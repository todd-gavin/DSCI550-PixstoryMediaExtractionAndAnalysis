Long layers
A layered haircut adds volume to long hair and allows for styling flexibility. Ask your hairdresser for long layers at the back and smooth, graded layers to frame the face. You can balance the layers with long bangs that can be styled to either side or straight.

Ultra short
For when you have that urge to cut most of it off without going for the complete buzz cut.

Layered lob
The long bob (also called a Lob) is when the hair length is below the chin and above the collarbone and is cut like a bob. Layers are still hot this season, so if you have long hair and you're considering a chop, a Lob might be the cut you're looking for

Bowl Cut
A bowl cut (also known as a mushroom cut) is a haircut that features bangs that go all the way across the front. The back and sides are the same lengths as the bangs or longer toward the back.

Classic Bob
A classic bob haircut is a style most popular among women, which has remained common over the years because of its simplicity and timelessness. The hair is cut to the same length all around the head in this style. A chin-length bob is the most common; the hair will fall just to the jawline.

Wispy bangs
Wispy bangs are a softer variation of blunt bangs, making them easier to pull off. Wispy bangs flaunt a mixture of short and long feathered strands that lay across your forehead, giving your strands a stylish flair. This style is a great way to step into the world of bangs.
