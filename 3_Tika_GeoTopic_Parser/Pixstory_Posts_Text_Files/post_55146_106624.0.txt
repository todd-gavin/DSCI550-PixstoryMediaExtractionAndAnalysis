Australia’s not the first country that springs to mind when you’re looking to explore lush wine lands. Yet, did you know what the country boasts over 60 separate wine-growing regions. 

As per planetd, between them, they produce over a trillion bottles of wine every year. We toured the Barossa Valley wine region and it was amazing. If you are heading there, check out this tour that takes you to 4 world class wineries and includes lunch.

Wine tours offer a host of varied activities in this part of the world including 4WD adventures, steam train rides, and truffle hunts. Of course, there’s plenty to taste along the way too, including cheese, charcuterie, picnic eats, and haute cuisine.

Interestingly, you’ll find most of Australia’s wine farms between Victoria and New South Wales. Around Victoria, you can sip on Pinot Noir, while New South Wales focuses on producing warm-climate varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz.

Some other types of wine you’ll encounter along the way include Chardonnay, Sémillon, Riesling, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc. At the 2020 Decanter World Wine Awards, several Australian wines scored top points, winning 17 platinum medals and six Best In Show awards.
