It was 27th June 2011, when the entire Wrestling Landscape stopped and witnessed something spectacular with CM Punk dropping arguably the greatest promo of the last 20 years. CM Punk dropped the infamous "Pipebomb" promo on 27th June announcing that after defeating John Cena at Money in the Bank, he would walk away with the WWE Title as it would be the last day of his contract.

CM Punk also mentioned how WWE has been washed down of its former glory with Vince McMahon at the helm. This scathing rant also saw him take shots at the entire McMahon Family as he said "And I'd like to think that WWE would be better off after Vince McMahon's death, but it would be taken over by his idiotic daughter, his doofus son-in-law and the rest of his stupid family."

For the uninitiated "the doofus son-in-law" is none other than Triple H. Triple H has been making shockwaves throughout WWE with bringing back people who have been released and making sure that they shine properly. In the last 3 weeks, he has brought back Iyo Sky, Dakota Kai, Scarlett Bordeaux, Karrion Kross, Dexter Lumis and now on last smackdown, he brought back Hit-Row.

Triple H has highlighted the history of the secondary titles and for the first time in a long long time, they actually seem important. Both the US Title and Intercontinental Title were properly showcased with IC title even main-eventing the show.

It would be safe to say that the Voice of the Voiceless CM Punk may have been wrong about HHH.
