From Neymar to Mbappe - How PSG splashed over €1.8 billion in player signingsParis Saint-Germain (PSG) have significantly inflated an already wild transfer market ever since new owners Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) acquired a majority stake in the club in 2011, before they became the club's sole owner in March 2012.In their ultimate mission to be crowned champions of Europe, PSG have splashed the cash on numerous high-profile signings over the last decade or so.We all remember when they changed the transfer market forever by spending a world record €222 million on Neymar in 2017, followed by the second-most expensive transfer in history when they parted ways with €180m to bring Kylian Mbappe on board two years later after a successful loan spell.
