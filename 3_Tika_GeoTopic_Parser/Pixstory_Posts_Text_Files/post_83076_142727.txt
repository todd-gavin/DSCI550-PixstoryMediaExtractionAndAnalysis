 There have been some tough situations that I have faced in my life as well as in the ring but kept my mind calm and dealt with them in a proper manner Every person and boxer faces challenges in both the forms so I always try to keep myself prepared for every outcome I m really proud to be a boxer as I ve not only brought honour to my family but also the country look forward to do this again and again I try to keep myself motivated on every stage and even my coaches motivate me to reach the goals that I ve set out for myself These goals that I set for myself keep me motivated in themselves as they let me strive even harder to reach them During training I try to remember where I want to reach and why I m doing this this acts as the necessary boost to my energy so that I can train on the next level
