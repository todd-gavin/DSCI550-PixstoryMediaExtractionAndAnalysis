The FBI has arrested an agent of Pakistanâ€™s spy agency ISI and his associate in Washington for impersonating as American officials over the last two years and ingratiating themselves with members of the US intelligence services.

Arian Taherzadeh, 40, and Haider Ali, 35, used their false and fraudulent affiliation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to get close to members of federal law enforcement and the defence services.
