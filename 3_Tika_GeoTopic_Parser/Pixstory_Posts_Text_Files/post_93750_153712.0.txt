Putin's handling of the war is again being questioned after the fiery explosion of the Crimean bridge.
It is a link between Russia and Crimean that provided the connection between Russia and the Ukrainian peninsula.
Ukraine's way of working patiently has affected Putin's strategy of war.
In 2018, the bridge, also known as Kerch Bridge,  was inaugurated with 4 billion dollars. This was to insinuate Russia's ownership of Crimea.
The bridge was being used as a base for critical military operations for the Russian forces. 
Though the challenge is real for Putin to use his tactics more appropriately to live with his pride.
In Kherson, the Russian army is trapped by the Ukrainian forces; the blast would add up to the problem.
The question is whether to save the bridge with the  forces already facing resupply issues or instead "partially withdraw the military to ensure their significant resources of the peninsula do not get cut off."
The choice is to be made by Putin; on one side, there are some waning chances of success, while on the other lies the greater objective that can hint at a win.
