Back around when the Pell Grant was created by Congress in 1973 to help students from low-income families pay for higher education, it covered 80% of the costs of attending a public four-year college or university. And it covered over 40% of the costs of going to a private one.

Today, thanks to increases in tuition costs and Pell Grants not keeping pace, they cover less than 30% of the costs at a public university and less than 20% of the costs at private institutions, according an analysis I conducted using College Board data.

Pell Grants yesterday and today
Over $26 million in Pell Grants were awarded to approximately 6.2 million students in the 2020-2021 school year, with the average recipient receiving just over $4,200.

The grants, originally called Basic Educational Opportunity Grants, were renamed in 1980 after the late U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell, a Democrat from Rhode Island and an early champion of the grant.

In line with the goals of the Higher Education Act, which was originally passed in 1965, the grants were designed to be the foundation of college funding for students from poor- and moderate-income families. They were also meant to be a mechanism to help eliminate the gap in the rates at which these students attend college and graduate in relation to their peers from wealthier families.

The idea was that with a Pell Grant, a student could afford to pay the major components of the cost of attendance at a public four-year institution without having to borrow a lot of money or work a lot of hours at a job, particularly off campus.

For students at private colleges, Pell Grants would cover a substantial amount of their education costs, too, but not to the same extent as public colleges, which typically cost less to attend.
