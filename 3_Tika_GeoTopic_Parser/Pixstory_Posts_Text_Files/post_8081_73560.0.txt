The European Union has launched multiple projects in Afghanistan amid a dire economic situation in the country to prevent deterioration of the situation and help Afghan people cope with current problems, the organization said on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the European Commission said the newly launched projects are worth â‚¬268.3 million and will be channeled through UN agencies in Afghanistan.

According to the EU, the funds support projects in education, health, and the livelihoods of Afghan people. "The EU support focuses on maintaining education, sustaining livelihoods, and protecting public health, including for refugees, migrants, and internally displaced people," the EU said.

According to the EU, UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, UNHCR, WHO, and IOM will implement the projects that directly benefit the people of Afghanistan. In addition, two projects support human rights defenders and Civil Society Organizations.

"Leaving no one behind is a key principle of the EU's engagement in the world. So today, we are demonstrating what we have said many times: we will not abandon the Afghan people," EU Commissioner for International Partnerships, Jutta Urpilainen, said.
