India is in a dilemma As Putin invaded Ukraine and threatens to use nuclear force many world players denounced Russia but China the UAE and India stood away For many it s inexplicable why India is trying to remain neutral though some see New Delhi s well known non alignment policy at work At the special session of the UN General Assembly on Sunday New Delhi formally called for immediate cessation of hostilities but did not name Russia In a procedural vote India abstained Under pressure from all stakeholders the US Ukraine and Russia India is obviously doing a tightrope walk to find what works best for its national interest Russia is the largest defence supplier for India and has vetoed UNSC resolutions on Kashmir in the past But India s defence ties with the US France and others European powers are on the rise Also remaining neutral would not help India s strategic objectives when China too had adopted the same stance it is indeed less ambiguous in its support to Russia India has to choose between two difficult options After an Indian student was killed in Ukraine on Tuesday the Russian action is even hitting home and yet New Delhi is loath to criticize Moscow But another way to look at India s stance is that it has been consistent with its traditional position of non alignment It is one of the few nations having good ties with all the three major stakeholders and thus in a rare position to broker peace Taking sides may hurt that prospect Meanwhile the ruling party s ideological allies in the Hindu right wing have come out in full support of Putin An outfit called Hindu Sena on Tuesday put up posters on the statue of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in New Delhi in support of the Russian action in Ukraine They hailed Akhand undivided Russia They probably see similarities between prime minister Narendra Modi and Putin as well as between the two nations Putin s actions resonate well with the image of Modi as a no nonsense leader without idealistic baggage who would go to any length to secure national interest
