Captive pandas can be seen throughout the year, but August and September are particularly wonderful months to visit since they coincide with the birthing season, when the nurseries are filled with newborn infants. Visitors to the research centres can observe the pink cubs being cared for by human carers from a viewing area in the nurseries.

Pandas are sluggish creatures who prefer to sleep, so it's better to visit the centres during feeding time, when they're most active. Every day, between 8:30 and 10:00 a.m., a morning feeding session is held. The rest of the day, pandas are likely to be sleeping in their indoor enclosures, sometimes out of sight.
