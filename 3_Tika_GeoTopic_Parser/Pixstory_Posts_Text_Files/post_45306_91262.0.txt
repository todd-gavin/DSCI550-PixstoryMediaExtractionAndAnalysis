Manuel Lanzini of West Ham United escaped unscathed after being involved in a serious car accident near the club's training ground. 

The Argentine, 29, was in a Â£70,000 Mercedes V-Class driven by a chauffeur when it flipped on the A12 on Thursday afternoon and landed on its side. Despite the fact that firefighters arrived on the scene before Lanzini, he was able to walk away from the wreckage. 

The midfielder was apparently driving to practise when his car tipped over on the route to the West Ham training complex. Lanzini was reportedly driven by a chauffeur and walked away from 
the incident unharmed. 

Firefighters and police hurried to the site, according to The Sun and the Daily Mail, where Lanzini was evaluated and cleared to leave after sustaining no injuries. The playmaker was allegedly assessed again at the training facility, but not sent to the hospital as some reports stated. 

"It's a miracle he's alive, from what I've heard," a source told The Sun. "This was an incredibly near miss and could have killed Lanzini and the driver. It's common for West Ham players to use a chauffeur service - especially for those who live in town. 

"They were on a dual carriageway so it could have caused complete carnage. Just goes to show, it doesn't matter how much cash you have - we're all just as vulnerable to a smash like this." 

Lanzini was on his way to his first team practise following the international break, during which he had been an unused replacement in both Argentina's games against Venezuela and Ecuador. On Matchday 31 of the 2021-22 Premier League season, West Ham will meet Everton.
