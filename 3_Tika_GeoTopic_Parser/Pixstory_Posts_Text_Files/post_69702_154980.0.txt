BTS Makes Rolling Stone’s List Of “The 50 Greatest Concept Albums Of All Time”
On October 12th American magazine published a list of the 15 greatest concept albums in music history, crossing a wide range of variety “from classic rock to R&B to punk to hip hop.”
Rolling Stone defined concept albums as “thematic albums, tied together by very specific moods or interconnected songs… which require listening to a record all the way through,” and it selected 50 albums that it considered “the records that define music at its most ambitious.
“To make it high on the list, an album had to be both conceptually tight and musically awesome,” wrote Rolling Stone.
BTS 2020 album "map of the soul" holds a 25 position on the list of 50 greatest concept albums with Michelle Hyun Kim praising its ambitious concept of using terms from Jungian philosophy “to paint a complete portrait of ‘[the members’] real selves.'”
Kim wrote, “Before BTS, few pop idols had attempted to express the anxiety that comes with maintaining such a visible public person that’s usually not faithful to the ‘true self.’ But with Map of the Soul: 7‘s heart-rending tracks like ‘Black Swan,’ the Bangtan boys cracked open their stage facades, exposing their fame-fueled fears with piercing introspection.”
Congratulations to BTS!
