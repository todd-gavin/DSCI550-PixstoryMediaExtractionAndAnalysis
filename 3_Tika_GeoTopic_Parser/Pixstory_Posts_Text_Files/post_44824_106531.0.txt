Ainsley Maitland-Niles, an Arsenal midfielder, is a target for Nottingham Forest. Forest contacted Maitland-Niles this week to inquire about his availability and have made him a summer transfer priority. Forest are looking to bolster their squad for next season's Premier League campaign, and Maitland-Niles seems a natural fit.

Maitland-Niles, 24, has a year left on his current contract at Arsenal and is eager to obtain regular game time now that it appears the Gunners are ready to trade. From his stint with the Football Association and coaching through the England age levels, Forest manager Steve 
Cooper is familiar with Maitland-Niles.

Maitland-Niles has represented England at all levels, from under-17s to adults, and was a 
member of the under-20s World Cup-winning squad in 2017. Cooper is a well-liked coach who champions young players and led England's under-17 team to the 2017 World Cup.

Forest are looking to expand their team and invest some money this summer in order to 
compete for a place in the Premier League next season, which is why Maitland-Niles would be 
such an excellent acquisition.

Maitland-Niles spent the second part of the season on loan at Roma, and he moved to Italy to gain more regular game time after having limited opportunities at Arsenal.

Arsenal are expected to consider moving the Englishman, with manager Mikel Arteta eager to reduce the club's wage cost in recent years.

As the club sought for methods to conserve money, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, Mesut Ozil, and Sead Kolasinac all had their contracts terminated. However, a slew of departures has left the north Londoners with a thin roster, and Arteta has to bolster his options now that they have qualified for the Europa League next season.
