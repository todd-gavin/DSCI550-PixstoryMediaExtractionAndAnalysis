Kids deserve a chance to enjoy life after school because there is more to it than just doing their schoolwork. If a student is not passionate about the majority of the subjects they are required to study in school, going home and worrying about homework does not make any sense. School is already stressful enough.

Let's not even forget about what they give to kids to work at home. It does not help at all. It's no life skills, it's just some random stuff that contributes nothing in their lives. Let's be practical, how many of us know or care about the theorems we studied in sixth grade? We don't even remember them! And to think, we spent majority of our time learning and stressing about stuff we don't even remember now!

Homework keeps kids in stressful situations. They're not left with any time at all and even when they're not doing it, they're worrying about it.

We have advances enough to technology to take the burden off of adults in their work life, yet we want to not only keep traditional and stressful ways for kids but make it worse by constantly making the education system more complicated.

If anything, it is oppressing kids! They should be able to have a life outside work. We need creative minds in our world, not workaholic robots! How is a child going to be creative then they 1) don't have any time at all, and 2) are always so exhausted and drained that it sucks their own hobbies out of them?
