Former Arsenal Central midfielder Jack Wilshere has been released by Danish Superliga side Aarhus Gymnastikforening (Aarhus GF) and with this, he has now been clubless for the 3rd time since October 2020.

In his latest Instagram post through which he announced his departure from the Danish club, Jack Wilshere hinted that he might be considering retiring from Football altogether.

Wilshere had a pretty decent time at Arsenal from 2010 to 2016 and he seemed to have a bright future ahead. But a series of major injuries cursed his professional career and rendered his vast potential moot. Between 2017 and 2020, Wilshere made a number of loan moves between Arsenal, Bournemouth and West Ham United before being finally released by West Ham United in October 2020.

In January 2021, he was signed as a free agent by Bournemouth FC but they again released 
him after just 6 months in July. After that, Wilshere was clubless for almost an entire year.
He trained with Arsenal and Como to maintain his fitness.

Finally, he was signed by Danish side Aarhus GF in February 2022, but he has been released 
again after playing just 14 games (136 days). In the 14 matches that he played with them, the 
Englishman provided 2 assists.

Wilshere has hinted that he is considering every possibility for his future and that includes a possible retirement and managerial career. It is indeed sad given the fact that Wilshere is still only 30 years old.

“My time at agffodbold has come to an end. Myself and the club have mutually agreed it’s 
best for me to move on. I would like to thank everybody at AGF for the support and confidence they gave me from day 1.

The club showed trust in me that not many others were willing to give. Although results were hard to come by the fans support of me and the team was unbelievable. Thank you guys for welcoming me into your club and city. I wish you all the best in the future. Personally I am considering all of my options,” Wilshere wrote in his Instagram Post.
