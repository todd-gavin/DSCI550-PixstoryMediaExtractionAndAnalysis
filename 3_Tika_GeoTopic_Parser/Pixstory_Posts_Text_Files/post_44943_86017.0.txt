Following Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, the Premier League has stopped its broadcast agreement with the country. The decision will take effect immediately, which means that none of Thursday's four matches will be broadcast in the United States. It took only 15 minutes of a four-hour conference in London on Tuesday for all 20 teams to agree on the topic.
The English Premier League has also announced a Â£1 million donation to help the people of Ukraine. The Rambler Group owns the Premier League's television rights. The business was nearing the end of a three-year contract to broadcast events in Russia.

The Football Association has also suspended its agreement with Russia in a separate step. As a result, none of the FA Cup quarter-final matches scheduled for this month will be broadcast.

The Premier League has issued a statement condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and stating that its clubs have unanimously approved the move.

Oleksandr Zinchenko of Man City and Ukraine on the Russian invasion:

"We call for peace and our thoughts are with all those impacted," the Premier League said in a statement.

The leaders of Premier League clubs wore special armbands in Ukrainian colours last weekend, while stadium screens displayed 'Football Stands Together' in front of the country's blue and yellow flag.

It is thought that the pro-Ukraine branding seen surrounding last weekend's events will not be repeated. Clubs, on the other hand, have been given permission to create their own response if they so desire.

Chinese rights holders did not broadcast Premier League matches in their nation last weekend, despite the fact that China is a close political friend of Russia. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston responded to the Premier League's move by saying it was "absolutely the right thing to do."
