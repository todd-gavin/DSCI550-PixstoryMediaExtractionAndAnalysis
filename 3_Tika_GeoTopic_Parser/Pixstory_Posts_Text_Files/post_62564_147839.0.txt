8. Washing your hair with hot water: Hot water can damage your hair even more by stripping away its protective layer and causing inflammation or sebum buildup.
9. Not using conditioner: Conditioner helps restore the lost moisture, vitamins, and minerals from your hair, preventing it from becoming dry, brittle, or frizzy.
10. Not rinsing off all of the conditioner: Conditioner will start to cause build-up if you don't rinse it off completely after each use, which will eventually lead to bad scalp conditions and dandruff outbreaks. 
11. Sleeping in wet hair: Even if you're planning on showering later on in the day, sleeping with wet hair will still cause damage because sweat and sebum will mix together and cause bacteria growth. 
12. Spreading heat onto damp locks: Heat styling products like blowdryers or flat irons can cause serious damage to your locks if they're used too frequently.
