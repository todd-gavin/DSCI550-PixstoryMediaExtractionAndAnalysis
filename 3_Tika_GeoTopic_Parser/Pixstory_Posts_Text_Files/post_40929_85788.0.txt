Now that huge figures like Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, and Mark Ruffalo have come out in support of embattled Ukraine, Hollywood must be reminiscing about the days when a public visit with Putin wasn't considered scandalous. He had only nibbled at a few former Soviet provinces and seen off the occasional dissident in the mid-2000s, developments that didn't bother most Entertainment Weekly readers. Russia was a major emerging film market that was well-represented on the celebrity junket circuit. So, as Leonardo DiCaprio purred at his fellow feline lover during a big-cat conservation convention in 2010, Jean-Claude Van Damme could gleefully buff the president's machismo credentials at a St Petersburg MMA event in 2007.

The Guardian reported that Putin already had a domestic entertainment machine working in his favour by then, with his power firmly established. Night Watch and Day Watch, two aspirational global blockbusters produced by Channel One, a descendent of the Soviet-era state TV station RTO, placed a manichaean gloss on the chaotic post-communist Russia that Putin had quelled in the early twenty-first century. "Dark signifies freedom, light means responsibility â€“ and Putin, for certainly, is a light one in real life," director Timur Bekmambetov stated at the time. "He's attempting to correct everything and organise everything." However, it is extremely detrimental to liberty." Perhaps it was the rash of jingoistic military pictures that the Russian film industry was beginning to produce, such as 9th Company in 2005, Admiral in 2008, and Stalingrad in 2013.
