Pride Month is a significant event that commemorates the LGBT community's struggle for recognition around the world. 

While it is more broadly accepted today than it has ever been, history can teach us why this was not the case for a long time. Pride Month is an opportunity for everyone to be proud of who they are and what they have to offer the world. 

As per DOY, this particular date was chosen in June to memorialise the Stonewall riots in Manhattan, New York, in 1968. While during the 1950’s and 60’s, the concept of being gay was not often spoken of or publicly expressed due to the pressure of American society and the social norms that viewed being gay as a taboo and a mental disorder, there was a population of people who did not believe in oppressing these rights. And they stood against the government because of it.

Even when the LGBTQ+ lifestyle was considered taboo in the 1970s and 1980s, support for LGBTQ+ pride has slowly grown over the last several decades. During the 1990s and 2000s, as more people joined the movement and had a better knowledge of what it meant to be homosexual, Pride Month became a more popular concept.
