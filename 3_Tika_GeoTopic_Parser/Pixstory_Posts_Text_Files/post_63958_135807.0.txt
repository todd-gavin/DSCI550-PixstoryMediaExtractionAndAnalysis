A new rumour has begun floating on the internet that a remake of the original Assassin’s Creed is currently possibly in the works in the offices of Ubisoft slated to come next year.
 
The rumour began floating when a French YouTuber named j0nathan said that Ubisoft is planning to release a remake of the 2007 original as part of the season pass for Assassin’s Creed Mirage which is said to be the next game in the series. 
 
Mirage will supposedly release at some point in early 2023 and will later be followed by DLC which will take place in Constantinople. In addition, this remake of Assassin's Creed will supposedly arrive at a time post the launch of Mirage. 
 
With the launch of Mirage Ubisoft’s goal is apparently to return to the basics of the Assassin’s Creed series, removing some of the more RPG-based elements such as dialogue trees, gender selection, and a levelling system, to supply a game that focuses more on the Assassin’s Creed stealth gameplay fundamentals.
 
A remake of the original Assassin’s Creed would indeed be very big, however, at the moment all of this is still in the territory of rumours as Ubisoft has yet to confirm any of these reports.
