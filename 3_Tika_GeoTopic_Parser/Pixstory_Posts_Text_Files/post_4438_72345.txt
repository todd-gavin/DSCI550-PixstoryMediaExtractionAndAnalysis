I wanted to share what I learned from this Covid experience and things that you need to take care Do not panic at all Wear mask and gloves It s our responsibility to take care of ourselves instead of blaming the other people for not taking precautions Take shower before sleeping and change clothes regularly Many people advised for disposable utencils but I washed it properly and served and I used disposables too When you touch any object in their room just sanitize your hands Spray sanitizer in the house everyday Also try to get sunlight if possible Drink hot or warm water everytime and milk with turmeric before sleep Make sure to make steam regularly and take food and medicine on time To increase your immune system Vitamin C and Zinc intake is important Above all eat regularly Do not keep your stomach empty virus loves empty stomach and if you dont feel like eating anything drink lots of water tea coffee or juice avoid cold Take good Amount of sleep it will help the body to rest sleeping is the best medicine Keep yourself Motivated and diverted Don t feel that you are in this all alone Keep yourself entertained watch your favourite movies TV shows talk to your family friends over video calls Read your favourite books to keep yourself busy and productive Do some breathing yoga and Exercises Slow walks after every meal to get it digest Takecare All
