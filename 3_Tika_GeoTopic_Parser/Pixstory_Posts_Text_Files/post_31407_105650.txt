Example of building a wall or placing oneself at the disposal of another to build walls the same object what changes between the two types of activity The modality of the activity changes, i.e. in one case the worker does not undertake to carry out a work but simply puts disposal of the other contractor his psychophysical energies and it will be the other contractor who will organize the activity in the case instead of the locatio operis the worker undertakes to carry out the wall, i.e. to deliver the already finished work while in the locatio operarum instead the worker does not undertake to deliver the work is finished but it is simply placed at the disposal of the other contractor who will then organize the activity Let&#39;s take a small step forward in many ways we can say that in one case we are faced with an obligation of results I have to deliver the wall in the other case we are faced with an obligation of means it&#39;s not me who has to hand over the wall I simply put my activity at the disposal of the other contracting party my psychophysical energies what changes in legal terms Is the risk of the wall mine in one case the risk of the work that it must be finished in the other case I fulfill a contract simply by making my psychophysical energies available but it will be the other contractor who will organize my activity undertakes to make its psychophysical energies available to the other contracting party and to carry out its activity under the direction of the other contracting party Other management means direct performance by the other Other management identifies subordination because the activity itself does not distinguish independent work from subordinate work but what the two cases are distinguished by the way in which the activity is carried out in one case the worker who decides what to do in the other case subordinate work the worker limits himself to placing his energies at the disposal of the other contracting party and it will be the other contracting party who will direct him in the execution of the service, the subordinate worker is subject to the managerial and organizational power of the other contracting party and it will be the other contracting party who exercises this power and organizes the activity of the employed worker
