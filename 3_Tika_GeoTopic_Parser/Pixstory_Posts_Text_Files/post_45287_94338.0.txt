In an exclusive conversation with GOAL, the Brazilian talks about his incredible career, which
included 37 titles and countless superstars. The usual names that come to mind when fans think
of the most decorated players in football history are Dani Alves, Lionel Messi, and Andres
Iniesta.

Maxwell, on the other hand, is frequently overlooked. In his playing days, the Brazilian was a
multi-talented left-back, but he also had a knack for being in the right place at the right time, as
evidenced by the fact that he represented Inter, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain during their
most successful periods.

Over the course of his dazzling career, he won 37 trophies, making him the most decorated
footballer of all time â€“ until, of course, his former Blaugrana and Brazil team-mate Alves
surpassed him. Of course, both Iniesta and Messi drew level with Maxwell's total before the
Argentine went one better by winning his 38th club and international championship by leading
his side to glory at the Copa America last summer.

With Messi joining PSG, who are now leading Ligue 1, Maxwell now believes that the
34-year-old Messi will finish up with even more silverware than the 38-year-old Alves.

"He has every chance of breaking the record," Maxwell tells GOAL. "Playing at PSG, he has a
great team around him and the possibility to win many more trophies.

"Even now, with Dani in Barcelona, Messi has longer to go in his career. We never know how
long Dani can go because he keeps pushing himself, but Messi is younger."

Maxwell, who is currently the Head of Football Development at UEFA, also stated that he was
not angry when Alves surpassed him in the record books.
