Smokey eyes – they sound simple in principle but can be pretty elusive in practice.

1. Start by applying a mid-tone shadow all over the lid. Opt for greys, browns or heathers to create a subtle smokey base.

2. Apply a liner along the lash line, making sure you're coating and depositing colour between the lashes to instantly pop the eye. Just make sure you smoke it out with an eyeshadow brush before it sets because once it does, it won't budge all night.

3. Layer a dark tone shadow like espresso, charcoal or smoke over the liner, blending halfway up the lid and into the lid shadow. Apply along the lower lash line by softly pressing the brush onto the root of the lower lashes. Then smudge out with fingers for a smokier finish.

4. Add those all-important final touches with mascara, like Bobbi Brown’s Smokey Eye Mascara, layering 3-4 coats for a full lash effect.

5. Finally, you can add a sparkle shadow with your finger to give it that real luxe finish. It's great for smoothing out the lid and giving that blend through the crease of the eye.
