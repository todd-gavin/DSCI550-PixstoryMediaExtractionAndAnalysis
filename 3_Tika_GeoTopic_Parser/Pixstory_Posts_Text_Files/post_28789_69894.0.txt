Yes.....Bollywood has degraded its quality to great extent. Now days originality of Bollywood movie is lost, they simply copy the concept of other movies plus the young directors have very limited area. They mainly make movies to earn more and more money as a result the story line of movies are very weak, dramatic scenes , and meaning less song in movie make them worse. Today most actors expose their six pack abs in songs, shirt tear off exposing their body . Exposing physique or body should be done if it is needed in the script. A movie made on some fighter or any other which demand the character to have good physique can be acceptable. 
Bollywood is not even putting effort to find new scripts instead they are just making remakes of their previous hits. All Bollywood is doing is to remaking movies either from Hollywood or their industry.
But Hollywood is busy making masterpieces, No I am not saying Hollywood only creates good movies, what I am saying here is Bollywood is not showing any creativity at all. But what do I mean when I say Bollywood is not creative.
When it comes to creativity Bollywood is not even close to the Hollywood film industry and this is one of the biggest reasons why Hollywood movies are better than Bollywood. Hollywood is known to creat movies beyond our imagination and this makes us fall in love with the movies created by Hollywood. 
If I ask you which is the best Hollywood Sci-fi movie? Maybe your answer will Inception, Interstellar, Gravity, or anything else. But if I ask you the same question about the Bollywood movies will you be able to answer quickly? maybe youâ€™ll need to make a google search
Bollywood starts valuing the talent and create good movies and try to be creative Bollywood can compete and who knows we might we second oscar but for that Bollywood has to stop favoritism to know more favoritism and nepotism
