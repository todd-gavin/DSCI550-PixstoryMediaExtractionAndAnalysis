Gio Reyna will miss the next five games of the season for Borussia Dortmund, while Mats Hummels will be out for several weeks as well.

Borussia Dortmund has announced that Gio Reyna will miss the rest of the season after suffering a muscle and tendon injury against VfB Stuttgart on Friday. After suffering what appeared to be a right hamstring injury, the USMNT star was forced to leave the game less than two minutes into it. He will not be able to play again this season, according to the Black and Yellows.

This season, Reyna has had to deal with a variety of injuries. In September, he injured his hamstring while playing for the United States men's national team, and he had to sit out for five months. Following his return, he suffered another injury on his first start, which forced him to miss another three weeks. And now the 19-year-old is facing yet another layoff.

Mats Hummels was also injured during Friday's encounter against Stuttgart. After hurting his thigh, he was replaced by Dan-Axel Zagadou at halftime.

 He will also be absent for several weeks owing to a muscular issue, according to Borussia Dortmund. It's unclear how long Hummels and Reyna will be out.

Meanwhile, Mahmoud Dahoud's shoulder issue requires more investigation, according to Borussia Dortmund. According to the Ruhr Nachrichten on Saturday, Dahoud's injuries is not as terrible as first thought.

Furthermore, Hummels will be out for several weeks after suffering a thigh muscle injury, and Dahoud's shoulder ailment will require more testing. To make matters worse for Marco Rose's team, Donyell Malen had a tendon injury prior to the game.
