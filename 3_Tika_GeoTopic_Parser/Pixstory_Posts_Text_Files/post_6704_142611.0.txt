Bollywood film Brahmastra has been in the theatres for a few days but it has been in the headlines for the past several months. Right-wing organizations have been demonstrating against this film on various grounds. A few days before the film’s release, Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor were allegedly stopped from entering the Mahakal Temple in Ujjain. There was also a demand to boycott the movie on social media platforms. The film was finally released on September 9 amid a wave of controversy. 
Against this backdrop, videos of audiences’ reviews of Brahmastra are being circulated widely on social media, describing the film as a flop. One such video was tweeted by a handle called ‘@Lucifer04588091’. Here, a group of people can bee seen criticizing the film, terming it ‘nonsensical’ and a ‘terrible movie’. Among them, there is an aged person in a light pink T-shirt. In the accompanying tweet, the user states that these people are giving a review of the film Brahmastra.

Twitter handle ‘@ShrishtySays’ also promoted a video as a review of Brahmastra, where the same aged man talks about a film, but this time he is in a grey T-shirt. At the time of the writing of this report, this video racked up more than 2 lakh views and was retweeted by more than 2,000 users. (Archived link) Let’s call this viral video II.

Fact-check
The same elderly man is seen in both these videos. It is worth noting that he is wearing different clothes in each. In other words, both the videos were taken at different occasions. Now, if a viewer did not enjoy a movie at all, it is unlikely that he would watch it a second time. It is equally unlikely that he would review the same film twice.
