When I think of Azzedine I think of the father of this maison and of this place that I call the cathedral But in this collection I also thought of my mother And the result is a mix of our inheritances of our stories Pieter Mulier creative director of Maison Ala at ease For his second collection we finally begin to see the gaze of the Belgian designer former right hand man of Raf Simons After a respectful debut perhaps too obsequious towards the brilliant predecessor we continue by sculpting the bodies in the most feminine way possible Silhoullete snug dresses dance dotted with ethnic jewels trousers in which the denim is elevated and no longer retains anything of the casual aspect of the material once too long ago used to work in the mine In this constant dialogue with the past the inspirations come from the fine art canvases of Picasso Azzedine himself was very a friend of the family as well as a collector they surround the statuesque bodies of the models who wear them Transparencies that would be risky almost vulgar in anyone else&#39;s hands in Mulier&#39;s they become a second skin with an ethereal and sexualizing flavor They are not simple clothes worn by beautiful models they are the Venuses at which time statues and sacrifices were dedicated Non fashion beauty x
