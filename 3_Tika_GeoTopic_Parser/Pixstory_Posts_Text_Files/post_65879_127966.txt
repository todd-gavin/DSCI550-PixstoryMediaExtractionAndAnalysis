Steve averages in tests this is when he started as a leg break bowler He has not played for a year Kohli average till in tests was below Still his average in test is In terms of experts Test cricket is the only benchmark of a cricketer Hence Steve Smith is miles ahead of Kohli I will not discuss about useless bilaterals ODIs where everything is fun for batsmen I will discuss about ODI world cup Knockouts Smith scored three consecutive big scores in quarters semis finals of world cup His not out half century against Pakistan under lights against rampaging wahab Riaz his classic hundred against india in semis and his calming not out half century in finals In all pressure situations he stood like a rock and helped Australia win all of it s knockout matches and eventually world cup In world cup semis only one batsman from Australian side was playing like a champion against high class bowling Steve Smith scored something in semifinal giving some respectability to Australian score Everyone knows the record of Kohli in high pressure ICC knockouts So no point discussing or mentioning T s is for Windies to make fun I will not go into that useless format It is easily discernible who is the champion bat among the two It s Steven Smith
