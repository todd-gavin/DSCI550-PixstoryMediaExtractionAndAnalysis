Although it still feels like beach weather across much of North America billions of birds have started taking wing for one of nature s great spectacles fall migration Birds fly south from the northern U S and Canada to wintering grounds in the southern U S Caribbean and Latin America sometimes covering thousands of miles Other birds leave temperate Eurasia for Africa tropical Asia or Australia Using observation records and data collected through bird banding th century ornithologists roughly mapped general migration routes and timing for most migratory species Later using radar at airports and weather stations they discovered how weather and other factors affect when birds migrate and how high they fly Today technological advances are providing new insights into bird migration and showing that it is more complex and wonderful than scientists ever imagined These new and constantly improving technologies are key aids for protecting migratory birds in the face of habitat loss and other threats Birding across borders The power of the internet has greatly aided migratory bird research Using the popular eBird network birders all over the world can upload sightings to a central database creating a real time record of the ebb and flow of migration Ornithologists have also learned to use NEXRAD a national network of Doppler weather radars to visualize birds migrating down the North American continent Now scientists are setting up a global network of receiver stations called the Motus Network which currently has receivers in countries Each receiver constantly records the presence of any birds or other animals within a nine mile kilometer radius that scientists have fitted with small lightweight radio transmitters and shares the data online The network will become increasingly useful for understanding bird migration as more receiver stations become active along migration tracks Tracking individual birds via satellite Three new technologies are rapidly expanding what we know about bird migration The first is satellite telemetry of bird movement Researchers fit birds with small solar powered transmitters which send data on the birds locations to a satellite Read more
