A bowl of freshly cooked oats is the healthiest breakfast. Tasty and healthy that’s all we need for our breakfast. 
Personally I’m not a big fan of oats. But the health benefits of oats cannot be ignored and hence making it an ideal meal to start your day. This oats upma is one of the healthiest & can be prepared in less than 15 minutes.
Steps to make it :
1. Dry roast 1 cup oats until crisp on a medium flame. They do not turn as crisp as poha but a bit. Transfer these aside to a plate.
2. Heat 1½ tablespoon oil in a pan. Add ¼ teaspoon mustard seeds and ½ teaspoon cumin seeds(optional). When the mustard begins to pop, add half teaspoon chana dal and half teaspoon urad dal.
3. Then add 2 tablespoons peanuts or 8 to 10 split cashews.
4. Fry until the dals turn golden. Then add half teaspoon grated or chopped ginger and 1 sprig curry leaves. Fry for a minute until the ginger smells good.
5. Add 1 finely chopped onion & 1 to 2 chopped green chilies. Saute until the onions turn transparent.
6. This is optional. If using mix vegetables, add ½ to ¾ cup. Half small carrot, 2 to 3 small beans and 2 tbsps green peas. Fry for 2 mins.
7. Sprinkle 2 tbsps water and cook covered until slightly soft for 2 to 3 mins. Then add ¼ teaspoon turmeric and half teaspoon salt.
8. Pour water and bring it to a boil. If using rolled oats pour 1 cup water. If using instant quick cook oats then pour half cup water. If you like mushy oats then pour more water. Mix well. The water will be absorbed with in a minute or 2. 

Then cover and cook on a low flame for 2 mins or until no excess moisture is left.
