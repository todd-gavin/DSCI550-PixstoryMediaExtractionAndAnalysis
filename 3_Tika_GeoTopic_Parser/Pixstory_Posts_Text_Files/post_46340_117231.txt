She is lost nowadays Smiling for the world but a mess inside How can she tell someone what s going on When she doesn t know All these thoughts inside her are like a ship sailing in a thunder storm World thinks her as a positive person Which she is for them but Tries hard to be for herself too Like a bird flying and chirping Like a flower blossimg in the springs But now she has cut down all the strings Now the bird is alive but had forget to fly The flowers are blossoming but the fragrance has forget to imply Everything is same but she isn t Yes she has forget to fly In the world full of lies
