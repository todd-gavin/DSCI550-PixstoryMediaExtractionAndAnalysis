Waking up at 6 AM and traveling to a local Dhaba to have a hot, sizzling aloo ka paratha (potato flatbread) with homemade, pure malai (cream) is worth all the trouble we go through. Dhaba may not have an aesthetic look, but it serves the best dishes that fill the heart and soul with content and gratitude.
