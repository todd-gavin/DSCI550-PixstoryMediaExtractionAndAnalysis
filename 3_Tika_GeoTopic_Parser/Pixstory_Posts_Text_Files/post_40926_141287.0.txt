Thursday night's late-night show paused their programmes to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away at the age of 96. 

Queen Elizabeth II passed away peacefully on Thursday at Scotland's Balmoral Castle, according to the royal family. Charles, her firstborn son, will succeed her after 70 years in power. 

Hollywood Reporter said that James Corden, the British host of the Late Late Show, said that he was "also incredibly thankful and grateful to the queen for the most extraordinary service and leadership that she has shown during all of our lifetimes" despite his sadness over the news of her passing. 

“She is the only queen most of us have ever known,” Corden said. “We viewed her as immortal and [an] essential part of the fabric of our world.”
