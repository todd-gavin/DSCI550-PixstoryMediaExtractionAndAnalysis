Rising competition for many of the world s important crops is sending increasing amounts toward uses other than directly feeding people These competing uses include making biofuels converting crops into processing ingredients such as livestock meal hydrogenated oils and starches and selling them on global markets to countries that can afford to pay for them In a newly published study my co authors and I estimate that in only of the global harvests of major crops may be directly consumed as food in the countries where they were produced down from about in the s We also project that because of this trend the world is unlikely to achieve a top sustainable development goal ending hunger by Another of harvests of these crops in will be used as feed for livestock along with significant portions of the crops that go to processing This ultimately produces eggs meat and milk products that typically are eaten by middle and upper income people rather than those who are undernourished Diets in poor countries rely on staple foods like rice corn bread and vegetable oils The crops that we studied barley cassava maize corn oil palm rapeseed canola rice sorghum soybean sugar cane and wheat together account for more than of all calories from harvested crops Our study shows that calorie production in these crops increased by more than between the s and the s Today however harvests of crops for processing exports and industrial uses are booming By we estimate that processing export and industrial use crops will likely account for of harvested calories worldwide When we add the calories locked in crops used as animal feed we calculate that by roughly of all harvested calories of these top crops will go to uses other than directly feeding hungry people Read more
