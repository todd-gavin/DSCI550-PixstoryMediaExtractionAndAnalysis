Punjab police have been highly active since the assassination of Punjabi musician Sidhu Moose Wala. During a raid in Haryana's Fatehabad area, another suspect was apprehended. The defendant is suspected of plotting the killing of a well-known Punjabi singer.

Meanwhile, the Punjab police are narrowing down the suspect list, which now includes eight people.

Last Monday, Punjab Police made the first arrest in the Sidhu Moose Wala murder investigation, when Manpreet Singh was apprehended in Uttarakhand. Manpreet Singh Mannu is from Kussa in the Tarn Taran area of Punjab. In court, Manpreet Singh was sentenced to a five-day police remand.
