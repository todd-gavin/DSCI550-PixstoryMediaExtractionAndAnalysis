Cristiano Ronaldo continues to dominate headlines, even at the age of 37. The Portuguese skipper recently scored a record-60th career hat-trick against Norwich City on Saturday, helping Manchester United beat the Canaries 3-2.

Interestingly, after the match, Ronaldo himself took to social media to share an intriguing stat 
about his record of hat tricks. Of the 60 hat-tricks Cristiano has scored in his playing career so far, half of them came before the talisman had crossed the age of 30. Moreover, the Portuguese phenom scored 30 hat-tricks after the age of 30, which speaks volumes about his talents even as he moves towards the fag end of his career.

Moreover, Ronaldo has no plans to slow down just yet, as he’s already set sights on a 61st career hat-trick in Manchester United’s next showdown, wherein the Red Devils will face off 
against Liverpool on April 20.

Taking to social media on Sunday, Ronaldo made his intentions clear for the trip to Anfield as he shared a pic of himself along with an interesting statistic.

“30 hat-tricks before 30 and 30 hat-tricks after 30. It’s time to unbalance the scale!” wrote the 
former Real Madrid forward in the caption.

With Manchester United embroiled in a dogged race to finish in the top-4, Ronaldo's goalscoring exploits will be very crucial for his club in the upcoming weeks.

The Red Devils are currently in fifth place on the league standings, with 54 points, with 
fourth-placed Tottenham further ahead on 57 points.

After the trip to Anfield, United will face off against Arsenal and Chelsea, thus Ronaldo seems to have found his rhythm just at the right time perhaps.
