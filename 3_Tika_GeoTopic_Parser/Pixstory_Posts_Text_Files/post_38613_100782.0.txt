The Final Verdict

Only 5 Premier League teams have conceded more goals than Manchester United. It’s worrying, because during the yesteryears, the duo of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic did not let attackers have a sniff at their goal. Now, Man United have fallen to a new low. United need a center-back as soon as possible to stop the leakage in terms of conceding goals. 

Inacio can be a long and short term solution. He is good with goals, passes, plus he is Portuguese. He can unite with Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo, his Portuguese teammates in the national team and know how he can help Man United to reach its former glory.

His release clause is 45 million, which shouldn’t be a bother for the Red Devils, as they are expected to make massive changes during the summer window.
