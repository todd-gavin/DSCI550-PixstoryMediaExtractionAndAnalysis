With Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar claiming responsibility for the murder of singer-politician Sidhu Moosewala, sources in the Delhi Police Special Cell say they will investigate those linked to Lawrence Bishnoi's gang, of which Brar is a member. Many of these associates, according to police, are already imprisoned in and around Delhi.

Senior officers also stated that they were looking into Brar for allegedly planning several murders and attempted murders from Canada.

According to the officer, Bishnoi and his gang have criminal records in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana, with Bishnoi still managing to run his gang from inside a Rajasthan jail.

Bishnoi's associates are as notorious as the gangster. His associate and friend Sampat Nehra was arrested by the Haryana Special Task Force in Hyderabad in 2018 after allegedly plotting to kill Bollywood actor Salman Khan.

Nehra, the son of a retired Chandigarh police officer, had also claimed responsibility for an April 2018 incident in which Punjabi singer Parmish Verma was shot.

Lawrence Bishnoi's name appears in almost every Punjab murder case, and this time he admitted to killing Moosewala and claiming responsibility for the crime. Bishnoi claimed that his gang members murdered Sandeep Nangla on his orders at the time.
