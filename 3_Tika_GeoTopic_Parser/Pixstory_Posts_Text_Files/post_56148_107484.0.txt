‌The European Union has initiated fresh legal action against the UK in retaliation over Boris Johnson’s plans to unilaterally ditch parts of Northern Ireland’s Brexit deal.
‌
‌The Vice President of the European Commission Maros Sefcovic said the UK’s move had “no legal or political justification”. Mr Sefcovic substantiated that existing infringement proceedings which had been paused while UK-EU talks took place would now be continued.
‌
‌And he further implied that the measures will continue if the UK pressed ahead with the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, which will rip up key parts of the deal signed by Mr Johnson and the EU in 2019.
‌
‌The plan would imply “breaking an agreement that protects peace and stability in Northern Ireland, an agreement reached together only three years ago”.
‌
Mr Sefcovic said: “Let there be no doubt: there is no legal nor political justification whatsoever for unilaterally changing an international agreement.

Do we have to expect a trade war? This dispute could eventually lead to a trade war even the suspension of the entire Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union.

As a first stage, the EU said it was ascending a “proportionate” reaction to the Government publishing its Bill on Monday.

The stalled legal action related to the UK’s unilateral extension of protocol grace periods in 2021.

The UK has contended that its unilateral approach is the only choice left to settle the issues “baked in” to the protocol if the EU maintains its rejection to fundamentally rewrite the terms of the deal.
