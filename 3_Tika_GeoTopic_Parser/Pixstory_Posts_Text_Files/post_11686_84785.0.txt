WHAT ARE KILOCALORIES? Kilocalories A unit of measure
used to express the amount of energy found in different foods. Basal metabolism The minimum energy needed by the body for vital functions when at rest and awake. 
 The number of kcalories (a measure of the energy in food) you need is based on three factors:
your energy needs when your body is at rest and awake (basal metabolism), your level of physical activity, and the energy you need to digest and absorb food (about 10 percent of kcalories).
 Men have a higher BMR than women due to more muscle tissue. Tall people have higher BMRs due to more body surface. BMR declines after age 30. BMR is higher during growth and in Exercise, fever, stress, smoking, and caffeine increase BMR.
Kilocalories (kcal) and calories are the same quantity of energy when it comes to eating and activity. Kilojoules (kJ) are another way to express calories, with one calorie or kcal equaling 4.18 kJ.
