Maa Kushmanda was the creator of the universe. The story goes that before the universe was created, there was just darkness around. Then came an intense light which was brought about by Kushmanda. It was her smile that filled the entire space with light thereby creating the universe as we know it today! Kushmanda is also credited with creating the first beings on the earth via her three eyes - Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi. These three gave birth to our trinity of gods and goddesses from Mahakali were born Shiva and Saraswati, Mahasaraswati gave birth to Vishnu and Shakti while Brahma and Lakshmi were born from Mahalakshmi. Then, Kushmanda paired the offsprings with each other as consorts - Shiva & Shakti, Vishnu & Lakshmi and Brahma & Saraswati. The fourth day of Navratri is dedicated to Maa Kushmanda and this year the colour of the day is yellow.
