Don’t look up. 

For me, this movie turns out to be the most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time, the cast, the cast includes names you just cannot get enough of. I think my one line review for the film is, “Adam McKay should have done better with Leo, Meryl, Jonah, Lawrence and a million other A- list actors on board.”

The film is fundamentally weak in its narrative according to me, it disappoints you in its grand finale, while there is incredible satirical comedy and narrative, the length of the film is way too much to justify it, a comet is going to destroy the earth, okay Adam, we get it, Move on. “The Big Short” director is far from his best with a cast that deserved better. 

I think in the long list of problems that Don’t look up faces, one problem lies at its core where we realise that it was great for McKay to gather such an extraordinary cast, but at the same time, the end product was supposed to be equally colossal with the amount of expectations they rallied behind. 

The performances were top notch, but I don’t think anyone expected poor performances from Leo, Jenifer or Meryl anyway. So, according to me this a movie that should not get a pass, if you want to watch it, watch it for its amazing cast because maybe only they are the reason why I watched till the end. It is almost a fan service for different fandoms, Leo, Meryl, Jonah, Jenifer, Chalamet, Ariana and many more actors. For me, you should let this one go unless you want to watch it for its cast.
