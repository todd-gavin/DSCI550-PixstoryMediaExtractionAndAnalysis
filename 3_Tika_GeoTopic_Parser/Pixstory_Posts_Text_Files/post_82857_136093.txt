During lockdown I couldn t train properly as almost every training facility was closed down Due to this I had to come back home and think about how I have to go about training during this pandemic I got a second hand weightlifting set so that I could train at home I had to face many problems during the lockdown as I couldn t get a proper diet anymore and not even train properly I still managed to get a silver medal at the Inter State level competition I talked to government officials and the weightlifting association about wanting to train in Guwahati In competitive sports like weight lifting and body building a proper diet is a must to compete at the highest level If the athelete can t meet these requirements the performance level is to drop surely After listening to my problems the weightlifting association and the government did help me and also sent me to train in Guwahati I ve been training their for over a year Now I eagerly await the National Games that will be held in Gujarat from th September to show my performance
