Popeye Village, also known as Sweethaven Village, is a village that was originally built as a film set for the production for the 1980 musical production "Popeye", but has now been converted into a small attraction fun park, consisting of a collection of rustic and ramshackle wooden buildings. It is located at Prajjet Bay, 3 km  from the village core of Mellieha, Malta.
