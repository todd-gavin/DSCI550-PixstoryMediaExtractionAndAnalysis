Tom Brady has said that he is returning to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers again. This will be his 23rd Season of the NFL. He announced his return on twitter saying that he has some "unfinished business." This comes right after seeing Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a match winning hattrick for Manchester United in the premier league.
He posted a video in which he is interacting with Ronaldo post match and Ronaldo asks him if Brady is finished Brady's response is not audible but the facial expression clearly suggested that its not the case.
Brady tweeted the following, 
"These past two months I’ve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands. That time will come. But it’s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business LFG."

This season of NFL just got more exciting.
