The original faculty of arts in MSU, a distinctly significant landmark in the city which is marked by is marked as the second largest dome in India after GolGumbaz in Bijapur. The campus has always been the heart of art and culture and is the oldest centre of learning and knowledge in western India. 

Being a major in English literature, I'm proud to state that Maharaja sayajirao university of Vadodara is one of the very few colleges in India with a medium of instruction and interaction as English, which is staple language for the diverse number of students coming from all across the globe, along with specialization courses in Indian languages taught in their respective language as the medium of instruction. 

The dome structure (shown in the above picture) as of 2022 is under construction ever since the city was hit by the global pandemic. This dome although affiliated to the faculty of arts in particular used to be the hub of knowledge, fun, fests and fiestas- emanating a conglomeration of multi culturalism. The picture does not do enough justice to the beauty this architectural piece holds for real.
