The US Supreme Court has blocked the Joe Biden administration's vaccine mandate for large companies. The mandate required workers to be vaccinated or masked on a regular basis.

The Supreme Court has said that the mandate was beyond the authority of President Joe Biden. Expressing disappointment at the verdict, Biden called on on business leaders "to immediately join those who have already stepped up - including one third of Fortune 100 companies - and institute vaccination requirements to protect their workers, customers, and communities."

How will the verdict affect companies? "It depends" says employers. If large private employers want their employees to be vaccinated or go through regular tests, they can still impose them. So, the ruling doesn't make a difference to such companies. But those companies which were not happy with the mandate can heave a sigh of relief and carry on like before.

One such organization is the National Retail Federation, which went to court against the mandate. The Federation has called the Supreme Court's action a "significant victory for employers." (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/business/osha-vaccine-mandate-businesses.html)

According to a survey, many employers are inclined towards having their employees vaccinated. The survey found that more than half, or 57%, of all respondents either "require or plan to require Covid-19 vaccinations."

As for companies which were not sure of how their employees would react if the mandate was upheld can now avoid taking any action and leave it for the employees to take a call on vaccination.
