Pickleball is the fastest-growing sport in the United States, with 4.8 million players. The sport of pickleball has expanded 39.3 percent in the last two years, according to the United States Pickleball Association. 

Pickleball is a sport that originated in the United States. 

Pickleball combines elements of tennis, table tennis, and badminton into a single game. The usual court size is the same as a badminton court or a modified tennis court, and it may be played both indoors and outdoors. 

The game is commonly played with paddles and a holed plastic ball as a singles or doubles game. The U.S. Sports and Fitness Industry Association reported 1,193,000 college graduate pickleball participants in 2020. The sport grew 21.3% from 2019 to 2020.

Hindu reported that in the United States, there are approximately 10,000 locations where the sport can be played. Hotel corporations such as Marriott have begun to offer pickleball courts on their hotels. 

The sport is presently shifting from amateur competitions to well-structured professional leagues. The 2022 National Championships will be place at Holy Hill, Florida from November 5 to November 13, 2022.

Pickleball is not a new sport, despite its recent popularity. Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum created it in 1965. These residents of Bainbridge Island, Washington, developed the activity to keep their children entertained during the summer months when they were bored with their normal summer activities. 

In 1967, the first permanent pickleball court was built, and by 1990, the sport had spread to all 50 states in the United States. The United States Pickleball Association was founded in 2005.
