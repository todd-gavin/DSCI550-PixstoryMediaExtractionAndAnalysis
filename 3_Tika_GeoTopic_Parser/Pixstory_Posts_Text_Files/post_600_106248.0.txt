A twenty four year old girl got married to herself. Great . Her choice .
I totally am in favour of people marrying who so ever they want to - where religion, colour caste is no consideration. 
Marriage is for love and that’s how it should be . 
But somehow ( at the cost of sounding politically incorrect) I don’t understand this . 
Self love is great, I am all for asserting who you are. I am what my teenage son likes to call, an extremist feminist but this doesn’t fit in my definition of anything. 
I saw the beautiful bride looking stunning in a video, with a vermilion and mangalsutra. I also saw a collage of pictures she had shared of herself. Where a female and male version of her seem to be in love ( photoshopped ofcourse) . 
I am not sitting on any kind of judgement but it’s a quest to understand what’s going on . 
Is she saying there are two people within her or does she believe in gender fluidity. Is she marrying different versions of herself . 
Her justification is she doesn’t believe in marriage or may be she didn’t want to get married but be a bride- a beautiful bride at that definitely. 
But to show self love and not get married she could stay single or may be not ( entirely her choice). She could dress up like a bride or may be not . 
But I feel a dichotomy here. She doesn’t want to get married but still gives so much importance to the institution of marriage .
That she had to marry herself to validate herself and her self love. 
The post might sound as confusing as I am right now can anyone help me understand. It’s like me always confusing then for than and than for then while writing . Do share your opinion .
