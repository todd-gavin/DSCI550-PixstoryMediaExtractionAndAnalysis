Xiao Guo Guangzhou Diabetic Eye Study Group Abstract Purpose To determine the predictive value of the microcirculation of optic nerve head ONH by SS OCTA for identifying individual with high risk of DR progression and DME development Design Prospective observational cohort study Method A total of patients eyes with type DM were recruited who had no DR or mild non proliferative DR at baseline and no DME All subjects underwent mm mm SS OCTA centered on the ONH to generate angiograms in four layers radial peripapillary plexus RPC superficial retinal capillary plexus SCP deep retinal capillary plexus DCP and choriocapillaris CC The CC flow deficit percentage CC FD vessel density VD and perfusion density PD were quantified Results During the consecutive years of follow up eyes experienced DR progression and eyes developed DME The DR progression was related to a lower VD of the SCP RR per SD decrease CI P a lower PD of the SCP P a lower VD of the RPC P and an elevated CC FD P The DME occurrence was associated with a lower VD of SCP P a lower PD of SCP P and a higher CC FD P The CC FD significantly improved the predictive power with the increase of the C statistic for DR progression and DME occurrence by P and P respectively Conclusions This study provides the first longitudinal evidence suggesting that CC FD can improve the prediction of DR progression and DME development beyond traditional risk factors Sources
