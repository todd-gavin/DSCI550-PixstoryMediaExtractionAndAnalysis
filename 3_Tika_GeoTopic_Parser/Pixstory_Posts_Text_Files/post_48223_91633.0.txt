In February, the Biden-led U.S govt freezed $7 billion in assets attached to the Afghan central bank. Since then, more than 13,000 Afghan children have died of hunger. 1 in 10 newborn Afghan babies is reported to have died since January as a consequence of the prolonged humanitarian crisis. According to a report by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) 95% of the population has scant access to sufficient food. The worsening situation has prompted an urgent need for nutritional support for 3.5 million Afghan children. Taliban has put the onus on the U.S govt, they say that the U.S sanctions have incapacitated the banking system, crippled the Afghan economy and impaired their right to life, food and health care. Afghanistan has appealed to lift the restrictions on their central bank which has been straining large financial transactions and deteriorating the healthcare infrastructure. 

The Biden administration subsequently announced that they would be moving to court to expropriate $3.5 billion of the frozen assets as reparations for the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks. This move has been widely criticized by many including the families of the victims of the 9/11 attack, they say that by doing so, the U.S govt would only worsen the liquidity crisis in Afghanistan leading to a steep rise in the mortality rates.
