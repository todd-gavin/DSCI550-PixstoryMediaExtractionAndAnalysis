BIG’s proposal for the six-story neuroscience center combines the efficiency of a double loaded corridor building with the generosity and openness of a classic atrium typology. By folding the floor plan around an atrium, similar to the characteristic folds in the cerebral cortex, the design not only allows each floor to reach the necessary square footage withing a limited area, it also creates a number of connections and smaller clusters with intimate workspaces, courtyards and views between each floor within the hospital.

“The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. Our design for the new Danish Neuroscience Center in Aarhus, replicates the most essential feature of the brain - the gyrification - to create more connections and space within limited confines. The building folds bring light, lots of new pathways and green pockets into the hospital making nature and biodiversity part of the hospital’s research and the healing journey of its patients.” Bjarke Ingels, Founding Partner, BIG.

Patients and guests access the building through a generous reception area, into the large open atrium at the center of the building which contains an experience center – an interactive public exhibition and presentation area where the visitors can learn about the hospital’s latest research and findings. The visitors can head directly to one of the clinics upstairs or enjoy the café and a public green courtyard at ground level. Each department from neurology to nuclear medicine, headache clinic and psychiatry has its own distinct space and program functions. To avoid separation and fragmentation between the disciplines, BIG proposes to organize them by the functions they have in common. This encourages crossbreeding between the different research groups that can help fuel inspiration, innovation and creativity, and future proof the spaces for growth, reduction or replacement.
