Happiness is something that cannot be described in words; it can only be felt through the expression of a smile. Similarly, happiness is a sign or indicator of a happy and prosperous life. Happiness is easy to feel but difficult to describe. Furthermore, happiness comes from within, and no one can take it away from you. We can say that happiness can only be obtained by thinking positively and enjoying life. Also, in order to be happy and keep the people around us happy, we must cultivate a healthy relationship with those around us.
