The concept of the U.S. Open being open to all does not end with qualifying for the right to play golf's most difficult test. 

US News reported that Nick Hardy, who was officially the last player into the 156-man field, shot a 2-under 68 on Friday to share the lead with Masters champion Scottie Scheffler among the early starters. 

This was one day after Adam Hadwin, who had been accepted as an alternate only eight days before the tournament began, had taken the 18-hole lead. This is not rare for a US Open, which featured England's Richard Bland a year ago.

“Couldn't be a better start,” said Hardy, who qualified for two U.S. Opens while playing at Illinois, where he was a Big Ten champion.

And it couldn't have been a quicker exit for Phil Mickelson, who at least delighted fans with big birdies — 45 feet on No. 5, nearly 60 feet on No. 6 — that only helped him salvage a 73. He still missed the cut for the second time in three years at the U.S. Open.

The next stop is Oregon in two weeks for the next Saudi-backed LIV event.
