To those saying that appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson is beyond politics and the Republicans should have no qualms about it I have one thing to say Wake up in the real world Everything is politics and to think otherwise is simply being naive It would not be an invalid argument to say that this whole nomination by Biden is a POLITICAL move to gain brownie points from the radical left We all have seen how Biden used the gaining momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement to his benefit and it s completely fair After all as Bloomberg reported she ll probably move the court s Democratic appointed bloc even further to the left Jackson would join the liberal minority of conservative dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation It s clear how all of this fits beautifully into Biden s agenda However to think that the conservatives would accept this quietly is unfair Biden has made his move and it s the turn of conservatives Guardian pointed out that based on her professional background and her previous rulings she s likely to be a more liberal justice than Breyer was and one who will probably be less willing than Breyer to compromise with the court s conservatives This means that the court like every other POLITICAL institution these days is about to become even more polarized And even if we remove the race and gender aspect from this debate there is plenty of reasons for conservatives to challenge this appointment for their benefit For instance her judicial philosophy Quint rightly points out that Conservatives will clearly prefer originalists who interpret the Constitution according to its original meaning and want to see if they can garner any indication that she might as they say legislate from the bench All in all this is a political game wherein the side with better arguments will win
