When it comes to longevity , surviving illness and coping with trauma , one gender comes in my Mind ! " Woman's " ! ‚ôÄÔ∏è

We Literally Tolerate everything ! Every Damn thing . From Family Pressure to Periods Pain , we face everytime with a smile on our face ! Still the Society thinks that only males are physically Strong ! Well , What a lie , what A lie . It's totally Wrong ! Each and Everyone Female Is Equally strong , Emotionally and Physically both ways ! ‚úÖ‚ôÄÔ∏è

Remember , If A Female Can Give birth To a child , A Human , she can do Everything ! Have You ever Imagined ?? How painful It is to give Birth to a child ?? I mean like ? The pain is equivalent to 20 bones Cracking at the same time ! The Screaming , Moaning and Alot of sounds commonly associated with childbirth . No male can Tolerate This pain , But we females ? We feel it ! We go through it . Each and Everyone of us ! ü•≤

I'm not saying That Males are not strong ! Obviously Males are strong But Females are Equally strong too .

Women rock ! Mothers rock ! We are strong ! we always do our best with what we know , we are admirable warriors ! I would love if people start treating women and womans to treat themselves like the goddesses they are . ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
