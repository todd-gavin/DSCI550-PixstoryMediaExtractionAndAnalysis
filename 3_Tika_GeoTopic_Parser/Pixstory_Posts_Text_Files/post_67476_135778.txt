Breadfruit which originated in the Pacific and is widely grown in South East Asia has a promising role in ensuring food security in tropical and subtropical regions of the world that are likely to be affected by climate change a study suggests As we implement strategies to adapt to climate change breadfruit should be considered in food security adaptation approaches says climate scientist Daniel Horton an author of the study and assistant professor at Northwestern University US Breadfruit has been eaten boiled roasted or mixed with other food for thousands of years Its taste and versatility improve when flour processed from its starch is developed into other foods such as bread Horton said that despite the word fruit being attached to its name breadfruit is mainly cooked like potato Closely related to jackfruit it is high in fibre vitamins and minerals he said Breadfruit is a neglected and underutilised species that happens to be relatively resilient in our climate change projections said Horton This is good news because several other staples that we rely on are not so resilient In really hot conditions some of those staple crops struggle and yield decrease Nyree Zerega a conservation scientist with the Negaunee Institute for Plant Conservation Science and Action US said Breadfruit trees can live for decades and provide a large number of fruits each year In some cultures there is a tradition of planting a breadfruit tree when a child is born to ensure the child will have food for the rest of his or her life While breadfruit shows the most promising resilience to future climactic conditions within Asia the study suggests opportunities to expand its cultivation over the next decades in Sub Saharan Africa where food insecurity happens to be high Christopher Umezuruike scientific director of the Abia State Independent Electoral Commission ABSIE in Nigeria s Umuahia region told SciDev Net that a particular variety of breadfruit that grows in Africa Treculiar africana has been found to be superior to others in terms of seed morphology amino acid content carbohydrates and quality of its seed oil Some important challenges facing commercialisation of African breadfruit are long maturity period absence of appropriate technology for dehulling the seeds and poor research interest Umezuruike said
