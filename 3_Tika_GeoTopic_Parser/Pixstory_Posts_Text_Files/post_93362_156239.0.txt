The moon told me i look like him,
Laughing from the corner of the crimson sky,
Beyond wordly things
I dance like him
In gloomy nights, His mysterious vows, 
The epic charm or the silvery glance
The moon said i laugh like him
He is tainted
He is eclipsed
He is lost
And so is me
The moon reminded how i am beyond what the world see me as. I am beyond the scars life gave me. I am beyond the expectations people have on me. I am beyond what you see as.
The moon said i shines like him
