Jackie Robinson was much more than an excellent Baseball Player. ‌Robinson was one of the first Americans to advocate for boycotting, divesting from, and sanctioning South Africa. Robinson along with the American Committee on Africa (ACOA), an anti-apartheid and anti-colonial organization advocated for the rights. Robinson paved the way for Willie Mays, Willie Stargell, Eddie Murray, Barry Bonds, Andrew McCutchen, and Mookie Betts, among so many other African Americans, to play Major League Baseball. 
‌
‌His belief in nonviolence and his talent challenged the traditional purpose of segregation that had then marked many other aspects of American life. Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, Chock full o'Nuts. In the 1960s, he aided in establishing the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. I couldn't agree more on how significant he was to the African Americans being a major proponent of their rights. Yet he is also a figure who was ignored by many historians!
