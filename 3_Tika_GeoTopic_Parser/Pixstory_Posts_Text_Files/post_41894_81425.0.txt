Invented by Japanese-American chef Keizo Shimamoto in 2013, the ramen burger is one of the most famous food hybrids to hit the market. The tasty sandwich debuted at the Smorgasburg outdoor food market in Brooklyn, New York, and has been a staple at the food festival ever since. 
One fan told Gothamist in 2013 that the burger is "slightly crunchy but mostly soft and noodle-y, sealed together for hand-holding."
The appropriately named Ramenritto is another NYC creation, this time hailing from Manhattan's West Village. A restaurant called the Presstea has created the oddity, and it's exactly what you are picturing in your head. A burrito gets stuffed to the gills with ramen noodles. There's also a protein of your choice in there, along with cheddar jack cheese, barbecue sauce, pickled onions, corn, pickled English cucumber and, for health, fresh greens. The noodles themselves are cooked in a lovely sounding cilantro and garlic-infused pork broth.
