Aaron Ramsdale loves the spotlight, both with his brilliant goalkeeping skills and with his witty sense of humour. Arsenal supporters seem to be loving the Englishman after his first full season at the club, and for good reason.

Afterall, who doesn't love a little old fashioned 
banter from a goalkeeper? Ramsdale was right at the centre of it when his team beat Chelsea to reclaim the mantle in the race for top 4 this week.

As Bukayo Saka calmly put away his penalty from 12 yards, the Chelsea fans wreathed in a 
mood of tension and disappointment. Not long after their Champions League disappointment, this defeat comes as further dismay to what may be seen as a sorrowful end to the season.

Saka's penalty all but confirmed that as in the minutes prior, the Blues were on the lookout for an equaliser. His 92nd minute penalty put the game to bed, and Ramsdale took a moment of his own.

The mood at Stamford Bridge went stale, as Thomas Tuchel furiously retaliated to his seat 
and multiple Chelsea players were on the ground. Ramsdale sarcastically waved to the 
Stamford Bridge faithful, as if cheering their mood on and begging them to make some 
noise. Saka's spot kick topped off a delightful team performance. Eddie Nketiah also scored 
on two occasions, making this his best senior cap to date.

Surely, Mikel Arteta's guts in trusting a young side against the European champions must 
come handy. The likes of Martin Ã˜degaard, Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel were also 
impressive. 

The two teams went head to head in the first half, with Chelsea being made to equalise twice. Timothy Werner and Cesar Azpilicueta bagged the Blues' only goals, and Ramsdale's banter only rubbed salt into their mortified wounds.
