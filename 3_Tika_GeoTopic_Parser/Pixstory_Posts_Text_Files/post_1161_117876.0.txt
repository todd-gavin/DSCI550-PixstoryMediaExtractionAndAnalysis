In India, we tend to blame the caste system for dividing people.  But some of the crudest forms of segregation, I have seen, are practiced by/takes place at educational institutions in this country.

Kerala is notorious for this. The college where I studied was known for its institutionalised moral policing. The college had specially designated guards to segregate/chase away boys and girls who mixed freely in campus/after college hours. Seating arrangements were always separate.

Some colleges even had partitions inside their buses to prevent mixing. The perversion continues in many colleges even today (see picture). So it's heartening to see that the current generation have started responding to such self-appointed guardians of morality in their own inimitable style.

Recently, the students of the College of Engineering Trivandrum, came up with a novel way to protest against gender segregation in public spaces.

Students were upset that a bus stop bench, on which they used to hangout together, was dismantled and replaced with three separate seating units, effectively putting an end to mixing and shared seating arrangement.

The explanation given by the local residents association, which carried out the work, was renovation. How clever!

Students saw through the game and protested by sitting on each other’s lap.

A few years ago, while talking about his book ‘Early Indians’ author Tony Joseph called ancient Indians who institutionalised the caste system as the original ‘Tukade Tukade Gang’ because of how effectively they put an end to mixing, which was so common in Indian society till then. Perhaps the real ‘Tukade Tukade Gang’ is much closer than you think.
