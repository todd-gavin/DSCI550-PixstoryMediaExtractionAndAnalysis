Gehraiyaan is a film about the complicated urges wants and justifications of a modern day ethically and spiritually troubled adolescent It s also a look at the hazardous undercurrents of money and desire that pervade today s romantic and familial relationships It appears to be a film about pulling apart the very fabric of one s inner understanding of good and wrong in one s connections with others what it would take to be driven over the edge and into the scary waters of I did what I had to do The thin veneer of Zain and Alisha s small romance Alisha s all too safe emotional discussion with her father and the entire concept of leaving the past behind us which is so aggressively pushed by Tia s unorthodox monologue near the conclusion all seem out of place Background music disputes that are always on the point of becoming violent Alisha s fear and events from her mother s past all add to the danger in the film The metaphor of the majestic waves is only obvious after watching the film for at least two hours The only person in this ensemble who is suitably rumpled and feels authentic is Naseeruddin Shah who plays Al s distant father While they re together the picture manages to breathe a little and reach out to us
