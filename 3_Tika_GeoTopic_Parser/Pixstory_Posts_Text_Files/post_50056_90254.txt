To me it s extreme desire plus hard work love this from The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it Just that desire isn t enough but work until you are satisfied The whole universe rests in you you as a whole is your universe Everything you love see believe fight and dream Focus on it and you can be anything and everything you want Good day Folks
