New findings raise issues about how much underlying health factors contributed to some ethnic minorities' disproportionately high rates of severe COVID-19 illness and mortality during the epidemic. 

US News reported that an analysis of nearly 18,000 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in more than 100 facilities in Mississippi in 2020 found that American Indian and Alaska Native inpatients died at a higher rate than all other racial groups studied, with nearly 30% dying in the hospital compared to a 14 percent overall mortality rate.

The current study discovered that American Indian and Alaska Native patients had lower average risk scores than both Black and white patients, indicating a larger burden of comorbid disease and higher likelihood of death. When compared to Black and white patients, a higher percentage of Indigenous patients received risk scores in the lowest range, while a smaller percentage got scores in the highest range.

“Although we do not discredit the role that comorbidities may play in COVID-19 outcomes, alternative contributing factors to disparate COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality outcomes among Indigenous populations must be considered,” the study says. “Discrimination, marginalization, inability to see preferred clinicians, and systemic underfunding of the Indian Health Service … have been widely cited as barriers to American Indian and Alaska Native individuals accessing care.

This is proof that discrimination can also adversely affect the health of indigenous groups and how the system is inherently racist.
