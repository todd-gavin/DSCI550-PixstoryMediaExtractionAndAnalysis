The Amazon in South America is the longest river in the world or so says a recent survey by the government of Brazil which has a vested interest in staying a few steps ahead of the Nile The Amazon has a vast jungle basin breathtaking waterfalls and the world s largest river dolphins but it might be more remarkable for something it doesn t have a single bridge That s right the Amazon is the world s longest river not crossed by any bridges The Amazon runs over miles from its headwaters in the Andes to its massive delta on the Atlantic While the million people who live on or near its banks span Brazil Peru and Colombia living in sprawling metropolitan cities and tiny tribal villages all have one thing in common to cross to the other side they ll need to jump in a boat or hop on a ferry No road crosses the Amazon It divides an entire continent nearly in two But the real reason for the lack of bridges is simply this the Amazon Basin has very few roads for bridges to connect The dense rainforest is sparsely populated outside of a few large cities and the river itself is the main highway for those traveling through the region Macap on the north shore of the Amazon delta is a city of half a million people but there s not a single road to connect it to the rest of Brazil
