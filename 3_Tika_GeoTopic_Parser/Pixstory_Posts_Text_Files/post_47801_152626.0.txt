By NewsDrum Desk Islamabad: The Pakistan government has issued a nationwide alert to authorities to maintain "extreme vigilance" amid a heightened risk of terrorist attacks by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) after peace talks with the dreaded terror group have stalled, a media report said on Thursday.The federal government said it had learnt that the TTP high command met recently in Paktika, Afghanistan, to discuss the deadlock in peace talks and the fate of the negotiations with the Pakistani government after the killing of TTP commanders Omar Khalid Khorasani and Aftab Parkay.The letter urged all authorities in four provinces to heighten security and exercise enhanced vigilance to avoid any untoward incident, the Ministry of Interior said in a statement, instructing forces that targeted search and strike missions be carried out wherever militant activity is reported.In a letter circulated last month, the Ministry of Interior warned that more than year-long peace negotiations between the TTP and the government of Pakistan “had come to a standstill”, which has led to unease within the TTP’s ranks, the Dawn newspaper reported.It noted that the TTP accuses the Pakistani government of failing to fulfil its main demand — the reversal of the merger of former Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — as well as continuing to detain TTP members while a truce was still being negotiated.The letter was addressed to the home and chief secretaries of the four provinces as well as the Islamabad chief commissioner, the report said.The ministry warned that the terror group or its splinter factions might also seek to escalate terrorist activities in the coming days to avenge the killing of their commanders and to show strength in case there is no further progress in peace negotiations.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/international/pak-govt-issues-nationwide-alert-amid-heightened-risk-of-terror-attacks-by-ttp-98542.html
