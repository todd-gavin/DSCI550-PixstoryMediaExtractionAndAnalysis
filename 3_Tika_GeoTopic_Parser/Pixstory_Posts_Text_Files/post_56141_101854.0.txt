‌The trooping parade is a parade that has noted the official birthday of the British sovereign. It has been held for more than 260 years. Last year's parade was on the grounds of Windsor Castle. It is generally held on the Queen's official birthday which is marked on the second Saturday of June each year.
‌
‌During the rehearsal of the trooping parade, five people were wounded, with two taken to major trauma units, when parts of spectator stands fell at a Trooping the Colour rehearsal at Horse Guards Parade in central London. 

London Ambulance Service (LAS) said two patients were taken to the hospital for medication as a priority. Three others were treated at the scene with one later transferred to hospital.

Spectators were vacated from the stands by the Army and police so that safety checks could be carried out. Army said that a partial structural failure was to blame.

Marcus Dell, one of the people present in the event said he heard screams: "Everyone had stood for the national anthem and there was a bit of a commotion. The first we heard was that one of the floorboards had broken and someone had fallen through and hurt themselves. He said a floorboard had broken down behind him and then about 25 minutes later, there was a similar incident in the stand opposite. However, it is said that the evacuation was well executed.
