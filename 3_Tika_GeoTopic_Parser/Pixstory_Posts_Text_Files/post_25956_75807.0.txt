Came across this amazing series. It's an amazing series which talks about the debates that were taken during the making of constitution as Republic day is coming this is one of the series that everyone should watch. The only thing I didn't liked about it was how most of the things that were spoken by the narrator was in hindi and as a nation of diversity it would have been amazing if the whole show was in English subtitles for every language were given there not English.
