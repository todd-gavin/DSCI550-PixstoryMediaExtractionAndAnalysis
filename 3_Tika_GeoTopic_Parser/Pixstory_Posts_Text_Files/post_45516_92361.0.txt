Gianluigi Buffon's recent remarks about Joe Hart come in the 34 year-old's rise to
prominence since his move to Celtic Park.

 Manchester City's once iconic #1 is now enjoying
some brilliant football over in Scotland, and a certain Italian goalkeeping Icon has been
keeping tabs with the same.

Buffon told the Daily Record: “The way Joe is playing this season is no surprise to me he
has always been a great goalkeeper. He just needed a place to call home again."

Then newly-appointer City boss Pep Guardiola insisted on a keeper who was good with the
ball at his feet, and that marked the symbolic end of Hart's career at the Etihad. A few loan
moves followed, after which he departed permanently in 2018.

“Along with (Manuel) Neuer, (David) De Gea and (Jan) Oblak, these guys were the next
generation who could take over from myself and (Iker) Casillas. That player who was No.1
for Manchester City and England didn’t go away. He just needed to find his confidence
again."

High Praise for Joe Hart, from Gianluigi Buffon.
“You make a mistake and all eyes are on you. That is what happened with Joe.He made a
couple of mistakes and people just decided he was not top level anymore.He needed a bit of
love to find his level again and he has obviously got that love at Celtic. The top player is
back and it is good to see.”

Buffon believes Hart has found a place to call home at Celtic. Since 2016, he's appeared for
a host of different Premier league teams (and weirdly enough, Torino in 2016) but has
always ended up as a backup/reserve keeper.

 While that can be tough, it is part and parcel
of being a goalie at top teams.
