If Congress manages to get a majority in Goa, Michael Vincent Lobo will be a contender for CM's post. 

‌ He was a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party until 2022 and quit the party on the eve of elections. His shift to Congress was considered an indication by many Goa that BJP is finding it difficult to retain the coastal state. 
‌
‌He represented the Calangute constituency twice in 2012 and 2017. 
‌
‌In the 2017 Assembly polls, he won against Congress leader Joseph Robert Sequeira by over 3,500 votes. 
‌
‌He was also a minister in the Pramod Sawant-led BJP government.
‌
‌ He is again bidding the elections from Calangute but on a Congress ticket this time.
‌He is emerging as a main challenger to veteran Congressman and former CM Digambar Kamat for the CM's post.  
‌
‌‌Lobo is one of the wealthiest among the 301 contestants in the poll fray with assets worth upwards of ₹84.39 crores. His total assets nearly doubled from the ₹49.47 crores he was worth back in 2017, information gleaned from the affidavit submitted before the Election Commission revealed.
