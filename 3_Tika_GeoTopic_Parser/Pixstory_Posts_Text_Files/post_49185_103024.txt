What police did or much rather failed to do while that boy carried out that shooting in Uvalde is all kinds of shameful Despite their reasons they still should have done something anything to protect those kids but they failed to do so There s no way to defend them or make excuses for them But we can t disregard all of the sacrifices the American Forces made for us Because of some bad cops we can t hate on every cop Every hours on average one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty in the United States More than U S law enforcement officials have died in the line of duty since the first known death in the course of duty in They keep their life on line for us over and over again even if it demands from them the ultimate sacrifice I know it s not the time to bring this topic us but it s also not the time to hate on the cops around America like this Let s keep the victims survivors and their families in our prayers instead of engaging in aimless arguments
