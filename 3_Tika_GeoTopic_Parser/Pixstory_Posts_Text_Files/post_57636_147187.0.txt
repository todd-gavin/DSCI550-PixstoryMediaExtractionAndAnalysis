The NFL(National Football League) has been in the news for its racism problems for a long time.
Countless instances have shown the existence of racism that has never left the league.
According to a report in the Washington Post, black coaches still face disadvantages despite the enactment of the Rooney Rule almost two decades ago.
According to this rule, league teams must interview ethnic-minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operation jobs.
But this is not precisely how it was supposed to be when the rule was enacted.
Racial discrimination has been America's problem, and its presence in the most renowned football league insinuates how apparent it is.
The findings show that black coaches perform with the same intensity and result as white coaches, but they are still denied equal opportunities. 
As a result, they end up serving in mid-level jobs.
The issue is serious and depicts the hypocrisy of well-known institutions and names. It needs to end to put an end to the discrimination going on in NFL.
