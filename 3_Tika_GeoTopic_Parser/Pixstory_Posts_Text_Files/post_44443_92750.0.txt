For the vast majority of football fans, the teenager was almost unknown until he was signed
from Las Palmas in 2019. 

Pedri joined Bar√ßa in 2020 after a year on loan at his boyhood club.

He hasn't looked back since. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the midfield sensation rapidly
won over fans with his incredible talents on the field, and he swiftly established himself as a
crucial element of Ronald Koeman's setup, becoming a household name in the process.

Since then, Pedri's ascension has been exponential, as he quickly established himself as a
mainstay for the Spanish national team, won several personal awards last year, and has now
become the face of Barcelona's comeback under Xavi. Pedri's meteoric rise to the top star he is
now, despite the fact that he is only 19 years old, has translated into commercial success for
both the player and the club.

Indeed, according to Mundo Deportivo, Pedri, together with Gavi, now leads the way in terms of
shirt sales for FC Barcelona. 

Meanwhile, according to the article, theSpanish international has
received over 80 sponsorship bids from all over the world. According to the source, Pedri's good
relationship with Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi helped his brand expand in South America
last season, and there is a lot of interest in the youngster in the Asian market, especially in
China and Japan.

The youngster's involvement with environmental causes has also boosted his profile. Pedri is a
member of the 'Kick Out Plastic' organization and one of the faces of Adidas' 'Run for the
Oceans' campaign.

Pedri had roughly 25,000 followers on his social media channels when he joined Barcelona.
That number has now increased to nearly 5.5 million people. It's no surprise that Pedri is
receiving so many sponsorship opportunities, given his rising reach and stature on and off the
field.
