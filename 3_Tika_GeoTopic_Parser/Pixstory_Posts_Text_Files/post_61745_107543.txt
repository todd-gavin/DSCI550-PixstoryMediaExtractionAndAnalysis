Many atheists think that their atheism is the product of rational thinking When you ask atheists about why they became atheists they often talk about one magical moments when they came to realise that religion is illogical Oddly perhaps many religious people actually take a similar view of atheism Theists speculate that it is sad to be an atheist lacking so much of the philosophical ethical mythical and aesthetic fulfilments that religious people have access to and being stuck in a cold world of rationality only But could you really call atheists rational Think about it just like religious people even atheists come together and form a group exactly what they oppose of Religious people They call religious people while they are just as much susceptible to following a charismatic atheist individual as a religious person is likely to follow a religious leader Atheists want to make the distinction of rationality between them and religious people but they are both inherently irrational because rationality makes room for opposing ideas to exist simultaneously Rationality is inclusive And to be frank I have never met an atheist who doesn t look down on religious people rationality has no place for moral superiority All in all it s very rational to think that atheists might be just as irrational as religious people
