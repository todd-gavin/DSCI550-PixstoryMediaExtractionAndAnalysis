1. Steve Martin and Martin Short
Short and Martin are one of the greatest comedy duos – and they’re also great pals. The actors played friends in their 1986 film, Three Amigos, alongside Chevy Chase, and they’ve been friends in real life ever since. In addition to working on other films together, they co-headlined a comedy tour, The Funniest Show in Town at the Moment, in 2020.
They reunited on-screen again in a Hulu mystery-comedy sitcom Only Murders in the Building, in which they play neighbours, would-be detectives and bickering friends. Selena Gomez also stars in the show and its second season was released in June.

2. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire
Before they were old sports in 2013’s The Great Gatsby, DiCaprio and Maguire actually met and became friends after both auditioning for a TV show in 1990. As Maguire was slightly more established as a child star, DiCaprio was the one who made the first move.
DiCaprio and Maguire both went out for the lead role, Toby Wolff, in 1993’s This Boy’s Life, with DiCaprio getting cast. Maguire was subsequently cast as Wolff’s friend Chuck Bolger. The friends would continue to compete for roles throughout their careers.

3. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are childhood friends, famously played friends in Good Will Hunting, and continue to support each other today.
Although Affleck and Damon have been friends since childhood, their breakout roles in 1997’s Oscar-winning film Good Will Hunting solidified their friendship on screen. The pair wrote and starred in Good Will Hunting, which earned them Oscars for their screenplay. This win propelled them to A-list status, and began a long working relationship that’s endured to today. They have continuously supported, defended and commended each other. In 2019, Damon said of his best friend, “I certainly wouldn’t be here were it not for him.”
