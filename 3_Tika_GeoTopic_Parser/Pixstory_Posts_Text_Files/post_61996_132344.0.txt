Marvel's newest streaming series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law has been, of course, officially billed as a legal comedy. And as such, even with only one episode having aired, it's easy for fans to pick up on the lighthearted, irreverent tone of the show. Naturally, this is helped along the way by lead character Jennifer Walters' ability to break the fourth wall and speak directly to the audience.  The premiere, while probably more serious than subsequent episodes, just from all the setup that needed to be done, still managed to pack in some definite laughs and funny dialogue. Notable among these was Bruce Banner revealing to Jen that former Captain America Steve Rogers lost his virginity in 1943 and Jen's ensuing reaction.  With a show like this, the temptation often exists to keep pushing the boundaries of comedy, but it would seem that Marvel Studios was there to prevent things from going too far.
According to She-Hulk: Attorney at Law producer Jessica Gao (via IGN) while the writers' room for the series was allowed to be surprisingly untethered with regard to the show's humor, Marvel still put the kibosh on jokes that would be damaging to the brand:
“Yeah, I mean, most of the time, the only jokes that they really forced us to pull back on were when we were being a little too mean when we were poking fun at Marvel things.”
Gao was sure to remark on the sense of freedom that was enjoyed in the series though.
“Well, I think what this shows and should be reassuring to fans is that Marvel now has gotten to a point where they’re willing to expand into areas that they’ve never gone to before. And they’re open to doing that, and trying new things, and getting into areas that were outside of their comfort zone previously.”
