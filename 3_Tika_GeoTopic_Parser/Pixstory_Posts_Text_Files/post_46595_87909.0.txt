Former President Barack Obama will surprise audiences as the narrator of the Netflix documentary Our Great National Parks, a five-part series about wildlife around the world. 

My favourite president is on Netflix! I am so glad that he got another gig and that too in the entertainment and informative sector. Giving Obama’s face to this nature documentary just assured its success! 

The Verge reported that the series was announced in February as part of a slate of content that Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions company is creating for Netflix — though the announcement didn't disclose that the former president would serve as host and narrator. 

"A fish with the ability to walk." Hippos who want to catch some waves while surfing. Species found nowhere else on earth,” Obama adds in the video for Our Great National Parks. 

According to Deadline, the show has video from parks in California's Monterey Bay, Kenya's Tsavo National Park, and Indonesia's Gunung Leuser National Park. 

Higher Ground Productions signed a multi-year deal with Netflix in 2018, with the stated purpose of producing "a varied mix of content, including the possibility for scripted series, unscripted series, docuseries, documentaries, and features" from the Obamas. Aside from the national parks series, the business has delivered Ada Twist, Scientist, and Waffles + Mochi to Netflix.

Can April 13th come any sooner?
