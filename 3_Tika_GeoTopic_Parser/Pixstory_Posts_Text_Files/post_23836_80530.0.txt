I’ve been to Goa twice and I would happily go again. Goa is the perfect mix of natural beauty, lively nightlife, and tropical environs. I clicked the picture in June, 2019. The weather was gloomy and it was raining throughout my trip. So maybe it wasn’t the best idea to visit at the end of the season. Goa was my first time visiting a beach, standing on the soft wet sand and the utterly humid breeze blowing in my face… okay so that wasn’t fun, but the sand, so soft!
