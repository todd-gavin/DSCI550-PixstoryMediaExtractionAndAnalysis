Real Madrid won convincingly at the Bernab u on Saturday night clearing any doubts if at all any on their authority over the Laliga title That after an emphatic victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge puts the Merengues in a good position to end the season with two domestic trophies and a respectable Champions League finish at the very least Even with Football Club Barcelona s recent resurgence It s unlikely the Catalans will do anything to catch up with Madrid But former Barcelona legend Ronaldinho seems to think otherwise and backs his former team to pull off an unlikely comeback Their most recent win over Sevilla restored some of the usual Camp Nou mood with Pedri starring in the victory We are excited that Barca play well again and I think anything is possible I hope so and as a fan I am hoping that things go well and I think there can be a comeback The optimism doesn t go unnoticed but a Real Madrid slip up at this stage of the season is rather out of the question Xavi has returned and has brought us hope he added As my friend and ex team mate this excites people and me too When he played he already had a vision of the game as a coach He guided the game and I see it very well in his coaching too because he makes us want to watch Barca games again Ronaldinho spoke well of Xavi Hernandez the head coach who s restored much of the usual winning spirits at Bar a Having gone unbeaten games and counting Barcelona will still have to rely on the likes of Sevilla Atl tico Madrid and Real Betis to beat Madrid if they are to have any chance at pipping the league leaders as well as obviously not slipping up any of their own fixtures
