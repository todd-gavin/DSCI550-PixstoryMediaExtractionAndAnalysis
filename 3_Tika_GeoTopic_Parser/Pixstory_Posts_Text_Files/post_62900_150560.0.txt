When it comes to delicious food, there's nothing like a taste of the world! Here are my favorite cuisines from around the world, and what makes them so special, in my opinion.
 1. Chinese cuisine 
 China is known for its wide variety of different dishes, all of which are deliciously complex and full of flavor. Some popular dishes include Cantonese rice noodles with shrimp or pork, stir-fried cabbage with beef or chicken, sesame oil noodles with shrimp or chicken, and steamed dumplings filled with pork, shrimp or vegetables.
 2. Japanese cuisine 
 Japan is known for its sushi â€“ fresh fish that has been sliced and arranged on rice crackers (or other types of sushi roll). Other popular Japanese dishes include tempura (deep-fried seafood), udon (a type of noodle), ramen (a type of noodle soup), and soba (a type of noodle).
 3. French cuisine 
 France is known for its amazing wine list as well as some amazing French food staples such as croissants and baguettes. Some popular French dishes include ratatouille (a vegetable dish cooked in a tomato sauce), onion Tart (an onion tart made with puff pastry instead of a classic dough crust), steak au poivre (steak marinated in pepper sauce), cassoulet etc!
4. Indian cuisine 
India is known for its diverse and delicious cuisines, which include North Indian dishes like tandoori chicken and saag paneer, as well as South Indian specialties like dosas and idlis. What makes Indian food so unique is that it's often cooked using traditional spices and herbs, which give it a unique flavor that you just can't find anywhere else. And every few miles, you have a new cuisine too! You can never have enough of Indian food!
