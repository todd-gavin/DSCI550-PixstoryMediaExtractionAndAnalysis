Armenia has agreed to “facilitate a civilian European Union (EU) mission alongside the border with Azerbaijan,” according to a joint statement released early on October 7. 
Azerbaijan also “agreed to cooperate with this mission as far as it is concerned,” the statement said. 
The peace deal is followed by a negotiation signed last month to end flaring-up of fighting that killed 155 soldiers from both the sides. 
The EU mission will start in October for a maximum of two months,  to build confidence and contribute to the border commissions that have been set earlier this year to address questions related to the delimitation of the border. 
Both Armenia and Azerbaijan have been involved in decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan but has been under the control of  Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. 
Now The move comes after the meeting of the leaders of historic foes Turkey and Armenia on Thursday, which aimed at improving relations.
