Most people associate Kashmir with its expansive landscape of breathtaking, snow-capped mountain peaks and serene alpine lakes. This is also true of the Pamsar Lake Trek. The Pamsar Lake Trek hasn't been as widely publicised as some of its more well-known counterparts, but it's still a very well-kept secret. 
Since Pamsar Lake is an oligotrophic alpine lake with low nutrient levels, it cannot maintain a diverse species of aquatic life. Pamsar Lake is a part of the Khansahib Budgam forest range and is located in the Budgam district of Kashmir valley. The trip follows a wonderful path with panoramic views of verdant, green meadows and spectacular mountains, which are covered in snow for the majority of the year. The word "Pamsar" is a combination of two Kashmiri words. The Himalayan herb known as "pam" is often found along the lake's banks. Also, the local language's translation of "Sar" is "lake."
