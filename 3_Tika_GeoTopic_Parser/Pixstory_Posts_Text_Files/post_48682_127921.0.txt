You would have thought that since we have a severe housing crisis that is only getting worse, more people would be aware of how much land we waste away for golf.

Approximately 17 people per 10,000 experience homelessness each day. With around half a million individuals living in a state of homelessness, things are not great for the nation.

The amount of land being used for golf courses was about 2 millionâ€” on an aggregate basis, golf courses covered an estimated 2,244,512 total acres as of 2018. That is larger in size than the state of Delaware, but smaller than Connecticut. Over a million people live in Delaware. The land used for golf can easily house all of America's homeless population.

But but but, some people continue to believe that there's no space in America left to house the homeless and that there is no chance of resolving the housing problem. Fair enough, most of us likely spend the most of our time on the small portion of land that is built upon. You'd think we could allot enough space so that the next generation could have their own house when we can devote so much acreage to putting a tiny white ball into a hole. But alas, America doesn't care about its people.
