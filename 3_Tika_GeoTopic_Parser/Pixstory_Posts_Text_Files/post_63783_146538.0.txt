 Developer Zelart and publisher HypeTrain Digital’s 2D Lovecraftian Soulslike action game ‘There Is No Light’ have finally released the game for PC on September 19. The Soulslike RPG recently launched on Steam, and its goal appears to be to show the world just how gory a pixel-art style can get.
There Is No Light isn’t merely gory – the art style is striking throughout, and the carefully hand-crafted environments and lighting can be stunning to look at, when you’re not splattering them with monster blood. From the dark Lovecraft atmosphere and brilliant design of the overall environment, the game is both a visual treat as well as a tirade of challenges leading to rage breakdowns.
Players  take on the role of a father and a lone adventurer whose child has been taken away to a desolate underground society by a ‘new god’ called ‘The Great Hand’. The game features a vast world with detailed and beautiful pixel art, a non linear narrative with a branching story, choice system and a moving 30-hour long storyline about a family, war and redemption.
In addition to that, the combat of There Is No Light features a very flexible combat system that that lets players seamlessly swap between four different weapons on the go to eviscerate any that stand in their path. 
A massive skill tree gives players the freedom to build out each of their weapons to create their own unique fighting style. In addition, players can explore the vast and beautifully atmospheric pixel art world of There Is No Light however they choose.
