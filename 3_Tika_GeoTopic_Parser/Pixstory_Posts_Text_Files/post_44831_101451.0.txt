Arsenal defender Dinos Mavropanos has signed a permanent contract with Vfb Stuttgart in the
Bundesliga, the teams announced on Thursday.

The Greek international spent the previous two seasons on loan at Stuttgart, where he helped
the club avoid relegation.

Stuttgart announced on their website that the 24-year-old, who has four goals this season, has
signed a three-year deal. There has been no financial information released.

He has played 52 league games for the German club after signing on loan in 2020, and he
made his debut for Greece in March 2021. Since then, he's made nine appearances.

I have always given my all for this fantastic club and will continue to do so. The confidence of the people in charge, as well as the love of the Stuttgart supporters, are wonderful motivators
for me.

"According to the club's website, Mavropanos,
Die Roten had a condition in their contract that required them to acquire the defender if they
avoided relegation during his two seasons on loan at the Mercedes Benz Arena. They
accomplished just that after a last-gasp win against Cologne on the last day of the season, and
have wasted no time in completing a £4.5 million transaction.

After Mislintat departed Arsenal to subsequently become Stuttgart's Director of Football, he made the 6ft 4′′ defender a priority signing after a six-month tenure at FC Nurnberg in the
2019/20 season.

"Dinos provides immense force and willpower to our game and has also stabilised at a high
physical level," Mislintat said of making the loan deal permanent. He has demonstrated a strong
commitment to VfB and our mission, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate. "

West Ham were said to be willing to pay upwards of £20 million for the centre-back earlier this
year, and a deal with Stuttgart might happen in the coming months. If that happens, Edu will
look bad since he must have been regretting the stoppage-time goal that saved Stuttgart's
bacon on Saturday.
