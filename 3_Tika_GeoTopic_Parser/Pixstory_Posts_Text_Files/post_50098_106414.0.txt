The spoken word refers to oral poetic performance art that is founded mainly on the poem as well as the performer's aesthetic qualities

 It is a late 2020th-century continuation of an ancient oral artistic tradition that directs on the aesthetics of recitation and wordplay, such as the performer's live intonation and voice inflexion.

 Spoken word is a "catchall" term that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including poetry readings, poetry slams, jazz poetry, and hip hop music, and can include comedy routines and prose monologues.

Unlike written poetry, the poetic text takes its quality less from the visual aesthetics on a page but depends more on phonaesthetics or the aesthetics of sound.

Spoken-word poetry is typically more than a hobby or expression of talent. This art form is often used to convey important or controversial messages to society.

 Such messages often include raising awareness of topics such as racial inequality, sexual assault and/or rape culture, anti-bullying messages, body-positive campaigns, and LGBT topics.

Slam poetry competitions often star loud and radical poems that display both intense content and sound. Spoken-word poetry is also abundant on college campuses, on YouTube, and on forums such as Button Poetry.
