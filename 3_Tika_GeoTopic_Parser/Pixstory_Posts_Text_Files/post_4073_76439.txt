 Republic Days were very special at school because mine was a school of a Gandhian DR G Ramachandran who was also a freedom fighter Celebrations like Republic Day were given at most importance I remember wearing white khadi which was our uniform for Fridays and marching across the ground holding house pluck cards and at times flags We had a very accurate parade in front of our chief guest and I remember in one of the Republic days our chief guest was Martin Luther King III We were so excited to hear his connection with our founder Dr G Ramachandran Every year we have practices weeks before republic day Many programmes including dance acrobatics songs competitions will be held on the day I really miss the vibe and enthusiasm with which the students enjoyed the day We used to have full attendance on the day I think my school with its secular vision and non violent ideologies had a great influence on the person I am Due to the current scenario many of the students are not having the privilege to understand the importance of the day I feel grateful for my school and the education I received
