Now many will say that Inter are still the favorites but I remember what was said at the beginning They hadn&#39;t won here for years but nothing was done It&#39;s just one stage that brings us closer to Milan and Naples Words and thoughts from Inter coach Simone Inzaghi who to the microphones of DAZN after winning the Derby d Italia I removed more than a few pebbles from my shoes I have a two-year contract the club asked me to extend it but I asked to wait until the end of the season because contracts are worth what they are worth daily work is important I feel great trust from all the players and fans.
