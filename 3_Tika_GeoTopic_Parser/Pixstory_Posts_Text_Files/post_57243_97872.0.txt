Dr Michael Rodriguez, a cosmetic surgeon with Gentera Center for Plastic Surgery in Coral Gables, Florida, says, "Vitamin C – the same vitamin C found in your citrus fruits – is an antioxidant that the body doesn’t naturally make. Instead, vitamin C can be made synthetically or extracted from foods. Antioxidants can help delay or slow down damage to cells, both topically and through digestion. This includes the skin, which means vitamin C can be useful to fight off premature ageing."

Vitamin C is found in a variety of products these days, including health care products. 
Some significant benefits of vitamin c for the skin include, 
It helps in repairing the ageing skin, including wrinkles. It does this by getting absorbed in the skin and neutralising free radicals that damage the skin and cause signs of ageing. Free radicals are unstable molecules in the body that can contribute to ageing. The body is exposed to free radicals through ultraviolet rays, UV rays, chemicals and air pollution. It helps in evening out skin tone and brightening the complexion. Creating collagen is a protein that helps make the skin more elastic. It helps in reducing acne. In addition, it works against sun damage because it neutralises free radicals.
