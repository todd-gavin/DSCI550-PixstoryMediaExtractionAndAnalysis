If you re a fan of Fantasy fiction and haven t read A Song of ice and fire then you re missing out on one of the best books out there It s a series of seven novels written by George R Martin and it tells the story of two rival houses the Starks and Lannisters as they battle for control over the Iron Throne Aside from its well written prose what sets this series apart is its complex plotline and rich characters The complex political landscape combined with the intricate relationships between different characters makes it difficult to put down You ll never be able to predict what s going to happen next which makes it that much more exciting when you do get to read the last page The book is set in a world of swords and sorcery where there are three main Houses vying for control over the Others a mythical race that is said to be able to walk on water The story follows several characters as they struggle for power and revenge in an increasingly brutal world What makes this book so good to me is its richly detailed storyline and characters Unlike other fantasy books that rely primarily on action or adventure A song of ice and fire is driven by psychological dynamics which makes it more realistic You not only become entranced by the action on the page but you also empathize with the characters as they struggle with their emotional turmoil If you re looking for an epic tale that will keep you hooked from beginning to end then you need to read A song of ice and fire
