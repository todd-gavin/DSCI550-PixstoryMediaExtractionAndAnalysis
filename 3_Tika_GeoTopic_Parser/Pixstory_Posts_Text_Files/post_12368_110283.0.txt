I want to point out that moms are not the only ones who go through hormonal shifts during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Studies have shown that testosterone levels in dads start to drop when their partners become pregnant.* It's nature's way of preparing them to become nurturers. After a baby is born, those levels drop even more!

What does this mean?

~ Dads are primed to nurture their babies-just like moms are.
~ Dads are going through major hormonal changes-even before a baby is born.
~ Dads are at risk for perinatal mental health issues, partially due to hormonal changes (along with sleep deprivation, new pressures and expectations, and the difficult transition into parenthood).

Postpartum depression and other mental health concerns for dads are real, and they need to be taken seriously.

It's important for all family members to prioritize their mental health and work to navigate their new roles after a baby is born.
