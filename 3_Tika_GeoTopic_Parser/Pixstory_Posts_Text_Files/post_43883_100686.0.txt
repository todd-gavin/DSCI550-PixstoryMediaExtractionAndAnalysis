Manchester City moved four points clear of Liverpool with a 2-2 draw at West Ham, the Reds could close that gap to one point with a win at Southhampton on Tuesday with
one game remaining each.

Liverpool could win 55-0 against Southampton this Tuesday, but it would not make difference. They have no chance of winning the Premier League now.

Manchester City’s result at West Ham was a massive point, now they have to beat
Aston Villa at home on the last day of the season. If Manchester City loses the game,
we could see Liverpool putting a lorry load past Southampton. It would have been a
five-goal swing had West Ham beaten Man City 2-0 and Southampton can let in goals
for fun. It could have been four then and we would experience a shootout at the end of
the season.

The point was huge, actually huge for Manchester City to win the Premier League. But the race for the title has been constant for these two teams. If anyone between the
two drops a point, that’s it! Liverpool did so, by dropping a point against Tottenham even
three games to go. The Tottenham game was a banana skin for them as they went
double over the City after all.

Liverpool has already won two finals, they are in another final and now they are going to
take the Premier League season to the final game.

The hardest thing in the world is trying to win the Premier League, it’s 38 games over
nine months. But to win two cup competitions, be in the title race until the final week of
the season and also be in the ultimate European final, there’s no better feat.
