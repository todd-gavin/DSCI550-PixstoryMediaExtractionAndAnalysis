‌Americans are often blamed for getting divorced. As per research, almost 50% of all marriages in the United States will end in divorce or separation. Is divorce a sin or a relief? 
‌
‌The concept of marriage is built on the idea of compromise and adjustments. In one way another one should compromise for the other. The issue arises when one of the individuals takes the other for granted. Then there are endless fights, toxicity and trauma. Finally leading a meaningless life in the name of children.
‌
‌There are often claims that divorce destroys families. Unhappy marriages ruin the mental health of the children. Your suffering will not allow you to focus on your children and they end up having serious trust issues or dependency issues. An unhappy family is not a solution for the children. 
‌
‌Divorce gives hope for a new life, new partnership and freedom. It might be initially a shock for children but eventually, they will realise the fact that they finally have two happy parents again. It's much better than life long trauma two unhappy people would give to their children. Toxic marriages make you lose yourself. You would dive into depression and resentment without even being aware of it. 
‌
‌Marriage is a choice; it should be a choice of happiness and love. It shouldn't be any adjustment that you make for yourselves or the sake of your children. Choose happiness over anything.
