Why is it that when the weekend comes around going out seems to be the only option Why isn t it more socially acceptable to stay at home Some people recognise the advantages of staying at home while others do not Everyone has that one friend that makes us feel obligated to go out whenever we have free time They don t understand how staying at home is preferable to going out Going out can be enjoyable at times but like with everything else in life there must be a balance You can t go out every day Staying in is sometimes the best option You don t have to worry about impressing others or putting on a phoney smile When you re at home you can be completely yourself without worrying about what other people think You have complete freedom to dress whatever you want eat whatever you want do whatever you want and act however you want When you go out you are forced to adhere to what society considers normal which isn t necessarily a pleasurable experience Staying at home gives you the opportunity to be yourself without worry of being judged Therefore I would rather Netflix and Chill at home
