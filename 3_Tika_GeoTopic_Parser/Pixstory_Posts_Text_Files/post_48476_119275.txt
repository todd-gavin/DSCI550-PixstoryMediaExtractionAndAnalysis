 Wives submit to your own husbands as to the Lord For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church his body and is himself its Savior Now as the church submits to Christ so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies He who loves his wife loves himself For no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the church because we are members of his body Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife and the two shall become one flesh This mystery is profound and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church However let each one of you love his wife as himself and let the wife see that she respects her husband Ephesians
