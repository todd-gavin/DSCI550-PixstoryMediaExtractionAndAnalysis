Tulika Maan won the silver medal in Judo women's 78 Kg category 3 days back in the Commonwealth games. 

What many may not know is the stout support to Tulika from her mother Amrita. 

Amrita was the first woman from her family to get an education and hold a job – as a constable with the Delhi Police. After joining the police force in 1991, Amrita’s work kept her away from home at odd hours. 

When she went to work, she would leave Tulika with her uncle. A few years later, she started leaving Tulika alone at home.

Left alone, Tulika would get extremely bored. “She was very lonely, so I thought I’d put her in a sport. I did not have any idea about judo, but there was a martial arts academy near our house. It was complete luck that it was a judo academy. It was run by a woman and was relatively cheap. I knew Tulika could at least spend two hours a day there,” said Amrita.

Initially meant for just daycare, Tulika found a home as a judoka.

There is further to the tale. 

Tulika's progress as a national-level player was happening in fits and starts. The mother and daughter pestered Yashpal Solanki, the best Judo coach in the country, to coach Tulika. 

Solanki had joined SAI in Bhopal. Tulika, with her mother’s support, followed. For Amrita, it was a simple decision. “When I was a young girl, I was the first in my family to get a job and become independent. When Tulika said she wanted to go to a different city to pursue her judo, I couldn’t say no.”

As Tulika’s judo career blossomed, her expenses rose, and Amrita, a single parent, kept paying from her salary, even withdrawing money from her PF. 

Finally it all came to fruition, but Tulika missed the Gold by a whisker. She is very unhappy about it. 

Her coach believes that she has it in her to win Gold at the Asian Games, a far tougher arena. 

That would be sweet redemption for Tulika, and her mother Amrita.
