There is always a complaint from the football fans who follow the UEFA Champions League religiously that Manchester City always gets an easier group Years have passed on and the complaint still carries forward In the history of Manchester City s Champions League fixtures they have never faced a stiff competition The trend has continued this year as well as they are drawn along with the likes of Borussia Dortmund Sevilla and FC Copenhagen Manchester City are in fine form and their bench makes the matter worse for the opposition The team has a huge number of stars which makes life difficult for the strongest sides as well We expect them to top the group stage in UEFA Champions League which leaves the room for Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla to claim their stake at the second position Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla have started the campaign on contrasting notes in their respective leagues Borussia Dortmund are in the top four in Bundesliga with points whereas Sevilla are struggling with a solitary point in the league Sevilla have just a draw and three losses to their name in the four games that they played this season The final team of the group FC Copenhagen also are struggling in their league to gain the points They have already played eight games and just have points to their name In the title race they are four points off the first placed team This leaves the competition open for all the teams for the second spot FC Copenhagen can surprise the opposition but their chances of qualifying for Europa League or knockouts remain difficult as we expect Sevilla and Borussia Dortmund to renew their vigor in the continental showdown Predicted group stage finish Manchester City Borussia Dortmund Sevilla FC Copenhagen
