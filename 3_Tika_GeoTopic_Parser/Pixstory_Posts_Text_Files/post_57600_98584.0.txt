Who would not be a fan of at least one of the heroes marvel (or maybe all of them) Marvel created.
Marvel movies have a different fanbase in Hollywood, and it has genuinely taken all the applause in recent years. It never halts to startle the audience with its created heroes.
The wave of films that took the heart of many people began in 2012 when Marvel Studios brought together six heroes from four franchises.
Since it is the time to celebrate the most important name and the movie in Marvel's universe, Marvel's The Avengers, people are filled with rapture.

The movie stars Jeremy Renner and Mark Ruffalo celebrated the tenth anniversary of the 2012 blockbuster.
Bruce Banner posted a clip on Twitter of the iconic scene in the movie " I'm always angry", in which he is transformed into Hulk. Ruffalo accompanied the clip with a message noting "what a true honour it has been to be a part of the MCU"
A decade has passed since this piece of Marvel movies was divulged to the audience. People were awestruck then, and they're even now. But, unfortunately, nothing else seemed to be changed then the far more craze for the movies and the whole franchise.

The variety and choice of the heroes it made have never been compromised, neither now nor then.
Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, once said, speaking of variety in his movies, “I’ve always believed in expanding the definition of what a Marvel Studios movie could be. So we try to keep audiences coming back in greater numbers by doing the unexpected and not simply following a pattern, mould or a formula.” 
This would be a secret of never ceasing to create a masterpiece.
