Roddur Roy, a Vlogger who was detained by the Kolkata Police in Goa on Tuesday for allegedly abusing West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and his nephew and TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, was brought before a Bankshall court on Thursday and remanded in police detention for five days. 

Roddur, whose real name is Anirban, was taken to Kolkata on a transit remand from Goa on Wednesday night and placed in the Lalbazar prison.

"He was taken into jail by the police until June 14," a source stated. Roy stated that he was not a "criminal" as he walked out of the courtroom.
