This is Malistan district of Ghazni province; Where the harsh nature has made those winter games and pastimes very few.

However, one of the advantages of this nature is the long and snowy winter. In late winter, when the snow freezes, children freeze with their hand-made tool called a "printing plane."

This entertainment, which is usually done in groups, is one of the traditional pastimes of this region and neighboring areas.

This winter, even though it is snowing a little, the children are taking advantage of this little opportunity.
