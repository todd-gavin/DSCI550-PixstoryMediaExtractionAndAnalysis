Mudbound happens in the backdrop of world war 11. A time when the ‘coloured’ people were entering and leaving through back doors. What I love about this movie which earned four Oscar nominations is its natural flow of incidents. Each scene carries a strong, non-preachy note about the times. It’s shocking but less dramatic.

Two families - a black and a white happened to share the same patch of a farm in rural Mississippi. Only after moving in there, Henry McAllan realizes the house he bought was given to another tenant. He makes a temporary hut for his family. Bearing the constraints of the new place was tough for his sharp father Pappy and wife Laura. She worried about her girls. Smell of mud was very new to her.

Mudbound’s characters grow toiling through the mud. Don’t pick your slot for entertainment. It’s a bit grey. All beautiful shots are infused with natural dark tones. Whether black or white, people are soaked in mud. Some wish for a core clean-up, some don’t.

Henry is a farmer. His first priority is his business. As his father puts in he is thick to understand many things happening at his own house. Jamie’s entry was a relief to Laura. He is the kind of guy who can create an effect in women. The war-torn pilot is too fragile inside. You would love this character effortlessly portrayed by Garrett Hedlund. When his father and brother keep apartheid towards ‘coloured’ he makes a beautiful bond with Ronsel, another army man just returned alive from the war.. Young Ronsel is stewing over being treated as a mere nigger back home. He was a respected figure on the war front.

Florence is the most beautiful woman in Hap’s family. How strikingly she understands each member of her family and Laura, the white woman she serves. She never slips. Grounded and sober all the time. Hap is conscious of the plight of his men but willing to wait for the dawn. 

The unique portrayal of this black family grabs the soul of this movie rather the purpose.
