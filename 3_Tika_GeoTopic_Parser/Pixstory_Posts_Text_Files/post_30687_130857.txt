Casemiro&#39;s farewell to the Real Madrid club with which he grew up and won everything was celebrated today in a press conference. The Brazilian did not hide his tears in front of an equally moved Carlo Ancelotti but explained why he decided to say yes to the court of Manchester United The choice to go to United didn&#39;t come so suddenly it had matured for some time I felt that a cycle had ended for me here and I said this to the president the day after the Champions League final He asked me to think about it by making an appointment after the holidays I came back and I hadn&#39;t changed my mind The Red Devils are not going through the best moment in their history but also for this Casemiro says he is more motivated than ever I feel like a year old I can&#39;t wait to start I would play against Liverpool tonight I&#39;m going with incredible enthusiasm I leave the biggest club in the world the most demanding club in the world here when you win the Liga and the Champions League the following year you have to win the Liga and the Champions League again but I&#39;m going to a huge team that maybe not now but in the future it will certainly be able to compete again with Real Madrid Madrid Anyone who says I leave for money doesn&#39;t know me. If I had wanted to earn more, I would have left years ago
