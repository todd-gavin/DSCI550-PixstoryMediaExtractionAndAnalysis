The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says the number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights abuses and harassment has risen to more than 100 million for the first time.

The head of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grande, called the 100 million mark a huge and alarming figure.

According to new figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the number of displaced people worldwide will reach 90 million by the end of 2021.

Now, with a new wave of violence and conflict in countries such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Myanmar, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, $ 10 million has been added.

The United Nations says that in addition to the displaced worldwide, 8 million people have been displaced this year and more than 6 million more have been displaced by the Ukraine war this year alone.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grande, says the figure should serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent devastating conflicts, end persecution and address the root causes of displacement so that innocent people are no longer forced out of their homes. Escape yourself.

According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the 100 million displaced people make up more than one percent of the world's population, equal to the population of the world's 14th most populous country. This number includes asylum seekers and more than 53 million internally displaced persons.

The UN official added that humanitarian aid was a relief, not a cure, and that reversing the process could only lead to peace and stability, which could prevent innocent people from being endangered and deported.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will publish its annual report on June 16, which is a comprehensive collection of global, regional and national information on forced displacement in 2021 and information up to April 2022.
