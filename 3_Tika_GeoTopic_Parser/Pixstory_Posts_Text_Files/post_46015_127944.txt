I am so glad finally someone said it While the idea of the show may be good the execution was bad There were too many plot holes For instance as various Reddit users point out it is totally unreasonable and a waste of time to vote to end the game after the first game Statistically votes are typically cast in the range for most topics nevertheless if you consider participating in a game in which you could lose your life the idea of a perfect split seems absurd It would have been more surprising and realistic if they had shown the majority of people returning to the games after voting to leave in large numbers Moreover as another user says if players can easily kill each other at night what s the point of the games It interferes with the actual games because players can sleep soundly which lowers their performance and it already defeats the purpose of having games This was stupid because the point of everyone having a chance is to overcome the challenge not to randomly kill people
