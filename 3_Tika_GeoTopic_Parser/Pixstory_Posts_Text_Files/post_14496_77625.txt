Chinese researchers have detected a new type of coronavirus among bats in South Africa While research claims it has latent ability to mutate the World Health Organisation has said its potential needs further clarity According to scientists from the Wuhan University in China NeoCov can penetrate human cells in the same way as SARS CoV It is the closest relative to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV It is only one mutation away from becoming dangerous for humans researchers said in a paper posted on preprint website bioRxiv and not peer reviewed yet However according to the WHO the question of whether the NeoCov coronavirus recently discovered in bats in South Africa poses a threat to humans requires further study Whether the virus detected in the study will pose a risk for humans will require further study the health body was quoted as saying to TASS news agency The WHO added that it works closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health OIE the Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO and the UN Environment Program UNEP in order to monitor and respond to the threat of emerging zoonotic viruses The WHO told TASS that its experts were aware of this research and thank the researchers for sharing their findings in a preprint Animals particularly wild animals are the source of more than per cent of all emerging infectious diseases in humans many of which are caused by novel viruses Coronaviruses are often found in animals including in bats which have been identified as a natural reservoir of many of these viruses the global body said The Chinese scientists said that they unexpectedly found that NeoCoV and its close relative PDF CoV can efficiently use some types of bat Angiotensin converting enzyme ACE and less favourably human ACE for entry The study demonstrates the first case of ACE usage in MERS related viruses shedding light on a potential bio safety threat of the human emergence of an ACE using MERS CoV with both high fatality and transmission rate Read more
