Nigeria was eliminated from the World Cup for the eighth time following a 1: 1 stalemate with West African rival Ghana. 

Ghana's Black Stars held the three-time African champions to a goalless draw in Kumasi on Friday March 25, advancing to Qatar thanks to an away goal in Abuja. In the 10th minute, 

Ghana took the lead through Arsenal's Thomas Partey. Following a penalty granted by the video assistant referee (VAR) in the 19th minute when Ademola Lookman was hauled down by Dennis 
Odoi, Nigeria drew level. 

Captain William Troost-Ekong of the Super Eagles stepped up to tie the game at 1-1, sending the Ghanaian goalie the wrong way. Fans gathered at various viewing locations, waiting for a second goal that never materialised.

He added “When you look at the first half at some point, they were trying to catch up but then it is still very disappointing”. 

As the game progressed, the much-needed goal failed to materialise, resulting in the Black Stars qualifying on the away goal rule. Nigeria has failed to qualify for the World Cup for the second time; the first time was in 2006, when the Italian national side, known as the Azzurri, won the tournament in Germany. The Super Eagles' failure to secure a spot in Qatar 2022 came 
as a shock to football aficionados. 

Africa will be represented in Qatar by Ghana, Cameroon, Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia. The West Africans will be making their fourth World Cup appearance, their first since 2014, while the Super Eagles will have to wait until 2026, when the World Cup will be hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
