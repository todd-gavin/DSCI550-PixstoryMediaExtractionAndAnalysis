We've been blessed with heaps of aesthetically pleasing beauty in the nature around us. From flowers at their full bloom to the first showers of the season, from autumn hues to winter sunshine, there is so much to be grateful for. The preservation of this natural beauty is at risk, with problems like climate change dictating nature's ways.
