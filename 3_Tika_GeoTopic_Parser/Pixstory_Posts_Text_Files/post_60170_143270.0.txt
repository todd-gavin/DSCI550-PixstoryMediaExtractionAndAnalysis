On the Secunderabad-Visakhapatnam Duranto Express, a woman who was expecting a baby received assistance from a medical student. While travelling, the pregnant woman went into labour, and the medical student who was travelling with her in the same compartment acted quickly to help.
In the early hours of Tuesday, the woman was travelling from Srikakulam when she began experiencing severe pains near Anakapalli. K Swathi Reddy, 23, of Narasaraopeta, who was also on board, assisted her in giving birth to the child right away while the train was still moving.
The mother and child's family members were relieved to learn that they were okay, and they all applauded the student who had prevented their lives on board the train.
