Opportunities
Frank Lampard now has an opportunity with this set of players to really implement his style of play and philosophy on the side. He has appeared to get the best out of Gordon and he will hope to improve the other younger plays in the squad. If Everton finish in the top 10 comfortably, this will be a significant improvement on last season. Experience in defence will help Everton concede less goals and it seems Jordan Pickford has also regained some good form which is a positive sign. Everton fans should not expect any fireworks this season but they should expect a comfortable season where they can clearly identify a style of play and direction when they watch their side.
Threats
A big threat to this squad is injuries. Everyone saw the immense negative impact Dominic Calvert-Lewins’s injury had on the team and Lampard will hope his key players stay fit, especially the new signings. This is due to the lack of experience and options Everton would be left with.
