The second division of English football reaches a heated conclusion as two clubs compete for a
place in the Premier League.

Each season, the Champions League final may be the highlight of European football as some of
the finest teams in the world clash, but it is not always the most lucrative.

The Championship play-off final at Wembley is the most commercially significant match apart
from the scrutiny of European eyes.

Although it is the second division of English football, the victorious side will be awarded a
position in the Premier League, which comes with a slew of advantages.

The teams who play in England's top division share billions of pounds, with equal broadcast
fees and merit-based prizes assuring a reasonably even distribution of riches.

It's no surprise that the Championship play-off final is labeled "The Richest Game in Football" on
occasion.

Championship play-off final could increase in revenue by up to £135 million ($167m) to £265
million ($328m), depending on whether a promoted team can avoid immediate relegation.

Official figures for the 2020-21 season showed that more than £2.5 billion ($3bn) was distributed
among the 20 clubs in the Premier League.

Championship clubs were guaranteed a total of £84.8 million ($105m) per team, regardless of
position. Of that, each club was guaranteed at least £47.5m ($58.8m) in international TV and
£5.9m ($7.3m) in central commercial payments.

Clubs were also given merit payments ranging
from £1.7m ($2.1m) for Sheffield United to $43.2m for Manchester City.

Being in the Premier League means you are more likely to be involved in live UK games.

This
means you also become a more attractive proposition for sponsors as well as potential revenue
streams. For example, in 2020-21 Tottenham finished seventh overall but pulled in slightly more
money overall than West Hammers because of their involvement in more live UK matches.
