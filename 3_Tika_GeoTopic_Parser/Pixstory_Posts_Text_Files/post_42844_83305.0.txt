With the final chapter 304: "The hero's tale"  Fire Force's Manga has finally came to an end. 

The World's at peace, Spontaneous human combustions have stopped and a world with less despair has be established. 

A Manga worth reading, Take some some to go through it, amazing plot and Anime adaptation is also worth it. Hopefully FIRE FORCE Season 3 will be out in 2023.
