A small endeavour to spread awareness through Tuffman Chandigarh Half Marathon - The City Beautiful's Green Run to keep the place cleaner than we find it & be a responsible runner & citizen.

All our runs since 2018 are against the use of single use plastic. It will be our best effort to pick up the litter / trash during & after the run & sending it to the concerned dumping yards ensuring #TheCityBeautiful - Chandigarh continues to live up to it's name.

Ultra Tuffman Gaurav Karjee will be taking care of the trash management on the whole race route at Tuffman Chandigarh Half Marathon on 25th September, 2022.
