Those who were planning to arrive in Qatar at the nick of time to watch the opening match of the World Cup 2022, will have to rework their travel plan as the tournament is set to be advanced by a day by FIFA. According to reports, the World Cup now could start one day earlier than scheduled with FIFA looking at a plan to let the host nation play Ecuador on November 20. The report suggested a decision could be made within days by a committee comprised of FIFA president Gianni Infantino and the heads of the six continental football bodies.
The proposal to create a 29-day tournament instead of the long-planned 28 has been favoured by Qatari officials and South American football body CONMEBOL, with talks also involving the Qatar and Ecuador soccer federations. According to original schedule, the World Cup was set to open on November 21, with the Netherlands facing Senegal in Doha. Qatar and Ecuador are also in Group A but that match was scheduled to start six hours later on the same day. The match schedule, with the official opening ceremony at the third match when Qatar was scheduled to play, was finalized after the draw was made in Doha on April 1.
The report further said, a shorter, 28-day schedule requiring four games each day during the group stage was agreed to by FIFA after talks with influential leagues in Europe which will play club games through November 13. However, a Qatar-Ecuador game involves a few players who are with European clubs and would give the host nation an exclusive day to open its tournament. The 2022 World Cup is the first in the tournamentâ€™s 92-year history to be played outside of the traditional northern hemisphere summer. The previous 21 editions were all played between late May and the end of July. The Nov. 21-Dec. 18 tournament schedule was agreed to so that European clubs could play on the Nov. 12-13 weekend before releasing their players to the 32 World Cup teams.
