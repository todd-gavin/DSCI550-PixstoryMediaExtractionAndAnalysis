Real-time imaging within the live body has been produced by a Columbia Engineering team, which might eventually replace traditional biopsies and histology. MediSCAPE is a high-speed 3D microscope capable of recording pictures of tissue structures that might assist surgeons to explore tumours and their borders without the need to remove tissues and wait for pathology findings, according to a new article published today in Nature Biomedical Engineering.
Many medical treatments, including cancer surgery and screening, require doctors to perform a biopsy, which involves cutting off small pieces of tissue so that they may be examined under a microscope. "Biopsy samples are cut out, fixed, embedded, sliced, stained with dyes, positioned on a glass slide, and inspected by a pathologist using a basic microscope in the same manner they have been for the past 100 years. This is why receiving word about your diagnosis after a biopsy might take days "Professor of biomedical engineering and radiology at Columbia University and the study's principal author, Elizabeth Hillman, Professor Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute explains.
Hillman, , has spent the last decade developing new types of microscopes for neuroscience research that can capture very fast 3D images of living samples such as tiny worms, fish, and flies to see how neurons throughout their brains and bodies fire when they move.
"It's critical to know if tissues are keeping healthy and receiving adequate blood flow throughout surgical procedures," Hillman adds. "We also recognised that if we don't have to remove (and destroy) tissues to examine them, MediSCAPE can be used for a lot more things, including answering simple inquiries like "what tissue is this?" and navigating around sensitive nerves. Both of these uses are critical in robotic and laparoscopic procedures, when surgeons' capacity to identify and interact with tissues directly is limited."
