When it comes to talking about the best rock bands of all time AC DC will undoubtedly find itself in that conversation But does it really deserve that place Probably yes They are certainly no Rush King Crimson or Pink Floyd and when it comes to writing instrumental and vocal prowess AC DC finds itself beat on almost every single parameter by many other finer bands such as Deep Purple Uriah Heep Rainbow Van Halen Scorpions Queen etc But they have a certain quality in their music that few others have and that is what has made them so famous over the years In essence AC DC is simplicity in itself Masters of structure form and rhythm AC DC have a very simple formula beat simple chords catchy hooks very basic riffs and blues base with heavy distortion accompanied by goblin like vocals They never go past the bare minimum and yet somehow they are able to innovate the most basic songs to sound the same yet pack a different type of energy and that is what draws people to AC DC But this simplicity is not bad in itself as the band embodies the true spirit of rock n roll For all said they are a true hard rock band who are only about rocking out having fun and living out life in all its flavours That may not appeal to music connoisseurs but it will certainly appeal to those looking for a big splash of fun and attitude in their music Hell almost every AC DC album sounds the same and overtime that can get weary over time but there is a certain charm in AC DC that almost can t be beat It is simple basic repetitive but nonetheless packs a good strength of its own Great stage presence massive energy massive shows theatrics rock hard attitude catchy rock numbers AC DC definitely tick all the right boxes for a true rock n roll band because what they do they do very well with few others capable on standing on par with them So while not the most original AC DC do deserve to be called one of the greatest rock bands of all time
