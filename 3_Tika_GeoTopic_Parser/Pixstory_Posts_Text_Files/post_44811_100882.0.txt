Dean Henderson hasn't had the most active of season's at United. In times where the
football has been slow, changes imminent and criticism at an all time high, the 25 year old
goalkeeper has been lost in the thick of it all.

Neither has he seen much game time this season, nor has an England call-up been a serious possibility. To fix his struggles for both
club and country, the Englishman could yet pursue a move away from Manchester United
ahead of this year's winter World Cup.

Newcastle United are said to be heavily linked to the goalkeeper. Eddie Howe has long been
interested in finding a player to provide competition to the long-serving Martin Dubravka.

Henderson returned to Old Trafford ahead of the 2020-21 season, making his way through to
the first team and making 26 appearances that season. This year though, and especially
after Ole Gunnar Solksjær's sacking, game time has plummeted. David de Gea's form,
despite United's woes — has been excellent.

Henderson offers a very different profile to the Spaniard. He is certainly not as conservative with his style, likes to come out and punch balls away or to play with the ball at his own feet.And this is all that Eddie Howe requires at Newcastle, a modern day keeper.

The Saudi-led
takeover has seen progress little-by-little, and purchasing a reliable shotstopper for the long
term is the first step towards building a solid team. The Magpies are said to be interested in
a £40 Million move for Henderson, after a January deal fell through at the last minute on
deadline day.
