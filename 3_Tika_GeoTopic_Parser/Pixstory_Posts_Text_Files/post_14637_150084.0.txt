ğŸ‘‰Remove any clothing that is covering the outer thigh of the victim. 
ğŸ‘‰Never inject an EpiPen anywhere other than the thigh. Accidental injection straight into a vein can cause death.
ğŸ‘‰Once the thigh is clear of clothing, hold the pen in your fist directly in the middle of the pen.
ğŸ‘‰Holding the pen in the middle ensures you will not accidentally trigger the pen. Once the device is triggered there is no way to use it again.
ğŸ‘‰Holding the pen in the described manner, remove the activation cap, which will be blue.
ğŸ‘‰With the activation cap removed, press the orange tip of the pen against the skin until you hear a click, which signals the needle has entered the skin. 
ğŸ‘‰Keep the pen compressed against the skin, with a firm weight for about a minute, to ensure the medication is fully released. 
ğŸ‘‰The pen itself is self-contained as far as the needle goes, so there is no worry that once the medication is spent the needle will be exposed.
