Real Madrid signed Antonio Rudiger on a free transfer this summer to bolster their backline. The reigning European champions have a pretty solid squad, with plenty of backup options. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has stated that despite the signing of Antonio Rudiger, he does not want to change the centre-back pairing from last year.

David Alaba and Eder Militao made a solid defensive pairing last season, which propelled Real Madrid to the La Liga title and the Champions League glory. Hence, it comes as no surprise when Carlo Ancelotti suggests deploying the former Chelsea defender in a new role.

Antonio Rudiger played at the left-back position for Real Madrid in the pre-season friendly against Barcelona in Vegas. Speaking after a 1-0 loss to their rivals, Carlo Ancelotti heaped praise on Rudiger, stating that the German is a very intelligent defender.

“I liked him [Rudiger] a lot. I am not crazy and he is very intelligent. He can play in that position, just as he can also change in the match with Alaba. They didn’t do so today, because it went well,” said Ancelotti.

“[Alaba] as a left-back...only when necessary. I don’t want to change the pair from last year,” he added.

Real Madrid have just kick started their pre-season campaign. Following a 1-0 loss to Barcelona, the Los Blancos will now face Club America and Juventus in the upcoming fixture.
