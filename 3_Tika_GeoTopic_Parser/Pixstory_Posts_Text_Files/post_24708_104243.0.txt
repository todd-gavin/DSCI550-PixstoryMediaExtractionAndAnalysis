Ukraine beat Scotland in the play off Semi final at Glasgow for 3-1. Final will be played at Cardiff on 05 June. 


Ukraine brought war to the field - the emotions, the fight and the energy. They showed high determination to beat Scotland and go close to getting qualified for the World Cup. Winner will join England, Iran and USA in Group B. Andriy Yarmolenko (33’), Roman Yaremchuk(49’) and Artem Dovbyk(90+5’) scored for Ukraine and Callum McGregor(79’) scored the consolation goal for Scotland. They used a jersey without name and Ukraine on their back for the match. 

Liverpool star Andy Robertson reflected on the match as “Hugely disappointing”.

“We’ve waited a long time for this game. Our performances before this game were really good, but today we didn’t really show up. Ukraine settled into the game quicker than us, and it kind of continued. We knew they were going to get tired, and that was the case, but we gave ourselves too much of an uphill battle.”

Ukraine, who didn’t play a match since November 2021, got a friendly match against German club Borussia Monchengladbach in March. They were mostly defending in the second half and Scotland were pushing for goals. Scotland lined up a pretty good team- Southampton’s Che Adams and Lyndon Dykes at forward, Aston Villa’s John McGinn, Billy Gilmour, Andy Robertson, Liam Cooper of Leeds, McTominay and Gordon of Hearts as goalkeeper. 

“To be fair, obviously everyone knows the situation in Ukraine, and every single game for us is like a final game”, Manchester City’s Zinchenko said after the match, “but we dream like a team to be at the World Cup, and we have one more game, one more final, and we need to win it, otherwise this game is going to mean anything. Wales is going to be a massive game for us.”

On the other hand, Wales lost to Poland in the Nations league match for a score of 2-1.
