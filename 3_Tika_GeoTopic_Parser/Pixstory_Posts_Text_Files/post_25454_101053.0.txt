I've been a big time watcher of KDrama and Anime and the food in it, its mouthwatering. I'm a vegetarian so there isn't a huge variety of dishes that I can eat but I still like it a lot.
I've not gotten the chance to try Japanese food yet, except for sushi.
But as for Korean, I did try it a couple of times and I love it, Kimchi, Kimbap, Bibimbap, Bulgogi, Rameyon are some of my favs. Give it a try if you ever get a chance too and if you're non vegetarian, you'll have a lot more options to try out.
