I had some problems today that I was helpless to resolve, and I despise helplessness. I was already preoccupied with upcoming exams. So I simply locked myself in a room, performed the Saitama routine ofÂ  ğŸ’¯ pushups, ğŸ’¯ squats, andÂ  ğŸ’¯ situps, and then went for a run. It helped, and it's kind of my secret weapon when I'm mentally exhausted. I physically exhaust myself, and I feel like I level up or reboot myself.
Overall, I had to level up today.
