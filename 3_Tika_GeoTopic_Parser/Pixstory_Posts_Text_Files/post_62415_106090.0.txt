I know you cannot focus on your studies and goals, and many of you are feeling anxiety, distraction also hits you.
Am i right?
Let me help you with some suggestions.
Your biggest weakness is your hormones ðŸ‘€ yes it's true. Many of you are focused on boys or girls if i am wrong let me know! 
I am not talking about everyone.

You get attracted towards opposite sex and you call it love but i call it fake attraction.
Actually you get attracted towards their personality and did you ever thought why you fall in love over and over again, i bet no one have think about it.
I am sharing this because my friend is also trapped in this condition and it is the time of his entrance exam and he cannot focus on his preparation and is actually depressed right now, i am trying very hard to help him let's pray for him but i want to help many more with my views.

I must say please please try to share your tensions with your parents if cannot talk to your parents talk to your friends, you can do something productive and can do meditation and can jog daily and the main thing you can do at your initial stage by controlling your hormones avoid porn instead of that do exercise or can join gym also trust me if you can control it you can control everything. 

If you apply these things to your life you will get the result, may be it take one month or one year i bet you will be unstoppable.
And one more thing never control your feelings and emotions just express it.
Only then your mind can be relaxed.

And if someone wants to add some more things you can.
