In a legal challenge that alleges official abuse of power, Twitter is attempting to reverse some Indian government orders to remove information from the social media network, according to a source familiar with the situation.
The American company's effort to obtain a judicial review is a component of a growing dispute with New Delhi.

Over the past year, Twitter has received requests from Indian authorities to take action regarding content from accounts that support an independent Sikh state, posts that are alleged to have spread false information about farmer protests, and tweets that are critical of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A request for comment regarding Twitter's legal action on Tuesday did not receive a prompt response from India's IT minister.

The Indian government has claimed in the past that despite being in compliance with the law, major social media companies like Twitter have refused to remove content.

The source said that Twitter did not specifically state which removal orders it wanted to be reviewed, but that Twitter contends in its request for a judicial review that some of them did not meet the procedural standards of India's IT laws.
