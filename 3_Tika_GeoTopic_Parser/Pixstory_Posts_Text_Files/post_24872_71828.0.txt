NASA has discovered a super large planet outside our solar system thanks to volunteers interested in astronomy and inquiring about celestial objects. This exoplanet is three times the size of Jupiter and orbits the Sun at a distance of 379 light-years. A star with the same mass as our Sun orbits the super-Jupiter.


The discovery was made possible by a group of "citizen scientists" who analysed data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, according to NASA (TESS). NASA periodically makes data from its telescopes available to citizen scientists so that they might learn more about the universe beyond our solar system.
