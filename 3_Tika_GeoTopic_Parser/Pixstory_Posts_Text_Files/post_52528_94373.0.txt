The spring summer season has arrived and we have some latest trends that has come into existence as the Spring Summer Fashion Trends for 2022.
We will be listing out some trends which are going to be in high popularity throughout the season. one of the most wearable trends to come out of this round of runways was the pleated skirt, and while there was a light scattering of mini incarnations reminiscent of this summer's favourite tennis skirt, for SS22 it's all about the pleated midi. Other than that, there really are no rules. Printed, plain, colourful, monochrome, paired with knits or paired with a bralette – as long as it's pleated then you're bang on the money.This season sees a new way to do metallic spangle without the need for sequins – which are often very damaging to the environment. Instead, may we encourage you to get your shine via liquid metal sheens; a far subtler, more grown-up and contemporary take on shimmer. Predominantly – but not exclusively – found in golds and silvers, these sheeny dreams create a molten metal feel as luxurious, shimmering fabric appears to be falling around your body.Perhaps a trend best-suited to those looking to have fun with fashion again after spending the best part of two years wearing tracksuits, super sheer fabrics will have a real moment in the sun this spring. Of course, they can be cleverly layered to protect modesty, rendering this trend one of the most flexible for SS22.Pleated skirts may be midi for this season, but all others are raising the hemlines to minuscule lengths. These are minis that the supermodels of the '90s would've been proud to wear, with well over half of the thigh exposed beneath the brief slip of fabric. Opt for super-statement shades, prints or fabrics to ensure that while the skirt may be small it still packs a real punch. The trend list will be a bit longer and we have our second chapter for this article. Stay tuned and keep following the trends
