Saturday saw Chelsea kick-off their Premier League campaign with a trip to Goodison Park to face Everton, a ground they had failed to win at since 2017.

A stoppage time penalty at the end of the first half from Jorginho was enough to decide the result, with the Blues travelling back to London with three points to their name.

Sterling, Koulibaly and Cucurella all featured during the match, and Thomas Tuchel will be pleased with their respective contributions against the Toffees.

Having previously played for Liverpool, Sterling faced a hostile reception against Everton but it was clear to see that the atmosphere did little to faze him.

The 27-year-old, who signed from City, brought fresh pace and drive to the Chelsea attack, something that they arguably lacked at points last season.

He did well to hold off challenges from multiple defenders and was unlucky not to have scored on his debut, with his tap-in from close range being correctly ruled out for offside.

Koulibaly spent eight seasons at Napoli and emerged as one of Europe’s top centre-backs during his time at the club.

He has now arrived in the Premier League with a point to prove but if his first appearance is anything to go by, then the Senegal captain should be just fine.

Slotting in on the left hand side of the back three, Koulibaly did well to limit Everton’s chances.

The centre-back was also the one who played the ball through to Ben Chilwell before he won the penalty towards the end of the first half, proving he can rise to the occasion at both ends of the pitch.

Despite his move from Brighton only being announced on Friday afternoon, Cucurella played his first minutes for Chelsea late on in the win.

He came on to replace fellow new signing Koulibaly with 15 minutes to go, but did well in his limited time on the pitch.

Chelsea did well, considering how their attack wasn't their best feature in the last season!
