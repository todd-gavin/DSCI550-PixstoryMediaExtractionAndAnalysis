Fazlehaq FekratIn a country where there is peace and tranquility people hardly value it but in a war torn country like Afghanistan people yearn for that elusive peace It has been almost over years of war murder killing and the people have suffered immensely Without peace life has no meaning at all It can only be done with peace we will not get anywhere with war everyone knows that the war continues in Afghanistan there is no peace Everyone lives in a very different atmosphere None other than Afghans understand the value of peace very well peace is like a living water it is the water of life to all the people of the world especially to those from Afghanistan Although they have seen and are still seeing the war Without peace it is not possible to live anywhere even if there is they are just breathing it is just breathing peace is everything peace is the cause of progress and progress in a country My message is that one day there will be peace and tranquility in Afghanistan but with the existence of these forces that currently rule in Afghanistan it is impossible for peace to come about It is still the beginning of wars young people are being killed every day the war fronts have started because of him I don t think peace will come so easily in Afghanistan There is only one way for the countries of the world to help the people of Afghanistan don t put pressure on the Taliban otherwise the Taliban will rule they can do whatever they want Millions of people are unemployed whether it is in the government or in the civil institutions of all peopleFrom an economic point of view Afghanistan is stuck in a very miserable situationYou see through the media and websites and television in Afghanistan that the situation is very bad you see that a teacher comes to sew shoes on a road this is out of necessity Fekrat is an Afghan reporter storyteller poet and painter To be continued
