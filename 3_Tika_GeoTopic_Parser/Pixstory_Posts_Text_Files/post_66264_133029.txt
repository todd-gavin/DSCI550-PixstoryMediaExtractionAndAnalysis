 Ask any racer Any real racer It don t matter if you win by an inch or a mile Winning s winning Dom An undercover cop infiltrates a gang of hijackers who are also street racing enthusiasts This film was the Citizen Kane of movies for my generation of boy backs in nbsp It was Need for Speed come to life nbsp Everybody was talking about it cars chicks guns sex violence nbsp What else did you need nbsp Having not seen it since all those years ago I was hoping it would hold up years later and for the most part it did but it also very much a movie of its time nbsp The dialouge the dress sense nbsp the attitude the cars it s all very styles nbsp Some of the car lingo used in this film I haven t heard for years BUT most of the time the dialouge is straight foward enough to follow and doesn t sound silly nbsp The car racing isn t as exciting as it once was being this is the first film in the franchise you would probably expect that nbsp The racing is often just a straight line and consists of pushing the nos button and then characters slamming their heads back against a head rest as it kicks in nbsp Not that exciting anymore and even the cars didn t look as flash as I remember bar one or two nbsp There is plenty of plot holes and hardly any intelligence on offer but it is stylish and has enough action and suspense that your kept intrigued nbsp The failed truck hijack scene and subsequent reveal of Brian as an undercover cop nearer the end of the film were pretty well done suspenseful scenes for a silly movie really nbsp I did have to laugh though at the stunt doubles who in K standout like a sore thumb as looking nothing like their counterparts Paul Walkers stunt double looks to be years older and has a huge receding hairline Final Verdict nbsp This is a true example of a boys popcorn flick Turn your brain off sit back and just go with it nbsp It s not smart but it is fun
