Hey One of my hobbies is to listen to music Music practically is a combination of sounds and words but it is never a random combination It is a combination that is made to touch a person s soul It holds the power to make a person sad at his happiest or happy at his saddest or nbsp even happier at his happiest Music can bring both peace and chaos It can help you heal or help you self sabotage Thank you
