These mental health habits can help you become more resilient and happy.
Humans were born social beings, so making social networks is ingrained in them. Besides using phone calls or other social media platforms, try to meet in person; spending time with people, especially those you love, can boost your mood.
Staying active is another way to boost your energy and make your brain happy.
 Regular exercise or activity can significantly impact your mental and emotional health, relieve stress, improve memory, and help you sleep better.
Yoga, mindfulness, meditation and deep breathing can help reduce overall stress levels.
Eating a healthy diet also affects.
Foods that can support your mood include fatty fish rich in omega-3s, nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews and peanuts), avocados, beans, leafy greens (spinach, kale and Brussels sprouts), and fresh fruit such as blueberries.
Try to find meaning and purpose in your life by doing relevant things.
Engage in work that makes you feel useful, invest in relationships and spend quality time with people who matter to you, and volunteer, which can help enrich your life and make you happier.
