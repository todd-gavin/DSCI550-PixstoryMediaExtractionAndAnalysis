Sevilla and Borussia Dortmund met each other at Signal Iduna Park last night in the Champions League group stage match The match ended in a draw with both sides sharing points Under their new manager Jorge Sampaoli Sevilla looked far more comfortable than they had been in the past few weeks and the transition has been smooth so far Sevilla s Ivan Rakitic came close to scoring twice in the first minutes The first one was a yard attempt and the second one was from inside the box where he skied a perfectly placed pass from Jesus Navas However moments later it was a set piece by the same Ivan Rakitic that led to Sevilla taking the lead His curling freekick was beautifully headed into the back of the net by centre back Tanguy Nianzou Dortmund s starboy Jude Bellingham levelled the scores at the mark However it was the joint ventures of Dolyen Malen and Thomas Meunier that actually led to the goal Bellingham has now scored goals in matches in the Champions League this season He could score his second goal just four minutes after that but his long ranger effort was just too high Erik Lamela got the best chance of the match in the second half through a corner but hit it straight at the goalkeeper It was Sevilla s best bet to get the full three points from the match Both sides played equally well and it was a well deserved tie However with this Sevilla s knockout hopes are almost over They will also have to battle it out with FC Copenhagen for the Europa League spot Sevilla have three league matches to play before taking on Copenhagen in their next UEFA Champions League group stage match That is going to be a do or die match for them
