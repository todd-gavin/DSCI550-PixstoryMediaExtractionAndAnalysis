Sonia Gandhi remains as the party president after a 4-hour CWC meet. Is this the nepotism of the party so deep that it is difficult to make changes? 
‌
‌Gandhis still remains as the pillars that hold the party together. Congress party doesn't seem to have confidence without the Nehru family. Many leaders agree to the fact that the party will split up with the Gandhis.
‌
‌‌Everyone can agree on the fact that Gandhis are important but they aren't enough. In fact it's a flaw that their presence in every decision urges to call back nepotism. So more participation and changes should be made so that people feel that Congress is approachable and capable of change.
‌
‌‌‌Congress party needs a rejuvenation because it is the only party that still has a chance against BJP on a national level.
‌
‌ To implement something, it is important to tighten one’s reign in the Congress.

 Members with high potential like Shashi Taroor should come in the forefront, he had been the MP of Thiruvananthapuram since 2009, this is the greatest evidence for the faith people has in him. Moreover the support he has in social media, where people actually could approach him with the issue is impeccable. He was India's most-followed politician on Twitter until 2013, when he was overtaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

 Moreover, more active roles should be given to Young Turks like Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mevani, Hardik Patel and others.
