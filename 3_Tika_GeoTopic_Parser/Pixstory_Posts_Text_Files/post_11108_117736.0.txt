We can not change what happens in life ,but it is within our power to decide how to deal with it . Some things are simply out of our control, whether we like it or not. It’s a waste of time and energy to fight things that are out of our control—so why fight things that you cannot change? Instead of feeling helpless or frustrated, it’s better to accept reality.

You must accept that some things are out of your control. You don’t have to like it, condone it, or agree with it, but you must accept the situation for what it is. Even if your situation is terrible, the first step in improving it is acknowledging it for what it is. Understanding, accepting, and working with reality is both practical and purposeful. Acknowledging your reality will help you choose your dreams wisely and then help you achieve them. You can’t improve something you don’t fully accept first.

Acceptance is experiencing life fully without resistance. You stop trying to change what you can’t control. And, instead, focus on what you can: yourself. Acceptance helps us neutralize frustration. It gives us permission. Instead of getting stuck fighting reality, we jump into action. When we accept ‘what it is,’ we gain clarity — we focus on what’s under our control.

Acceptance requires courage — you must confront, not avoid, yourself. We must get past the ‘like-dislike’ reactive relationship with reality. We cannot control many things in life, but we can control how much love we embrace in our lives
