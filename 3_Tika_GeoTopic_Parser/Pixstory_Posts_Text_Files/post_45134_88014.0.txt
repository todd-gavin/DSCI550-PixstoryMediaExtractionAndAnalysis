Winning games in the UEFA club tournaments' crown jewel is a lucrative business.

The financial incentives of the Champions League are an important component of the season-to-season strategy of the world's best clubs.

Reaching the group stage of UEFA's flagship club competition is worth millions of euros and can turn a smaller club's fortunes around overnight.

Of course, the overall award is determined by how many games a team wins and how far they advance.

What is the prize pool for the Champions League champions in 2021-22?

Winning the Champions League final is worth €20 million (£17 million/$22 million), while losing the final is worth €15.5 million (£13 million/$17 million).

However, the total prize money awarded to the winner is significantly more, as incentives are earned each round based on performance.

Winner (€20 million)

Runner-up (€15.5 million)

Semi-finalist (€12.5 million)

Quarter-finalist (€10.6 million)

Last 16 (€9.9 million)

Group-stage win (€2.8 million)

Group-stage draw (€930,000)

Qualifying for group stage (€15.64 million)

Third qualifying round (€500,000)

Second qualifying round (€400,000)

First qualifying round (€300,000)

According to the most recent numbers, a single group stage victory is worth €2.8 million (£2.4 million/$3 million), while a draw is worth €930,000 (£783k/$1 million).

If a team competes from the group stage onwards and wins every match in the group stage before going on to win the entire competition, they will receive €69.8 million (£59 million/$77 million) in prize money.

For those competing in the most prestigious continental championships, there is also the issue of television revenue to consider.

The pot is worth roughly €292 million (£246 million/$323 million), and it is distributed among the teams based on their relative market value and previous performances.

When those revenues are combined to the winnings of a victorious team, the total earnings exceed €85 million (£72 million/$94 million).

Qualification for the competition is valued €3.5 million (£3 million/$4 million), with the winning team receiving an additional €1 million (£842k/$1.1 million).
