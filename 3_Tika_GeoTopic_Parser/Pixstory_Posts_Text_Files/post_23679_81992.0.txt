It was the schooling barracudas at Blue Corner, Palau, in the western Pacific, that grabbed Yung's attention while diving in the turquoise seascape.

He had been swimming with them for four days, but their formation constantly changed shape and he could not find the perfect angle.

On the fifth day his luck changed when the fish seemed to accept him into the group.

Surrounded by the barracudas, he started to imagine how one fish sees another while swimming, and this was the picture he wanted.

The fish were fast, and he had to swim hard to keep his place in the school.

At the end of an exhausting 50 minutes, he got his perfect 'fish eye' view.

Equipment used: Canon EOS-1D X Mark II + EF 11--24mm f4L USM lens; 1/250 sec at f14; ISO 400; Seacam housing; Seacam Seaflash 150D.
