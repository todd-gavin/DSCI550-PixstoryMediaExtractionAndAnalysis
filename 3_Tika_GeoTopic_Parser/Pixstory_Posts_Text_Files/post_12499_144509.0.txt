Marwan Al Suwaidi, a 280kg patient who recently underwent bariatric surgery at NMC Royal Hospital in Abu Dhabi, doctors performed a full mental assessment before his operation.
Doctors there said he had been living with depression, and that it was not uncommon in morbidly obese patients who had given up hope of living a normal life.
While a healthy body mass index is suggested by doctors to range between 18 and 25, a BMI over 40 is considered a potential candidate for bariatric surgery.
Obese people are increasingly considering bariatric surgery as an easy means to reduce excess body fat.
 Researchers concluded that there was a greater need for more engagement from primary care providers in the mental health screening of patients. They also said there should be more early intervention by doctors and referrals of obese patients, especially those patients seeking or pursuing bariatric surgery, to specialist facilities.
