The first names that come to mind when someone says Mount Everest are of Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary but were they indeed the first to reach the summit?
George Mallory an English mountaineer most known for his answer to the question "Why he wishes to climb Mt Everest" by saying "Because it's there" might just have been the first to reach the summit.
Mallory had been part of three English expeditions in 1921,1922 and 1924 and had got extremely close to achieving the ultimate goal. However he was not able to make it back to tell his tale. 
Little was known about whether they made it to the top or not until his body was discovered in 1999. Before climbing he had promised his wife that he will put a photo of hers at the summit. After his body's discovery when it was checked whether he had the photo ot not it was found that he didn't. Does this mean that he reached the summit?
After two failed summit attempts he has said it multiple times that at this expedition he will not come back unsuccessful. "I will not come back unsuccessful" - George Mallory. Did his dedication to succeed in his third attempt prove to be his undoing? Did he exceed his own physical limitation to achieve the ultimate accomplishment of climbing Everest? 
Perhaps we will never know the answer to these questions. But these will remain questions that will continue to fascinate the mountaineering community.
