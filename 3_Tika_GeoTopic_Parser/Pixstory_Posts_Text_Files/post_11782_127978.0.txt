The vagina is a delicate ecosystem, and it's important to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in this area. The composition of the vaginal microbiome plays a role in vaginal, reproductive and maternal health. 

Dysbiosis of the vaginal flora can play a large role in infertility, frequent miscarriage, endometriosis, pre-term birth, frequent
urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, vaginismus and vagino-vulval itching and discomfort.

A healthy vaginal microbiome can help:

* Prevention of yeast infections - supporting beneficial bacteria can help to prevent the overgrowth of yeast in the vagina, which can lead to yeast infections. 
*  Relief from symptoms of a yeast infection - If you do develop a yeast infection, probiotics can help to relieve the symptoms.
* Prevention of bacterial vaginosis - supporting beneficial bacteria can help to prevent the overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina, which can lead to bacterial vaginosis.
* Relief from symptoms of bacterial vaginosis - If you develop bacterial vaginosis, probiotics can help to relieve the symptoms.
