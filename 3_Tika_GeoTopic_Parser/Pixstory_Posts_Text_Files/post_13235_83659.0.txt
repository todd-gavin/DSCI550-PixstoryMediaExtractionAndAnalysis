Laying nestled in my hand a promise to another land
Bedecked within in its silver screen lay places I have never seen
These places have the sweet allure of honest people hearts so pure
It’s possible I tell my mind, 
my dreams await within to find
What lies within I tell myself must be a place of righteous wealth
Plunging in with shining eyes I pray my dreams be realized
When finally, I am inside and finding others writing lines
Of text, and people posting scenes I want included in my dreams

Seeking paths to education, people come from every nation
Or searching for a boy or girl, to enervate their social whirl
I take the bait and dive right in, join the fun by writing things
Then all at once I’m not quite sure, of what it is I’m looking for

People in there share a feeling, taking me from floor to ceiling
Could this be real and is it true, have I found my Xanadu
There’s people round who always say, hey you look out, no place to play
They say that there behind the screen, are only traps and fool’s chagrin
I’m not worried I’m inside; I’m feeling strong I’ll take the ride
I’ll climb the giddy heights within, 
And search inside the things they say, and show them there’s a better way
For if they like me I’ll be hot, and if they don’t I guess I’m not

And so, begins the path in here, enunciating phrases clear
Soon posting words with asterisks to indicate the ones they’ve missed
I smile when some there try to dent, and weaken their own sweet accent
Matured from their day of birth, it’s beautiful, no thing of mirth

So when we meet we try to bless, the ones we speak with happiness
Make all things that we share and say, a bonus for another day
Accepting things are they're expressed, and deal with them in gentleness
Each person worthy of their view, our's may be different, nothing new
