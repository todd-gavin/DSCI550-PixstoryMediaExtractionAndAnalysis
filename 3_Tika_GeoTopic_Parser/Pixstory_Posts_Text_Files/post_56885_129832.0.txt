People's upbringing and surroundings develop a sense of empathy in them, but yes, we are not born with it; we learn it.

The best part about empathy is that it can be learnt and taught.
Becoming more adept at perceiving othersâ€™ emotions, learning self-regulation techniques to help us not get overwhelmed by excessive emotional resonance, and finding ways to encourage perspective-taking can build empathy in anyone.
These are some ways how we can learn it,

Work on listening to people without interrupting.

Pay attention to body language and other types of nonverbal communication.

Try to understand people, even when you disagree with them.

Ask people questions to learn more about them and their lives.

Imagine yourself in another person's shoes.

Strengthen your connection with others to learn more about how they feel
Seek to identify biases you may have and how they affect your empathy for others.

Look for ways you are similar to others versus focusing on differences.

Be willing to be vulnerable, opening up about how you feel.

Engage in new experiences, giving you better insight into how others in that situation may feel.

Get involved in organizations that push for social change.
