Up All Night may have been the album that made One Direction international sensations in but that doesn t mean all of the band members think it s a good record In a recent interview on the Smallzy s Surgery podcast Louis Tomlinson got real about his feelings toward his former band s debut project Twelve years ago today the band got formed but the first album was s t anyway he said at the very beginning of the minute episode Released the year after One Direction was formed on The X Factor Up All Night debuted at No on the Billboard Its lead single and the band s breakout hit What Makes You Beautiful hit No on the Billboard Hot while single One Thing reached No Tomlinson is now gearing up to release his second solo album which he said on the podcast doesn t have a release date as of yet The record will follow s Walls which the year old Back to You singer says was more difficult to make than his current project I ve enjoyed making this album times more than the first album he said I think there s still pressure for me to deliver a good record but there was just so many different opinions on the first album and me trying to find my feet coming out of a band the size of One Direction So I feel like I ve been able to look at this record with a bit more clarity And though Tomlinson apparently isn t a fan of all the music he and his One Direction mates made together he definitely doesn t feel the same way about the band itself A few days prior to his appearance on the podcast he revealed that he s hopeful for a reunion with Harry Styles Zayn Malik Niall Horan and Liam Payne I ll be pretty gutted if it s not like definitely he said on the Australian daytime program Sunrise What s the impossible question to answer is when I ve got no idea but I d be really really surprised if one day we didn t It would be a waste
