Gary Neville, a former Manchester United defender and well-known TV analyst, believes the criticism of Qatar hosting the World Cup is unjustified.

Many people have been critical of Qatar since it was awarded the hosting rights for the 2022 World Cup. The weather in Qatar in June and July, when the World Cup is normally hosted, was a major issue.

 Because the weather would be too hot for football, FIFA decided to move the World Cup to November and December, when the temperatures in Qatar would be significantly lower.

In addition to the scheduling shift, the fact that Qatar is not a footballing powerhouse has been mentioned as a source of concern. 

However, Neville has rejected such worries, claiming that football is a worldwide sport that is not limited to places with colder climates.

According to Neville, the 2022 World Cup, which will be the first to be staged in the Middle East, should mark the start of a new era.

"We have to have a winter World Cup every 20 years because if you say you don't want a winter World Cup, then you are saying that the Middle East is a region that should not have a World Cup," said Neville in a podcast for Sky Sports.

Neville also stated that it is a positive thing that the World Cup is being hosted by a Muslim country, as it provides an opportunity to bring people of many cultures and beliefs together. He went on to remark that Qatar hosting the World Cup in 2022 is a perfectly reasonable development.

There has also been a lot of criticism directed at the employees' welfare issues around the 2022 World Cup construction projects. Qatar had regressive labour laws in place for labourers like Kafala. However, such practises have been prohibited throughout the country, and reform initiatives have begun to be implemented
