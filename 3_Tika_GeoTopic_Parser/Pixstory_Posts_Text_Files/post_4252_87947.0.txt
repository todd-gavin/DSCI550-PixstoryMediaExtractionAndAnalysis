Whoever thought of the name Imperfecto for the pub inadvertently described the place to the T. Recently a beautiful band called Skrat was called all the way from Chennai. There was a so so opening act before the actual show and when the much awaited band started playing they brought the house down. Head banging, crowd jumping having a great time till a cop showed up and told the band to close the act. No explanation given about why a Punk Rock concert in a pub was being shut down abruptly. The management was unable to sort it out with the cops. Maybe they did not have adequate permissions to hold the concert. Whatever the reason Delhiites we’re left shame faced because the band from Chennai could not perform on their turf. Music lovers lost a evening of scintillating music. Imperfecto should get it’s act together. It’s a crying shame that their incompetence to handle things ruined so many peoples happiness that day
