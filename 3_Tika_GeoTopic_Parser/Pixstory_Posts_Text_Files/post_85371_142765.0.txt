Hello!! Namaste!!
A guy from Kathmandu here.
Living in capital cities come with challenges as they are the population hotspots.
Traffic Jams inside the Kathmandu valley has always been a topic of serious concern.Traffic jams are literally possible if you wipe the half population out. 
The major reasons for these traffic problems are the sluggish development of road infrastructure (thanks to those so-called authorities) and addition of public, private vehicles in an insane amount plus the work-shy traffic police (*terrific police).Â  
People are unwilling ready to travel by buses, transport vehicles who are carrying people like commodities. These vehicles stop recklessly wherever they wish to load and offload their passengers. And addition to that there are no train or metro services available in Kathmandu nor any parts Nepal due to its difficult land topography. 
Comming to the question, the answer is obvious; the first thing I would like to change is the traffic management of my city.
Hopeful about it in the near future!! fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž
