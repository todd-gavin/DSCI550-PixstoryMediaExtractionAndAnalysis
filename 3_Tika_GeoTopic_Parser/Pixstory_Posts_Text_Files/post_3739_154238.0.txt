By Sneha Kumari The much-awaited month-long International Cricket Council (ICC) Men's T20 World Cup is all set to commence on October 16 in Australia. As per media buyers from the top agencies, this year's ICC tournament may get a tepid response from traditional advertisers.An industry veteran who is keeping an eye on the developments in ad-spot buying noted that given the volume of cricket that has taken place recently, the interest in the game has dwindled as compared to the earlier times. “The IPL's viewership was almost 30% lower this year,” he said.Cricket is not an advertiser’s delight anymore because it has become unaffordable for the FMCG players especially, as per the veteran.For the eighth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, the Co-presenting sponsors will have to shell out Rs 1.8 crore to Rs 2 crore for 150 seconds per match, respectively.Sources told BestMediaInfo.com that the ad rates for T20 World Cup are going to be similar to IPL which is between 14-15 lakh per 10 seconds.Only top advertisers coming on board as sponsors can get a discount, the sources added.On the other hand, Krishnarao Buddha, Senior Category Head - Marketing at Parle Products, said that for IPL the rate was about Rs 15 lakh for 10 seconds, and for T20 World Cup it would be in the range of Rs 15-18 lakh per 10 seconds.While some advertisers or brands can get a better deal for sponsorship this time, the minimum cost for ad-spot buying will be between Rs 14-15 lakh. “The India-Pakistan rate will start at around Rs 20 lakh,” said the veteran. There is a huge variation when it comes to the viewership of IPL and ICC World Cup, since there is a difference in the consistency of watching. Buddha said that in IPL it doesn’t matter which team wins, unlike T20 World Cup, as the moment India goes out of the contest the interest level of the audience drops down.
