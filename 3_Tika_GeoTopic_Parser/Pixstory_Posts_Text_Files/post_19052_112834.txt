The Center Court of Wimbledon was born in Church Road in London, the central court where many important matches have been played. Many champions who have played on this grass including Roger Federer who has won Wimbledon The last appearance of the Swiss tennis player dated one year makes its own in the oldest tournament in tennis Today it has made its return to celebrate the years of the court I have been lucky enough to play so many matches at Wimbledon Central and it is strange to be here in a different role but also special to see all these champions on this court where were my greatest victories and defeats said Federer I felt and still miss Wimbledon in this year that was so difficult for me in which my knee made me suffer And then the phrase that everyone hoped he would pronounce Now I&#39;m fine not I knew how I would feel during the trip but now I&#39;m happy to be here with you and I want to come back here to play one last time
