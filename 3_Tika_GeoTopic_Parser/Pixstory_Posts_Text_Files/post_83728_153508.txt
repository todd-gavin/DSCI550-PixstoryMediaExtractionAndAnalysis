I read some Susan Sontag today and it blew my mind she has absolutely astonishing viewpoints on modern culture and her essays are so damn thought provoking that they make you want to stop and think for yourself I also wrote a post about it in which she reveals the double standard of ageing Anyway it was refreshing to take a break from studying for the exams and now I have to return to the boring same old medical books
