Kim Min Jae new Napoli signing doesn&#39;t say many words but has pretty clear ideas This is what we already understood from today&#39;s presentation I&#39;m happy to be here of the interest immediately shown Napoli said I&#39;ve already adapted and settled in this new context I&#39;m doing my best to fit into this new team The defender arrived in Naples to replace Koulibaly who moved to Chelsea Physically as good as the Senegalese but he knows he&#39;ll have to do his best not to make him regret Koulibaly an irreplaceable international player I&#39;m not replacing him and no one can do it but I will do my best to play at my best On the other hand, since arriving in Europe Kim has grown a lot from a technical and tactical point of view and believes that he will continue to do so I have had formidable growth I am happy with this but future prospects are not I can imagine them He said about his role and his characteristics I have various styles of play I think I&#39;m strong in cover I find myself better on the right side but I happened to be more on the left but it&#39;s fair to deal with this solution too I don&#39;t have major flaws characterful as far as the strong points are concerned, you have seen all the videos
