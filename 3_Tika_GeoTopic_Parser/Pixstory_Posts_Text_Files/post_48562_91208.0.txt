Black Lives Matter doesn't only save black people, it saves humanity. Racism is against christianity. The Bible affirms black lives are created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26–27), and our country has a history of dehumanizing black people. The words “black lives matter” affirm a scriptural truth about black people. Because God, through Christ, both empowers and requires us to walk in love with the power of the Spirit, we must actively fight racism as Christians. When we love our neighbours as ourselves (Gal. 5:13–14), we are walking in the Spirit. We should not exploit our newfound freedom in Christ to indulge in our sinful desires in the flesh. Those who live for the sake of satisfying their flesh will not obtain eternal life (vv. 16–21). Complicity in racism may indicate that one is enslaved to the flesh and its alluring demonic powers. Because we are new creatures in Christ, we must reject racism whenever and wherever it appears (2 Cor 5:17-21).

When black lives are dehumanised and treated as if they don't matter merely because they're black, Christians everywhere should be able to stand up and declare, without hesitation and with their Bibles open, that black lives do indeed matter, have dignity, worth, and value, just as non-black lives do.

Racism is opposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ and against God’s vision to redeem and unify creation through Christ. God recreates through Christ a diversity of different tongues, tribes, peoples, and nations into one new (but diverse) people. God commands us to live in pursuit of a reconciled community with one another and with our neighbors in anticipation of the age to come (Is. 65:17–25; Rom. 8:19–22).
