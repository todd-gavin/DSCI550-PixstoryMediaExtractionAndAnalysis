The next step for the front line of ours is to generate a peak level of output.

We forget the age of both Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka, who are in their early 20s. At this stage of their careers, they are producing impressive numbers in terms of actual goals / assist output, but they are not complete players YET.

At the moment, they average 10-15 G/A a season - give or take. Saka had his best season of output in season 21/22, whereas Martinelli is on track to have his best numbers. The likes of Sané/Sterling in the centurion City team and Salah/Mane in the title winning Liverpool team produced numbers around the 20-30 G/A mark, however they were much more complete players. That should be the target for Martinelli / Saka.

We didn’t recruit a wide-forward, so from a depth angle, we don’t quite have the effect of bringing a quality wide forward substitute to replace Gabriel Martinelli & Bukayo Saka after 70 minutes. City and Liverpool are/were good at this. The strategy for a wide-forward may have changed later in the transfer window, so we may see movement in January.

Marquinhos did shine for us in Europe, and I personally feel we have a little gem who looks physically ahead. His body type is far more ahead of any typical young player coming through, more so on the stocky side - yet looks wise on how to mix speed and his turning angles. We may have our mystery winger amongst our ranks!
