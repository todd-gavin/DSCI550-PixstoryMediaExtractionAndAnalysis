HBO's highly anticipated House of the Dragon trailer dropped on July 21, 2022, offering viewers a glimpse into several thrilling events that are expected to unfold this season.

Fans have been going berserk ever since the trailer-drop, and took to Twitter to express their enthusiasm for the show's premiere on HBO on August 21, 2022.

The series is a prequel to the iconic Game of Thrones and is set 200 years before the events of the show.

One of the highlights of the House of the Dragon trailer is Daemon Targaryen's arc. Daemon considers himself to be the new heir whilst conflicting opinions emerge. His niece Rhaenyra, daughter of King Viserys, is also among the contenders, but she faces tremendous opposition since ''No queen has ever sat the Iron Throne.''

The trailer also shows the daughter of Ser Otto Hightower - Alicent Hightower - who seems to play a crucial role in the entire battle for power since she wanted her son to be the new heir to the throne.

With several stunning action sequences to look forward to, the trailer maintains a gripping storyline, similar to Game of Thrones and viewers can expect an equally enthralling and entertaining series.
