Arsenal host th place Aston Villa in this set of midweek games with a win simply essential to make this our joint best EVER start to a Premier League season along with where we went on to come second in the league Steven Gerrard s side have been somewhat of a disappointment so far in the new campaign losing three and winning just once in their opening fixtures Despite having an impressive squad on paper their side just isn t clicking right now and whilst there is no easy game in the Premier League Arsenal should be looking to take advantage of this THE LINEUPS Arsenal will surely stick with the formation that has served us well of late I imagine Arteta will aim to make as few changes in personal as possible where injuries allow With Partey and Elneny both injured and Zinchenko a doubt Sambi Lokonga and Ben White emerge as the two more obvious options to play the deeper midfield role I would honestly be happy with either As for our opponents we can expect a strong lineup on paper Ollie Watkins and Danny Ings are great outlets and always a nuisance to defend especially with the likes of Coutinho and McGinn behind them This Villa side are not bad don t get it wrong THE GAME I can only really see this game going one way Whilst I doubt it will be as easy as many are saying with the home fans and the way we have been playing so far this season it should be a comfortable three points I do think we ll miss Partey and somewhat his understudy Elneny but this game could provide Albert Sambi Lokonga the chance to prove a lot of people wrong I hope he does well if he plays THE PREDICTION Fortunately I ll be at the Emirates to watch this one and I m hoping Mikel Arteta s boys put on a show I ve captained Jesus on Fantasy Premier League so let s go positive with a win A brace from Jesus and Saka to top it off COYG
