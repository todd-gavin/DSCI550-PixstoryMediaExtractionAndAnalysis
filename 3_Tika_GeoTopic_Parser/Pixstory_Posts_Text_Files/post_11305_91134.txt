Isoflavonoids found in soy molasses and kudzu roots have strong antioxidant and cytotoxic action according to experts When chemotherapy or surgery to remove metastases is too risky substances may be an effective ally in the battle against cancer The study s findings were reported in Plants Soy molasses and kudzu roots contain phytoestrogens that resemble the human hormone oestrogen Defeat free radicals which may harm cells and disturb the immune system by binding to and removing them from the body As a result numerous illnesses such as malignant tumours develop Plant isoflavones are efficient against human internal organ tumour formations that are dense Muscle metastases and malignant tumour cells growing rhabdomyosarcoma are best combated by soy extract whilst kudzu root isoflavones have shown strong anticarcinogenic activity against brain cancer glial cell tumour and bone and connective tissue cancer glioblastoma multiforme osteosarcoma Cell lines derived from patients with various disorders were used for in vitro research Daidzein and genistein which preserve bone tissue were shown to be the most active isoflavones in both plant extracts according to the researchers There was also biochanin A puerarin and formononetin Natural deep eutectic solvents or green solvents were employed to extract isoflavones Citric acid and choline chloride solutions were employed in the investigation Organic substances are the only ones that are safe for consumption Isoflavonoid extraction has been shown to be more efficient with this technique than with the synthetic approach Because of their medicinal qualities choline chloride and citric acid may improve the effects of isoflavones on cancer cells As Saied Abushanab describes it High performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection was used to identify phytoestrogens extracted from both plant preparations and an ultraviolet detector was used to quantify them Both qualitative and quantitative analysis may be performed using this mix of techniques according to researchers Source Ural Federal University
