 Congress crossed all limits during the first wave of the infection During the first wave of Covid you Congress gave free train tickets to migrant workers to leave Mumbai At the same time Delhi govt told migrant workers to leave the city and provided them buses As a result Covid spread rapidly in Punjab UP and Uttarakhand That s a direct quote from the PM in Lok Sabha on Monday Is it true Cast your mind back to March when a surprise lockdown of the nation was announced with just four hours notice For migrant workers who were hundreds of miles away from home and subsisting from meal to meal this announcement was devastating There was no provision made for them With their income having seemingly vanished overnight many of them had no choice but to start walking to their home villages a journey on which more than one of them died But it is not only the Govt s neglect that we have to contend with it is the fact that the Prime Minister is unabashedly lying about the role that he had to play in spreading infection as he puts it The Railways in consultation with the Union Home Ministry launched the Shramik Special service on May starting with six trains from Telangana to Jharkhand Kerala to Odisha Maharashtra to UP and MP and Rajasthan to Bihar and Jharkhand These Shramik trains on which so million migrants travelled were not equipped with food and water in many cases leaving even more migrants to die In the light of these facts there can be no doubt that whatever gross mismanagement and heedlessness was perpetuated during the first wave in India it must have been largely due to the reigning government and not to the Opposition in the light of which the PM s incendiary statement looks like distraction tactics
