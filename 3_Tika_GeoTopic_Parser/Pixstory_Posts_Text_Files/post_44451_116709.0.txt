Serie A champions AC Milan kicked off their pre-season campaign for 2022-23 today in Cologne’s Rhein Energie STADION against Bundesliga FC Köln. The match ended up being a thrilling 2-1 that was won by the Rossoneri, thanks to Olivier Giroud’s brace in the first half. The German club tried hard to make a comeback in the second half but unfortunately fell short of a goal. 

AC Milan boss Stefano Pioli went to Germany with a fairly weak squad and thus AC Milan’s playing XI lacked many big names apart from Olivier Giroud, Ante Rebic and Brahim Diaz. Although Milan was quick to bag two goals, thanks to Giroud's incredible finishing (the two goals came in the 16th and 36th minute respectively), the weak set of players in Milan’s defence allowed FC Köln players to thrive, especially in the second half. For the same reason, we witnessed the Germans dominating the game for almost its entirety. 

FC Köln had a total of 16 attempted shots compared to AC Milan’s 7 which tells us a lot about their intent. They gave it their all to nullify the two-goal lead in the second half and even scored a goal in the 86th minute, giving us hopes for a possible late drama. Unfortunately, Milan’s defence was resolute in the final minutes and they did not let Köln’s players get past. Köln also had a 51% possession in the game. 

AC Milan will be playing 3 more pre-season friendlies before the commencement of Serie A 2022-23. They will play against Zalaegerszegi on 23rd July, Wolfsberg on 27th July and Marseille on 31st July. 

The departure of Franck Kessie to FC Barcelona has been a major blow to AC Milan as he was one of their key players in their last season’s Scudetto-winning team. It will be interesting to see whether Rossoneri can fill in the void by signing a midfielder in this transfer window. Their main target in this transfer window currently seems to be Belgian forward Charles De Ketelaere.
