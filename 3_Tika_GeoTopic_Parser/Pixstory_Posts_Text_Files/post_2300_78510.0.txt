There was not a word in the speech about any cash assistance to the very poor who have been pushed into extreme poverty and suffered immensely during the last two years; not a word for those who had lost their jobs; not a word about creating jobs for those whose education stopped at some stage at the school level;  not a word about reviving MSMEs that had shut down; not a word about distributing more food to combat malnutrition and hunger; not a word about cutting indirect taxes, especially GST, to contain inflation and bring down the prices of goods; and not a word about giving tax relief to the tax-paying middle class or the tax-bearing head of a household.

By any standard, today’s budget speech was the most capitalist speech ever read by a Finance Minister. The FM has mastered the jargon of capitalist economics. Read her speech again: count the number of times she used the words digital, portal, IT-based, paperless, database, ecosystem, global,  atmanirbhar.  The word ‘poor’ occurs twice in paragraph 6, and we thank the FM for remembering that there are poor people in this country.

There are worrying macro-economic indicators: top of the list is that the fiscal deficit (FD) for 2021-22 has overshot the target of 6.8 per cent and is estimated at 6.9 per cent. For next year, it will be 6.4 per cent. That is an insufficient correction if the goal is to reach 4 per cent three years hence by 2025-26. The financing of the FD is also a matter of concern. 70 per cent of the FD in 2022-23 will be financed by market borrowing as against 55 per cent in the current year, crowding out private sector borrowing. 

The worry from the welfare angle is greater. Every key subsidy has been slashed. 

The total subsidy bill has been cut by a humongous 27 per cent. This is the “most unkindest cut” in this budget. The FM may have forgotten the poor but the poor have long memories.
