The 27-year-old Queenslander is the first female swimmer to win seven medals in a single Games. Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz, and Matt Biondi are the only men to have done it. She is now only the second woman in history to win seven medals in a single Olympics, trailing only Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya in 1952.

McKeon won the butterfly leg of the relay after winning the 50-freestyle earlier in the session, capping off an outstanding performance by the entire Australian women's team. Cate Campbell finished strong in the freestyle, setting an Olympic record of 3 minutes, 51.60 seconds to defeat America, the two-time defending champion.
