I believe that one of the most loving things you can do for someone is to put your own world view aside and truly see and feel into theirs That I believe is the essence of true listening The quality of your relationship will be determined by the quality of your communication but the quality of your communication will be determined by the quality of your listening You will gain a good listener for yourself if you are one Folks instead of wishing for one start being good listeners
