They say time and tide wait for no man but they never say that time is such a mighty thing which sometimes washes away our loved ones like the tide taking away a part of shore along with When bunny realized that even though been in any part of the world a corner in his heart still beats for Naina he came back because this time he was not ready to risk his love We sometimes stab our own feelings not because we think that the person won t reciprocate but because we think it will act as the hindrance on the way of dreams And in the process of doing so we slip out on creating beautiful memories we slip out on the feeling of love and moreover we slip out on a precious soul We are so busy with our life that we often overlook the people who care for us selflessly maybe we throw them away like tiny pieces of broken glass but we fail to realize that if kept together it creates a beautiful mosaic So sometimes it s better to confess sometimes it better to let the other person know they are special Sometimes it s better to let words and emotions win over your silence and dreams Because sometimes it s better to lose your heart and empty your feelings rather than keeping it heavy with the weight of regret Yeh Jawaani Hai Dewaani One of my all time favourite movie Tell me in notes what are your views On it
