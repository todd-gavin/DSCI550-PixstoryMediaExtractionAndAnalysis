‌American culture and liberalism are trendsetters; which brings a lot of responsibility to America. Here we see America all set to promote the drug mafia very openly. 
‌
‌The house of Representatives recently removed Cannabis from the list of banned substances; making its access easy. Cannabis is legal for adults in 19 states and for medical use in 36 states. This bill would end the federal ban, but leave legalization up to the states. The legal industry generated $25 billion in sales last year; a 43% increase over 2020 and is expected to hit $65 billion in 2030.
‌
‌The HOR focused on the matter of personal choice and public health. It is also expected to raise revenue. What about the promotion of drug culture among Americans? Openly promoting drugs reduces their seriousness among people and leads to daily use. It's not about a person's choice. The addictive element of marijuana goes beyond the choice of an individual. It affects the mental health badly that there is no longer choice but to a perilous addiction that has no escape. 
‌
‌ Marijuana being a lethal drug promotes the use of drugs and alcohol in turn increases crime rates, harms public health, curtails traffic safety, and lowers literacy among teens. It would also increase the access to drugs in children. Youth will be affected the most. Marijuana is first and foremost a drug. Using it for medical purposes is not as same as daily use or lifting its ban. Its straight effects are on cognitive ability. Marijuana use may increase the risk of depression, schizophrenia, unhealthy drug abuse, and anxiety.
‌
‌ I strictly call against the bill and hope the Senate does not pass the bill. Drug culture is not what America wants. Many say they find happiness in drugs. I say, don't focus on temporary happiness and ruin your life. Happiness and sadness are a part of life; learn to embrace them. Show that you can be happy without drugs.
