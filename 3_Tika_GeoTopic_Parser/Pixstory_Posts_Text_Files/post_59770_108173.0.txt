The administrations of flood-affected districts have issued alerts, encouraging residents to stay inside unless it is absolutely necessary or there is a medical emergency. 
The floods have affected at least 19 lakh people in 28 Assam districts, with the newly established Bajali district being the worst hit. According to officials, water levels in the Brahmaputra and Gauranga rivers were flowing above the danger limit in numerous regions.
