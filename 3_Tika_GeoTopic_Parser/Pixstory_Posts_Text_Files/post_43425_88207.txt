Coming from a convent school there were too many rules and regulations there were so many people to tell us about what not to do but unfortunately no one really told us what to do I guess it s never too late and because no one told us these things I hope this might help the kids who are still in school Participate in extracurricular activities They teach you more than books I was always an introvert student in school I thought participating in the extracurricular activities is only for the smart and the popular kids Now I wish I had participated in those activities because trust me it helps you in so many ways You learn to make new friends you learn to talk to new people you gain confidence and there are many more things that you will experience once you start taking parts in the activities outside of the classroom Enjoy your school life as much as possible You ll miss it I m sure so many people and movies have already told you to enjoy your school days and trust me on this they re all right One day when you ll get busy with life you ll barely have friends you re going to miss the days when the entire class was your buddy Don t shy away from asking questions in class Remember your teachers are there to teach and they will be more than happy to know that you are actually listening to them and wanting to learn from them When you ll grow up you ll have too many questions but no one is going to be there to answer Disrespecting your teachers will not make you cool I cannot stress this enough You probably think making fun of your teachers is fun They wake up at am everyday to teach they definitely don t deserve the disrespect Respecting and loving your teachers will surely make you the coolest Figure out what you enjoy doing This is the best time to explore your options STUDY TO LEARN NOT FOR MARKS People don t notice judge you as much as you think they do And be kind
