Pictures posted on social media show the Taliban casting a black veil over a "mother statue" at Kabul University's Faculty of Fine Arts.

This work of art by female students is a statue of a woman holding her child in one hand and holding a jar on her shoulders with the other.

A Kabul University School of Fine Arts graduate says the work was a joint project of a group of female students who created it as their "undergraduate dissertation" from the School of Fine Arts' sculpture department.

Construction of the mother statue began at the end of 2012 and was completed in 2013.
 The making of this work of art was also controversial in those years. At that time, the Faculty of Sharia opposed the construction of this work, but after many discussions, the construction of this statue was approved, provided that the statue of the mother does not have a head.

Eventually, the students of the Faculty of Arts decided to replace the statue with a jar.
