It's possible that the question of how this group came to be arises in your mind. As a result, this group did not appear out of nowhere. Its name has been somewhat modified. There was a discussion concerning the West Asia Quad in October 2021.
This virtual summit, which took place in October, brought together the foreign ministers of these three countries, including External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. At the time, the West Asia Quad was not officially recognised.

New organisations and organisations have developed over time that are transforming the global geospatial scene. These groups of four or five countries are working to make their strategic interests more effective, based on the aims of mutual collaboration and partnership.
 
I2U2 is one such group that has emerged. The United States has announced the formation of this new organisation, which includes India, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates. Israel and the United Arab Emirates are both Central Asian countries. I2 is used for India and Israel, while U2 is used for the United States and the United Arab Emirates.

This meeting has been dubbed I2U2 by the United States. This group was mentioned at the October 2021 conference, and it was stated that the four countries will be able to work together. Infrastructure, technology, marine security, and trade were among the topics tackled at the conference.
These four countries want to make better use of each other's strengths. Clearly, India's influence in the Middle East will grow more than ever with this group, and its strategic interests will be more secure.
