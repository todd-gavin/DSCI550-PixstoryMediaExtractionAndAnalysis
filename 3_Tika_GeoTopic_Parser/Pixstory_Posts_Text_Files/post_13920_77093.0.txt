What seemed like a done deal is now on the verge of collapsing, or may have collapsed already by the time you read this. Adama Traore was thought to be moving to the new White Hart Lane, but may now end up at Nou Camp. Antonio Conte wanted Traore to join the squad at Spurs in a right wing-back position, something that has not interested the Spaniard much, and when Barcelona come calling, it usually is a no-brainer.


A graduate of Barcelona’s famous La Masia youth setup, Traore made his La Liga debut at the age of 17 in November 2013. The Wolves winger had also featured for Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League as he replaced Cesc Fabregas in the 82nd minute in a 2-1 defeat away at Ajax in the group stages.


With limited playing opportunities, Traore moved to England and signed for Aston Villa, and then for Middlesbrough the very next year before his performances were deemed enough to warrant a return to the Premier League, as Wolverhampton Wanderers under then manager, Nuno Espírito Santo signed Traore on a five-year-deal. A deal that ends in 18 months’ time, and recent reports coming from Molineux suggest the player has no intention of extending his stay in the Midlands.


The 26-year-old is renowned for his pace and power, but he is criticised for his end product. It was probably for the former, that Antonio Conte deemed him fit to fit in on the right flank of Spurs’ defence. Conte was hoping to use Traore’s pace to run on the right channel, but it all seemed to have gone for a toss.


Barcelona’s rebuild is well and truly on, and Traore instead of moving to London, now seems to be on his way to Barcelona, where he will sign a six-month loan deal with an option to purchase the winger for £29m. It is believed that Spurs had a £15 million bid rejected by Wolves earlier in this transfer window, and Antonio Conte will be furious to know he will have to plan a different approach, now that Traore will be taking an international flight than a domestic one.
