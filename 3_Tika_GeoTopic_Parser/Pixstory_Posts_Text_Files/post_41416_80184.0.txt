The United States has already qualified for the FIBA World Cup by virtue of winning Olympic gold. But the Americans still play in the qualifying tournament, as it is a good competitive event to help prepare for the World Cup, which runs Sept. 22-Oct. 1 in Australia.

The qualifying tournament will be played at the Mystics' Entertainment and Sports Arena. Puerto Rico will play Belgium on Thursday, then the Americans will face Belgium on Friday and Puerto Rico on Saturday.

Some of the more familiar names from USA Basketball competitions over the past several years, such at five-time Olympians Sue Bird (Storm) and Diana Taurasi (Phoenix Mercury) and four-time Olympians Tina Charles (Mercury) and Sylvia Fowles (Lynx), are still competing in the WNBA but likely will not play again for the national team.

Six former Olympians will be on the roster for the U.S. team that will take part in the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup qualifying tournament in Washington, D.C., beginning Thursday and ending Saturday.

USA Basketball finished a training camp over the weekend in the nation's capital, after which the 12-member team was named. It includes Ariel Atkins (Washington Mystics), Chelsea Gray (Las Vegas Aces) and Jewell Loyd (Seattle Storm), who were on the gold-winning 5-on-5 team at Tokyo, and Stefanie Dolson (New York Liberty), Allisha Gray (Dallas Wings) and Kelsey Plum (Aces), who were on the 3-on-3 team that won gold.

The other players on the roster are Natasha Howard (Liberty), Brionna Jones (Connecticut Sun), Kayla McBride (Minnesota Lynx) and Kelsey Mitchell (Indiana Fever), who all have prior USA Basketball game experience, and first-time U.S. team members Dearica Hamby (Aces) and Alyssa Thomas (Sun).
