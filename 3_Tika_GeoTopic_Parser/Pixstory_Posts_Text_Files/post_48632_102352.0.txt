Jeremy Lin was the sole reason the Knicks were the talk of the sports world for two weeks straight during the 2011-12 season. Starting with a 25-point game against the Nets in February, the undrafted guard from Harvard became a sensation. Lin averaged 23.9 points in 11 games during the next two weeks, shooting 50 percent from the field and 36.1 percent from beyond the arc. During that time, he also averaged 9.2 assists per game, culminating in an eight-point, 1-of-11 performance against the Heat in Miami. New York, NY, USA, 10 February 2012; Jeremy Lin (17) of the New York Knicks walks off the court after a game against the Los Angeles Lakers at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks triumphed 92-85.

Lin averaged 14.9 points over the next 14 games before suffering an injury and missing the remainder of the season.

The Rockets signed him to a four-year, $30 million contract after that season, but he never lived up to his potential with the Knicks.

Following that season, he moved around and is now out of the league after appearing in 23 games for the Raptors last season. Linsanity, though, had overrun New York for a time.
