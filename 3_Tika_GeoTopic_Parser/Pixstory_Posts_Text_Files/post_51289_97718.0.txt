When you are the logistics person in the family or relationship then everything falls on you or at least you think that everything is supposed to fall on you. But I must admit I did too much in this move.  And one lesson this pandemic taught me is that we need community and in my case at the very last six hours of my move that community showed up and helped out for the next nine hours!  I couldnâ€™t done it without them period!  But I love to get feedback maybe ðŸ¤” with better planning you can do it all?
