I jumped up high to reach the sky but found I couldn t reach that high Between us there was too much air even balanced on a chair I built a rocket from a box but couldn t get it to take off I climbed up on a trampoline and bounced around like a jumping bean Up above me planes fly high and birds soar around in the sky but no matter what I try I m doomed to fail I don t know why So I stretch my hands above my head standing on tippy toes on a shed my fingers grasping for a cloud but reaching none I scream out loud Having stretched and reached I ve come to see that the sky is just too far from me and so if we are to meet may I invite the sky to come down here to my height
