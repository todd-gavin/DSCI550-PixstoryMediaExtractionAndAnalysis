A beloved Holocaust classic has been ousted from Tennessee classrooms, because a school board found it inappropriate for young students. Art Spiegelman’s ‘Maus’ is a cultural phenomenon – the only graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize. It’s history, fiction, autobiography, and much else. In a reader-friendly, engaging and humorous manner, it introduces a difficult topic. But is it meant for young minds? Should it be removed from the eighth-grade syllabus? Or, will ‘Animal Farm’ be the next?

The January 10 vote was unanimous. The McMinn County Board of Education members were uncomfortable with cuss words (“There is some rough, objectionable language in this book”) and a depiction of a naked character. ‘Maus’ was removed from the curriculum because “of its unnecessary use of profanity and nudity and its depiction of violence and suicide,” they said in a statement on Thursday (which, incidentally, was Holocaust Remembrance Day.)

Spiegelman, who recounts here his parents’ experiences (they survived Auschwitz), was aghast: “This is disturbing imagery. But you know what? It’s disturbing history.” Reading the minutes of the meeting, he got the impression that the board was asking, “Why can’t they teach a nicer Holocaust?”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/us/maus-banned-holocaust-tennessee.html 

Yet, many would probably agree with the board. It says ‘Maus’ is “too adult-oriented” for use in its schools. Yes, with its shocking images and disturbing material, it was probably not written for eighth-graders. Removing it need not be equated with anti-Semitism. There could be a more suitable book as replacement (not announced yet).

Others would see this as one of the many battles fought amid an all-out culture war that is also targeting the teaching of race and also alternative gender identities: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/02/us/york-pennsylvania-school-books.html 

As Spiegelman put it, “It’s part of a continuum, and just a harbinger of things to come… the control of people’s thoughts is essential to all of this”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/comics/2022/01/28/art-spiegelman-maus-ban-tennessee-school/ 

‘Maus’ appears on many lists of great books and comics. Time magazine ranked it seventh among the best non-fiction books published between 1923 and 2005: https://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/maus-by-art-spiegelman/#maus-by-art-spiegelman Even philosophers like Umberto Eco are among its fans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus
