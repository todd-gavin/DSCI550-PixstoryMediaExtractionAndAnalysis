Yesterday, when Manchester City wins the Premier League 2021-2022 and all the players started celebrating with the Premier League trophy, one moment that made football fans emotional was when Oleksandr Zinchenko wrapped the Premier League trophy with Ukraine’s flag and starts crying.

As you all know, Zinchenko is a Ukraine born footballer and after Russia’s invasion, the whole football community showed support to Ukraine and Ukraine footballers.

After winning the Premier League title, Zinchenko said that,

“I am so proud to be Ukrainian. People in my country are starving, they are suffering because of Russian aggression and I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine for all Ukrainians because they deserve it and I will never forget this, never in my life.”

and after that many Manchester City players hugged Zinchenko because he broke down in tears.

Moments like these make sports like football special because whatever is said and done, players are also humans and they go through all the emotions as we all do.
