Lani is a bisexual feminist writer and an activist. She is openly bisexual and often pens about her sexuality. She serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Bisexuality. The article bisexual movement are we visible yet?; was the first article about bisexuals and the arising bisexual movement to be published in a national lesbian or gay publication. 

Her mom was of Japanese and Native Hawaiian descent and Kaâ€™ahumanu often passed for white, due to her light skin and features, and from a young age, she saw how she was treated differently than her mother and sister as a result. 

These experiences with racial bias and passing educated her advocacy for social justice and bisexual rights and visibility later in life.

In 1993, Ka'ahumanu spoke at the rally of the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, and Bi Equal Rights, and Liberation; she had conceived and led a healthy national campaign to have bisexual people included in the title.

 Ka'ahumanu was the first openly bisexual individual to be invited and to serve on a national gay and lesbian board, and as such completed her term with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force board of directors in 2000.

In 2004, Ka'ahumanu, Bobbi Keppel, and the Safer Sex Sluts presented the first Safer Sex Workshop given at a joint national conference with the American Society on Aging and the National Association on Aging. In 1983, she co-founded BiPOL, the first feminist bisexual political action group in the country.
