Every person's week is different, some end in a difficult way and some in a comfortable way.In the same way I have good morning with tea made by my mother's hand. I always like to get up early in the morning because by getting up early we can follow the schedule of our day.I always think about my future while drinking tea and sleeping at night  What work do I have to complete today and what was left to study yesterday. Well my week schedule is only study because I love to study Reading new books like historical books and novels When we read books or any novel, many such words come in their paragraphs whose meaning we do not know.Because the language of books is different from our everyday spoken word.So I believe that if we read books, then we get a lot of knowledge. And I also like to collect a lot of books.Whenever dad used to go to Gita Press.Then I used to go too.And used to buy a lot of books because along with study, I also like books collection.Even my dad loves to read novels. I also like to read books of Swami Vivekanand ji because his books inspire me a lot.  I like to read biographies of successful people because their biography gives me thought process.And the thought process gives a reference point that if these people can do it, why can't we? So that's why these books inspire me a lot and I love reading it.  And I like to visit historical places.  And like to know about new things and new culture and which type of things is more famous here.  I like religious places too. Sometimes I make paintings too but it depends on my mood.So that's how our mid week end's .
