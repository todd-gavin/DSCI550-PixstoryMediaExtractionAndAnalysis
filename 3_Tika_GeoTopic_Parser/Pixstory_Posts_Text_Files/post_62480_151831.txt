One of the most intriguing things about whales according to me is their contribution to limiting the effects of climate change on the earth Now how do they do that Whales regular movements help to transport nutrients throughout the ocean and support a healthy ecosystem by the development of phytoplankton At least of the oxygen in our atmosphere is produced by phytoplankton that are small creatures that capture significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere Therefore the more whales we have the more phytoplankton we ll have in the ocean and the better off our seas and environments will be which is exactly why the reducing population of whales is a matter of concern
