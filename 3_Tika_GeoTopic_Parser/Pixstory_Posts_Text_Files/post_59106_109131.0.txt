I am for sure Taylordle. Wondering what's that?? It's a wordle just for Taylor Swift fans.
Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography cuts across multiple genres and her narrative songwriting are inspired by her personal life. 

The first song that I heard of her is ‚ÄúYou belong with me‚Äù To this date, I love that song.
The song from her second studio album Fearless (2008). Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose and produced it with Nathan Chapman. Swift wrote "You Belong with Me" which was inspired by an argument between a male friend of hers and his girlfriend over the phone. 

After that song, I fell in love with her and her songs. I adore her and like every other fan, I did this cringe stuff... Like copied her haircut... Post about her online and daydream about taking an interview with her and her cats. Yeah, too much Right üòë I know... 

Swift explored country pop on the albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010); the success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established her as a leading crossover artist. She experimented with rock and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), supported by the singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble". Swift eschewed country on her synth-pop album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping tracks "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny on Swift's life inspired Reputation (2017), which drew from urban sounds. Led by "Look What You Made Me Do", the album made Swift the only act in MRC Data history to have four albums each sell over a million copies in a week. And many more records.

It was released in 2020. She reveals intimate details of her life while showcasing backstage and onstage concert footage.
