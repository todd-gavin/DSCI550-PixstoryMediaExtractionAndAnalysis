One Direction is the greatest Boyband of all times. 

They had the world in the palm of their hands, every girl just wanted to listen to them, thats all. In its hayday, they were bigger than the Beatles. 

One direction was formed at X Factor in 2010 when Nicole Scherzinger, one of the judges said that they should put these 5 outstanding individuals in one group and the rest is history. 

5 ALBUMS, 3 SOLD OUT WORLD TOURS, 12 AMAZING YEAR. 

Thank you, One Direction. We had some good times, didn't we?
