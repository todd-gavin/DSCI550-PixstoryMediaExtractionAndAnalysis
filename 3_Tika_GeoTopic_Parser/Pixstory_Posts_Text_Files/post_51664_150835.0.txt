Penalty kicks looks so easy to score but in real it is the most hardest set piece to take. Its not about the probability of scoring a goal or having a miss,
It is all about the mental pressure the penalty taker feel while standing to take a penalty kick. This pressure can make you feel scared and may distract you from shooting the ball with good technique. 
You have to be cool and calm-minded while taking a penalty kick. 
Place the ball on the penalty spot and take few steps backwards (approx 5-7 steps). 
Stand there with your chest out and do deep breathing to calm your mind. Don't take side steps as it will make it easier for the Goalkeeper to judge the direction of your shot.
The goal is to fool the goalkeeper and not let him judge the direction you are about to shoot.
Never ever look into the eyes of the goalkeeper as the goalkeeper will try to judge you by looking at you face expressions.
Just look at the ball and make decision in your mind on where you are going to shoot, Wait for the referee to blow the whistle and start taking the run up. 
Always choose placement of the ball rather than blasting the ball as shooting with uncontrolled power will disturb the aim. 
Always try aiming the corners, it can be top corners as well as bottom corners. Take the run up and place the ball inside the net with controlled power and accuracy.
Golden Tip- 
This may not be a professionally accepted way to score a penalty but this is my technique of scoring a penalty.
"You have to show the keeper that you are going to shoot the ball with power, this can be done by running with speed in the run up. 
Instead of blasting the ball just give a little chip at the centre of the goalpost. 
Mostly goalkeepers choose a side to dive for saving a penalty."
This will fool the goalkeeper and it will be an easy goal for you...
