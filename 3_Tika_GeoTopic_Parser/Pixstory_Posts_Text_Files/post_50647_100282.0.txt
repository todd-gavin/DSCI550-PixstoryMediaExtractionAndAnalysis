As Election Day approaches, many homes and businesses in Wentworth proudly display signs supporting Allegra Spender, who is running against the Liberals for the seat. 

Foreign Policy reported that Spender is not affiliated with any political party, but she is part of a powerful network of independent candidates, almost all of whom are women, who are funded by the enigmatic and wealthy Simon Holmes a Court. 

Holmes a Court, whose father was Australia's first mining billionaire, is the driving force behind Climate 200, a fundraising campaign aimed at "striking at the root" of the country's political stagnation. Over 8,000 people have donated a total of more than $7 million Australian dollars (approximately $5 million), including AU$200,000 from Holmes a Court himself.

As Maddison Connaughton writes, Clive Palmer, Australia's seventh-richest man, is also hoping to influence the outcome of the election by funding his own party, the United Australia Party, and running ads critical of the government's COVID-19 responseâ€”from lockdowns to vaccine mandates and the debt racked up trying to keep the economy afloat. 

While the boisterous Palmer and the methodical Holmes a Court are poles apart in terms of politics and temperament, both plainly want to shake up Australia's political elite by spending large.
