The moment that everyone is talking about from the 94th Academy Awards isn't who won Best Picture, or what Zendaya was wearing (a gorgeous Valentino ensemble, for the record): it was Will Smith slapping Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. 

Twitter exploded immediately. The reactions ranged from people who found it funny ("finally standup comedians got what they deserve", some tweeted), people who found it satisfying ("Chris Rock had no business mocking a woman with the distressing condition of alopecia"), and people who found it upsetting ("it's bad to condone violence in the name of protecting women!") 

Look, wherever you fall on this issue, I would like to suggest that the worst take of all time came from the director Judd Apatow, who started tweeting unhinged reactions to the incident. "He could have killed him. That's pure out of control rage and violence." I read that before watching video of the slap, which shocked me - for its MILDNESS. 

Will Smith is well trained to throw a real punch - thanks to the many action movies he starred in! What happened on that Oscars stage was not a real punch. At most, it was a controlled slap, not even a very hard one, as you can see by Chris Rockâ€™s reaction. Rock took it in his stride - perhaps he understood that, as Smith said, he should "keep [his] wife's name out his f***ing mouth." 

Either way, there is no way that slap could ever have been fatal. Apatow's tweet (since-deleted!) is merely classic white overreaction to Black men: it's part of the racist myth that suggests all Black men are hyperviolent, and in need of control and policing. 

Furthermore, Apatow really had no room to be talking when he let James Franco throw Busy Phillips around on set - a fact that Twitter users were quick to point out, and probably why he deleted his idiotic tweets.
