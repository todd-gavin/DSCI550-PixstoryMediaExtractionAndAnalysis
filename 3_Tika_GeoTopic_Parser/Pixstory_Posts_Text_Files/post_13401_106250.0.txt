Anas Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani Network and the brother of the acting Taliban interior minister, released pictures of his trip to Bamyan on Thursday.
Below his souvenir photos next to Band-e-Amir, the social media users asked Anas Haqqani! "Did you see the empty space of the exploded Buddhas?"

Two historic Buddha statues in Bamyan were blown up by Taliban members in 2001.
The group has now regained control of Afghanistan after 20 years.

"Bamiyan's winds are cold and pleasant, but people's hearts are not cold," he wrote on Twitter. I walked the streets of the city, people are loving. "Band Amir, which is a masterpiece of nature, has a fascinating view."

He did not mention the Buddha statue, which was one of Afghanistan's most famous tourist attractions before being destroyed by the Taliban.
