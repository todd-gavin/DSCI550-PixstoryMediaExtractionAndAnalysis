REMOVE YOUR MASK, LET ME SEE YOUR FACE! 
Remove your mask,
Let me see your face 
Walk through your darkness
Liven up your emptiness,
Look around ,
It's a beautiful world,
Why burden your shoulders with fanatic madness ?
You get nothing in return
Only coffins
And you rot in hell,
Remove your mask
Let me see your face. 
You are valiant,
Why die a coward's death?
You are oblivious to the passage of time,
Care for none,
But all in vain
You lose the final race.
Your monstrous laughter echoes far and wide ,
Pride, arrogancy and evil way 
Takes you nowhere,
Look around,
It's a beautiful world,
Greet your dawn with your smile
Kiss your dusk with promises, 
Let dreams swim through your eyes,
Create your ultimate fairyland 
Colour it with harmony and peace,
Drop your mask
Let me see your face.
