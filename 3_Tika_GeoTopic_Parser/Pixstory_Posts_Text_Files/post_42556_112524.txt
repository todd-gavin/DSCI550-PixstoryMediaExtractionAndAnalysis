I just finished watching Stranger Things Season Vol and after watching one thing I want to say is that Stranger Things is getting better season by season and Stranger Things is one of the best web series in terms of its story writing and character building Volume of Stranger Things Season started from the same point where Volume has ended but Volume put the foot on the accelerator and things started happening which were leading us to the great season finale In total there are stories which are connected and are simultaneously in focus in Volume The first story is about Dustin Max Lucas Robin Steve Eddie Nancy and Erica and they were trying to kill Vecna by going in upside down with the help of a gate The second story is about Hopper Joyce Murray and Dimitri who are trying to come back to America but Hopper got an idea which will indirectly help the kids to kill Vecna The third story is about Mike Will Jonathan and Argyle and they want to evacuate Eleven from Dr Brenner once they succeed in it now they are trying to save their friends from Hawkins If I write anything else about Volume then it will be a spoiler from my side and will ruin your experience of watching the show Things I liked about the Stranger Things Season Vol are its story writing and character building because the characters who were introduced in the fourth season only will connect with you very easily and you will laugh and cry for them for sure Season of Stranger Things will be the last instalment and I can t wait for Season Note down in the comments and tell me the moments that you liked in Volume
