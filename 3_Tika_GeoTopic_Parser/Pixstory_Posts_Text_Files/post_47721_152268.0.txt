By NewsDrum Desk New Delhi: A decision by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to appoint a new party chief in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday (October 1) in the middle of the ongoing organisational elections has triggered a debate on the validity of the move.Sonia Gandhi appointed Brijlal Khabri, a former BSP leader, as the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president, along with naming Nasimuddin Siddiqui, Ajai Rai, Virendra Chaudhary, Nakul Dubey, Anil Yadav and Yogesh Dixit as regional chiefs in the state unit.Critics argued that the order should not have been issued at a time when campaigning for the upcoming elections to the Congress president's post was underway.As per the information available, Madhusudan Mistry, chairman of the party’s central election authority (CEA), in a meeting on September 14, directed all the Pradesh Returning Officers (PROs), responsible for conducting organisational elections in states, to ensure resolutions from all state units authorising the Congress president to appoint new Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chiefs.They were directed to get these resolutions passed by the respective state units between September 24 and September 30, the period specified by the CEA for filing of nomination papers for the elections to the Congress president’s post.However, it has emerged that the Congress general secretary in charge of organisation KC Venugopal’s office started calling up PCC chiefs from September 11 onwards asking them to submit their resolutions before September 20.Mistry initially resisted the move but eventually agreed to it. This explains the reason why the Uttarakhand Congress hurriedly called its meeting on September 16 to pass this resolution. The other state units subsequently followed suit.The Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) met on September 19 and passed the resolution authorising Sonia Gandhi to select the new state chief.Generally, all new appointments are frozen the moment the election schedule is announced and the model code of conduct comes into force.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/analysis/did-congress-president-violate-a-poll-norm-by-appointing-new-state-chief-for-up-in-the-midst-of-organisational-elections-98235.html
