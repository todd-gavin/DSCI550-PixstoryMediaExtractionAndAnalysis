This summer, a Native American comfort cuisine restaurant will open in the Logan neighbourhood. 

Spokesman reported that Indigenous Eats will open in August in a 1,900-square-foot space formerly occupied by Bruchi's Cheesesteaks & Subs at 829 E. Boone Ave., Suite E, according to Jenny Slagle and her husband Andrew. 

“We thought, ‘What a great opportunity to have some representation of our food, culture and music,’” Jenny Slagle said of the restaurant.

Fry bread, Indian tacos, and desserts with huckleberry sauce will be among the things on the restaurant's menu. A recipe from Slagle's mother will be used to make the fry bread, which is a flat dough loaf fried in oil. 

“As we are open a little bit longer, we will be offering seasonal stews and soups,” Slagle said.

Ingredients for the restaurant's menu will be sourced from Native American-owned businesses in the area, according to Slagle.
