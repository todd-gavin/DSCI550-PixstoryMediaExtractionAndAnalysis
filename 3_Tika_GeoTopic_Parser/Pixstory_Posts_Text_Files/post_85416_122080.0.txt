We've learned more about Joker 2, which is calming us down as Warner Bros continues to cancel major projects. 

As per news portals, the anticipated follow-up to the popular 2019 film was announced in June of this year. Todd Phillips is helming the film, and Joaquin Phoenix will return as the DC villain.

News reports say that the sequel's working title is Folie a Deux, which translates to two close friends who share a mental disease or delusion. Additionally, it has been announced that the movie would be a musical, which has divided fans. According to another source, the actor's pay will increase from $4.5 million for the 2019 film to $20 million for the follow-up. 

While DC lost Batgirl, fans have been worried about the other projects, such as Joker 2. But with the new update, it seems like they have one thing less to be worried about. As per The Wrap, itâ€™s said that the Joaquin Phoenix starrer will supposedly heavily involve Arkham Asylum. Though the details regarding the location are not known, fans expect to see the wall of the Gotham City psychiatric facility a lot.
