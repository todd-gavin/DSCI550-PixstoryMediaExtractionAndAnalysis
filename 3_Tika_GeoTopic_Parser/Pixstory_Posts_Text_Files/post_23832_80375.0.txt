Mark Wahlberg is breaking my heart a little. As a huge fan of comic books I’ve been a part of my favorite fan casting debate here and there since the days of Wizard magazine in the 90’s. Some of you guys remember Wizard magazine and their fan casting feature. As a kid I couldn’t help but imagine some of my favorite actors and actresses portraying my favorite comic book characters in film and television. When superhero movies became more commonplace I sorta assumed that this may make it possible for some of my favorite A-listers to appear in these movies and make my fan castings a reality. Sadly, that hasn’t happened very often with most A-listers choosing not to participate in the superhero films all together.
