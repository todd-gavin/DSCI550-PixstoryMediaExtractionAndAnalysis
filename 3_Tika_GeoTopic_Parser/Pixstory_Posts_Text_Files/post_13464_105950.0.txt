Human Rights Watch says what is happening in Afghanistan right now is "the most serious women's rights crisis in the world today."

The Taliban's list of violations of women and girls' rights is "long and growing" and the world needs to do more for Afghan women, the organization added.

 the head of the women's section of Human Rights Watch, published an article referring to the Taliban's strict laws against women and girls, and wrote that the Taliban enforced these laws through "violence."

 the Taliban had demands from the international community, including "legitimacy", "relief from sanctions" and "financial aid".

The head of the women's section of Human Rights Watch believes that these cases "can be used as agents of pressure on the Taliban."
 That the nations of the world should agree on a roadmap to make it clear to the Taliban that the group's goals can only be achieved through "comprehensive human rights reforms."

The memo states that six countries that have "committed to a feminist foreign policy," including Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Sweden, must lead the way in putting pressure on the Taliban.

 The United States, which has led international cooperation in Afghanistan for the past 20 years, must "encourage, welcome and support" those countries to put pressure on the Taliban.
