Warriors stomped out Celtics to further their championship claims, as they took the 3-2 lead over Celtics, being in the driver seat for the first time in this series. 

Wiggins delivered the biggest game yet in his eight-year career with 26 points and 13 rebounds, Klay Thompson scored 21 points, and the Warriors beat the Celtics 104-94 on Monday night for a 3-2 NBA finals lead.

Warriors are within an inch of the title, they just need one more win to win their fourth title in the last 8 years. 

Stephen Curry had a bittersweet night, as he won the game but failed to score a Three-pointer. Curry's NBA-record streak of 132 straight postseason games with at least one three ended, along with his NBA-best run of 233 consecutive games with a three between regular season and playoffs combined.

The sixth game of the series will be played in Boston, which just might turn out to be the Championship decider. If the Celtics do manage to hold them off at their home turf, both the teams will be back in Bay Area for the 7th, Winner take All match. 

We have an exciting week of basketball ahead of us, and I for one cannot get enough of it.
