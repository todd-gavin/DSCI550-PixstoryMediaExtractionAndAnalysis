A few months back, a few thousand refugees from the Middle East on the border of Poland had created a crisis for the European Union. But it’s a different situation now. Ukraine’s neighbor Poland has registered over half a million Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion, and another neighbor Hungary has seen over 130,000 people crossing over the border.

And the EU is ready to take in more refugees in what is called the “greatest human exodus since the end of World War II” in Europe. According to some estimates, over one million Ukrainians have fled the country in the last two weeks. 

And the European Union has resorted to the ‘Temporary Protection Directive’ in the EU constitution, which it has rarely used, offering a reasonably simplified process for refugees to stay in Europe. By invoking this provision, the EU countries can provide residence permits to Ukrainian refugees to stay and work for a year and that stay could also be extended for another year. 

Ukrainian refugees are entitled to visa-free travel in the Schengen countries for up to 90 days. All these agreements have been reached in a special EU meeting over the crisis. 

The speed at which the EU has responded to refugees has surprised even the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. It has said, “Despite the extraordinary pace and challenges, the response from governments and local communities in receiving these one million refugees has been remarkable. UNHCR staff have already moved in throughout the region and are scaling up our protection and assistance programmes for refugees, in support of host governments.” (https://www.unhcr.org/news/press/2022/3/62206a824/news-comment-1-million-refugees-fled-ukraine-week.html)

Take the case of Hungary. The country’s hard-line prime minister, Viktor Orban, had previously called refugees a threat to his country. But even he has come out openly in support of refugees. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/us/politics/ukraine-europe-refugees.html)
