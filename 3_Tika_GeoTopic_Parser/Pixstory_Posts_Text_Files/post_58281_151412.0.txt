Weight loss and matches made in heaven. 
One fine day Han Fei a descendant of traditional Chinese medicine Han family woke up and realized that she has gone back into the ancient times and become the fat,useless daughter of the Han family . 
Everyone looks down on her and mocks her . On top of it she was engaged to be married to Prince Qin , who could not walk used a wheelchair. 
Everyone laughed and mocked them , a crippled man and a fat woman what a couple! But little did they realise that its not the people who are perfect but the love and bond between a couple that is . 
Han Fei and Prince QinÂ  might did not have a happy wedding but maybe their married life will be source of envy for many .
