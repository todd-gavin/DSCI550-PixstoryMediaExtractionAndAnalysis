Pep Guardiola says Erling Haaland is fit to play for Manchester City's Premier League trip to Liverpool on Sunday.
Haaland sat on the bench for City's Champions League trip to Copenhagen on Tuesday - the first time he's not started for City since signing in the summer. Guardiola said he wasn't fully fit to play in Denmark, and that he would be assessed this week ahead of the weekend trip to Anfield.
And speaking on Friday ahead of the Liverpool showdown, Guardiola confirmed that Haaland is available to play in the game, along with Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden, who were also benched in Denmark.
He said: "We have a lot of games, the players recover better. Erling last season couldn't play these games in a row. They feel good and are ready for Sunday.
"Guardiola also offered an update on other injury absentees John Stones, Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips, with the trip all missing games recently for various issues. Phillips and Walker are recovering from surgery and face a race against time to make England's World Cup squad, while Stones picked up a hamstring problem with England last month and hasn't played since, with this week originally mentioned as a possible return date.
Now, Guardiola said Stones could be out for another two weeks, as well as providing an update on Walker and Phillips.
