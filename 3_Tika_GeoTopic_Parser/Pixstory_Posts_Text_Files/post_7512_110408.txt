Woh Subah Kabhi to Aayegi A translation of Sahir s lyrics from Phir Subah Hogi We await that dawn When the sea of joy will brim over And the dark clouds of misery melt When the sky will dance enraptured And the earth in ecstasy sing This dawn for which from ages past half stubbed lives have we lived This elixir in the wait for which from poisoned chalices have we drunk Carrying hopes that one day fortune will touch these famished desperate lives True our hopes and dreams are meaningless now While even mud has a price humanity sells cheap The day when human worth will no longer be evaluated in coins counterfeit For that dawn we wait Not a literal translation
