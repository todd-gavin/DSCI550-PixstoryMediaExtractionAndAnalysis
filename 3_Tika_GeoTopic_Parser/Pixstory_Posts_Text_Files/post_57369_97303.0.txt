Riot games on Thursday announced the alterations made to Valorant eSports.(Valorant is a free to play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft windows.)

This time, they have unveiled different international and domestic leagues and a competitive game mode for players interested in eSports.
The changes will be made in 2023, and the details about the new in-game mode are yet to be announced.

John Needham, president of esports at Riot Games, said they'd use everything they learned from the  League of Legends.
“We’ll use everything we learned from the past ten years with LoL Esports to build an ecosystem that will supercharge ‘Valorant’ into the next great multigenerational esport,” 

Many changes have been made to make it more interesting; Riot will work on finding teams with permanent partnerships; this partnership will have two key benefits. First, selected teams would not pay the participation fees, and they'll get an annual stipend from Riot.
 Whalen Rozelle, head of esports operations at Riot, said, 
“We are setting up our long-term partners for success by forgoing any entry or participation fees for selected organisations. We aim to free our partners to invest their resources in supporting their pros and growing their fanbases through creating incredible content for fans.”

The new-made changes would invite more aspiring players to join the Valorant.
