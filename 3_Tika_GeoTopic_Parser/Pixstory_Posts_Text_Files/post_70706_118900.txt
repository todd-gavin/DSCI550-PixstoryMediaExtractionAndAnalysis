Pictured above is an artist s depiction of what such a nuclear power system could look like Image credit NASA The US Department of Energy DOE issued three contracts to three businesses earlier this year each worth about million for design ideas for a nuclear fission surface power system that can be sent to the Moon By the end of the decade such technology might be used on the Moon according to NASA The funding provided by the DOE contracts are to be applied toward the creation of preliminary design ideas for a kW fission power system that will operate on the Moon for at least years The companies chosen for the contract are Lockheed Martin Westinghouse and IX and all three will collaborate with other businesses on the design development Nuclear fission technologies are perfect for the lunar environment since they are relatively light and compact They are also capable of producing power consistently regardless of location amount of sunlight and other environmental factors Long duration expeditions to the Moon Mars and other planets may be possible if such a Nuclear fission technologies are perfect for the lunar environment since they are relatively light and compact They are also capable of producing power consistently regardless of location amount of sunlight and other environmental factors Long duration expeditions to the Moon Mars and other planets may be possible if such a technology is successfully created and implemented Source
