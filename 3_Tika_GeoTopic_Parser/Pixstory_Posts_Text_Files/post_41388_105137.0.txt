The NCAA baseball tournament's prodigious offence was on show once again on Sunday, with another wild game in Stillwater, Oklahoma, serving as Example A. 

US News reported that Oklahoma State came back from a 12-0 hole to defeat Missouri State 29-15 in the tournament's highest-scoring game. 

It happened less than 24 hours after the Cowboys lost 20-12 to Arkansas after blowing a 10-5 lead in the seventh quarter. 

The Cowboys' comeback against the Bears was complete when Griffin Doersching hit a grand slam in the seventh inning for a 17-14 advantage. With 12 more runs in the eighth and ninth innings, they pulled away and had just over an hour to prepare for a rematch with Arkansas.

No. 16 Georgia Southern was the only national seed eliminated, losing 3-1 on its home field to Texas Tech.
