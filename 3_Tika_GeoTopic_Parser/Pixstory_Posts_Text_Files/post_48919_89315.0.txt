Pigs are among the most intelligent creatures on the planet. Their IQ is better than that of dogs and even certain primates!

Pigs are very clean animals in their natural state. They keep their bathrooms apart from where they live and eat.

They can tolerate chilly temperatures considerably better than heat. Pigs don't have sweat glands, hence they can't sweat, so they prefer laying in the mud to stay cool.

Piglets may learn their names and respond when called at two to three weeks of age when properly trained, and they can learn skills faster than dogs.

Pigs converse with each other through grunts. Pig grunts differ depending on the pig's personality and can provide vital information about the health of this highly social creature.

Pigs have extremely long memories and may recall events from years ago!

Mother pigs can communicate with their newborn piglets by grunting while they suckle, and newborn piglets learn to run to their moms' voices. Piglets have a certain teat order, according to scientific studies, and each piglet has its own teat.

They enjoy getting massages, touching trees (in natural conditions), relaxing while listening to music, and are curious creatures who enjoy various enrichment devices.

The pig's nose contains the largest density of touch receptors. It is mostly used by pigs to dig in the dirt and sniff for food. The sense of smell of a pig is around 2000 times more sensitive than that of a human.

Pigs are gregarious creatures. They create strong ties with one another and with other species, and some of them enjoy cuddling up close, especially in cold weather.
