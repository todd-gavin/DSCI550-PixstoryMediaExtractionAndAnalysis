With car speeds averaging 260 kmph per lap, Monza is rightly called the “Cathedral of Speed”. Alongside Silverstone, it holds the distinction of being a part of every F1 season since its inception.

The 2021 Italian Grand Prix was a day to remember for McLaren fans worldwide with a rare 1,2 as Riccardo and Norris crossed the chequered flag first.

In 2019, Vettel claimed his final victory with Ferrari before parting ways and finding a home in Aston Martin since then. Can he find a way to the podium this season?
