One night I visited this historic site The street was brightly lit and bustling with tourists Very vibrant and amassing There are over stars Many of your favourites are visible Street food theatre and other activities are available It takes about hours to see all of the stars I believe two hours and seeing some of them is sufficient It is a must see if you visit Los Angeles
