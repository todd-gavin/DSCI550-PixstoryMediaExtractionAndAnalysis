Man Ray's famed "Le Violon d'Ingres" is poised to make history as the most expensive photograph ever sold at auction, according to a report in CNN.

The black and white image, taken in 1924 by the American surrealist artist, transforms a woman's naked body into a violin by overlaying the picture of her back with f-holes.

The original print of the masterpiece, widely considered to be Man Ray's most famous work, is expected to fetch between $5-7 million when it goes under the hammer at Christie's in May -- the highest estimate for a photograph.
