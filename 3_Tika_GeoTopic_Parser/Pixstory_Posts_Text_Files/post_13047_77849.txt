I used to study in elementary school at Abdullah Khan High School in Kabul province We had a teacher who was one of the educated youth in our area named Faizullah He was a good man He always relied more on his words when he spoke in class for example but I will never forget one word that said that everything in the world was seen except two things one is a Hindu grave and the other is a hungry grave at that time we also believed But today I heard that someone in Badghis province committed suicide because of poverty and rarity I heard that someone committed suicide in Baghlan and we always hear that they sell their children because of poverty and hardship But unaware of today when a government comes to power in the shadow of Islamic justice people starve to death and sell their children maybe this will be the end of time
