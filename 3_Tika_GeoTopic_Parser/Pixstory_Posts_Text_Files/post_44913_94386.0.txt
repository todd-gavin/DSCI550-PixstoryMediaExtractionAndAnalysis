Norwich City were Cristiano Ronaldo's latest victims this weekend as the latest round of
Premier league fixtures ended with Manchester United in a respectable 5th place. All thanks
to CR7's heroics of course, the triplet of goals puts him on 60 career hat-tricks, and with of
them having come since turning 30 years old his longevity isn't questionable. Here are five of
the Portuguese's most iconic hattricks.

#5. Terrorising Atlético Madrid (2018/19 - UCL):

CR7 has torn into Atlético Madrid's defence on multiple times in his illustrious career. In fact,
Jan Oblak has only ever conceded 4 hat-tricks throughout his career. All of them being
courtesy of the Portuguese, with this one being the last of them all. With Juventus having
lost the first leg 2-0 in Madrid, it was down to Ronaldo to drag them back from a deficit they'd
never overcome. The Round of 16 second leg was perfectly set for the Allianz stadium.

After 26 minutes of Total domination, Bernardeschi's ball found Ronaldo who leaped over
Juanfran to head past Oblak. Beyond the break, another Joao Cancelo cross from a similar
angle reached his head. Oblak parried the shot on target but VAR ruled in favour of
Juventus, and the third came shortly after as Bernardeschi was fouled in the area. Ronaldo
stepped up and slotted to Oblak's right. Possibly his best performance in a Bianconeri shirt.
