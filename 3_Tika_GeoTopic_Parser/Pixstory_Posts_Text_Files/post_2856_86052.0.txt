Sri Lanka has never seen such power cuts in almost three decades. The daily power shutdowns in some country regions have reached more than 10 hours a day. Officially it is only five hours. But the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, the body responsible for power regulation, has said that the power cuts could worsen. 

In the meantime, the country’s currency has been tumbling as the country’s foreign reserves are dropping so much that the government has no money to buy gasoline, which the island mostly imports. In fact, Sri Lanka’s public transport may grind to a halt as the country is fast running out of diesel. The energy is so bad that a minister of the country’s cabinet has called it the “worst economic crisis since independence” from Britain in 1948. https://www.digitaljournal.com/business/sri-lanka-runs-out-of-fuel-as-dollar-crisis-worsens/article#ixzz7MxyHrh53 

This is far cry from days when it was considered fast-growing South Asian tiger. 

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has indicated that it is in favor of devaluing the already crashing currency even further to make way for the country to make more exports so that it can see some increase in its foreign reserves. But it could also drive inflation higher as imported products could become costly.

Several economic experts blame the crisis on Covid and strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s economic policies, including high government expenditure and populist tax cuts. These happened at a time when the country was being warned of walking into a debt trap of China which has been involved in large infrastructure projects with no economic benefits. Inflation has been on rocketing because of ballooning internal and external debt. ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/covid-crisis-sri-lanka-bankruptcy-poverty-pandemic-food-prices ) 

The Sri Lankan government has to service $7.3bn in foreign debt this year or default on its debt. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is racing to avoid just that, but not many are sure how that the default can be prevented.

The crisis is so severe that there are shortages in food, medicines and other essentials. Country’s foreign currency reserves at just f $2.07 billion, far below $7.5 billion in November 2019 when President Rajapaksa took over. Alarm bells are deafening.
