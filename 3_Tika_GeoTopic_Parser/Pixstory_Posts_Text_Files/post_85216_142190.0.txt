The statement read, “Last weekend, English football united together to honor and remember Her Majesty the Queen.”
“We would like to express our thanks and gratitude to everyone across our game for their support and understanding as we paid respect to our long-standing Patron of The Football Association, Queen Elizabeth Il.”
