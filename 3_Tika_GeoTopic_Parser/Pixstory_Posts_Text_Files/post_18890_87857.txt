In the last minutes of Manchester United Atletico Madrid match valid for the round of 16 of the Champions League while Paul Pogba was on the pitch the thieves burst into his house and in a few minutes they burgled it His wife was with him at the stadium but at home they were his two sons were left sleeping A night worse than a nightmare told the former Juventus midfielder In five minutes they robbed us of the most precious object that is the sense of security and tranquility This happened during the final minutes of last night&#39;s match when they knew that we wouldn&#39;t have been home To trace the thieves Pogba offers a reward to anyone who can help him We went home not knowing if our children were safe As a father there is no worse feeling than not being able to protect your children and I hope no one must feel like I did last night for this reason that I would like to offer a reward to anyone who can help us
