James' return is obviously good news for a Lakers team that is substantially better when he is out on the floor. The Lakers lost four out of five games during James' recent absence, and they dropped down to ninth in the Western Conference standings as a result -- probably not where they thought they'd be at this point in the season. 

James has been hampered by injury issues this season, but when he's been out on the floor he's been fantastic. On the season, he's averaging 29.1 points, 7.8 rebounds and 6.4 assists in 36.7 minutes per performance. His points per game average is the highest it's been since the 2009-10 season. 

Now that James is back, and Davis is also healthy, perhaps the Lakers will begin to ascend in the standings over the back end of the season. The win over the Knicks was a solid start.
