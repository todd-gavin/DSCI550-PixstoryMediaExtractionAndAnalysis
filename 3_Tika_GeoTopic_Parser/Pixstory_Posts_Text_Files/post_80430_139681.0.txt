Arsene Wenger's first official match in command of Arsenal was 21 years ago. He had previously agreed to the position a few weeks earlier, but a delay was necessary due to his obligations to Nagoya Grampus Eight. Finally, as the Gunners' manager, he entered the dugout on October 12, 1996.

The game in question ended in a 2-0 victory for Blackburn Rovers. Funny enough, Wenger started out playing three central defenders for Arsenal, a strategy he has now switched back to.

In this essay, we go through the team sheet and wonder what happened to the XI Wenger selected that day.
Goalkeeper: David Seaman

For an additional seven years, England goalkeeper Seaman was Wenger's top choice. He wasn't eventually released by Arsenal until 2003, which gave him the opportunity to sign for Manchester City for nothing. Unfortunately, Seaman's decision didn't turn out that well. He was forced to step down in January 2004 as a result of mounting injuries.

In 2005, he briefly pondered returning to play for Walsall, but decided against it after learning that doing so would have violated the conditions of his retired insurance payout. These days, Seaman takes pleasure in honing his golf swing and making the occasional media appearance.

Right wing-back: Lee Dixon

The former full-back for Stoke City retired in 2002, one year before Seaman departed Arsenal. He had made an astounding 458 league appearances by the age of 38. He currently works as a commentator for NBC in the US and ITV in the UK. He is articulate while discussing the game and steers clear of the clich√©-filled commentary provided by less accomplished analysts.

After his retirement, Dixon has interests outside of football. Unexpectedly, he also supports Yorke Dance, a ballet group that performs dances in England and Los Angeles.
