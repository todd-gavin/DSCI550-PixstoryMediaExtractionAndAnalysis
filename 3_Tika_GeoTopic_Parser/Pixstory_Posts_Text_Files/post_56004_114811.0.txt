Rishi Sunak is already in the race to be the next PM. This was a  quick and expected move, doubting whether he already planned his resignation for the same. His walkout from the cabinet was sure the trigger for many others to do so forcing Boris Johnson to resign.

What does he put forward?  He emphasizes his more modest background-describing his grandmother who emigrated to Britain and his mother working had to give opportunities to her children. It's this anecdote of opportunity - and his background running the economy - that will play a vital part in his campaign.

But is his side clean? He had a pretty tough year after the revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister's birthday party on June 19, 2020, which he later apologized for "unreservedly." Let's not forget this is one of the reasons why many people as well as MPs lost confidence in Boris Johnson.

 His financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK -- meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income -- and that he held a US green card while serving as minister. Akshata his wife earns around Rs 11.56 crore in annual incomes from her interest in Infosys, her father's company, and she contends a non-dom tax status in the country, which enables her to avoid paying taxes on the annual dividend advantages she earns from her Infosys holding.

Sunak, in his capacity as Chancellor of the Exchequer or Finance Minister, declared a series of tax increases that went into effect this month. So, at a time when the pandemic has caught everyone off pace and businesses are still swiveling from the devastation, news that the Chancellorâ€™s wife has been sneaking British taxes has developed quite a bit of stir in the country. The cost of living and inflation crisis also was tough for him to manage and hence affected his political image.
