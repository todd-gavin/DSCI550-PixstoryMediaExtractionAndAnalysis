Rest and relax. Taking a nap in a comfortable position or relaxing in the bathtub with soothing essential oils can help ease the pain.

Application of heat is known to significantly reduce the pain. You can either use a heated pain relief pad or simply turn toward a trusty hot water bag.

Gently massaging your abdomen and lower back can soothe the pain too.

Try to do some gentle exercises that help in improving the flow of blood to the pelvic area.

Try relaxation techniques such as guided meditations and deep breathing.
