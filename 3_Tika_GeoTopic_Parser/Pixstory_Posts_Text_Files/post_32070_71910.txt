The place which measure the distance between two places in terms of time the place where people walk and eat all together to save time A place where people usually jump off the running train A place where you ll figure out the difference between high class and low class is nothing but just a wall and that s Taj heritage wall A place where you may get lost in the herd of thousands and a place where you can find a serene place to watch sunset near sea A place which can feed your belly in rupees and can leave your belly half full in rupees depends how and where you eat A place where you humanity is still alive In the periods of grief A place where woman s are still safe a place where the whole India lives with harmony and love A place where you can still kiss in public and hardly anyone cares a place for all and for everything called Mumbai We love Mumbai
