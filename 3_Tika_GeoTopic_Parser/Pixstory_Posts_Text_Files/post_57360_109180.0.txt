Sleep disorders are a group of conditions that affect the ability to sleep well regularly. Whether they are caused by a health problem or by too much stress, sleep disorders are becoming increasingly common in the United States. More than one-third of adults trusted sources in the United States report getting fewer than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. 

Insomnia
Insomnia refers to the inability to fall asleep or remain asleep. It can be caused by jet lag, stress and anxiety, hormones, or digestive problems. It may also be a symptom of another condition.

Sleep apnea
Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. People with untreated sleep apnea stop repeatedly breathing during their sleep.

Parasomnias
Parasomnias are a class of sleep disorders that cause abnormal movements and behaviours during sleep. They include: sleepwalking, sleep talking, groaning, nightmares, bedwetting, teeth grinding or jaw clenching.

Restless leg syndrome
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is an overwhelming need to move the legs. A tingling sensation in the legs sometimes accompanies this urge. While these symptoms can occur during the day, they are most prevalent at night.

Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder of sleep regulation that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any activity on any day. In addition, some patients with narcolepsy experience sudden muscle weakness with laughter or other emotions.
