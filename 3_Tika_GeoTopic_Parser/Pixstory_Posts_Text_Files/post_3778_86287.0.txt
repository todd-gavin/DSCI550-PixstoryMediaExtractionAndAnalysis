Will Sukhbir Badal finally emerge from the shadows of his illustrious father Parkash Singh Badal this election?  Can he bring back his Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) back to relevancy in 2022? These are key questions as we await election results. Sukhbir is candidate from the Jalalabad constituency. Last time his party, after remaining in power for 10 years could get only 15 seats. Sukhbir broke his alliance with BJP and went with BSP, a minor force in Punjab this time and if there are conflicting reports about his party's performance in 2022. Some say he would bring his party to second position and Congress may slip to third position in AAP wave. Others say Akalis won't do better than last time this time. 

Sukhbir, 59, has many years ahead in politics and this election will ensure this jat sikh leader's stature in Punjab politics for years to come.
