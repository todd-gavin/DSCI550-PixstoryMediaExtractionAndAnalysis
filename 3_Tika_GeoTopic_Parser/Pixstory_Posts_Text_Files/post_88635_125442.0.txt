Today we celebrate " International Lefthanders Day" .💫🖤
Being a left hander was never an easy journey for me. Not because I ain't equally capable and efficient like my peers who are righthanded , but because of the fact that I live in a world that's designed for righthanders.
Right from kindergarten to college , I have had quite a lot of people asking me the same set of questions :
"Didn't your parents notice that you are lefthanded?
Why didn't they correct you from a young age? 
Why didn't they take an effort to make you a righthander ?" . 
And whenever I googled about lefthanders I got to read a lot of myths and a few scientifc facts which portrayed the sunnyside of being a  lefthanded person... 
Myths or facts!! .. over the past many years such random facts have instilled a lot of confidence in me and I take immense pride in being a part of the rare 10 percentage of world's population. 💪⚡
While in school , during Informatics period , almost all of my classmates were able to use computer so effortlessly except for 1 or 2 lefthanders including me.
And back in my school days ,  out of great passion for music  ,  I joined a violin class in my locality . Unfortunately that's when I realized that all instruments like violin, guiter, etc are designed primarily for righthanders . If a lefthander wanted to be good at such instruments then they should be either ambidextrous or they should re-tune  the strings.
Inspite of all these odds , I'm a proud lefthander and i don't regret my parent's decision of not changing me into a righthander. Instead I'm indeed happy .. for ... they let me live , the way I'm . 💓
And the best thing is that , now I'm ambidextrous .💛

Dear lefthanders out there , 
You are equally good .💜
Someday if you're feeling low just think about Barack Obama,Mark Twain,Angelina Jolie, Albert Einstein,Leonardo da Vinci and the list goes on & on. 💜

Thanks for reading.❤
Wishing you all good health , happiness and prosperity. ❤
