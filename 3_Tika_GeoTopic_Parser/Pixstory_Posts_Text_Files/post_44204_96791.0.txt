Following a relatively under par season in Serie A, Juventus are on the lookout in the summer transfer market again. In a bid to strengthen their squad, the Bianconeri might be eyeing a summer swoop for Angel Di Maria.

The Argentine is pretty well settled at PSG, where he's made a name for himself since his move from Manchester United in 2015. With Covid-19 leading to a cut in finances at his current club, offloading a high earner like Di Maria wouldn't be completely out of the equation.

Italian manager Masimilliano Allegri returned last summer, prompting an impending revolution. With striker Paulo Dybala set to leave this summer, a vacant spot opens up in Juve's ranks. Di Maria is a great candidate given his experience, skillset and ability to decide matched, and Allegri is said to be fan.

Di Maria announced his Argentina retirement earlier this year, "I just wanted to say thank you 
for the enormous love I have received," wrote Di Maria on Instagram, shortly after Argentina 
hammered Venezuela 3-0 in a WC qualifiers 
"I always dreamed of everything I've experienced on this beautiful night.

It was probably my last match with this shirt in Argentina and being able to say that it was a wonderful night is an understatement. Thank you, thank you and a thousand times thank you."

Juventus have often lacked cutting edge this season, and Di Maria might change that if the 
transfer does hypothetically go through. As it stands, PSG haven't opened renewal talks with 
Di Maria's agent. The club show no intention of keeping the Argentine beyond this summer.

Di Maria doesn't wish to explore the possibility of a return to Argentina, as that is a pay cut 
he isn't willing to take. His status in Paris hangs in the balance, but that is where he plays his 
best football and has his family settled too.
