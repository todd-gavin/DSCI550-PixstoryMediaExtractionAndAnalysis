Venus Williams has sent tennis fans into a frenzy after accepting a wildcard to play at the Canadian Open in the lead-up to the US Open next month.

The 42-year-old hasn't played singles in nearly 12 months but made a surprise appearance in the mixed doubles with Jamie Murray at Wimbledon this month.

Speculation has been rife that Venus is on the verge of retirement, but Canadian Open officials announced on Wednesday that the seven-time grand slam champion will return to singles action in Toronto
