Tottenham edged past Brighton in an intense game during Matchday 10 of this season's Premier League to finally gather some bit of rhythm after the frustrating draw with Frankfurt last week in the Champions League. Antonio Conte's displayed a fairly good performance under pressure to register a crucial win to maintain their position among the remaining teams at the top of the table so far this season. This win helped the Spurs retain their 3rd position in the table wherein they sit comfortably currently with 20 points in 9 games. 
 
Tottenham had a great start to the game with the attackers having great sight of the goal right from the early stages of the game. Son at first forced a good save off the goal keeper Robert Sanchez to deny the striker a free kick goal. Son kept attacking brilliantly to create another good chance a few minutes later which ended up being an off-target shot from Doherty. 
Tottenham finally had their goal with Kane finding the back of the net via a fine header. Son, who had his earlier shot blocked, sent the ball once again towards the near post wherein it was tucked into the net by Harry Kane. 
Both the teams started creating their fair but of chances. Brighton came close with their corner kick towards the later stages of the first half with the attempt from Dunk flying over the crossbar. Hugo Lloris was kept busy regularly by some really good attacks from caicedo who was regularly outplaying the defense with his brilliant trickery. 
The French goal keeper however managed to make good saves to prevent Brighton from finding a much needed equaliser. Both the sides kept the fans at the edge of their seats throughout the second half. However to everyone's surprise none of the teams managed to find any more goals as the game ended 1-0 in Tottenham's favour. None of the sides managed to find their best possible rhythm as they squandered chances one after the other with Kane's header being the difference between the two sides.
