Dance is a motion, an expression, an act or just a moment of fun. Dance has different meaning to different people.
Having various styles and meaning, dance is like a sea where each and every wave has a different story to tell. 
In all these stories, one common chapter that is always on top is The Street style dance. Starting from the ancient times to now. Street style has been evolving at rocket's speed. As the evolution begin, The street style started evolving into Poping, breaking, Locking, Wacking etc. Soon there was a style which was discovered and named as the Urban dance style. This came in action in the urban areas of Brooklyn, New York and other near by places. This was basically started by the Afro Americans and the Lations and soon came into the big picture from past two decades. Urban became the new language of dance. As the world started adopting urban. It became one the most popular dance styles all over the world. Various groups like The royal Family, The Kinjaz, Jabawockeez and solo artists like Brian Puspos, Matt Steffanina, Les twins started creating a revolution through their dance everywhere. But somehow people didn't feel all into this dance form due to its concept of being always news which is signified from the name Urban itself. Many black artists and similar ones starting opposing that Urban doesn't actually makes them feel good. It hampers their emotions. So they started opposing and requesting all the global dance communities to stop stating it this dance style as Urban. This is how Choreography as a style was born. This brought the message that any artist doing any style with his or her own interpretation and meaning regarding the dance is unique and respectful. Any artist can show whatever they like as an artist. And this how urban dance is now termed as Choreography all over the globe.
