The situation at Cagliari is complicated with the Sardinians who lost in the Seriea round against Juventus This is the comment of the rossobl coach at the end of the match We deserved a draw because we were unlucky with their goals We recovered the game but it doesn&#39;t go good nothing If we play with this spirit we can do well The team doesn&#39;t deserve to retire I don&#39;t look at the standings there are finals and points If we always play like this we can score points against everyone We have to avoid technical errors to achieve safety
