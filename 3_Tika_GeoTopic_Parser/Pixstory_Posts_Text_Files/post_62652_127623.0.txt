Pimples can be a nuisance, but they're definitely not worth the risk of getting an infection or scarring. Here are 5 reasons why you should avoid popping pimples:

1. Pimples can easily become infected – bacteria likes to grow in warm, moist environments like those found in pimples. If you get an infection, it will spread throughout your body and may even lead to serious health complications.

2. Pimples often develop into bumpy scars – if you pop them without proper treatment, the pus that accumulates will form bumps (scars) on the skin that won’t go away for a long time. This is especially true if you have acne that’s caused by oil and sebum production, which is common in people with oily skin types.

3. Pimples can become very painful – if they're left untreated, pimples may become infected and extremely painful. This is because pus collects around the follicles (the cells that produce oil and sebum) and causes inflammation and pain.

4. Pimples may blacken or turn brown – this is due to increased production of melanin (a pigment that helps protect the skin from sunlight), which may result in dark spots or brown patches on the skin. 

5. If your pimple is big or deep enough, it might rupture and spread infection throughout your entire body. 

6. Skin loses its naturally elasticity from pulling and pinching at an already sensitive area.


So unless you want to deal with all of these consequences, it's best to just avoid popping your pimples in the first place!
