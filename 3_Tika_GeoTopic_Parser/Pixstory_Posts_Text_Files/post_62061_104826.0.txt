Alexander Zverev tested Rafael Nadal for three hours in the semi-finals until a sickening ankle injury marred the German, forcing him to withdraw, paving the way for Nadal to reach the finals of French Open 

Nadal stands to become the oldest man to win the French Open title that is if he comes out ahead Casper Ruud, the Norwegian whose clay court talents he has personally helped foster. 
Nadal will be competing in his 14th Roland Garros final on Sunday and 30th overall at the Grand Slams. 

Victory will deliver a record-extending 22nd Grand Slam and 14th French Open for Rafael Nadal,17 years after his title winning debut in Paris. 

The 36-year-od Nadal is, however, as surprised as anyone to have got this far. A chronic left foot injury which has haunted his career had reared its ugly head once again in Rome last month, putting a serious question mark over even making it to the French capital. 

And here he stands at the Brink of the history once again. 

“Without a doubt, I’d prefer to lose the final and have a new foot,” admitted Nadal who has not shied away the heart-breaking reality that the match at Sunday may as well be the last one he plays ever.

Despite his fears, Nadal has impressively battled his way into Sunday’s championship match. 

Victory on Sunday will make him the tournament’s oldest champion, eclipsing 34-year-old compatriot Andres Gimeno who took the title 50 years ago. 

Rafa has a date with the destiny on June 6th, Casper Ruud, the in-from clay court player is the last obstacle in Nadal’s path to record extending glory of 22nd Title.
