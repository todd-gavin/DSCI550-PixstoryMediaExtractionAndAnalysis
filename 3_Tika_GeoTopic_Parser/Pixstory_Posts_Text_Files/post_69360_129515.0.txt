The Kashmiri Shahi Zeera, which is known to grow wild in Gurez, also thrives in the Srinagar Airport (an unexpected place to grow a spice), from which locals gather it and sell it in the markets. The spice has a nutty and peppery flavour that improves your cooking abilities in a way that regular zeera cannot. Also known as Kala Jeera, is a staple in Kashmiri cooking and a very well-liked spice in north Indian cooking. Typically used to flavour rice, meat, and vegetable dishes. The word "shahi" is derived from the Persian word "syahi," which means "black." Kala Zeera gets its name from this word. The only area in India where premium black cumin is produced is Kashmir.
