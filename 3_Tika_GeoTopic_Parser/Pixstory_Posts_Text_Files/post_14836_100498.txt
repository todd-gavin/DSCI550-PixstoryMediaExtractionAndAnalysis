The Monzino Cardiological Center has launched a new clinical study on Dapagliflozin, one of the most innovative and promising drugs against heart failure, of which the Milanese center is the leading prescriber in Italy. recently in clinical routine which, despite having demonstrated their efficacy for some aspects of heart failure, can be better evaluated in the field to study all their potential benefits and understand their mechanisms of action. The study on Dapagliflozin is an autonomous and independent initiative by Monzino without any external sponsorship. Monzino study envisages enrolling a minimum of patients to carry out for the first time a complete multidisciplinary evaluation blood chemistry tests including new generation biomarkers cardiopulmonary exercise tests respiratory function tests sleep analysis with nocturnal apneas and echocardiogram DI new data collected in this way will allow to take stock of the therapy of heart failure with reduced systolic function which in recent years has made extraordinary progress also thanks to the discovery of SGLT i. The pharmacological class of SGLT i represents a fine example of serendipity, i.e. the casual discovery of an unexpected benefit of a a drug that was previously used for a completely different purpose explains Massimo Mapelli of the Department of Critical and Rehabilitative Cardiology, coordinator of the study In this case the drug was and remains an anti-diabetic drug which, however, has been seen to work just as well if not better in patients with heart failure without diabetes mellitus II At Monzino we prescribed Dapagliflozin to patients with heart failure in months regardless of diabetes and we drew up the first therapeutic plan in Lombardy Today we can talk about the pillars of anti-heart failure therapy SGLTs and then beta-blockers anti-aldosterones and sacubitril valsartan continues Piergiuseppe Agostoni Director of the Department of Critical and Rehabilitative Cardiology Monzino Full professor of cardiovascular diseases at the University of Milan These drugs have changed the guidelines and if the treatment is started early in the first stages of heart disease, they really make it possible to cure these patients, obtaining a reduction of mortality that in the latest meta-analyses reaches
