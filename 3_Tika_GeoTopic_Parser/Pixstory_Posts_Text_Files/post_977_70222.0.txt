Virat Kohli  Saturday stepped down from Test match captaincy. “Everything has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test captain of India, it’s now. There have been many ups and also some downs along the journey but there has never been lack of effort or lack of belief,” Kohli wrote in a statement which he posted on Twitter, taking everyone by surprise.

Virat Kohli led India in 68 matches and has been the most successful captain with 40 wins. Virat Kohli was appointed Test captain back in 2014 when MS Dhoni stepped down in the middle of the series against Australia.
