PEACE..
Peace is not to be alone where there is no noise but it means to be in all those where you still feel calm .
        It will stay as a dream if we refuse to look beyond colour and caste .We can't force peace neither we can force to be in peace .The dream for peace will be achieved if we all understand each other .. 
     JUST COME TOGETHER AND ACHIEVE PEACE TOGETHER. WITHOUT ANY  CONFUSION .. SO LETS BEGIN ..
