Former NBA standout Ben Gordon is facing multiple charges after allegedly punching his 10-year-old son in the face at a New York City airport, per TMZ Sports. Gordon, 39, was arrested on Monday night after an American Airlines employee told Port Authority Police that they witnessed the former NBA star hit his son in the face at LaGuardia Airport "multiple times." 
Gordon allegedly resisted being placed in handcuffs and reportedly said, "I am not going with you guys." Two officers say they sustained injuries in the alternation. One alleges to have injured a knee, and the other claims to have injured an arm and a wrist. 
In total, Gordon facies nine charges. He was charged with two counts of second-degree assault, one count of third-degree assault, resisting arrest and endangering the welfare of a child among other things. Gordon's son was taken to a nearby hospital for further evaluation. The extent of the boy's injuries are not known at this time.
