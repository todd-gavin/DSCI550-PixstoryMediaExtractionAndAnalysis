You look in the mirror and wonder if you're enough. The pain surrounding your heart keeps you trapped, and you wonder if you'll ever be able to become the person you've always wanted to be. You compare yourself to everyone you meet. You go through old photos and cry over the person you used to be. You see your reflection in the water and intensely dislike the person you've become. You want to be someone, but you're not sure who. You put yourself in a box, thinking you can't be him if you're not like that, thinking that who you are today cannot reflect who you will be tomorrow. But, buddy, you can be both.
You can be what ever you want. You could be the one who sings his heart out on the balcony late at night. You could be the one chasing the football in the rain. You can be the guy who enjoys reading. You can be the one to speak up for yourself. You can be the first person to leave. You can try new things, push yourself, and still be who you are. Don't limit yourself for the sake of others' comfort. You are capable of being both.
