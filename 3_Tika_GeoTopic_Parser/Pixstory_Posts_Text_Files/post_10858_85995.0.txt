Through her four years at PSG, Paulina has found that creating strong connections with teammates and believing in oneself can be crucial in manifesting the dream of playing for the biggest football clubs in Europe.

“The atmosphere is really good for me – we know each other, we understand each other more and more really, like everyday on the trainings and especially in the games,” Paulina says.

Some of the most memorable moments since Paulina signed with PSG Féminine in 2018, include the club’s title as the French Champions last season.

“The moment when we realized that we won the league – that’s the moment we would want to feel again, and to have again, and that's what we are working on,” Paulina said.

Celebrating a win comes with the simplicity of togetherness in the first moments of joy: leaving the fields as a team, unwinding in the changing rooms, cracking jokes: “You feel that kind of synergy, all of us are in the same moment, happy and enjoying… and of course, like good food after – just to be with each other,” Paulina says.

Along with the thrill of playing as a French champion, Paulina appreciates the chance to explore new places while learning about different cultures in her travels to different countries for games.

“I'm just glad that PSG lets me play here,” Paulina said. “It's really important for me to learn new languages, meet new people, see sometimes, the different side of the same thing.”
