Then why even support a profession that in itself is an epitome of violence or is advocating the ideas that would in any way try to make it bad for the people working under its periphery?
Legalizing it would instead validate the violence that is already existing, and speaking of rights, no women would want to be used as objects even if they're given the right to live with it.

I would not argue for ending prostitution because it is considered as immoral ( though it is apparently immoral to see women as objects). Still, I abhor this idea of using women as sex objects and making men assume that they're entitled to access women's bodies for their pleasure.

Moreover, if this is going to be normalized, it normalized support the already existing views of people who consider women as commodities made to be bought and sold.

I think the origin of this whole narrative and idea is deplorable, and nothing in this world would or can validate it.
