A close feat for Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon Opposed to the defending champion Novak Djokovic, the South Tyrolean won the first two sets only to surrender in the fifth after hours and minutes of match with the score in favor of the Serbian A match that started with Djokovic launched by an immediate break in the second game but which Sinner had been able to recover in the seventh before breaking his service again on and flying away to success in the first set The momentum continued in the second set where the blue broke his opponent&#39;s serve twice, clamorously moving forward of two sets Here, as often happens in matches that are played in the best of five sets, the experience of the over thirty Djokovic came out at the distance, who won the third set with a break in the fourth game and then dominated the fourth set, immediately taking on a similar script in the last set with the inertia of the match now turned in favor of the Serbian who closes with two breaks and qualifies for the semifinal. The twenty-year-old Sinner is left with many compliments and the belief that in the future this tournament could end up in his hands
