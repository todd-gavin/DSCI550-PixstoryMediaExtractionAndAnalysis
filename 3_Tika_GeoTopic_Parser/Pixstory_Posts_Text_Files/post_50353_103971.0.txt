Several Raids were conducted in the jungles and in the diaras to recover the kidnapped child. But it was proving to be futile, when suddenly one fine day when it was quite cold, one informer came with the vital clue. 

The gang of Rudal Yadav had been camping in a diara area of UP just across the border of Bihar. A police team under SI Sheomuni Prasad had been sent to follow the trail when they met in an encounter. The child was recovered. Two dacoits were killed in the encounter, while four others fled taking advantage of the cover provided by the dense sugarcane fields. A cordon was placed during the night to catch the dacoits who were presumed to be hiding in the dense sugarcane, but they somehow managed to escape. The gang of Rudal Yadav was shattered, and two of his main kingpins were no more. The confidence of the public was restored, and surrender became the preferred option for most of the gangs operating in the diaras of Champaran. The gangs of Ramakant Yadav and Ranglal Yadav surrendered in March 2008 in front of a very large crowd.

 The final moment of glory was the surrender of the dreaded Vasudeo Yadav in May 2008, before a large crowd which had gathered to see him in front of the SP’s office in Bagaha. It was covered live by ETV, Bihar. Vasudeo Yadav was believed to be the pillar of the crime in Bagaha, and he had fallen. He had more than 100 cases to be tried for at the time of his arrest and carried a reward of Two Lakh Rupees. He was also wanted for a massacre in Marchahwa. Later Asharfi Yadav also surrendered. The money received from the Government for the rehabilitation of the dacoits was immediately released, and it led to confidence in the claims of the Police Leadership.
