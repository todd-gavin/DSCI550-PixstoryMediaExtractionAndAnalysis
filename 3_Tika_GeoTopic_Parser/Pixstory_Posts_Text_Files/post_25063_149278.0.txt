Gabriel Jesus made his switch to Arsenal this summer after a long stint at Manchester City. The Brazilian striker has made quite an impression in the opening few fixtures, netting four times and providing three assists in seven Premier League fixtures.
His performances have helped Arsenal claik the top spot in the domestic league, as they have collected 18 points from seven games, with their sole loss coming against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
Ex-Aston Villa skipper Gabriel Agbonlahor   has deemed Gabriel Jesus as the best summer signing of the season. The former English striker has rated the Gunners striker even higher than Manchester City's star signing Erling Haaland. 
The former Borussia Dortmund striker has already netted 14 times and provided one assist jn all competitions so far. However, Gabriel Agbonlahor believes that Manchester City have always scored magnificent goals, and that would still be the case without Erling Haaland.
"Best signing is Gabriel Jesus for me. Haaland has been outstanding, but City always did well without Haaland and scored ridiculous goals without Haaland. Gabriel Jesus has turned Arsenal into something else. They have got a striker now who doesn’t labour when he is pressing defenders," he said.
Arsenal are scheduled to face Spurs in a crunch North London Derby this weekend, as club footba returns after an International break. The Gunners' last competitive outing was against Brentford, against whom they managed to claim a convincing 3-0 away victory.
