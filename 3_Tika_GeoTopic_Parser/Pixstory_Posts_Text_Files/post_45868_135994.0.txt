Mom burnout is one of the worst things that can happen to any mom. Especially single mothers. So here are some tips by pragmatic parent to deal with it! 

- Make a schedule that both of your kids can follow. Picture routine cards are a terrific technique to teach toddlers a routine that they can independently follow throughout the day if you have young children. 

How does this work? The organisation of a routine will help you know what to expect from the day and be more aware of behaviour shifts in your children (like when they are tired, hungry, thirsty, etc.). Having a routine will also help your children manage expectations, sleep and eating schedules. and when you might have some time to yourself later, such as during a nap, quiet time, or bedtime.

- Let your kids be! There is a widespread misconception today that we must always play with our children and keep them occupied. 

How will your children ever learn to play and enjoy themselves if you are constantly doing it for them? 

It's completely acceptable to watch from the sidelines as your kids engage in independent play and exploration in their own environment (after you've made sure everything is secure, of course). In fact, it has been demonstrated that encouraging this would help them become more independent and motivated to learn.
