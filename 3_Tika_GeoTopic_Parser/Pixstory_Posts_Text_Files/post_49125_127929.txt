Golf is an important part of American culture and we shouldn t shut down our golf courses just because of the current problems that can have better solutions than taking away people s hobbies from them Golf has been a part of American culture since the early s and it has played a big role in building our country It s been credited with bringing people together and helping to create stronger ties between different parts of society In fact golf is now more than just a game it s an obsession that many people hold dear The fact that we re in the middle of a crisis doesn t mean that we should stop playing golf altogether Golf courses are often seen as symbols of togetherness and prestige They re places where people from all walks of life can come together and have a good time something that s essential in a society like America where social mobility is so high We need to preserve our culture By doing this we can help preserve our golf courses and help ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy them too There are many shelters for the homeless already We can just do that better no need to sabotage our culture for anything
