Serbia won the match thanks to a goal from Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic.

Slovenia vs Serbia: Prediction

Slovenia's defensive tenacity was on display against Norway on Thursday, but they may find it
difficult to keep Mitrovic, Milinkovic-Savic, and Tadic quiet in the last third on Sunday.The visitors
were clinical against the hosts in their last meeting, and they should have no trouble getting all
three points in Ljubljana.

Prediction: Slovenia 0-2 Serbia
