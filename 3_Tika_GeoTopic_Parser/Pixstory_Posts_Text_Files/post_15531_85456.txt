Today I visited the Pope&#39;s summer villa in Castel Gandolfo near Rome The internal palace is rich in history and wonderful and after doing some separate posts Here I focus on the wonderful garden full of Roman ruins and memories that the various popes of history have brought here like a wooden crucifix given to Pope John Paul II by a mountain community The route is very long and there is a risk of getting lost so you are accompanied by a guide aboard a ket At the top of the garden there is a breathtaking viewpoint from where you can admire the sunset on the sea The top is a place much loved by the popes to gather in prayer a corner with the statue of the Madonna If you come to Italy you must absolutely visit it
