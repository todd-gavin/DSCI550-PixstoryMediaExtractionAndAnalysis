The first period begins with the issue of a commemorative stamp on Ambedkar in 1966 and ends with another commemorative stamp issued in 1991 after he was posthumously conferred with the Bharat Ratna. The material of this period is limited to commemorative releases that portray him as a standalone political figure and social reformer. The second period (1992 – 2010), when Ambedkar was included in the definitive series, marks his entry into the philatelic pantheon hitherto restricted to Gandhi and Nehru. Also, in this period Ambedkar is no longer confined to commemorative stamps and he figures on a very wide variety of philatelic material. In the third period (2012-22), postage stamps and special covers celebrate him as a pan Indian leader by representing the different stages of his life and tracing his journey across the country. The segments on postal stationery and special covers commemorating the platinum jubilee of Ambedkar’s tour through coastal Andhra Pradesh are among the highlights of the exhibition.
