Whatever has happened to Dragon Ball is the million dollar question Once the Super Saiyan transformation and all its variants like Ascended Super Saiyan Ultra Super Saiyan Full Powered Super Saiyan and Gohan s Super Saiyan gave us chills Then you had Majin Vegeta s Super Saiyan Goku and Gotenks going Super Saiyan and Gohan becoming Ultimate Gohan Then you had the god transformations for Goku and Vegeta Super Saiyan God and then Super Saiyan Blue Enter Dragon Ball Super and the transformations not only stop making sense they stop mattering altogether For some they stopped mattering by Dragon Ball Z but by Super they really outdid themselves in pulling thin all the transformations SSJ Blue SSJ Blue Kaioken and Ascended Blue in the anime have become totally worthless and uncool not to mention poorly animated Unlike the manga where they still stay relevant and make sense even if they are still stupid Well now you have Goku s Ultra Instinct which is absolute trash and Vegeta s Ultra Ego which is surprisingly cool though Akira Toriyama s manga is as predictable as the next villain s motivation in Naruto and him going Oh we suffered the same pain Society was unkind world was cruel we are the same and bla bla bla Vegeta may have closed the gap in power against Goku in both the manga and the anime but the fact is that Toriyama will never make Vegeta the hero in spite of the thousands of requests to make him so No Goku who is now apparently an uncaring selfish dumbass of a fighter and friend instead of the once childlike but nonetheless really likable and still smart and mature enough father husband and fighter has to always be the one to save the day But coming back to the issue yeah while Dragon Ball Super Super Hero might be dominating all the talk regarding Dragon Ball Super issues these ultra liberties taken with introducing new transformations like it is annual super sale needs to be stopped For all the things that matter the transformations are already reduced to being irrelevant if not outright annoying
