Abortion pro groups usually use religion as their tool for the debate saying that abortion infringes religious freedom. A synagogue in Florida has come up with a claim that the argument that banning abortion violates Jewish religious liberty.

In a lawsuit against the Florida government, Congregation L’Dor Va-Dor of Boynton Beach says that the state's pending abortion law, which bans abortion after 15 weeks with few exceptions, infringes the Jewish teaching that abortion "is required if necessary to protect the health, mental or physical well-being of the woman.” Citing the constitutional right to freedom of religion, the lawsuit asserts that the act "prohibits Jewish women from practicing their faith free of government intrusion and this violates their privacy rights and religious freedom."

Florida's famous 15-week abortion ban bill which was signed Inside a church by Ron DeSantis grants exceptions if the mother's life is at risk, if she is at risk of "irreversible physical impairment" or if the fetus is found to have a fatal abnormality. There are no exceptions for rape, incest, or human trafficking.

If Jewish law stipulates that access to abortion is required not only for a woman's physical well-being but also her mental well-being this criminalizes religious freedom.
