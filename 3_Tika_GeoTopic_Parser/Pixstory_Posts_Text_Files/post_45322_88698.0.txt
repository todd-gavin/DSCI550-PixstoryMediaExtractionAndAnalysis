Before the match against Feyenoord, Erik ten Hag had this to say:
"I have been busy with Feyenoord. I know their principles and I can imagine what they are like. Yesterday I did not see much of their match, but I know how they play. They have no secrets for me."

"But now it's a totally different Feyenoord than in recent years. Feyenoord wants to dominate on the ball, they have an idea on the ball and exert high pressure with equally high intensity. That's a difference from previous years."

That Feyenoord comes straight after such a midweek deception doesn't bother Ten Hag much. "There's not much you can do about it. I think it's fine. It's a big game in which we can really wash away the nasty taste of the European elimination."
