Well , jokes apart guys ! 

We have all been constipated at some point in our life , and no one can deny it . It can be uncomfortable when you try your best to get those pesky , hard stools out of your body , but all you do is strain and get nowhere .

Are you also tired of Trying alot of remedies for constipation ? But nothing worked ! Well ,  Don't worry ! I'm gonna tell you the Easiest way of saying goodbye to constipation ! 

Any guesses ?? 
Its *POPCORN* Yes , you heard me right ! 

I can‚Äôt imagine a movie night without a bowl of popcorn . Especially stuffing my mouth during twists in the plot ! 

This delicious , crispy , and easy-to-make in fact , very healthy snack . It is rich in dietary fiber and thus known to aid digestive health . It even works well as a remedy for constipation .

Air-popped popcorn is a good choice for a high-fiber snack that can help provide relief from constipation . A filling 3 cups of air-popped popcorn contains 3.5 g fiber , and less than 100 calories , which is roughly equivalent to one cup of brown rice or a cup of cooked oatmeal . 

If you‚Äôre trying to fix your constipation problem , try making the switch from microwave or stovetop popcorn to air-popped popcorn . And Don't Burry your popcorn in Salt and Butter ! 

*Remember*
There is nothing to be ashamed of , if you are having problem of constipation . 

Soo ? Eat popcorns , Say Friendly Goodbye to constipation ! And Thank me Later üí≠‚ù§Ô∏è
