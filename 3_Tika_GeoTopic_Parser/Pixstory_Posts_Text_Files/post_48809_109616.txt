The federal constitutional right to an abortion has been abolished as a result of the Supreme Court recently overturning over years of precedent and Roe v Wade The majority of states are anticipated to outlaw abortion And who turned it around Roe v Wade was overturned by two sex offenders Submitted by a corrupt president who has been twice impeached Such people are sitting in power to dictate the lives of millions of women trans men and non binary people People will be forced to change their lives when they can t afford to All because of a man s opinion People who experience ectopic pregnancies miscarriages stillbirths chemical pregnancies neonatal pregnancies or any other life threatening pregnancy will suffer All women are targets of abortion restrictions but the poor those of colour and those who are in abusive relationships are disproportionately affected This is forcing them to die this is taking away so many people s lives from them Don t you dare say it s pro life If it was about the lives of the babies healthcare would be free daycare would be free So many children wouldn t be living on streets so many children wouldn t be getting murdered for their skin color religion ethnicity If it was to protect children it would have protected children It s about power control and misogyny The most dangerous and influential ideology in this nation at the moment is Christian fascism And that is destroying all of us Today we are the targets tomorrow it will be you
