The Indian Eves won their first game against Ghana by 5-0 at the Commonwealth Games. 

Although the team might have won the game, they wouldn't be the happier side as they were expected to beat their opponents by a far bigger margin.  India opened their account within the first 3 minutes itself but after that Ghana defended really well to not concede goals at regular intervals. 

The Indian team managed to get 10 short-corners but failed to convert 9 off them. This was their biggest issue in the just concluded World Cup and they seemed to have carried the same problem at the games.  It might not have cost them against Ghana but low conversion rate of penalty corners may come back to haunt them against better opponents. 

India plays Wales in their next encounter on the 2nd day of the mega-event. Wales lost 4-0 to Canada on the opening day. But they had beaten India 4-3 in the previous edition at Gold Coast, so the Indian team would be wary of them. The Savita Punia led side would hope to start converting their PCs into goals. If India wins this game they will put their one foot in the semi-finals.
