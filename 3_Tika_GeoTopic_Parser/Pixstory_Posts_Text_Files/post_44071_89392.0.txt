11) 22-24th July- France

Circuit Paul Ricard holds the rare distinction of hosting the first-ever F1 race and evidently is one of the oldest circuits on the grid. After being scrapped off the race calendar in 2008, it made a comeback in 2018 and has been a regular feature since then. The blue and red striped run-off areas are the highlights here, setting it apart from the other circuits. In 2021, Max continued his dominance by winning the race with his rival Hamilton a close second.

12) 29-31th July- Hungary

With its own share of twisty hairpin curves and turns, Hungaroring is affectionately dubbed “Monaco without the walls”. Debuting in 1986, the Hungarian GP has been a regular feature in all editions since then. With overtakes being a rare possibility, races are often won here on pit strategy. The 2021 Hungarian GP shuffled up the pecking order with a number of DNFs. This opened up the door for Alpine’s Esteban Ocon who registered his first win in his F1 career.  

13) 26-28th August- Belgium

At 7 kilometers, Circuit Spa-Francorchamps is the longest circuit on the F1 race calendar. It’ll be the first race that the1 drivers will be competing in following the summer break. With long straights, extensive corners, and highly unpredictable weather, it’ll require utmost concentration on the part of drivers to even finish the race. The 2021 edition was cut short as heavy rains wreaked havoc, but we might get to see all 44 laps of racing action this year.

14) 02-04th September- Netherlands

Circuit Zandvoort officially returned to the racing calendar in 2021 after its 37-year absence. After being extensively reworked, the circuit now features 14 turns and two DRS zones. Dutchman Max Verstappen will clearly be the fan-favorite here and will be keen to replicate his commanding win in 2021 where he finished more than 20 seconds of Hamilton.
