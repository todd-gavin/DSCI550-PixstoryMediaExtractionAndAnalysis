Done is better than Perfect.

I cannot study but I have to prepare for the exams.
And the reason I am studying is that I am not focused so I feel lazy & then I procrastinate.

I want to get everything covered so it's a bit lengthy & my mind refuses to do that because it hates hard work.

One of the factors is my Habits, my habits are disorganized & full of addictive tasks. Like Scrolling Feed, Watching Videos & Doing something with the phone. I use half of a day facing a Screen (that's too much).

So I decided to break that heavy goal into small tasks that can be less time-consuming & easy for my mind. I just have to get things (small tasks) done without worrying about the bigger goal.

That's why I focus more on doing  than waiting for perfection.
