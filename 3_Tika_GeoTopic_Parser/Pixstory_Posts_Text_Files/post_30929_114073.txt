Bad day for Primoz Roglic the most accredited opponent of the great favorite Tadej Pogacar for the conquest of the Tour de France Today the Jumbo Visma cyclist crashed in the final stage of the fifth stage, losing from the leaders but above all dislocating his left shoulder A physical problem that Roglic himself he fixed it himself as he explained at the end of the stage I stood up quickly and got back on the saddle but very soon I realized that I couldn&#39;t continue like this I had to stop to put my shoulder back in place it had happened to me before and I know how to do it the knee and strong shot Roglic for now has no intention of raising the white flag I don&#39;t know what state I&#39;ll be in For now I won&#39;t tell myself that I lost the Tour I will try to recover Roglic is now in the yellow jersey Wout Van Aert and his rival Pogacar
