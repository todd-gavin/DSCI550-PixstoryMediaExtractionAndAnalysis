Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects as well as on vulnerable societies are a concern for the entire scientific community Rising temperatures heat waves floods tornadoes hurricanes droughts fires loss of forest and glaciers along with the disappearance of rivers can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental However there is a clear lack of psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change Climate change has an impact on a large part of the population in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health However the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect The lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly some mental disorders are common and others are more specific about atypical climatic conditions Moreover climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions as well as a lack of access to resources information and protection Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms coined only recently eco anxiety eco guilt ecopsychology ecological grief solastalgia biospheric concern etc For more details
