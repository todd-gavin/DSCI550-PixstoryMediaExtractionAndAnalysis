Manchester United striker Cristiano Ronaldo is scheduled to meet up with the first team manager Erik Ten Hag today. The scheduled meeting is being conducted to have a discussion regarding the striker's future with the club. 

Cristiano Ronaldo and his agent have made it clear that they do not intend on staying at United this season. The Red Devils failed to qualify for the Champions League and this is the main reason why CR7 wants to move on to another club. The Portuguese international has reportedly been offered to multiple clubs including PSG, Bayern Munich, and Chelsea but none of the aforementioned clubs have decided to sign him. 

Manchester United on the other hand have stated that Ronaldo is not for sale. This statement has been repeated by the manager Erik Ten Hag himself. The Dutchman has stated that he is looking forward to working with CR7 in the upcoming season! 

As per BBC Sports, Cristiano Ronaldo is due to meet Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag on Tuesday to discuss his future at the club. The Portugal forward wants the club to let him leave this summer and he missed United's pre-season tour to Thailand and Australia because of personal reasons.

It has to be seen if the meeting could bring about any positives for the United management and the fans as they look forth to start a positive season.
