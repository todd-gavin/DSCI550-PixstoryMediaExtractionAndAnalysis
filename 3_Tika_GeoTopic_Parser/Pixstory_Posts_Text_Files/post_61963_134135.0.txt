The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s expansion never seems to end. There are constant rumors surrounding the latest heroes and villains that might join the ever-growing line-up and each one is as exciting as the last. While not all of them pay off, every now and then there’s a nugget of information that could hint to the future of Marvel Studios’ plans. 
The rumor mill is always buzzing, but the concept that the Squadron Supreme might be making their way to the MCU has begun to pick up traction. It’s to be taken with a big grain of salt, but sites like CineStealth have noted that big plans are in place for the group. Most notably, the rumors indicate that not only will the team be established in a similar manner to the comics, but their presentation will take inspiration from The Boys
Needless to say, that gritty and political approach, combined with shocking and over the top moments and topical humor, could really allow the Squadron to stand out in comparison to the other superhero units at Marvel. The success of The Boys is also something that the MCU could ironically benefit from, allowing the studio to access the meta market as audiences look for a more realistic approach to storytelling that isn’t afraid to point out the flaws of the genre. 
It’s better to be in on the joke and capitalizing on the consequences than trailing behind and ignoring the essential point that the very existence of The Boys attempts to make! Plus, there’s something quite innovative and fresh about the style of the Prime series that could rejuvenate some of Marvel’s familiar tropes.
