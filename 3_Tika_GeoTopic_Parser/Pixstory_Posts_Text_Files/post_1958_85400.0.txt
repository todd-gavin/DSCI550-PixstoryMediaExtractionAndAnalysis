At the 2022 State of the Union address, President Biden honored the two NYPD officers who were tragically killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Harlem, New York in January. While honoring the slain officers, President Biden stated “We should all agree: The answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to find the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.”

This is not to say that Bidens speech was satisfactory by any means, but it is certainly refreshing to hear a Democrat diverging from their party’s mainstream policies and not calling for the defunding of police. Our nations police officers face dangers every day, and if they are not well-equipped to handle and prevent those dangers, then we will have less people who are and are willing to protect us. 

What are your thoughts? What did you think of Biden’s State of the Union address?
