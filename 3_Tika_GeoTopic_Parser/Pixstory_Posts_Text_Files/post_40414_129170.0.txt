There are many reasons why the death penalty is questionable. Firstly, its use is often biased against minority groups. For example, Black people are disproportionately represented among those sentenced to death in the United States. This is due not just to their disproportionate involvement in crime but also their poorer legal representation when they go to court. 

Secondly, there are concerns about its effectiveness as a punishment. Studies show that it doesn't deter crime â€“ in fact, it may even lead to more crime because it creates feelings of revenge or retribution among criminals. 

The death penalty has been practiced for centuries, and its history is riddled with horrors.

Innocent people are disproportionately sentenced to death row. And it's just not stupid fines. People DIE because of one misplaced judgement. This happens because prosecutors use circumstantial evidence, which can be unreliable and unfair. Additionally, juries are often influenced by media coverage of a particular case, which can lead to unfair verdicts.

In addition to its inherent flaws, the death penalty also has other negative effects on society as a whole. For one thing, it costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year, and it doesn't always result in convictions or justice being served. In fact, there have been numerous cases where innocent people have spent years on Death Row before they were eventually released due to new evidence or mistakes made by authorities involved in their case.

Considering all these facts, it's clear that the death penalty is an ineffective and unjust way of dealing with criminals - and should be abolished altogether!
