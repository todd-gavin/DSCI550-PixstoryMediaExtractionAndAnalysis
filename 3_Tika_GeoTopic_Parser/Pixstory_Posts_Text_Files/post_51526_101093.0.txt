In 2012 when a 27-old-year old Croatian signed for Real Madrid, the media didn't resist themselves from criticising the player and the club. 

Spanish news outlet MARCA termed him 'the worst signing of the year' in 2012. Fast-forward to 2022, the same Croatian going by the name of Luka Modrić having 4 UEFA Champions League and a Ballon D'or among other notable awards received the honorable 'Leyenda' award from MARCA who supposedly (during 2012) failed to recognise what a giant Luka Modrić would become in the following years.

The credit should always go to Jose Mourinho who was the first one to recognise Luka's talent in Tottenham and urged Florentino Perez to do whatever he can to bring the Croatian to Madrid.

In 2021, Mourinho's interview to talksport summarises Luka's playing style, talent and his longevity 

He said:  “Luka is one of those players who when he ends his career in a couple of years or so, people like us who love football, we are going to be very sad.

“He’s absolutely fantastic. When I asked Florentino Perez to buy him, I don’t want to remember the occasion because it was really hard to deal with Tottenham

"In the end he arrived in Madrid and stayed for ten years at the biggest club with the biggest pressure and absolutely amazing."

" You don’t know if he is right or left footed, the way he analyses everyone around him, it looks like there is no pressure and no players around him.

“The way he thinks is fantastic, then he’s such a humble guy inside the pitch, the way he works for the team. He’s such a humble guy outside.

“I think yesterday when he left the pitch on a substitution at extra-time; I think it was not just the Croatia crowd applauding him, but the whole stadium, even the Spanish ones." [In respect to the Spain vs Croatia game]

May your magic never end Luka!
