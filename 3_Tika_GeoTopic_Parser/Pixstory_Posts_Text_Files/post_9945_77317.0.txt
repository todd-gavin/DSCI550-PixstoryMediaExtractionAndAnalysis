A report published by the 

European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control

 in July, when the Delta variant of SARS-CoV2 was widespread globally, had stated the benefits of keeping schools open far outweighed the risks posed by disease transmission in children, especially because data suggested that school-going children were less likely to develop severe symptoms even if they got the disease. “...the decision to close schools to control the pandemic should be used as a last resort,” it said.


Ashok Agarwal, a lawyer and public health activist, said keeping schools shut was wrong. “Governments don’t want to take risks or make arrangements to ensure continuation of academic activities with adherence to Covid protocols,” he said.


“The parents of children are going out for work, coming back and infecting children. Many kids are getting infected when they go to play in the park. So, closing schools doesn’t really serve any purpose. They should be opened, especially because all available data suggests children who don’t have any underlying medical condition are less likely to develop complications,” Agarwal added.

The Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM), a consortium of leading public health experts, has strongly advocated reopening schools. Dr 

Suneela Garg

, president, IAPSM, said even the pre-school classes should resume. “Losses from closure are beyond recovery. It has led to child dropout and even child marriages,” she added.
