Right then The winning streak is over United A game that I think everyone will admit we were the better team in for minutes but ultimately our opposition were clinical Terrible defending As always let s do some player ratings Ramsdale Not the reason we lost but conceded three One nice save from his mistake Zinchenko Not bad Could have done a lot better for the first goal Gabriel Seems to struggle in the big occasions Saliba First game against the Big and he struggled Poor for the goals White Not a terrible performance but ultimately he was part of a back that conceded Lokonga Unfortunately our fears were right Just looked out of place today Xhaka Didn t have his finest game but was far from bad degaard Thought he was good today but my god Please shoot when you can Martinelli Always bright one of our best players l Jesus Kept getting fouled referee gave him no help He was good I thought Saka Happy that he got his goal He was pretty good today Unlucky to be on the losing team As for the substitutes I don t have much to say I thought Arteta was naive for his first three they were always going to score against that midfield we had Vieira looked up for the occasion it s good to finally see him We have to go again
