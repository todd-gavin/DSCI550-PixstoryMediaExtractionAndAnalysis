Gabriel Jesus is expected to score at least Premier League goals this season for the Gunners Three goals in his first six games especially a great composed finish against Leicster but it has been everything else that comes with the Brazilian the pressing interplay and relentless hard work that has captured the imagination of a fanbase who have been crying out for a do it all striker since Pierre Emerick Aubameyang went off the boil perhaps even since Robin van Persie left In what appears to be the penultimate step in their pursuit of a new striker Arsenal and Manchester City reached an agreement on a million fee for the forward Mikel Arteta s team s primary goal scorer a position the four time Premier League winner will easily fill It would be incredible if Arsenal s newest acquisition didn t score Premier League goals for Arsenal this campaign We re not sure if a number nine can be that though given the way Mikel Arteta prefers to play Because of this Pierre Emerick Aubameyang excelled as a goal scorer He wasn t a true nine instead he was a number who used his speed to play off the sides The Gabriel Jesus controversy is quite contentious He wasn t a fan and didn t always play for Pep Guardiola s team so it would be astonishing if he didn t score a minimum of goals this season for Arsenal now that he is there Jesus enjoys doing things like that Arsenal missed out on his ability to play it around the boundary of the box with a great burst of pace Because he was typically deployed sporadically Jesus struggled to reach the Premier League goal mark during any of his five years at City under Guardiola The Brazilian s finest performance came during the Premier League season when he scored goals in appearances Jesus scored goals overall for City in league games
