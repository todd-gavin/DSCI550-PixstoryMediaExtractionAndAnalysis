The days of the blackbird are the 11th and January In the peasant tradition they have always been considered the coldest of the whole winter even if in recent years this has not been the case today, for example in Milan it was almost a spring day with temperatures decidedly outside the seasonal averages and in the central hours of the day there were good degrees Regardless of how it went today let&#39;s get back to us and talk about blackbirds Legend has it that these birds in ancient times were white, not with black plumage for the males and gray brown in the females as used to to see them today During the end of January a blackbird took refuge for three days in the chimney of a fireplace to shelter from a strong storm and came out black from the soot From then on the blackbirds were black This is only one of the versions about the origin of the name given to these three days Another romantic legend tells that a young girl lived on the opposite bank of the river from her beloved and that during the winter she could not see him because the road was too long and cold to set out before the spring The young girl prayed that the river would freeze so that she could cross it and be reunited with her love She prayed so much that her wish was fulfilled And what does blackbirds have to do with it Nothing the young girl was called Merla and from there the name these days
