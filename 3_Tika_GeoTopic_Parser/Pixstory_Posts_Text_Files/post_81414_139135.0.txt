In two seasons since the start of 2020-21, Granit Xhaka scored twice and assisted four times. In just 6 matches in 2022-23, he has matched 50% of his tally over 58 appearances playing in an unanticipated box-to-box role.
Xhaka has always been a personality that splits Arsenal fans. Last summer he nearly left the club when Jose Mourinho and Roma came knocking. He stayed and Arsenal are much better for it.
The Swiss international has been relied upon by manager Mikel Arteta throughout his time at the Emirates. Most people though thought he would be at the edge of the squad, being phased out as Sambi Lokonga and Fabio Vieira came through. Few would have predicted his current role of becoming an attacking threat with runs from deep.
It is a very small sample size but the change is clear. Xhaka is passing less and creating more. Compared to the rest of his Arsenal career, he has 61.8 touches per 90 this season against 85.5. However, touches in the attacking third (22.5 vs 17.3) and in the penalty box (3.83 vs 0.81) have gone up drastically.
The midfielder is also tackling less and being more productive going forward. At Arsenal, Xhaka has been the one who used to receive the first pass from the defence and orchestrate the progression into the final third. Now he stays high in the middle third, usually in the left channel, and waits for opportune moments to stretch the opposing defence and get in behind.
Arteta’s reasoning is sound - Xhaka’s physicality makes him a better box presence than Smith-Rowe and it frees up Odegaard to roam and construct attacks. The nearly 30-year old also has excellent technique when striking the ball.
It is still a curious development in some ways. Players tend to move to roles that reduce their physical burden as they grow older. Xhaka is going the other way but it is an experiment worth undertaking for Arteta, and one that seems to be reaping rewards already.
