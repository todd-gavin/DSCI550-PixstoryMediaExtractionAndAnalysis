Russia s isolation from international sport continues after UEFA confirmed the country would be excluded from qualification for Euro Russia has been banned from UEFA and FIFA competitions since it launched its invasion of Ukraine in February with the Court of Arbitration dismissing an appeal against that ban in July This is not today s decision The decision regarding Russian national and clubs teams on their suspension it was a decision taken until further notice which means that until we decide otherwise this will remain on place That means we don t have to take a decision when another competition it comes We hope that the war will end as soon as possible so we can have the national team of Russia in our competitions but the situation as it is is such that we can even discuss it Aleksander Ceferin UEFA president said We are not considering such a Euro tournament in or countries That was complicated enough and with Covid it was even more complicated Switzerland played one match in Rome and then in Baku and there were teams that played at home all the time and those teams that did not travel and played at home ended up in the final We don t like that concept I think it was a good idea because it was the th anniversary of Pan European friendship and those were the elements of that idea of the Euro I am not saying the idea as such it was bad but my feeling is that the Euro should take place in one or two countries but it is very difficult that we will repeat such an exercise any time soon
