'ATEEZ THE WORLD EP.1: MOVEMENT' is set for release on July 29.

Days before its scheduled release, copies of ATEEZ's upcoming record "ATEEZ THE WORLD EP.1: MOVEMENT" was unintentionally sold by a Las Vegas music store. 

On July 24, which would be today, it was confirmed that ATEEZ related promotional activities have been cancelled in Las Vegas after the knowledge of this incident was brought out. According to their statement, "the mistake was identified and rectified after a short period of time" and "the Las Vegas store removed all ATEEZ THE WORLD EP.1: MOVEMENT albums from their store" since the incident.

Yikes.. right now the purchaser are being tracked and are given a full refund.
