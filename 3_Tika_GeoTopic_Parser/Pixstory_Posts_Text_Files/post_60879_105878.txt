I love fiddling with my camera Especially exploring different techniques and styles This shot was taken in the dark with a fairy light and slow shutter speed You can check the advanced settings on your mobile camera and set the shutter speed to manual Reduce the shutter speed like etc and adjust the ISO You can do this with any kind of light source but I tried using a fairy light to get that halo effect Try it for yourself It s fun
