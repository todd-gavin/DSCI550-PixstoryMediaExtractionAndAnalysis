Instead of perusing a menu patrons of Mr Kanso browse the aisles of tin cans Yep everything served at Mr Kanso which operates out of different venues across Japan comes out of a can The appeal apparently is the sheer variety there are more than cans of food sourced from all over the world to choose from While the first restaurant opened in Osaka City Minami Horie in the trend has since been adopted by similar outlets in London and New York The concept is a pretty simple one it is a small counter bar the walls of which are lined floor to ceiling with canned goods After surveying the selection you pick up the cans of food that pique your fancy and pass them to the staff behind the counter The staff heats up what you want as you sip on a drink and then you eat It s certainly an unusual dining experience but one that has proven to be so popular that the bars have exploded all around Japan
