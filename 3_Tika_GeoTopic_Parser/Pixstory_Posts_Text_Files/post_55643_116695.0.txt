A historical mystery and drama series set in Melbourne in the roaring 1920s, Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries is based on a series of mystery novels by Kerry Greenwood. Both the TV series and the novels follow the personal and professional life of private detective Phryne Fisher (Essie Davis).

I agree with Collider when it says that spanning over three seasons, Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries is full of flapper fashion, interesting characters, and mysterious murders. The creators Deb Cox and Fiona Eagger have described Phryne Fisher as “one of the first feminists… a bit of a James Bond action hero - she’s much better dressed than James Bond though.”
