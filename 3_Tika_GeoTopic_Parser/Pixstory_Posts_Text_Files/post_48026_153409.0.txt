By NewsDrum Desk New Delhi: Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray emerged a clear winner in terms of political messaging against his successor Eknath Shinde in round one of the show of strength organised by the two warring factions of the Shiv Sena on Dusshera. While Uddhav Thackeray addressed a Dusshera rally at Shivaji Park on Wednesday (October 5), Shinde held a parallel public meeting about six km away at the MMRDA ground in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Bandra. The Shivaji Park in Dadar has been a venue associated with the Shiv Sena since its inception in 1966. The turnout was significant in both events. While the BKC was high on optics, the Shivaji Park one had huge emotional content.The Shinde faction tried to turn the event into a contest to claim Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray's legacy by roping in estranged family members of the late leader.On the other hand, Uddhav Thackeray called Shinde a traitor and someone who backstabbed him even as he attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for going against the coalition dharma by reneging on its promise of power-sharing after the assembly elections in 2019.A tussle between the two factions over the Shiv Sena poll symbol, bow and arrow, has already reached the doorsteps of the Election Commission of India (ECI), which is expected to take a decision on the matter soon.The by-election to the Andheri East assembly constituency in Mumbai is scheduled to be held on November 3. The by-poll was necessitated due to the death of Shiv Sena legislator Ramesh Latke in May this year. While the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena has fielded Latkeâ€™s wife Rutuja, the BJP is fielding former Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) corporator Murji Patel. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are likely to back Rutuja.
