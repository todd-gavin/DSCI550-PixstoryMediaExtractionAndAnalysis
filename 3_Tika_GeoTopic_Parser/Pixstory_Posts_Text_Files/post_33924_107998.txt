Crazy what happened last Wednesday evening in the playoff final of Group A of the Piedmontese Second Category between Quaronese and Dinamo Bagnella A fiery match inside but above all outside the pitch with the fans present at the stadium who threw firecrackers and smoke bombs on the pitch already kick-off The climax then comes in the second half from the stands a homeowners fan hits one of the assistant referees on the head with a sandwich causing him pain and momentary fainting Match suspended for a quarter of an hour The announcements on the microphone from part of the Quarenese management with the home supporters who throughout the match insulted and seriously threatened the members of the referee triad as stated in the official press release drawn up following the match director&#39;s report Fine and disqualification for one day of the playing field these are the sanctions for the Quaronese promoted in the First Category despite the final by virtue of the best placement in the standings
