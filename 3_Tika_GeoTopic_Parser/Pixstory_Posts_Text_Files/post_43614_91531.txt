The South Korean first lady Kim Jung sook is in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh where she is visiting the ancient city of Ayodhya Ayodhya which is best known as the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram also however holds special significance for some South Koreans many believe they can trace their ancestry to the city This belief comes from several historical Korean stories which tell the story of an Indian princess Suriratna who married a South Korean king and started a dynasty According to the legend Princess Suriratna also known as Heo Hwang ok went to Korea in AD some years ago and started the Karak dynasty by marrying a local king Some Chinese language texts claim that the then King of Ayodhya had a dream where God ordered him to send his year old daughter to South Korea to marry King Kim Suro A popular South Korean book comprising fables and historical stories Samguk Yusa Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms mentions that Queen Hwang ok was the princess of Ayuta kingdom The royal couple prospered They had sons and both lived to be over a years old An anthropologist named Kim Byung mo Ayuta appeared to confirm the widely held belief that Ayuta was actually Ayodhya as the two names are phonetically similar But there is no clear evidence to show that the princess even actually existed Her origin story is considered to be mythical and is not considered to be history by academics says David Cann of the BBC s Korean Service There have been several fictional renditions of the story as there is plenty of room for imagination
