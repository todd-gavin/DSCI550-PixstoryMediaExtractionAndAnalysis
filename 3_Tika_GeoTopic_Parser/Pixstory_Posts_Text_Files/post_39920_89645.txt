When floods wreaked havoc on Kashmir in killing people and destroying property one unintended result was the loss of nadru or lotus stem a staple in Kashmiri cuisine Local farmers have worked hard over the past three years to resuscitate the crop in the Dal Nigeen Manasbal and Achar Srinagar s biggest lakes employing clever methods The firm coarse root vegetable which ranges in colour from white to light brown is not unique to Kashmiri cuisine it s known in Punjab as bhein and in Sindhi cuisine as kamal kakdi but it s especially important to Kashmiris Asking a Kashmiri about nadru is like asking a British person about shepherd s pie or a North Indian person about dal Marryam Reshii a food critic who has written extensively about Kashmiri cuisine and culture stated It s just a natural part of Kashmiri kitchens Despite the fact that Kashmiri cuisine is centred on meat nadru appears in equal amount Ascend and descend According to legend the lotus plant was discovered by Badshah Ghiyas ud Din Zain ul Abidin the king of Kashmir on a shikara ride on the Gul Sar now known as the Gill Sar a lake on the outskirts of Srinagar in the th century The Persian word Gul means flower or rose and the ruler was so taken with the lotus blooms that he wanted to plant them in all of the region s lakes But it wasn t just the flower s beauty that drew the badshah s attention His boatmen had picked some nadru and served it with the evening meal bringing new attention to the flower s root Soon Kashmiris started frying steaming and boiling nadru making it one of the region s most popular vegetables The flavour of nadru is earthy and fibrous unlike any other vegetable In the region it s boiled with green beans to produce dal fried as nader monje a famous fritter like street food and used to make nader yakhni a classic yoghurt and cumin based meal with the vegetable substituting lamb On Nowruz or the Iranian New Year the yakhni is prepared as a special dinner a tradition brought to the region by Shia Muslim immigrants many decades ago
