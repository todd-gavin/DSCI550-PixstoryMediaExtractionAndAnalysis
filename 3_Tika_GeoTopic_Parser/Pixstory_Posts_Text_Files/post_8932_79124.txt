Reading your post made me realize how the man who commented on the journalist s post was so patriarchal when he condemned the acid attack I might be away from the captivity of the Taliban but not very much away from their ideas of how a society should behave The man s comments made me remember how the Taliban have put the entire burden of how men will thrive as a society if women are confined to four walls Rather let me put my words as how men use patriarchy and twist Islam to show they know everything while women know nothing The only difference between this man and the Taliban is of the tone One has requested women to follow deen while the other is forcing deen on the women of Afghanistan As far as my understanding of Islam is women shouldn t be forced to follow the religion nor did the Quran guaranteed a happy life if one follows the deen and has full faith The Quran emphasizes that this life is full of tests one problem ends and the other one starts I am not saying one shouldn t follow deen one should definitely follow deen because life starts to make sense when one knows about deen and understands it Men deciding for women and their faith is something I am not okay with I am still figuring out why this man assumed the victim wasn t following her deen Let s suppose she wasn t following her deen and hence she became the victim of an acid attack but what about the burrari family who were religiously following their deen but unfortunately met an unexpected end not because of themselves but because of how the society tricked them I am upset with the fact that this man assume all the rape and attacks on women are a cause of women themselves and not because of uneducated men LetWomenBreathe
