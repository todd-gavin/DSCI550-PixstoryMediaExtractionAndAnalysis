Meanwhile Priyanka Gandhi has asked a question hovering in the minds for many "What benefit has BJP government given in last five years?

Meanwhile Amit Shah ironically makes a remark on Akhilesh Yadav that he wears glasses with which he sees only one religion. (Looks like Amit Shah knows a lot about these glasses)
