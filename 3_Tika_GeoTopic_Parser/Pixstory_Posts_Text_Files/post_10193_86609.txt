Like many of you I too abhor knowing that there is a side to Afghanistan that s full of misery and misfortune Having to post this hopelessness and an aspect of Afghans we wish did not exist has a very heavy toll on my heart For now I am obligated to let you in on knowing there is a world where people are deprived of their own money because a country far far away has ordered to freeze their assets Taking this decision on behalf of my people are the foreigners who make headlines of utter Shock and Distress when they can t get their KFC delivered to them on time The same people who will never ever be faced with such trials and tribulations are speaking for my motherland s behalf as they sit in their warm comfortable oversight offices How do they justify punishing the whole country because of one group The picture above has made me restless we cannot fathom the urge of a mother wanting to protect her children but the helpless state of this Afghan mother as she begs for anything that can get them through the day is a heart aching sight I get many dms of people expressing their strong emotions of how I should stop posting the heartbreaking reality our people are faced with Ifeel as thought it is my duty to do what I can in hopes that the situation of my people may change for the better through efforts of holding authorities responsible through donations as well as through our remembrance of them in our prayers Turge you all to do what you can raise awareness pressure your authorities to make a statement on releasing Afghan funds and please donate
