Britishers had ruled India for nearly200 years. The Indian National Congress was formed in 1885 by A.O.Hume, an Englishman and a retired official. It had been a loyalist, communal and conservative political organization that supported the partition of Bengal, opposed the Swadeshi movement, demanded special safeguards to its community and a separate electorate for Muslims. In Dec 1906 at Calcutta, the INC under Dadabhai Naoroji adopted ‘Swaraj’ because of the goal of the Indian people. After the Lucknow Pact, a British policy was announced by 1917 which aimed toward “increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration for the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British empire”. Congress passed the resolution in its Calcutta session in Sept 1920. A mob of individuals at Chauri – Chaura clashed with police and burnt 22 policemen on February 5, 1922. This compelled Gandhiji to withdraw the Non-Cooperation movement on Feb.12, 1922. Simon Commission was constituted under John Simon by 1927, to review the political situation in India and to introduce further reforms and extension of democracy. Gandhiji signed a pact on March 5, 1931. In this, the INC called off the direct action movement and agreed to hitch the second round table conference and represented the INC and then Muslim League first passed the proposal of separate Pakistan in its Lahore session in 1940 and provides a glimpse of the timeline between the formation of the congress party and therefore the independence of India.
