Chelsea Grade D Chelsea ended the month without making one first team addition to their squad and they will have to rely on what they currently have Now Thomas Tuchel has many options to choose from in his squad but with Ben Chilwell injured and Marcos Alonso not getting any younger you might have thought the Blues would invest in a left back They tried to recall Emerson from his loan with Olympique Lyon but the Ligue side refused all of Chelsea s offers Fabrizio Romano th January After that there was very little activity from Stamford Bridge though they did sign two younger players Travis Akomeah arrived from Watford and they also signed Dylan Williams from Derby County Akomeah is a year old centre back so very much one for the future Meanwhile Williams is an year old left back and it appears as if the Blues swooped in to take advantage of the Rams current situation There were no major outgoings at Stamford Bridge and Tuchel s side pretty much slipped under the radar as other teams frantically rushed to strengthen their sides In my view Chelsea have incredible strength in depth and should still achieve great things despite no major additions but another left back left wing back would have elevated the Blues onto that next level Instead they will just have to hope that Chilwell returns soon enough This wasn t a disastrous window for Chelsea but you always expect a club with that much financial muscle to be active in the transfer market and that wasn t the case on this occasion My grade might seem slightly harsh but I just feel they are putting too much pressure on Alonso while Chilwell remains out
