Bielsa is famed for his high pressing, gung-ho style of football, which had fit Raphinha like a glove, and his high energy has meant he never shirked away from the defensive side of the game as last season he ranked amongst the top 10 for tackles + interceptions per 90 amongst forwards in the Premier League with 3.19, but it is his ability with the ball that has garnered him many suitors across Europe. 

Raphinha’s versatility means that he can play on either wing but also operate in the number 10 role if required. He has stupendous close control, dribbling ability and agility that harkens similarities to Riyad Mahrez, which allows him to dribble past his marker. Even though he is heavily left-footed, he is not afraid of going down the line on his right foot, making him even harder to defend against. 

The 25-year-old is not just all show, however, as the Brazilian combines flair with effectiveness. He has a great crossing ability which leads to him being a constant threat on set plays. His passing ability is superb as his switches across the pitch lead to unbalancing the opposition.

All of this contributed to him supplying nine assists last season in the Premier League

Not only is he an excellent playmaker, but he is also calm and composed in front of goal.  Last season, he scored 6 goals in the Premier League, but he has already surpassed that tally with 8 goals in 17 appearances this season and almost half of the games still remain.

His goal scoring threat is not limited to inside the box, as he can also shoot from outside as well

He is not only comfortable on the wing, as the former Avaí youth player is equally as comfortable coming in between the lines and combining with his teammates.

We will compare Raphinha to Salah and Mane to see what he will be bringing at Anfield in the absence of these lethal wingers, if the deal goes through.
