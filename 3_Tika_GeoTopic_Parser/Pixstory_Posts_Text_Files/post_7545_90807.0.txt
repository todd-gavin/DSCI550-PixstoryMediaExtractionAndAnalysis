Rajasthan Royals never gave Sunrisers Hyderabad a chance. The SRH captain, Kane Williamson choose to bowl first. Buttler and Jaiswal gave a quick start to RR just as the two got out. Sanju Samson and Padikkal took the onslaught to the SRH bowlers and hit them all around the park. Samson played a captain's knock scoring 55 of 27 balls, he hit 5 sixes. Paddikal got out for 40 from 29 balls playing the anchor role. The party for RR didn't stop here, Hetmyer with a strike rate of 246, scored 32 of 13 balls. RR in the end managed to put up a total of 210.

On the other hand, Sunrisers never looked like the favourites while chasing the game at all. While the SRH bowlers leaked runs, the Rajasthan bowling line kept everything sharp. Chahal was the pick of the bowlers for me, he took 3 wickets giving away only 22 runs. The SRH top order was a massive let down, Williamson got out for 2, Sharma for 9, Tripathi and Pooran both got ducks. Markham managed to get a fifty by the end, Sundar also got to a 40 and Shepherd hit 24 runs. 

Rajasthan Royals won the match by 61 runs in the end. For me the highlight of the match was the magnificent shot making of Sanju Samson, he was just in a class of his own tonight.
