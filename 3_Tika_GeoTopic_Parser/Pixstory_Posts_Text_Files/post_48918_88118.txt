Chick culling is a horrifying secret as well as a severe reality It s a type of massacre that goes after so called surplus animals such as baby chicks who are male at birth Professional chicken sexers trained to differentiate the sex of hatchlings at commercial hatcheries quickly separate the pullets female chicks from the cockerels male chicks male chicks While the pullets will continue to lay eggs the cockerels who are undesired and disposable are immediately dispatched Despite the fact that chick culling is a common procedure it has largely gone unnoticed by the general population Male chicks hatched into the egg industry are judged worthless because they are unable to produce eggs and are not ideal for fast meat production That is why they are slain within a few hours after birth The chicks are incarcerated within plastic bags and must pant for breath The tiny chicks are shocked to death when they are exposed to electric currents The newborn chicks are killed one by one by factory workers their fragile necks stretched to breaking lengths When exposed to a high concentration of carbon dioxide a gas that is exceedingly painful to birds at high concentrations the newborn chicks lungs burn until they lose consciousness and die The innocent babies are pushed onto conveyor lines and into a grinder which rips the newborn birds alive with sharp metal blades
