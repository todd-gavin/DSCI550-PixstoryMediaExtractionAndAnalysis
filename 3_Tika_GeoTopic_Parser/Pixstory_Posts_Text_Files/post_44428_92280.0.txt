Both AC Milan and Inter have stated that they are willing to relocate their teams outside of Milan
in pursuit of a new stadium. The two clubs, who have shared San Siro since 1947, have
authorised a scheme to create a new, modernised stadium on the same location as their current
venue, although construction is not anticipated to be completed until at least 2027.

Both clubs have been frustrated by the delay, which has led to rumours that the entire idea
could be scrapped - something Milan mayor Beppe Sala recently dismissed.

AC Milan chairman Paolo Scaroni, on the other hand, has admitted to Tutti Convocati that the
club would be happy to leave Milan if it meant moving to a new stadium sooner.

"I expected this to be faster, especially since we're in Milan," Scaroni said. "The stadium project
is for everyone, fans and non-fans. Unfortunately, we know that Italian bureaucracy often does
not make things easy.

"What's happened is that this is no longer a project of Milan and Inter, but instead of the
municipality of Milan. That's why we are looking outside Milan. We will accept the project with
the shortest development times, we urgently need a new stadium."

Alessandro Antonello, the Inter director, shared a similar viewpoint.

"We started with a lot of enthusiasm, but unfortunately, the Italian system does not help with
infrastructure and particularly not in sports," Antonello added. "We appealed to the law on
stadiums but the time was prolonged.

"Would we go to another municipality? We always have alternative plans. The goal is to move to
a new stadium as soon as possible. It's an option that is being evaluated and studied. When we
have all the details, we will make the decision that is best for the clubs, which is having a new
stadium as soon as possible."
