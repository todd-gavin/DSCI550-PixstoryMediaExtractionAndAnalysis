The COVID pandemic triggered an unprecedented rise in deaths around the world, leading to falls in life expectancy. In research last year, we found that 2020 saw significant life expectancy losses, including more than two years in the US and one year in England and Wales.In a new study published in Nature Human Behaviour, we have now shown that, in 2021, life expectancy rebounded somewhat in most western European countries while eastern Europe and the US witnessed additional losses. However, only Norway beat its pre-pandemic life expectancy in 2021, and everywhere is worse off than it would likely have been without the pandemic.We knew the outlook for 2021 was mixed, with the excitement of vaccine rollouts tempered by huge numbers of infections caused by a series of new and highly transmissible variants.To assess the impact of these changes on life expectancy, our research team at the University of Oxford’s Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research gathered data from 29 mostly European countries (plus Chile and the US).Life expectancy is a measure we use to summarise the mortality pattern of a country in a given year. It’s calculated based on deaths from all causes, so it doesn’t depend on the accuracy of recording COVID deaths, and can give us a broader picture of how the pandemic affected mortality.Life expectancy is not a prediction of the lifespan of a baby born today. Rather, it’s the number of years someone born today could expect to live, if they lived their whole life with the mortality rates of the current year (or 2021 in the case of our research). So it’s a snapshot of current mortality conditions, if they were to continue without any improvements or deterioration.Demographers find life expectancy a very useful summary measure of population mortality because it’s comparable across countries and over time. Large swings upwards or downwards can tell us something dramatic has changed, as it has with COVID.
