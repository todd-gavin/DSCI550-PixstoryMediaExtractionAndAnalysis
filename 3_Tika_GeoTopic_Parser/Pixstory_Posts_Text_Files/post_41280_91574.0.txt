Georges Mèliès was the first person to adapt a book into film and he did a pretty good job at it!

As per archives, based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale, Méliès created the eerie Cinderella. The film had a cast of approximately 35 people, including Bleuette Bernon, who played the lead role. It was also Méliès' first picture incorporating tableaux, or numerous scenes. The picture was a huge hit in Europe and the United States, where it was largely shown at fairgrounds and music halls. 

Moreover, American cinema distributors like Siegmund Lubin were in desperate need of new material, both to lure new audiences and to compete with Edison's expanding monopoly. Méliès' films were extremely successful, and Cinderella was frequently screened as a main attraction long after its premiere in the United States in December 1899.

It sounds so easy to adapt a fairy tale like Cinderella for big screen when we study it in today’s context wherein technology has advanced so much. But to do it in late nineteenth century or to even think of doing it is a remarkable achievement!
