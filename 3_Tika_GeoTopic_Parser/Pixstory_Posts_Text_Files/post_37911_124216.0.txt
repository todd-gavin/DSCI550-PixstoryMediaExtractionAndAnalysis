Timo Werner has completed his return to RB Leipzig. The German international departs from Chelsea after spending just two seasons at the club. 

The Blues bought Timo Werner from RB Leipzig for Â£45m in 2020. But things did not go as well as expected for the German international with the English giants. Werner scored 23 goals in 89 appearances for the Blues and helped them win the UEFA Champions League among other trophies. 

However, the striker was heavily criticized for missing easy opportunities regularly. Due to his varying form, Thomas Tuchel also signed Romelu Lukaku to the club last summer but things did not go as planned with the Belgian international as well. 

After returning to Leipzig, Werner talked about his objectives with the club. The striker said, "It was a great time from 2016 to 2020 in which we caused a sensation as a league newcomer. It was a worthy farewell for me back then, going as a record goalscorer. But that's also a bit of the past and now I'm looking ahead, because RB Leipzig has developed over the past two years, just like I have."

With the 2022 FIFA World Cup set to take place in Qatar in November, Timo Werner would certainly want to rediscover his touch. It has to be seen if the German can cement his position in the Leipzig starting XI in the coming days.
