Wolves' hopes of qualifying for Europe are dealt a big blow as important midfielder Ruben Neves is ruled out until MAY after suffering a knee injury in the defeat to Leeds.

The revelation that important midfielder Ruben Neves will be absent until May has harmed Wolves' chances of qualifying for Europe.

During Friday night's defeat to Leeds, the Portugal international suffered a knee injury that will keep him out for several weeks.

As a result, he will be unable to participate in his country's crucial World Cup play-off against Turkey this week.

Neves returned to his native Brazil for a consultation with a knee doctor, who confirmed that the medial collateral ligament injury was 'uncomplicated.'

Wolves said in a statement on their website: 'Ruben Neves suffered a medial collateral ligament injury to his knee in the match against Leeds United on Friday evening.
'He travelled to Portugal with members of the Wolves medical team to see a knee specialist, where the injury was confirmed as uncomplicated.

'He will spend this week in Portugal with the Wolves physio before returning to continue his rehabilitation at Compton Park. We are hoping for Ruben to be fit to return in May.'

Neves, 25, has played an important role in Wolves' successful season. They are four points behind sixth-placed Manchester United and yet have a chance to qualify for Europe.

After a hamstring injury, Nelson Semedo has returned to a limited training regimen.
