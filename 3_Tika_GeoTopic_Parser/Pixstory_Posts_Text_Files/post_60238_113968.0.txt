Only 11 and 20 run were scored in the two Test innings by Virat Kohli, who is still having trouble with his form. He is currently occupying the 13th rank after falling out of the Top 10 as a result.

He no longer ranks among the Top 10 in the Test rankings for the first time in six years.

Rohit Sharma, the captain of India, dropped down to ninth after missing the game.

The ICC Test rankings have undergone a significant amount of change as a result of England and India's performances in the Edgbaston Test. With their highest-ever successful chase in Test cricket, England won the game by 7 wickets. Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow, the heroes of that chase, are currently ranked in the top ten hitters. While Bairstow advanced 11 positions to take the tenth position, Root solidified his position at the top of the standings.

Rishabh Pant of India, who also hammered a century and a half in the match, has climbed six places to land in fifth place, which is a career high.

James Anderson contributed to keeping England in the game in the most recent Test against India by taking five wickets in the first innings. Since his recall, he has taken 17 wickets in three Tests.

The recovering pace bowler moves up one spot to sixth place in the Test bowling rankings.
