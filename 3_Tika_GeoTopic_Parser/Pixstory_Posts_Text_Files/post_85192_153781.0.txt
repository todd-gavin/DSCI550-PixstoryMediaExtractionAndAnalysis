The Bundesliga fans and all other fans from all around the globe got to watch an incredibly intense match between two of the biggest rivals in the league for the first time this season as Bayern locked horns with Dortmund at the Signal Iduna Park. The Der Klassiker lived upto it's worth as it ended at 2-2 with the fans being pushed to the edge of their seats till the final whistle was blown. Both the teams had been in fine rhythm prior to this game in the Champion's league with fine wins.This game was thus going to be a high voltage one with it being literally impossible for anyone to predict as to which team would emerge victorious beforehand.
The match started exactly the way a Der Klassiker was supposed to as De Ligt,Sabitzer and Jude Bellingham were booked for minor offences inside the first 15 minutes of the match. Both the sides looked to execute their counter attacking strategies brilliantly up against the press.Good runs being made by Dortmund's attackers forced a couple of good saves from neuer. However it was Bayern who opened the scoring brilliantly. Jamal Musiala offloaded a ball to Goretzka who fired a right footed shot which totally managed to find its way through a crowd of Dortmund defenders into the back of the net.
Leroy Sane made it 2-0 with an out of the box attempt. Just when it seemed as if it was all overÂ  for. Dortmund managed to reduce the deficit by 1 as 17 year old Youssoufa Moukoko managed to score after beating Manuel Neuer to find the bottom left corner off a left foot shot in the 74th minute.
With the last few moments of the game having arrived the atmosphere started growing more and more intense, as the home fans were waiting for a late miracle to happen. Schlotterbeck firstly did brilliantly well to keep the ball in play after it had been carried up forward by an Adeyemi chip.
The centre back then chipped it up for Anthony Mudeste to score the equaliser with the last kick of the game.
