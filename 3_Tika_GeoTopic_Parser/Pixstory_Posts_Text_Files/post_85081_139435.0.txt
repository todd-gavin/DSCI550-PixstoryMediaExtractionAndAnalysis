Liverpool are off to a lackluster start in the Premier League. With just 9 points in 6 games, the Reds have already fallen behind the pace in the quest for the title. That has got a lot to do with the injuries sustained by the squad in the recent months. To be fair to them, they were involved in all possible matches last season and that has clearly taken a toll. However with a new campaign in the Champions League starting it is imperative that the runners-up from last season will be in contention. Here are 3 reasons why Liverpool can win the UEFA Champions League trophy this season.
#1 Injury Returns
The biggest question in Liverpool’s season so far has been their squad depth. With injuries to many key players like Thiago, Naby Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain to name a few, Liverpool has had to field below par Starting XIs in many matches. Klopp’s side came under the pump when he was forced to start Milner, Elliot and Henderson in the midfield against Manchester United in a game that they lost 2-1. 
However with all the players out with injury set to return soon, the Merseyside team is expected to regain the team that took themselves so close to the title last season. With a full fledged, side Liverpool are better than most other teams in Europe and they have mostly fared well when they have had to face strong opponents in the past.
