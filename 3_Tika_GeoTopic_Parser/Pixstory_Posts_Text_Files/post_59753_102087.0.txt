This is Divya!
Whenever someone asks for introduction, we start giving our academic and professional details. We forget that a casual introduction needs to include the things which define YOU. As my first post on Pixstory, I would like to post an introduction for you to know who is behind the screen!

My pronouns are She/ Her. I am a Virgo, which is why I am a perfectionist and aim for perfection in whatever I do. I love to learn new things. I am an overthinker and a caring person, who tries to ensure that everyone around her is happy and calm. I am not really good at sharing things.

I love spending time with my family, reading books and dancing. I like to binge watch Series and Movies genre of which are Romantic, Comedy and Suspense. My playlist is filled with both English and Hindi songs.

I am still figuring out what I want to do in life but I am proud of whatever I have achieved and believe in myself!
