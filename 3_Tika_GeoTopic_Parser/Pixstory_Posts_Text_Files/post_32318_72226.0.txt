The Bishnoi Movement or the Khejarli Massacre was started by bishnois of Rajasthan,who are considered as the first environmentalists of India. Around 260 years back,the king of Rajasthan decided to cut down all the trees to build a new palace.But,the bishnois used the strategy of hugging and embracing trees for their protection. The protest was firstly started by Amrita Devi,also her 3 daughters added her in hugging the trees and about more than 350 people sacrificed their lives in protecting their trees.
This act is still so underrated.
