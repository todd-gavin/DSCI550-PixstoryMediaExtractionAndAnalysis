 Neurons in the brain that regulate competitive interactions between individuals and play a vital role in determining group social behavior have been discovered in new study in mice The findings which were published in Nature by a team led by Massachusetts General Hospital MGH investigators will be useful not only for scientists interested in human interactions but also for those researching neurocognitive disorders like autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia which are characterized by altered social behavior Human and animal social interactions are most prevalent in big groups and these group interactions are important in sociology ecology psychology economics and political science explains lead author S William Li an MGH MD PhD student Most neuroscience research has so far concentrated on the behaviors of pairs of individuals interacting alone so it s unclear what processes in the brain govern the complex dynamic behavior of social groups We were able to examine group behavior by creating a model in which huge groups of mice were wirelessly tracked through hundreds of different competitive group encounters Li and his colleagues discovered that the animals social ranking in the group was closely linked to the results of competition and they discovered that neurons in the anterior cingulate region of the brain store this social ranking information to inform future decisions by examining recordings from neurons in the brains in time As the animals competed for food these neurons collectively held remarkably detailed representations of the group s behavior and dynamics as well as information about the resources available and the outcome of their previous interactions says senior author Ziv M Williams MD a neurosurgical oncologist at MGH These neurons when combined could even anticipate the animal s own future performance far before competition began implying that they likely guided the animals competitive behavior based on who they interacted with The findings suggest that competitive success is controlled by signals in the brain that alter competitive desire rather than being only a function of an animal s physical fitness or strength These one of a kind neurons can combine information about the individual s surroundings social group circumstances and reward resources to compute how to best behave under given conditions Li explains
