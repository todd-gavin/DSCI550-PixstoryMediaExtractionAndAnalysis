In Japan, the film ‘Super 30’, was released in cinema halls with Japanese subtitle across 50 cities. The show was house full when I reached Shinjuku Piccadilly Cinema in Tokyo. After the show, the response from the viewers was truly overwhelming
What a show. 
Super 30 is a highly ambitious and innovative educational
program running under the banner of "Ramanujan School of
Mathematics". It hunts for 30 meritorious talents from
among the economically backward sections of the society
and shapes them for India's most prestigious institution –
the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). In the last seven
years, it has produced hundreds IITians from extremely
poor background. During this program students are
provided absolutely free coaching, lodging and food.
Super 30 targets students from extremely poor families.
They have all seen the change with sheer disbelief in
their eyes that their children are now going to be top
technocrats.
