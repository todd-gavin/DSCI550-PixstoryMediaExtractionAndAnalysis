I realized I haven t introduced myself properly I m starting a new series called Campus Diaries on behalf of Pixstory as their Campus representative I study at CHRIST Deemed to be University Bangalore I am a final year student of Media and Communication English and Psychology My university has definitely given me a lot of opportunities I would not have gotten otherwise and the past years at college have been some of the best years of my academic life Our first year was spent online due to pandemic but it was truly worth the wait to get back offline because the central campus is simply breathtaking I love this campus for so many reasons The greenery on campus the little nooks and crannies that go unnoticed the people I have met and the relations I have built have all contributed to my growth I m happy that I get to share my experiences at campus with the Pixstory community P s The above picture is from our campus view As the name suggests you can see most of the campus from that floor and I love studying there whenever it s quiet
