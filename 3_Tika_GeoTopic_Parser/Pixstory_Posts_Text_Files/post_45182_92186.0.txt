Former Barcelona and Everton manager Ronaldo Koeman will take charge of his second
stint as the coach of the Netherlands national team once again after the World Cup in Qatar.

The move comes after current Dutch gaffer Louis van Gaal's cancer diagnosis, and the
Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) have therefore moved quickly to have a
replacement lined up from January 2023.

Koeman had coached the Netherlands between 2018 and 2020 before he left the post to
take over the top job at his previous club FC Barcelona.

The Dutchman didn’t have a fruitful spell at Barca and was let go by the club shortly after
one year in the hot seat.

Koeman had been looking for a new challenge since, and it’s all but confirmed that the
59-year-old will be leading his country’s national team after their adventure at Qatar 2022.

Speaking about his new role on Wednesday, Ronald Koeman says he’s looking forward to
the challenge.

“I am looking forward to the new collaboration. A little over a year and a half ago, I certainly
did not leave the Dutch national team out of dissatisfaction,” he was quoted as saying by
Goal.com.

The Dutchman further added, “My stay felt good, the results were good and the click with the
internationals was good. We will soon continue on that path. That is certain for me.”

The move comes after current Netherlands boss Louis Van Gaal made shocking revelations
that he’s battling prostate cancer.

The 70-year-old vowed to continue to lead the national side until the World Cup and as such
Dutch fans will be hoping that Van Gaal can replicate the heroics of World Cup 2014 when
the Netherlands reached the semifinal stage under Van Gaal’s tutelage.
