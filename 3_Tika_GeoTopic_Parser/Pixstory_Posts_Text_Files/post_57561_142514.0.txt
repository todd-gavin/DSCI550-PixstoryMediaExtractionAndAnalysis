As much as has been narrated or said, more of it is being erased to save the glorious past of Britain.
For those who spread news and truth claim "authentic" and say that during the reign of the Queen, colonies gained independence.
But we know what independence they talk about here,  the freedom to believe in the Queen's greatness, submit to her ideas and thoughts and believe in the glorious past of Britain.
This is the liberty they achieved.
Those imprisoned, shot or killed in the battles are lost; the true British people wrongly depict their stories—lost in the force of monarchy, which still lives even after the Queen's demise.
Many enslaved people were taught that becoming a part of a culturally superior empire was a form of advancement, regardless of whether they lived as minorities or struggled. Still, they should stay grateful for this "inclusion".
In Ghana, people traumatised and tormented by the spirits of colonialism were educated that it all was justified.
Their Independence Arch, which represents the freedom of the first Black African people to break free from the Empire successfully, has a plaque which dedicates their liberty to the Queen itself.
So no matter how far the task of truth-telling goes, for some, even truth is not entirely free from the trap of the Empire.
