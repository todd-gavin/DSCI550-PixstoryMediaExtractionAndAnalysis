Some tips to get the perfect Almond flour Chocolate Cake

Measure the almond flour by its weight, not by its volume - this is always needed while baking and that too while baking with almond flour. 

As this recipe consists of baking soda as a leavener, the cocoa that needs to be used needs to be natural cocoa powder and not Dutch processed cocoa powder. 

If so we use Dutched cocoa powder it is not acidic and so this won't react with baking soda and the cake would turn out to be flat, than fluffy.
