The song, seven by Swift has the narrator talk about her friend, who's queer, living in an abusive environment and offering them to move in with them. 

The next stanza continues with her suggesting they pack their "dolls and a sweater" and moving to India, which is a testimonial of the naivety and innocence of childhood, unaware of the realities or the gravity of everything happening around them and the way their world is limited to "dolls and sweaters." 

For many queer kids, or children with unstable environments, it can also be reminiscent of the fact that when you're a kid, you have no idea of the gravity of everything happening with you and around you, when you're a child, you're naive and unaware of the realities of the world, which is what makes one think that one can easily just move out, and even moving out would mean you're done with the situation forever, which is sad, bittersweet and heartbreaking. 

The song references heavy themes but comes off as comforting owing to the nature of Swift's vocals, talking about pure, childhood love and unadulterated support.
