The Albanese government has acted quickly to abandon the prosecution of Bernard Collaery, who was charged in relation to the leaking of information about Australia’s alleged spying in Timor-Leste.

Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said that in taking this decision “I have had careful regard to our national security interest and the proper administration of justice.

"It is my view that the prosecution of Mr Collaery should end”.

He said the “decision to discontinue the prosecution was informed by the government’s commitment to protecting Australia’s national interest, including our national security and Australia’s relationships with our close neighbours.”

He was the lawyer of the whistleblower known as Witness K, a former ASIS officer.

Witness K received a suspended sentence in 2021 after pleading guilty to conspiring with Collaery to reveal information about the alleged spying.

Collaery was due to face trial in October on charges alleging breaches of the Intelligence Services Act.

The alleged Australian government spying was at the time of 2004 negotiations between the two countries over oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea. The Australian Secret Intelligence Service – Australia’s foreign spy service – allegedly had listening devices in East Timor’s cabinet room in Dili.

Dreyfus told a news conference on Thursday this was “an exceptional case. Governments must protect secrets and our government remains steadfast in our commitment to keep Australians safe by keeping secrets out of the wrong hands.

"The long-standing practice of government has been to neither confirm nor deny claims made about intelligence matters and I will strictly adhere to that practice.”

He said prosecutions involved “a balancing of interests. The balance of interests can change over time and this is such a case.
