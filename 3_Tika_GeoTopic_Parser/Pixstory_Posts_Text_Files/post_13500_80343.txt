When you find yourself with your environment home school friends childhood youth those around you and your closest friend Life changes take away from you in a second Until we adapt to another environment our living quarters become deeper than a few years ago But you wake up stronger every morning because of those who give you hope for life Narrative My mother called me many times but I m just looking at stars which winking to me I don t know what my mother told me I was in my own imagination and just heard her voice I m looking on those brightness stars which winking to me I feels they want to share me something in this moment I m just feels gentle wind in my face which was so amazing with fresh wether while could smile deeply in our heart so I feel someone is coming it s what the stars want to tell me but I heard the singing of birds with my mom voice mixed so I want to opening my eyes and see what happens I m at night or it s morning By force I m opening my eyes with yawing for a minute and said for my mother yes mom My mother tell me go outside look at the birds which singing they want you I become so happy run away and find myself on grasses when I touch that was damp grasses and give as freshness oh my God what a good feeling birds on blue sky singing sun smiling at me weather is so gentle and I see the children which singing and the farmers which going to their lands also singing Everything is deferent everyone is fresh happy and singing I shocked what happen than I heard they voice of those children while singing Spring is coming oh my God it s that one which stars tried to understanding me This is spring which everyone feels alive This story was written by my best friend I have been apart for several years I wish to hug each other again one day Zohal
