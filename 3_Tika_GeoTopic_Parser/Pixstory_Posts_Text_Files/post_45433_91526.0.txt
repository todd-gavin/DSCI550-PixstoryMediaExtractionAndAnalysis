Moves took Harry Kane's situation at Spurs as a pristine example of how transfers involving
this kind of cash go about in England. The two are, very obviously similar and comparable.
Both Rice and Kane are practically club legends at their current clubs, players even the most
hard-core of football fans cannot hate. Rice, like his compatriot is very ambitious and may
well resort to forcing a move out when the time comes. Although his manager seems to think
differently.

"There will be times when players have got the power, but at the moment we have got
Declan on the best part of a three-and-a-half-year contract - just like Tottenham have got
Harry Kane on a contract and they control what happens." Moyes concluded.

Cross-London rivals Chelsea are in the race as far as European success is concerned. The
club's ownership is in a crisis of sorts but if they are to get Declan Rice's signature this
summer, it wouldn't surprise anyone. Then of course, others like Manchester United are
omnipresent in the transfer market and City could always make a return with Fernandinho's
contract running out.
