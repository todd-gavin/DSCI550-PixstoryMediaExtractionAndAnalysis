After shrinking in April and March, the Uk economy rebounded in May. According to the Office for National Statistics; the economy grew by 0.5% during the month, higher than the flat growth most economists expected. Most of the areas of the economy expanded. 

And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, there is "still a real risk" that the economy could fall into a recession, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.

"That may mean the economy proves to be a poisoned chalice for whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister," he added.

Both businesses and households are being hit by rising prices, which are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years due to record-high fuel and energy costs.

UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May and is expected to reach 11% later this year. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%, "no ifs or buts". It has raised rates five times since December and is anticipated to put them up again next month. He has indicated the Bank will "act forcefully" suggesting it could raise rates by more than 0.25%.

Even though there is growth in the economy there is also the fear of the stable economy and how long will it take to achieve it as it is slow growth.
