The day after Durga Puja ends is so melancholy. Venturing out in the city feels so sad. The same roads which were alive with people enjoying, bright lights and music, until few days back are now silent. 
The Pandals are slowly being put down and all you see are the skeletons of bamboo. The decorative lights are being taken off. The people are also returning back to work with a lull. The daughter has 
returned back to Kailash, leaving the mortal realm in slight dejection. 
But admist the all this lingers the hope that as a year passes Maa Durga will return to bless us all again.
