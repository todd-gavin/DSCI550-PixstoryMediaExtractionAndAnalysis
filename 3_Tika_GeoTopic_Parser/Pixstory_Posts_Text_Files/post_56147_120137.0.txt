The Foreign Office has said it "regrets" the time taken to ascertain the decision-making process behind the controversial evacuation of animal welfare charity staff from Afghanistan.

But it contended information had been given to MPs in "good faith" and there had been no intent to mislead.

It conceded an "error" in information had left some staff understanding the prime minister decided to call Nowzad's staff forward for evacuation.

In a report earlier this year, the foreign affairs committee said "multiple senior officials" believed Boris Johnson had interfered and "we have yet to be offered a plausible alternative explanation".

Its report asserted that "after a mysterious intervention from elsewhere in government", Nowzad's workers had been called for evacuation "at the last minute", even though they did not meet the Foreign Office's prioritization criteria.

The charity's animals were able to leave on a charter flight, which the MPs said had used "significant" resources.

The committee added that "under-resourcing of the evacuation effort in a crucial period likely cost hundreds of people their chance to leave the country, and as a result likely cost lives".
