Boo, Bitch' Trailer is out. The new Campy Afterlife Comedy Series starring To All the Boys I've Loved Before movie actress Lana Condor is on Netflix. 

The movie is all about Lana Condor playing Erika Vu, who dies and is still in the world after her death, like a ghost. ðŸ˜ˆDying can be a hell of a thing, especially when you come back as a ghost and still have to find a way to survive your senior year of high school. 

'Boo, Bitch' will be on Netflix on July 8. 

I am very interested in shows like this. Horror comedy stories are fun to watch. Looking forward to this series.
