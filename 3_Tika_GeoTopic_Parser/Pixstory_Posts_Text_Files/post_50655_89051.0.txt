Indiana Governor Vetoes Transgender Girls Sports Ban! As I read this news this morning, I felt so great about the changing times. There is a lot of TALK that goes around how transphobic policies should be abhorred and but it’s finally good to see some action being taken in my home state!

A bill prohibiting transgender females from participating in girls' school sports was vetoed by Indiana's governor on Monday. 

The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana said it prepared a lawsuit against what it called "hateful legislation" by opponents of the transgender sports bill, claiming it was a discriminatory solution to a non-existent problem. 

The bill's Republican sponsors argued it was necessary to protect the integrity of female sports and possibilities for females to earn college athletic scholarships, but they pointed out that transgender athletes have never outperformed girls in the state.

US News reported that Holcomb’s veto comes seven years after Indiana faced a national uproar over a religious objections law signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence which opponents maintained could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The Republican-dominated Legislature quickly made revisions blocking its use as a legal defense for refusing to provide services and preventing the law from overriding local ordinances with LGBT protections.
