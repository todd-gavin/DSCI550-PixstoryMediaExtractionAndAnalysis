I’ve been spending a lot of days at The Groove Studios in Safdarjung. There are numerous reasons as to why this is the case. Well first, it’s a considerably central location which is easy for all our band members to reach. Secondly, my good friend and drummer of the last 8 years (pictured above crouching behind the drums in pain as he battled a 103° fever while recording a song while I flip off the camera) is now a manager there. He is also the reason I am deaf in one ear.

This place started out during the first lockdown. The owners tried their best to make sure musicians had some source of income. Just like the owners, this studio has heart. Today, almost all the musicians who’re worth something come to this studio to either jam or record. Despite how high profile it may seem on the outside, it’s still a warm place. (Except when the AC is turned on. That thing works a bit too well)

We’ve had food in the waiting area, splendid coffee brewed by my drummer friend, the manager, laughter and catching up between musicians. We’ve recorded songs, videos and even had our girlfriends inside just so we can spend some time with them. (Being a gigging musician with a permanent job doesn’t leave much time for socialising).

As long as the place isn’t messed up, nobody has a problem. The vibe is great, homely and welcoming. I wouldn’t consider myself too important in the music scene but by simply hanging out here, I regularly find myself chilling with the who’s who of Delhi’s music.

One final reason why I love this place so much. It’s bang opposite The Piano Man Jazz Club. Long-time followers of mine would know my love for that place. In between jams, we sometimes grab a bite and a drink at the Jazz club. There is nothing more we could ask for. 

In my story, I know if I ever make a name for myself as a musician, I will surely have stories from this studio to recall. Right now? I’m just gathering them.
