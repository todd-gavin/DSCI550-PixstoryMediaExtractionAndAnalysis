An idyllic South Pacific Islands beach: coconut palms bristling above a bone-white sliver of sand, and luminous aqua water lapping softly on shore. This is the delicious stretch of sand on Direction Island in the Cocos (Keeling) islands.

This remote Australian Territory of two atolls and 27 coral islands lies about a 4.5-hour flight from Perth. In 2016, with permission from the locals, beach expert and author Brad Farmer christened this sublime slice of coast "Cossies," after Australia's 26th Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove.

Bordered by lush coconut palms, this beguiling beach curves seductively out into the tropical turquoise sea, and you can snorkel among coral gardens and diverse marine life in the crystal-clear waters.
