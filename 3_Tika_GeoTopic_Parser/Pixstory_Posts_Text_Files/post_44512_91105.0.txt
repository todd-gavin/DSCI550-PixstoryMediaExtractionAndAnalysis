New player loan laws have been agreed by FIFA ahead of the 2022-23 season. According to FCInterNews, the Italian news agency, football's global governing body has approved new guidelines for loaning players in and out, which will take effect on July 1.
The new guidelines are intended to encourage positive development of young players and competitive balance, as well as prohibit clubs from stockpiling players.
Special requirements governing the specifics and durations that must be mentioned in loan contracts, as well as new laws discouraging loan agreements between two teams, are included in the new regulations.
According to the new rules, no single club can have more than three players on loan from another club, and no single club can loan more than three players to another club.
Clubs will be able to loan in or out eight players at a time next season, but this will only be a transitional stage, as this will be cut to seven players in 2023-24 and six players in 2024-25.
The following year, the number will reduce to seven, and from 2024-25 onwards, it will remain at six. 
The new rules will take effect on July 1st. However, homegrown athletes and those under the age of 21 will be excluded from the rules.
The regulations also involve the establishment of a minimum loan period of two transfer windows, with a maximum duration of one year.
FIFA also said that a club may have no more than three professionals leased out to it and no more than three professionals loaned in from it. It is also forbidden to "sub-loan" players to a third club.
