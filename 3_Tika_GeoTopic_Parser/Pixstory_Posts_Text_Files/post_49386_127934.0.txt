Religion is a very personal thing, and for many people, it's the only thing that matters in their lives. The "my way or highway" attitude towards people of other faiths often leads to discrimination - on the basis of religion - and this has negative consequences for both believers and non-believers alike.

In a world where religion is still so important to so many people, it's important that everyone realizes that every religion is important to its followers. We need to start to put an end to all the discrimination that happens on the basis of religious beliefs. The feeling of being the superior needs ro go.

We don't need more Christians. In fact, we don't need more religious people either. We need more people who believe in secularism and understand that wanting everyone to be alike leads to nothing but destruction. Being secular means you don't have to blindly follow any rules or dogma that isn't supported by evidence. It also allows you to think for yourself and make your own decisions based on what you believe is right instead of simply trusting what others tell you.

We need to be able to build a more tolerant society where everyone can live peacefully and without fear of persecution based on their beliefs, or somebody constantly lingering around them telling them they're going to hell for not being Christians, especially when we're currently facing all the negative consequences of the Christian nationalism.
