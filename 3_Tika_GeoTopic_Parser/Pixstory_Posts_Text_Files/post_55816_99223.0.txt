Rebecca Slater has rightly pointed out that many in the American intelligentsia have only recently discovered the existence of a white American proletariat, thanks to Trump. They've flocked to books like JD Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, which analyses and explains the unfathomable crazies who are hell-bent on elevating a hand grenade in human form to the presidency of the United States. 

In Australia are not even interested in the second efflorescence of One Nation, despite the fact that we should be. Luke Carman is our best and most vital guide if we want to know what the silent majority of our country is thinking.

An Elegant Young Man, Carman's semi-autobiographical story of growing up in Sydney's western suburbs, is the sharpest, funniest, most eloquent, and intellectually urgent depiction of what it is to be a working class Australian that I have encountered. This single slim work contains more wit, sincere eloquence, comedic brutality, and unapologetic self-evaluation than any other title produced in the United States. Although the prose is deliciously untidy, the thinking that animates it is succinct, and ruthlessly so. This is not a story for the classroom.
