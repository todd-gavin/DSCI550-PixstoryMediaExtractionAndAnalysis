Oh, that's interesting. Your post gave me perspective, I actually never gave a thought to the fact that people could hate these things in a book, haha.

I really like it when they show main characters in middle ages acting like how we behave in today's times. It adds the sense of rebellion in that character for me, which I find extremely interesting. For example, a woman riding on a horse carefree, challenging men and being outspoken. It's great to see someone who relates to our mindset in a book. That's fun to read.

I also like that it's not too realistic. Like I'm reading fiction for a reason. I want the main character to stand out. Not to mention, necessarily adding the social causes in a medieval book takes away a good fiction from me. Like, I like reading books that address them but I also like reading books that don't. I heard somebody say one time that the marginalized communities are allowed to write happy disney fiction for them without it being rubbed in their faces that they were supposed to be oppressed.

I also like all thoze details. Ocean blue and chestnut brown et. Al. I think it gives a very poetic, very 'fictitious' sense to fiction, if that makes sense.
