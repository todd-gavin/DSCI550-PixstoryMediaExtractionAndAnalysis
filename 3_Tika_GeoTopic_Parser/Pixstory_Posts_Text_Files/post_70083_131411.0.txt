Chapora Yuvak Sangh edged past FC Goa 4-3 to move ahead in 18th edition of the Goa Police Football Cup, organised by Goa Police Sports Cell, at Parra ground, on Tuesday. The teams were locked 2-2 at full time. 
Both the teams started on a positive note with play shifting on both ends. In the 16th minute, Chapora's Pratik Dargalkar sent in a low cross which found Sachidanand Satelkar in the ideal position and he scored the opening goal. 
Soon, Chapora could have scored their second but  Sachidanand's effort went wide from close.
The young Gaurs regrouped and levelled terms in the 26th minute with a cool calm finish by Amen Altar.
They then took the lead through Bryson Pereira who slotted the ball home from handshaking distance. 
However, it did not take long for Chapora to make it 2-2 as Rohit Totad's header hit the far upright before entering the goal. 
In the 69th minute, FC Goa's Versley Paes struck a powerful 25-yard strike which was palmed away for a corner by keeper Soma Korgaonkar.
In the closing minutes of the match Chapora keeper Soma pulled off two brilliant saves to stop Versley and Sidney Lucas efforts.
