The majority of young children treated with peanut immunotherapy achieved desensitisation after two and a half years of treatment and one in five remained in remission weeks after treatment ended according to a randomised controlled trial published in The Lancet Achieving remission was more common the younger the child was at the start of therapy of those aged one year old of those aged two years old and of those aged three years old achieved remission Peanut allergy affects of children in Western countries and most remain allergic across their lifetime Current standard of care for children with peanut allergy is dietary avoidance and access to self injectable epinephrine but the risk of peanut induced anaphylaxis from accidental exposures persists highlighting the need for safe and effective therapies Immunotherapy involves repeated exposure over time to gradually increasing doses of the allergen to reduce allergic reactions Previous studies in school aged children and young adults have demonstrated that peanut oral immunotherapy can achieve desensitisation an increased allergic reaction threshold while on therapy in most participants but success in achieving remission lack of reactivity after discontinuing therapy over a prolonged period has been limited Therefore the observation that one in five children achieved remission is the most novel outcome in this study and it provides a better indication of a lasting treatment effect than desensitisation The study included peanut allergic children and measured desensitisation safe consumption of mg peanut protein powder in a food challenge supervised by researchers after two and a half years of daily treatment and remission ability to repeat this food challenge weeks after treatment ended In children who received peanut oral immunotherapy achieved desensitisation versus in the placebo group while achieved remission versus in the the placebo group Read more
