The Pakistan cricket team has been heavily criticized for their pathetic and lackluster showing in the Asia Cup Final defeat to the spirited Sri Lankans In particular the batting seems to be an area of concern for Pakistan cricket fans as it looks to be a major weakness on the side Mohammad Rizwan has come under fire for his showing in the final and we will look at why he doesn t and does deserve to be blamed for the loss One reason why he does deserve to be blamed for the loss is that given his experience he was aware of what was required at the time and did not bat accordingly Pakistan required close to runs an over in the middle overs and the wicketkeeper batsman showed no sign of upping the ante This is no surprise as we have seen this defensive approach from the batsman all tournament despite him being the top run getter In the modern game especially the strike rate is extremely important and Rizwan s strike rate on Sunday was unacceptable as he scored runs from balls The idea of playing an anchoring role in T international is outdated While Pakistan smiddle order is weak and has been exposed previously in the tournament the likes of Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan have proved they are no mugs with the bat against India Nawaz s innings proved to be vital and he swayed the momentum back in Pakistan s favor Shadab also has a brilliant strike rate against spin which took the game away from Pakistan s grip Rizwan struggled against the likes of Hasaranga and consumed far too many dot balls in the middle orders He also failed to hit boundaries which meant the required run rate would just increase over by over Pakistan eventually lost the match here and Rizwan should take huge responsibility for the loss
