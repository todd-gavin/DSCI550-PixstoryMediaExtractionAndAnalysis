July The day our founding fathers made the American dream come true America where citizens have the ability and aspiration to better their circumstances is a bright symbol of light a beacon of hope Our nation strives to become a place of opportunities where people from all backgrounds can thrive to achieve their life goals Although we have made mistakes messed up a few times we are still working toward that ideal The progress and changes in our laws constantly build a country that inspires hope in millions of people throughout the world To an even better America and to the American dream Happy fourth of july
