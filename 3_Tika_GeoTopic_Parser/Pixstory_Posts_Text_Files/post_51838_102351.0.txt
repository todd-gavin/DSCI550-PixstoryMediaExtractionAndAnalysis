May is mental health awareness month people! These little critters slow me down and center me again when I see them. Since I am often running in some way or another I need the reminders to slow down, shift perspective, and just be. 

We are so big and so small in life, and our nature presents both opportunities for us to see this. Itâ€™s nice ðŸ˜Š.

Sending thanks to these little ladies, and thanks to the safe havens like Little Island in New York City that provide room for them to roam. 

How do you slow down and take care of yourself?
