If you exclusively pump, the mother and her baby will still get most of the benefits of directly breastfeeding. The uterus will still shrink quicker after giving birth than if it were to formula feed, mothers are still at lower risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and a bottle pumped the same day can still provide the baby with antibodies to the bacteria and viruses you are exposed to.

However, the constant freezing, thawing, and reheating routine can deplete some of the proteins and vitamins in your breast milk. So if a mother is exclusively pumping, itâ€™s a good idea to try to feed your baby freshly pumped milk the majority of the time.

Breast pumps and bottles are also prone to picking up bacteria and mold, which could cause some serious illnesses for the little one, so be sure all caregivers are practicing proper storage and sanitation.

Breastfeeding is better for supporting proper jaw, teeth, and speech development, whereas extended use of a bottle is known to cause tooth decay, misalignment, and speech delay. Bottle feeding also gives your baby less control over their milk flow and intake, making them more likely to be gassy and putting them at a higher risk of overeating and obesity later in life.
