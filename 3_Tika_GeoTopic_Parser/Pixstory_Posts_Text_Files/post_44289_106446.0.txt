Malta will meet San Marino at the Stadio Olimpico di Serravalle on Sunday to begin their UEFA
Nations League campaign.

San Marino's Nations League campaign got off to a bad start as they were defeated 2-0 by
Estonia on Thursday.Since a goalless draw with Gibraltar in the Nations League in November
2020, they have lost each of their past 16 matches.The next opponent is a team that has failed
to win any of their past seven games, losing five and drawing two.

Malta's last match took place in November 2021, when they drew 2-2 with Cyprus in Group H of
the World Cup qualifiers.They had been on a five-game losing streak before to then, scoring one
goal and allowing 11 in that period.Malta enters the weekend having lost their past seven games
in all competitions, dating back to a 1-0 triumph over Latvia in October 2020.
