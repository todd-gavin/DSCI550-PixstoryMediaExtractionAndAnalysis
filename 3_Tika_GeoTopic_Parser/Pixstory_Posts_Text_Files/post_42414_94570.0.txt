It is with our deepest sadness we have to
announce that our baby boy has passed away.
It is the greatest pain that any parent can feel.
Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the
strength to live this moment with some hope
and happiness.

We would like to thank the doctors and nurses
for all their expert care and support.
We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly
ask for privacy at this very difficult time.
Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will
always love you.

For any parent, losing a son is a huge loss and we canâ€™t even imagine, how much pain Ronaldo and Georgina are suffering from.

May God give strength to Ronaldo and his family.
