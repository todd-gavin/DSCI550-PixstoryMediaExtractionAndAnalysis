Eminem aka Marshall Mathers, is a household name all over the world at this point. 
The 8 mile famed rapper turns 50 today, and he has without a shadow of doubt left a huge impression on people of my generation, and is truly a role model for most of us. 
Eminem grew up facing adversities, with his father leaving his family, when he was less than 2 weeks old. He grew up being bullied, to the point where, one time, somebody had stuffed his mail box with the head of a dead kitten. 
So it goes without saying that Em has had a rough childhood. 
Eminem has become the best selling artist of the 21st century. Neilsen revealed the statistics that Eminem has sold over 72 million units sold, while Taylor Swift is on the second spot with 57 millions. 
He has been through so much, and has still accomplished so much, is a testament to the fact that You can do anything you put your mind to.
