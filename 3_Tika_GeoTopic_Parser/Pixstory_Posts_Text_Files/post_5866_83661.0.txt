#FridayReads #books #bookrecommendations The Art of Happiness by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler. M.D. 

"In this book I have sought to present the Dalai Lama's approach to a primarily Western audience. I have included extensive excerpts from his public teachings and our private conversations. In keeping with my purpose of trying to emphasise the material that is most readily applicable to the Dalai Lama's discussions that chosen to omit portions of philosophical aspects of Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama has already written a number of excellent books on various aspects of the Buddhist path. A bibliography of some of his works can be found on page 269, and those interested in more in-depth exploration of Tibetan Buddhism will find much of value in these books," Howard C. Cutler
