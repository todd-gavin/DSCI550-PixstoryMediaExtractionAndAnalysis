Udinese&#39;s sporting director Pierpaolo Marino doesn&#39;t tell them after the match against Milan He&#39;s not there because according to him the penalty for the Rossoneri was not managed well with the initial decision to let referee Marinelli continue, recalled shortly after to the Var More than angry I&#39;m enraged, in reality I&#39;ve played football for many years suffering with medium-small teams but today I still see that there are guidelines that then have to be disregarded thundered Pierpaolo Marino Mazzoleni&#39;s speech at the VAR was beyond logic there was nothing doubt Penalties shouldn&#39;t interest the VAR an episode that changes the game These decisions made the game take a different turn after our great start I really hope there are adequate clarifications The players then what they have to say on the pitch I don&#39;t understand Mazzoleni what he had to intervene Let the VAR decide then I don&#39;t understand all the episodes In this case the VAR doesn&#39;t help but disturbs the referee Udinese without the nervousness generated by that decision changed the game
