The Rihanna empire is expanding. According to paperwork acquired by Billboard, on Friday, July 15, Rihanna's business Roraj Trade, LLC, submitted two applications for Fenty Hair to the USPTO.

According to the documents, the hair goods will include wigs, curlers, pins, brushes, combs, scrunchies, bows, clips, ribbons, hair bands, and more.

With Fenty Skin, Savage x Fenty, and Fenty Beauty, the singer and entrepreneur has already established a significant business. Rihanna was included to Forbes' list of America's Richest Self-Made Women due to the success of her Fenty products, with the position at No. 21. She is the youngest person on the list, and according to the journal, she is worth roughly $1.4 billion, a large portion of which comes from the cosmetics company Fenty Beauty.
