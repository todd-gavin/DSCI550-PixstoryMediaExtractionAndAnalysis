When you eat breakfast, your memory and concentration improve. Studies show breakfast eaters have greater attention spans and perform better on spatial and cognitive tests.

On the flip side, breakfast skippers are more likely to get stomach pains and headaches caused by hunger, making learning and test-taking challenging.


In general, breakfast eaters are healthier. They are more likely to meet the nutritional recommendations for their age groups, especially for vitamins A, C, riboflavin, calcium, zinc, iron and fiber.
Chronic conditions like diabetes can also be significantly improved by maintaining a healthy diet, starting with a good breakfast. Diabetes is difficult to control if meals, especially breakfast, are skipped. (But always remember to consult your doctor before making changes to your diet, especially if you have a chronic condition.)

Breakfast shunners tend to have higher cholesterol levels, increasing their risk for heart disease. They also tend to snack more on high-fat, low-nutrition foods and are more likely to overeat at lunch because of excessive hunger.
Some research suggests that regular breakfast consumption can help you lose weight and maintain that weight by revving up your metabolism to burn calories throughout the day.
Eating foods with protein and fiber in the morning also gets you off to a smart start by keeping your appetite in check for the rest of the day.
