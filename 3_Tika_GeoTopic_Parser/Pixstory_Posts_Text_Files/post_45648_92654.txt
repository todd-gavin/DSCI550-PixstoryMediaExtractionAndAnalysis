The problem with today s generation is that everything is too convenient for them With technology on the tip of their fingers everything is achievable with a click Therefore they have forgotten what it is like to work hard Marriage is an institution that requires hardwork commitment and sacrifice all the virtues lacking in today s kids When two people from different backgrounds come together they face several challenges but they always make it work if they truly love each other However some people want even love served to them in a platter and on the first sign of struggle they take the route of divorce No wonder today s generation is as lonely as it gets Additionally I can t imagine the plight of the children whose parents go through divorce Imagine spending the rest of your life trying to choose between your mother and father Every child deserves a complete family with a happy environment to grow up in but people selfish enough to go for divorce deprive their children of this too No wonder almost everyone these days have mental health issues because of lack of a strong foundation of love and sacrifice Therefore instead of going for divorce people should learn what it takes to make a marriage work from the older generation
