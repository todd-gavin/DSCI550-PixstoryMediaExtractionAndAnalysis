Chelsea and Sevilla are on the same page when it comes to the transfer of Jules Kounde.

The Blues desperately want him and the Spanish side want to sell him as soon as possible.

That is why the two clubs have already agreed a fee of £55million for the Frenchman this summer.

Despite these claims, Barcelona sources has reported that the Frenchman spoke to Xavi and said he wants to join the Catalonian side this summer.

If that is the case then it makes sense why stories are now coming out saying that Kounde is waiting for Barcelona's response to Chelsea's offer.

According to Víctor Navarro, via Reshad Rahman, Kounde, for the time being, is waiting to see what Barcelona does.

However, if it was up to Sevilla, he would already be a Chelsea player, the Spanish journalist claims.
