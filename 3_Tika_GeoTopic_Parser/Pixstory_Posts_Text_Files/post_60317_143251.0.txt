The victory over Swedish wrestler Emma Jonna Malmgren for the 53 kg bronze medal on Wednesday made Vinesh Phogat the first Indian woman wrestler to take home two medals from the World Championships.
In the 2019 edition in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, Vinesh, then age 28, also took home a bronze medal.
Vinesh made an incredible recovery after suffering a shocking loss in the qualification round, defeating Malmgren 8-0 in the bronze medal match.
After losing to Mongolia's Khulan Batkhuyag, the silver medalist at the 2022 Asian Championships, in her opening match on Tuesday, she advanced to the bronze play-off in the repechage round.
Following Batkhuyag's success in the final, triple Commonwealth Games champion Vinesh advanced to the repechage round.
To proceed to the bronze medal round in the repechage round, Vinesh first defeated Zhuldyz Eshimova of Kazakhstan by Victory by Fall (4-0) decision. She then won the following match after Leyla Gurbanova of Azerbaijan failed to show up due to injury.
