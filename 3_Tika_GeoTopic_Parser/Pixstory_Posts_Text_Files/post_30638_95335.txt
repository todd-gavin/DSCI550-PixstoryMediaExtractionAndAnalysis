Phoenix Suns New Orleans Pelicans Surprise victory for the guests at the home of the best team of the regular season At home, the Suns are concerned about the condition of Devin Booker who was released with a muscle problem in his right flexor after scoring points in just minutes on the field Lost their Phoenix star collapsed under the blows of an excellent Brandon Ingram author of a triple double narrowly missed by points, rebounds and assists well supported by a CJ McCollum from Memphis Grizzlies Minnesota Timberwolves The match between the seventh and second seeded in the West is also tied with the hosts responding to the defeat in the opening match with an authoritative victory already addressed with the Memphis half-time dragged by the star Ja Morant who scores points, rebounds and assists but the whole team runs wonderfully so much that good points arrive off the bench Minnesota game hero Anthony Edwards scored points while Karl Anthony Towns was limited by fouls
