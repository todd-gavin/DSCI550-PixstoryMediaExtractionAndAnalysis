‌California was shot right at the heart by multiple shooters who opened fire downtown killing 6 people, and wounding 12 people.
‌
‌The firing happened around 2:00 am on Sunday. Despite the interference of police several were wounded in the incident. Police said that a fight apparently took place before the shooting incident. The people who shot the video and footage CCTV will also aid the investigation.
‌
‌Meanwhile, President has once again issued a statement calling for more gun control. He mourned the loss of the families. He also stated that we must do more than mourn but act. He also pushed on 'Ban ghost guns,' and 'Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.' He pointed out to Congress the urgency of these decisions. 
‌
‌Day by day we see an increase in issues regarding gun violence. We wish to put an end to it. Thank you President; may your action speak louder than your words.
