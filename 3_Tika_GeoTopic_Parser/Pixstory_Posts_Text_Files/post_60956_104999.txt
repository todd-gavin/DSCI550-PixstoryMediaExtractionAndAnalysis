Cereals This was one of my favorite breakfasts and to be honest the only breakfast I had It was also a sneaky midnight snack It is always a trip down to memory lane when I buy a small packet to eat as a snack Noodles Eating Indomie in Saudi and making Maggi and yippie in India is such a nostalgic hit Even though I regularly eat noodles even now Even single time I eat noodles it reminds me of my playful stress free days Chocolate cake This was considered a luxury dessert I used to get it monthly after we went out for a fancy dinner The light and creamy chocolate icing paired with the rich yet fluffy chocolate sponge cake So decadent and wholesome Chicken soup The occasion for making this soup was not a happy one but it made our day better Whenever we used to get sick like cough and cold or the flu my dad used to whip up some hot seasoned chicken soup warming not only our tummies and throat by also our souls Moreover man was it the fastest way to get rid of the flu
