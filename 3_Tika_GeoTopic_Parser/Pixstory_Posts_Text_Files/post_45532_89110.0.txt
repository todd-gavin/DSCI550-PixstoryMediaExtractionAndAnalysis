Real Madrid were enraged in Tuesday's Women's Champions League match against Barcelona after the Blaugrana were awarded an easy spot-kick early in the second half.

In extra time, Alexia Putellas of Barcelona makes it 3-1.

Real Madrid threatened an upset against the holders after Olga Carmona gave them an early lead and Esther González's second was denied by the post.

After a foul on Caroline Graham Hansen, Alexia Putellas equalised from the spot on 53 minutes, Clàudia Pina came off the bench to give Barcelona the lead nine minutes later, and Putellas added their third.

They had a 1-0 lead at the moment, but after Alexia Putellas scored from the penalty spot, Barcelona went on to win the quarter-final last 16 match handily.

As a result, Real Madrid was denied their first Clasico triumph over their rivals.

"Until the penalty we competed, we were superior," Real Madrid coach Alberto Toril said in his post-match news conference. "After the penalty, they were better. I'm annoyed, because this is a Champions League quarter-final, we should be more demanding. Nobody was asking for a penalty. There was a slight contact. That penalty shouldn't have been given.

"[The scoreline] is a bit excessive, given what we saw on the pitch," he added. "Today I have the feeling we could have won. It was very even. We could have gone in further ahead at half time, because Esther hit the post and had the one-on-one. They hardly created any chances in the first half, but the second half was more even."
