Former World No. 1 Roger Federer of Swiss has announced that he would retire from professional tennis following the Laver Cup in 2022. The renowned tennis player wrote a lengthy message on Thursday to discuss his retirement plans.
"The people I've met along the way—my friends, my rivals, and most importantly the fans who give the sport its life—have without a doubt been the greatest gifts tennis has given me over the years. I wanted to let you all know some news today," Federer remarked
The legendary Swiss tennis player went on to say that the forthcoming Laver Cup would be his last ATP competition. Federer has had trouble making the cut in big events over the past three years, though he is already embracing the end of his illustrious tennis career. Federer has played more than 1500 matches over the course of his 24-year, trophy-filled career.
I am 41 years of age. Over the course of 24 years, I have participated in over 1500 games. I've been treated more kindly by tennis than I ever could have imagined, but now I have to decide whether to call it quits on my competitive career. My last ATP competition will be the Laver Cup next week in London. Of sure, I'll continue to play tennis in the future, but not in Grand Slam events or on the professional tour, said Federer.
