The last match played by Roger Federer dated July It was the Wimbledon tournament when he was defeated in the quarterfinals by Hubert Hurkacz The right knee injury and the consequent third operation of his career kept him away from the playing fields and will keep him at least few months We will see how the body will react so as to eventually consider the hypothesis of returning to hitting the balls in April or May Federer himself said in an interview with one of his sponsors Credit Suisse I would like the times to be shorter but the doctors don&#39;t want him to skip steps From what it turns out the Swiss tennis player works every day in the gym but still can&#39;t run I really hope to be able to work the knee within two or three weeks Then we&#39;ll see how the body reacts In any case I&#39;m still extremely motivated
