Due to the continuation of the stalemate in the negotiations with the industry on the price of tomatoes in Lombardy, the sowings planned for this season have already been reduced by at least 1, which will no longer be recovered, as estimated by Coldiretti Lombardia in denouncing the extreme delay in defining the contract for harvest Every day that passes without agreement says the regional Coldiretti are more hectares of lost production precisely at a time when Italy with the war in Ukraine and the explosion in the costs of raw materials and energy needs to deploy all its resources to guarantee food production and food supplies to families The lack of an agreement continues Coldiretti does not allow farmers to face rapidly rising production costs to which is added a drought situation which has been going on for months in Lombardy and which contributes to jeopardize the cultivation of red gold Time can no longer be wasted continues the regional Coldiretti An agreement is needed immediately that recognizes the right price to farmers which cannot be less than euros per ton Below this threshold it makes no sense to sign any contract it is better to sell the product directly at harvest time The strategic price agreement for farmers says Coldiretti because those who choose to grow tomatoes must order seedlings for the summer harvest with the risk that the jump in costs will lead even historical producers to choose crops that require less investment and lower risks such as corn, sorghum, sunflower and soy whose prices exploded with the war in Ukraine and international trade tensions, it is urgent that all the players in the supply chain show themselves to be mature and responsible, continues Coldiretti Lombardia We must all row in the same direction which aims at transparency of the supply chain and the valorisation of the 100% made in Italy product
