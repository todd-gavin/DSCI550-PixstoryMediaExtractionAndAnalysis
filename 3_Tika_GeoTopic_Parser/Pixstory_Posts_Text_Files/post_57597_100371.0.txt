It was a sullen afternoon for people in Buffalo on Saturday when ten innocent lives were killed at a supermarket. An 18-year-old man wearing military gear and a helmet approached the store and opened fire on shoppers and employees. Ten people were killed, and two were injured.
The officials describe it as a racially motivated hate crime as 11 out of 13 people were black.

Payton Gendron was a resident of Conklin, Newyork; he arrived at the store in his car.
Although the true intentions behind the scene are still unclear, some instances indicate "racial animosity". He considered himself a white supremacist, fascist and antisemite, according to a document he wrote in his high school. He was under medical supervision for the same.

President Biden, while addressing the rampage, said,  “We still need to learn more about the motivation for [the] shooting as law enforcement does its work, but we don’t need anything else to state a clear moral truth: A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation.”


He also added: “Any act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America. Hate must have no safe harbour. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.”
