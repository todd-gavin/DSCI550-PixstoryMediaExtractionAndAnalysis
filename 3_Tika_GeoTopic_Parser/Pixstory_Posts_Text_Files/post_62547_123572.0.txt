Have you ever wondered what animal kills the most humans? Here's your answer:

Mosquito.

Even while it may seem implausible that something so tiny can actually kill a lot of people, over 1 million people every year die as a result of mosquito bites, according to the World Health Organization. A mosquito's ability to spread viruses or other parasites that result in deadly diseases is what makes it so deadly. Each year, the Anopheles mosquito alone, which carries the malaria virus, kills 400,000 people and renders 200 million others temporarily unable to function. 

So look out for these little bloodsuckers next time you go camping!
