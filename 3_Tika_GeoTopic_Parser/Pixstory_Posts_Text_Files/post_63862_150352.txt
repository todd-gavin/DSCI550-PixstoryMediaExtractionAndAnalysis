Soulstice is an action adventure hack and slash game developed by Reply Games Studio and published by Modus Games Mechanics wise Soulstice borrows heavily from elements of Darksiders and Devil May Cry the only difference being that while DMC is more on the lighthearted goofy side of things Soulstice is dark grim and bleak The combat is the shining point mostly focused on close combat The game forces and rewards innovation in combat putting players in a position to diversify their playstyle and experiment rather than stick to one style over and over again Whether it is simple light attacks or brutal heavy attack combos there s so much more on the table for you to take that it is indeed amazing Action is fast fun the enemy variety is great while the combination of different enemy types can be challenging when they surround you in variety rather than numbers Its downfalls are that it s plagued with by terrible camera loads of bugs and a steep learning curve Furthermore to not spoil the story suffice it to say that the story is not particularly imaginative being a bit predictable at several points Though the game s setting is rather good with its dark dreary somewhat gothic setting remind you of dark fantasy mangas such as Goblin Slayer and Berserk the environments are rather linear with little to explore while the colour palette of the game is so desaturated that it can be frustrating One of the biggest downfalls of the game is the characters as throughout the game you could not be bothered to care about any of them being pretty bland in design while the conversations are largely uninteresting so it does not exactly help in making you care about the stakes Overall Soulstice delivers some pretty engrossing action having just enough freedom facilitate creative combat The game is challenging and provides a good time at least on the first playthrough Unfortunately it s also bogged down by various negative factors ranging from bad camera control dull palette to overall unnecessary tedium at times that can make the game rather frustrating Score
