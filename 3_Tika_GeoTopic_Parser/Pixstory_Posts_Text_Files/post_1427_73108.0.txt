In response to the recent movement of Indian men against the criminalisation of marital rape - we women have only one thing to say: Lol. 

Indian men - who do not seem to understand the notion of consent whatsoever - are coming out to boycott marriage in droves, claiming that they fear false rape accusations from women. 

Well, we don't have any problem with that. Please, do not get married if you're so afraid of women ruining your life with false accusations! Seems like a win-win situation all round. 

The men don't have to fear about those hypothetical, hysterical evil women who are out to ruin lives with false accusations (never mind that this is a bogeyman and that rape is vastly under-reported if anything) and the women can live their lives in peace, without having to worry about a man demanding 24x7 access to their bodies as if marriage has given him that right.
