Calling heroes overrated would be one of many topics in popular culture that would spark a passionate discussion among fans. 

As tvovermindsays, the truth is that many heroes are overrated, but until supporters of them have gained a little more perspective through time, they don't want to hear this. 

Let's face it, we prefer to admire the heroes since they save the day and are there to keep civilians safe when we are younger and into everything that has to do with superheroes. People don't want to criticise heroes since they are supposed to be the ones who can be counted on to represent humanity at its best. 

The hero-worship that such a concept might inspire eventually backfires because it gives the impression that heroes are exempt from accountability and can get away with anything. The most  popular heroes in modern comic books aren't necessarily those that are thought of as heroes, which is a sad fact.

How many times we have seen that heroes in the pursuit of  saving the city, destroy so many lives. But no one ever questions them. Why is that so?
