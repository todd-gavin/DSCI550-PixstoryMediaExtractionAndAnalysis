Former President Donald Trump asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to share any embarrassing material he had about the Biden family in a new interview published Tuesday, in a blatant appeal for domestic political assistance from America's biggest adversary. 

It's the latest sign of Trump's willingness to seek and accept domestic political assistance from foreign powers, including Putin, who is presently directing a horrific conflict in Ukraine. 

CNN has reported that Trump pushed an unverified claim about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Russia in an interview with JustTheNews, and demanded Putin to reveal any information he might have regarding the matter. It's unclear whether any such materials exist or whether the Kremlin has access to them.

â€œI would think Putin would know the answer to that," Trump said, referring to Hunter Biden's potential dealings in Russia. "I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer."

As Marshall Cohen pointed out, while his father, President Joe Biden, was vice president, Hunter Biden was paid handsomely for consulting work he did in foreign countries such as Ukraine and China. These transactions and potential financial crimes are the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the Justice Department. 

However, there has been no proof to back up Trump's assertions that the Bidens were involved in corruption or impacted US policy for personal gain, and the President has not been named in the investigation. Hunter Biden has denied misconduct and stated that he would be cleared once the criminal investigation is completed.
