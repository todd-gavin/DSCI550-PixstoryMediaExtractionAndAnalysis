The above image pops up when you search for ‘Genderqueer’ in Getty Images and I hate that this gross misrepresentation describes how I feel when I look back at photos from my forced performance of femininity.

Congratulations Getty Images, on your innovative use to technology as a weapon to lengthen the ongoing legacy of misrepresenting gender nonconformity.
