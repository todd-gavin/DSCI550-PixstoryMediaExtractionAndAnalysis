The word home surely has a concrete meaning to it but it has definitely taken up a lot more meanings with the evolution of mankind It has become a subjective term for each individual creating their own perception of it For my mother home is where her family is For my sister home is a person with whom she feels most comfortable with and for me home can be a feeling a person a place or even your pet but it is definitely something which is never permanent I believe that home would be described by anyone as their comfort and their loving zone but what everyone truly forgets is how we need to always leave that zone and get out of it to fend for ourselves in this world That feeling of home that we derive certainly is felt after each individual goes through multiple obstacles and hurdles in life We all try as much as we can to make our homes permanent but it will always be a temporary feeling and that is what upsets me to an extent but also makes me hopeful and cheerful waiting for the time when I can finally feel at ease and be home and feel the joy of being with my loved ones and cherishing those moments forever I will always be eager and hopeful to reach home but always upset to let go of it
