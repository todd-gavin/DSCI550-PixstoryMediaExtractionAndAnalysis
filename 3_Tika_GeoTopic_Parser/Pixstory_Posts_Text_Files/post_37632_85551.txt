Ravindra Jadeja stood tall with his all round brilliance as he complemented his unbeaten with nine wickets in India s innings and run win against a Sri Lankan team that looked anything but Test class in a match that ended inside three days After being bowled out for in the first innings Sri Lanka who lost wickets on the day were dismissed for in their second essay In the first innings they were one short of Jadeja s individual score and in the second they were three more which speaks about their plight India lead the two match series and will like to gain full points from the rubber by winning the Pink Ball Test in Bengaluru starting March It is after years that an Indian has scored runs and taken five wickets in an innings Jadeja not out and made the match his own while Ravichandran Ashwin in overs also had a satisfying run replacing Kapil Dev in games as India s second highest wicket taker with victims He is now only behind Anil Kumble s scalps Jadeja s heroics with both the ball and the bat earned him the man of the match award
