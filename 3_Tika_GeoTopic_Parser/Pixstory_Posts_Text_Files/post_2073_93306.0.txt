I believe that many would agree that there needs to be some regulation on firearms. Now that is not to say that what we have now is too little, in fact, we have now might be too much. But we cannot allow Democrats to continually and slowly erode our Second Amendment rights through regulation. This new crack down on ghost guns really doesn’t make much sense when you think about it.

Whether a gun is serialized or not, that will not change whether a bad actor wants to kill or maim somebody with it. For example, a significant number of murders with guns occur at the hands of gang members who are already predisposed to gun violence irrespective of deserialization on the gun.

I mean, do Democrats think that real life is like one of those murder-for-hire movies where somebody has an untraceable gun and so nobody can track them down because of that?

Democrats continue to try and throw useless statistics at us, for example, where they say that all of these crimes occurred with an unserialized firearm. OK, now all the guns are serialized, what’s the next thing they’re going to say causes a lot of firearm deaths? Different bullet types? Specific rifles? You can see that policy makers are duped into slowly eroding our rights by falling prey to the nonsensical talking points of far left advocates who don’t care about unserialized firearms, but who only care about getting rid of guns entirely, and they use these non-issues as a facade to seem less radical.
