Two years have passed since former police officer Derek Chauvin publicly lynched GeorgeFloyd.

Seven hundred thirty days since a gruesome display of white supremacy sparked the largest mass mobilization against anti-Black racism in U.S. history.

Yet, despite a national uprising and state-by-state demands to reimagine public safety, Joe Biden and other elected officials have failed to take meaningful action on police violence. What action they have taken came only after we organized and made clear demands.

We need to see a substantial divestment from massive spending on police that don't keep us safe to a large investment in a shared vision of community safety that works for everyone, not just some.

The safest communities in America don't have the most police; they have the most resources. Memorialize George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, and other Black people extrajudicially killed by police by divesting from harmful institutions and investing directly in our communities: This means well-funded schools, good living-wage jobs, affordable housing, and self-determination.
