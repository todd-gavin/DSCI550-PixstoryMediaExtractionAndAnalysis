Anne Heche has been declared legally dead in California, but her heart continues to beat and she has not been removed from life support, her rep confirmed to Variety on Friday. Heche will be kept alive until her organ donation compatibility is verified. She could be discharged as early as Saturday or as late as Tuesday.

“Today we lost a bright light, a kind and most joyful soul, a loving mother, and a loyal friend,” her family and friends said in a statement. “Anne will be deeply missed but she lives on through her beautiful sons, her iconic body of work, and her passionate advocacy. Her bravery for always standing in her truth, spreading her message of love and acceptance, will continue to have a lasting impact.”

“My brother Atlas and I lost our Mom,” Heche’s son Homer Laffoon said in a statement. “After six days of almost unbelievable emotional swings, I am left with a deep, wordless sadness. Hopefully my mom is free from pain and beginning to explore what I like to imagine as her eternal freedom. Over those six days, thousands of friends, family, and fans made their hearts known to me. I am grateful for their love, as I am for the support of my Dad, Coley, and my stepmom Alexi who continue to be my rock during this time. Rest in peace Mom, I love you, Homer.”
