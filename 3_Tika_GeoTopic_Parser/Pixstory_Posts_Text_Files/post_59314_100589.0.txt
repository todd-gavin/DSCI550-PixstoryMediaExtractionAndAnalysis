Hi everyone who is reading this,
Anant Pandey this side. So I want to introduce myself by something which I am proud of myself. It is about a part of my life, where I was once playing Table Tennis; I am so glad that I was able to play such a good sport. Apart from it, I am big Anime weeb. It is like, being a nerd for Anime. I have watched almost all of the famous Anime ever created. My recommendation is “One Piece”. I am going to learn Japanese, just for the sake of watching Anime without subtitles. I also like to Swim occasionally, just for leisure.
I am 21+ Years old, and Single. And, I like to read Novels as well. And, the series of Percy Jackson is one of my favourite. About songs category, so I really like EDM’s, Martin Garrix and Avicci are few among many artist, to whom I like to listen I also like Coldplay.
I am not a picky eater, and pretty much eat anything and everything. I still prefer, Bournvita in milk over Tea & Coffee. I also like to Run, though my BMI is below average, but still I enjoy Cardio.
You can connect with me if you want to know more about me, I would love to have a small chit-chat, please don’t call if you have my contact. I am introvert in that aspect, so it is one of few things I really fear. Can’t help it.
P.S. – Come to me if you want investment advice.
