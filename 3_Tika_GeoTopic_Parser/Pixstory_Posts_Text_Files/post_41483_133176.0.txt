Great opportunities are going to open up for Indian football!

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) suspension, which was put in place as a result of improper third-party influence, has been lifted by the FIFA Council Bureau. 

The FIFA media release said that the choice was made after FIFA received confirmation that the committee of administrators' mandate, which had been established to take over the AIFF Executive Committee's authority, had been terminated and that the AIFF administration had reclaimed complete control over the organization's day-to-day operations. FIFA and the AFC will keep an eye on the situation and assist the AIFF in holding its elections on schedule. 

As a result, India will host the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup 2022TM, which is set to take place from October 11â€“30, 2022.

Everyone is looking forward to this event!
