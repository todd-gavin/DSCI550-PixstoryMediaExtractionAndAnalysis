Pride often serves as a roadblock on the path toward success and the Lakers have exemplified that multiple times over this season On the court an unwillingness by Russell Westbrook to accept a new role has led to a lack of success for both him individually and the team as a whole Away from the court an unwillingness by Rob Pelinka and the front office to admit they got it wrong by bringing in Westbrook is only setting the Lakers back with each passing day At the trade deadline the Lakers opted not to part ways with Westbrook choosing instead to keep future assets like their first round draft picks and potentially Talen Horton Tucker rather than attaching them to Westbrook to dump his salary But their lack of movement at the deadline may not have been solely because they did not want to include future assets and instead may have involved an inability to give up on the idea of Westbrook this season On Tuesday Ramona Shelburne appeared on the Brian Windhorst the Hoop Collective podcast alongside Dave McMenamin to discuss the Lakers On top of the pair reporting the Lakers did not do a deal for Christian Wood because of luxury tax implications Shelburne also revealed some insight into the Lakers thoughts on Westbrook and their unwillingness to pull the ripcord on his time in Los Angeles For front office figures to find success in the NBA and across sports there s a high level of self belief required Pelinka showed that in winning an NBA title but that belief may be a double edged sword right now From the outside looking in it s abundantly clear that things are not going well and likely not salvageable between Westbrook head coach Frank Vogel and the Lakers Save for a complete change of face from one of those parties most likely Westbrook after the All Star break the conclusion has long been written for the Lakers this season
