Thomas Tuchel is overjoyed that Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta's contract has been automatically extended, with the expectation that Antonio Rudiger will provide further reason to rejoice in the coming weeks.

After making 35 appearances this season, long-serving Spaniard Azpilicueta's contract was extended for another year, despite the signing paperwork restrictions now in place at Stamford Bridge. Azpilicueta will not be released because the terms of his contract had previously been agreed upon before club owner Roman Abramovich's assets were blocked by the UK government.

Tuchel expressed his delight and relief with Azpilicueta's decision to stay with the Blues for at least another season, telling reporters about the condition in Azpilicueta's contract:

“I knew it was going to happen because I knew the amount of games before it was going to happen. It was so close.

“It’s a good thing, we were aware of it. It’s good news for us. We have a contract, he’s our captain, it’s a very high possibility he will stay.

“That’s why I am very happy, you know how much I rely on him and how much impact he has in this group and this club. It’s very good news for us.”

Tuchel is still hopeful that Rudiger can be persuaded to extend his stay with Chelsea, and he responded to rumours that "secret" conversations have already begun with those at Camp Nou: "Of course (it's concerning) if it's true." If I were in any other club, I'd try to meet him!

“He’s still our player, we still think there’s a good chance he stays our player once things are solved.

“This situation is the situation at the moment, our hands are tied. We cannot speak, negotiate with him and his agent.

Tuchel added on hearing Barcelona president Joan Laporta admit to having a defender deal lined up, with Danish star Christensen considered to be that man: “We heard he rumours, the same rumours.

“I have no confirmation for you as I did not speak to Andreas about it at the moment but we heard the same rumours.”
