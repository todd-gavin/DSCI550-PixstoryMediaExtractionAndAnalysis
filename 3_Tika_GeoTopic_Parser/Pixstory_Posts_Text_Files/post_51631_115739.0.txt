It's a saying that you should do what you love for living, then the job will be enjoyable. 

Football is called "The beautiful game" , and i fell in love with it.
Cause i forget all my problems when i have football between my feets. 

I was about 6-7 years when my dad introduced me to football , He was also a footballer once. 
It's like drugs , the happiness and feeling i get after playing football is so beautiful. 

I started my career in football in my school , as every school have a football team , The age category for the sub-junior team was 6 standard onwards.

But i got selected in the team when i was in 4th standard. This motivated me like yes i have something in myself and i am different from others,

I started training every day for hours , because i had decided that i want to be a footballer and nothing else, i started watching football matches overnight to see how professional players play. 

Then the Scouts of The UNION FOOTBALL CLUB had eye on me and they asked me to join their football academy. This was my first step towards my dream. i Played Delhi B-Division 

Everyday after training for going home i use to run instead of taking rickshaw. I use to workout after training , i always did extra outside the pitch to improve myself. 

I went to a trail for HINDUSTAN FOOTBALL CLUB , One of the best club in Delhi. I Played U-17  Indian-league , the time when i struggled the most, After i come back home from school i use travel for 6 hours a day for training.

Then i got a professional contract from GARHWAL DIAMOND F.C.
They offered me ‚Çπ1000/match contract. I played the Senior Division league 2021-22. 

After all this success, I Got injured while practicing, i had 2 meniscus tears in my left knee and ACL tear in right after 3 months. 
i have adviced to take rest for 9 months. 
And now, 
I WILL COME BACK STRONGER SOON üí™üèª
