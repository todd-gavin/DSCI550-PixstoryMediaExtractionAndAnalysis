Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,No more modest than immodest.Unscrew the locks from the doors!Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!Whoever degrades another degrades me,And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.Through me many long dumb voices,Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,Voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,And of the rights of them the others are down upon,Of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.Walt Whitman
