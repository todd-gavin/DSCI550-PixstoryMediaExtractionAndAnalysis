On Monday, a group of elite soccer teams will square off against Champions League organiser UEFA in court in a legal dispute that might cause the largest shakeup in European soccer in more than 25 years. 

US News reported that a case has been filed with the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg by the company formed by the 12 rebel clubs, which are now led by Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Juventus. The Super League project was abandoned at its inception 15 months ago. 

Over the course of two days, judges from 15 of the EU's 27 member states will hear arguments, with the majority of those national governments siding with UEFA.

The clubs will accuse UEFA of alleged abuses of market dominance with control of soccer competitions that breach European law.

UEFAâ€™s defense is that it protects the special place of sports in European society by running competitions in a pyramid structure open to all and funding the grass roots of the game.

A ruling is unlikely this year and will not affect the Super League clubs playing in UEFA competitions from September. Ten are in the Champions League groups with Manchester United and Arsenal in the second-tier Europa League.
