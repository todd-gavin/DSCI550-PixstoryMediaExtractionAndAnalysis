This kiwi banana smoothie recipe is surely a trick  . It's full of delicious banana and sweet kiwi ! This kiwi banana smoothie is an easy and quick breakfast or snack with only a few ingredients . It had greek yogurt for extra protein and creaminess ! 😋✨

Ingredients ; 

1 big kiwi
1 small banana
1/2 cup thick curd 
1 scoop vanilla protein ( optional ) 
1 tbsp pumpkin seeds 
3-4 Ice cubes 

Method ;

Put everything in a blender jar and blend ! Blend just until everything is smooth and combined . Don't over blend ! If you over blend then this will cause your smoothie to get watery as the ingredients start to warm up ! 😋
