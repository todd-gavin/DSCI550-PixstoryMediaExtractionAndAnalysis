The movie that brought to us closer to the genius of Quentin Tarantino, it was amazing to see the lead cast together again. For a second I really thought the briefcase mystery would be given a resolution finally but it wasn't the case. What a moment at the Oscars, I wish Tarantino would be there just so we could just see the whole pack together. Pulp Fiction is another movie that has shaped cinema in its own non-linear fashion.
