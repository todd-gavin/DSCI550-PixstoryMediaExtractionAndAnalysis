Roger Federer has competed in more than 1500 games in his career. In all those 1200+ wins the 41-year-old has played some scintillating tennis. But in some matches, he has had to go the extra mile to defeat his opponents that pushed his limits. Thus here are 5 of the best matches that Roger Federer has ever played.
5. Vs Marin Cilic, Wimbledon 2016 QF
2016 was a turbulent year for Roger as he faced problems with his knee for the first time. He had to go through surgery and would miss most of the season. But everyone remembers the 2016 Wimbledon quarter-finals when the Swiss came back from two sets to love down to win the matches against Marin Cilic. The Croatian had dominated the first two sets and had three breakpoint opportunities in the third set at 3-3. But Federer was defiant as he held on. In the fourth set, he saved three match points edging out a close tie break before eventually taking the fifth set 6-3. This match was proof that even at 36 years of age, Federer kept his never say die attitude and hunger for victory.
4. Vs Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 2001 Round of 16
In 1998, Federer won the Boy’s Wimbledon championship. But by 2001, Federer was yet to show his grand slam maturity at the professional level. That finally came against the then world.1, Pete Sampras who was looking to win five back-to-back SW19 titles. The match went into the final set with Sampras having the opportunity to break at 4-4. But Roger would hold steady as Sampras went on to lose his serve and the last set 9-7. Tears rolled down the future world.1’s eyes as the entire Centre Court saw a passing of the guard from one legend to another.
