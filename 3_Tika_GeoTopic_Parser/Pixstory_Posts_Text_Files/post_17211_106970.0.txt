Akshay Kumar is one of the busiest actors in Bollywood, and has an interesting line-up of films ahed. The actor already has Aanand L Rai’s Raksha Bandhan, Amit Rai’s Oh My God 2 (OMG 2), Abhishek Sharma’s Ram Setu, Raj Mehta’s Selfiee, and Ranjit Tewari’s untitled next in the pipeline. While Khiladi Kumar has already finished shooting for many of these, he is in the process of signing another interesting project.


It’s a subject that Akshay and Dino (Dinesh Vijan) have been discussing for a while, and have agreed to collaborate on the same. Once the final script is locked and the papers are signed, they will make an official announcement with the director name and film’s title.
