The Warriors of the last decade have been compared to the Bulls of the 1990s. Aside from six NBA championships, there is one thing that both clubs have in common: Steve Kerr. 

Essentially Sports reported that as a player, Steve Kerr was underappreciated, and his contributions to the Bulls during their second three-peat are largely overlooked. Kerr was a key cog in Jordan's success, winning three championships in the process. When the 2015 NBA champion Warriors paid a visit to the White House, Barack Obama offered a funny joke about Steve Kerr.

In 2016, the Golden State Warriors, the 2015 NBA champions, were invited to the White House. President Barack Obama recognised them at the time. Barack, on the other hand, had some banter for the Dub Nation. By referring to Kerr and the Chicago Bulls, he ridiculed the Warriors. 

"Today, being in the presence of guys from the greatest team in NBA history is really unique," Obama added. "As a result, we're in fairly good shape today. Because one of those players is in our midst. Steve Kerr was a member of the 9th Chicago Bulls in 1995-96. It's great to see you back (indicating Kerr)."
