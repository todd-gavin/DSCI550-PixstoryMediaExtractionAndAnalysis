The man who brought a smile to many children in the 2000s while playing the character of Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) in the Harry Potter franchise has passed away at the age of 72.I am recalling his quote from the documentary named “Harry Potter 20th anniversary: Return to Hogwarts” which is available on Amazon Prime Video and the quote was:- “The legacy of the movies is ... that my children's generation will show them to their children. So you could be watching it in 50 years, easy. I'll not be here, sadly, but... Hagrid will, yes"Rest in Peace Hagrid ☮️😇
