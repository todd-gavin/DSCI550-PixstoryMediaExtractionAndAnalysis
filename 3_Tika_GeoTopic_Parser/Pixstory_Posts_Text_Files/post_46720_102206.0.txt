Your Excellencies,

Prime Minister Kishida, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and President Biden.

Prime Minister Kishida, thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality. It’s a great pleasure for me to be among friends in Tokyo today.

I first of all congratulate Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for the victory in elections, many congratulations. Your being with us only after 24 hours of taking the oath shows the strength of Quad friendship and your commitment to it.

Excellencies,

In such a short time, Quad has assumed an important place on the world stage.

Today the scope of Quad has become broader and the format has become effective.

Our mutual trust, our determination, is giving new energy and enthusiasm to the democratic forces.

Our mutual cooperation at the Quad level is giving a boost to a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, which is the common objective of all of us.

In spite of the adverse circumstances of COVID-19, we have increased coordination in many areas such as vaccine-delivery, climate action, supply chain resilience, disaster response and economic cooperation. This is ensuring peace, prosperity and stability in Indo-Pacific.

Quad is carrying a constructive agenda for the Indo-Pacific region.

This will further strengthen the image of the Quad as a ‘Force for Good’.

Thank you very much.
