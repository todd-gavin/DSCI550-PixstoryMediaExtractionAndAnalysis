There is no doubt that the place must have been very important in the older days. Cunningham has mentioned it to be the largest site between Bihar and Gaya, which makes it very important. There should have been a great place of Buddhist pilgrimage as many indications of visits from persons from faraway lands in India like Punjab, Kerala, Kanchi are found along with those from abroad like Bali and Malaya. The inscriptions found are dated from the 8th to the 12th centuries. But more information is sure to come forth when the other mounds are further explored and excavated. The importance of the place and the need for systematic excavation of the mounds were realized as early as 1902 by Bloch also, but no such work was even carried out at Kurkihar afterwards.

   I had also learnt that around 3 miles from the village, at Punwan, there are a lot more of Buddhist relics to be seen. However, it was learnt that unfortunately, they have not been preserved well and much of it has been destroyed by the digging activities of the villagers. Also, a temple by the name of Triloknath, which once existed there has been carried away for the bricks. During this visit, I could not locate the site in absence of a proper guide, and have reserved the same for the future. The exploration of more such silent sites bearing the testimony of their former prominence continues.

Visit to Kurkihar concluded!
