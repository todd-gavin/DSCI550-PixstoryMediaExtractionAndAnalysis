Filmmaker Hansal Mehta and actor Kangana Ranaut worked together in the film Simran.

The movie did work at the box office well...
The film was critically panned and did not impress the audience. 

Hansal has now reviewed the making of Simran and admitted that working with Kangana was a “massive mistake”. Though he reaffirmed that she is a good actor, he also insisted that they did not fix with each other.
