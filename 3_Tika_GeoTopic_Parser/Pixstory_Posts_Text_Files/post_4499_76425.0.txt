The Secret History by Donna Tartt has been all over internet once again lately and I’ve heard so many good things about this book that I finally gave in to my urges and picked it up off my dusty book nook. 

So far I’m 31 pages in but it feels like I’ve read at least a hundred that’s how deep and philosophical this book is. It says ‘fiction’ at the back cover of it but I’d call it, ‘modern classic’. 

The Secret History is a remarkable book which completely enthrals you! It’s profound, playful and elegant. 

Give this book a chance, it’ll take your breath away. And if you’d already read it then do tell me if you liked it or not? Because I am liking what I’ve read until now!
