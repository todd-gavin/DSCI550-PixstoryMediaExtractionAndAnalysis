Introspection may help us in our everyday life, with solutions for relationships and work and our community. But that's only the beginning. That's still working on the external level - meaning the physical world that we live in that includes people, places, situations, relationships, objects, environment, events and processes of change in nature, and so on. We are just playing in the world of external physical things.
Beyond the external, physical world, there's an entire universe within our inner-world that remains for us to explore. It is full of high potential for us as human beings evolving at this time in our history. 
Within this inner-world lies not only the answers to our current "problems" but also immense transcendental treasures that I cannot even begin to speak about because I have not fully explored them myself.Â  However, I've read that many mystics, saints, shamans and noble beings have. And they have left for us clues along the path.
