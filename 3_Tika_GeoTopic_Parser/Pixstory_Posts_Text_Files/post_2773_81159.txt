First the bad news A device that puts together all estimates into a number to show how close humankind is to the doomsday has been closest ever to the endpoint Now for the good news it has been steady there for the third year now Is that good news at all What s Doomsday Clock How to read it The latest announcement The Doomsday Clock is a project of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists founded in by Albert Einstein and University of Chicago scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project The clock launched in seeks to underline the urgency of preventing the doomsday by projecting it over a hour cycle We are less like to bother about something that may happen several decades later but on a scale of few seconds it sounds far more alarming It has become a well known indicator of the planet s vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons climate change and other threats The Bulletin s Science and Security Board sets the clock every year in consultation with its Board of Sponsors which includes Nobel laureates Over years there were times when we were even as much as minutes away from the apocalypse but in for the first time the gap went below two minutes to seconds For third year now there s no change in the scientists estimates of the time left in our hands to do something about saving the earth It could ve been worse yes but there s no improvement either Steady is not good news as a Bulletin scientist put it It seems in the words of an expert that we are stuck in a perilous moment that brings neither stability nor security The pandemic by the way is not on a major factor The Bulletin considers it more a wake up call than an existential threat The real danger is from climate change and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the global leadership s failure to find mechanisms to reduce it as seen in the lack of progress in the negotiations over the Iran nuclear deal
