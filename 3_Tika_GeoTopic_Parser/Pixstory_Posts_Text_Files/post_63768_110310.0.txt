Themes and scores are a very integral part of a movie, as the score plays a powerful role in shaping the movie’s overall character. 

The biggest most momentous scenes are not nearly as powerful if the background score accompanying the scene is weak, unaccommodating or otherwise unfit for the scene. 

For example, the most memorable scene in Empire Strikes Back is the “I am your father” scene. It wouldn’t nearly be as epic, if the music behind it were not good enough.

 And just like it is with movie directors, the music composers need to have a strong vision to create a compelling score.

 Those composers who are able to compose a score which not only makes the scene a powerful one, but also makes the audiences remember both the scene and the piece of music in the background are rare, and an example to behold for all composers. 

Creating a truly compelling score in all aspects almost falls under the ratio of a 3:10 probability. Some of the best Hollywood movie scores ever created include:
