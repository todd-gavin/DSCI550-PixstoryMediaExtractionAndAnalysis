Anderson

Anderson, a former Golden Boy winner, concluded his playing career at Adana Demirspor in Turkey's second division and retired at the age of 31. He presently works as an external relations officer for the club.

Tom Cleverley

Cleverley made his competitive debut in the 2011 Community Shield after impressing on the pre-season tour and was projected for a bright future.

The midfielder made 79 appearances for United in all competitions, but he was a much-maligned figure under David Moyes. He played a brief period at Everton before joining 
Watford for the last four seasons, helping the Hornets achieve promotion back to the Premier League in 2020-21.

Ryan Giggs

In 2014, Giggs ended his illustrious 23-year playing career and transitioned to coaching.

He appeared to be a lock to lead Wales to Euro 2020, but he was arrested for violence before the tournament even started.

Gabriel Obertan

Obertan failed to make an impression at Old Trafford, netting just one goal in 28 games before signing a permanent move with Newcastle United in 2011. The winger has played for Anzhi Makhachkala, Wigan Athletic, Levski Sofia, and BB Erzurumspor since leaving Tyneside in 2016.

Federico Macheda

Macheda made a name for himself in 2009 when he scored the game-winning goal against Aston Villa, but he never reached the same heights again. The 29-year-old, who spent several years in the English second division, now plays for Panathinaikos in Greece.
