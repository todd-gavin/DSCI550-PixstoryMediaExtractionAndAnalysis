Happy tears or what? Hindustan times writing on women who took the food industry by storm, and it feels good to be able to talk about something you are proud of; it's my bakery for me. 

Little back story of how it all started:

Before lockdown, I had no time and interest in stepping into the kitchen. But during the lockdown, Just like everyone else I also started experimenting with some dishes. I started learning everything right from the scratch. Along with the cooking fever, the oreo cake recipe went viral on Instagram. So I gave it a try and loved it to an extent that I used to experiment with the same recipe by making small changes literally every day. Without even realising it, my interest in baking developed. I use to binge-watch baking videos on youtube the entire day. That‚Äôs how I learnt how to bake. 

Becoming a baker was never on my card, it was just for fun which turned into a passion later. I remember my family forcing me to make a page on Instagram and how I kept avoiding it for the longest. And then suddenly one day I decided a brand name, made a logo and started a page called Bake Whip Love on Instagram with no hopes of receiving orders but ending up receiving a lot of them‚ù§Ô∏èüßø
