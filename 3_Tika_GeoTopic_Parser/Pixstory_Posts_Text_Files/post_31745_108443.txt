The Etruscans have a serious problem they do not have direct literary sources they do not have written sources that start from their point of view We reconstruct their history and their civilization through what the Greek and Latin historical sources tell us however we know that when a population observes another not always generous because it often captures different aspects that are stigmatized Example concerns the representation of the female figure the Etruscans had a very different way of relating between men and women compared to that of the Romans and Greeks Etruscan women could lie down on the same kline of male companions in the various ceremonies and within society there were yes gender polarities but they were not hierarchical but complementary the role of the woman and that of the man were seen as complementary This attitude today very much felt years ago by the Greeks and Romans was seen as a scandal as something absolutely not to do The Etruscan civilization that cannot speak for itself we must make ourselves speak through archeology through contexts images iconography monuments tombs
