Prem Sagar speaks on Experiences as a nurse in the workspace translated and edited I come from a small village in Andhra Pradesh When I identified that my body is not perfect as I desire I thought I am different from others My walking style talking style tomboy character made me different from society and relationships I shifted to Hyderabad to continue my studies there and started working in a private hospital I faced a lot of discrimination because of my gender expression Because of this discrimination I left my job and joined a private company as a cleaning supervisor Over there my profession was different my studies were different and the working sector is also different I had a tough time managing and faced a lot of discrimination Everyone would tell me that I m not supposed to be wearing men clothes So I left my job and spent almost three to four months at home
