Murmu Droupadi 
NEW DELHI: With the BJP nominating Droupadi Murmu, a 64-year-old Santhal from Odisha, as its candidate for the highest constitutional post, India may eventually elect its first tribal president. 

After the legislative board of the party endorsed what is widely seen as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pick for Rashtrapati Bhavan, BJP leader JP Nadda announced Murmu's candidacy. 
"The life of Smt. Droupadi Murmu Ji inspires millions of people, especially those who have struggled with poverty and adversity. Her knowledge of policy issues and compassion for others will be very beneficial to our nation, the PM tweeted.
