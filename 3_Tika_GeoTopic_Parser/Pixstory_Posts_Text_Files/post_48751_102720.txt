 All Lives Matter has come to become an immediate response of a lot of white and white appeasing people to Black Lives Matter Do all lives matter Oh absolutely Yes they do But are all lives being treated equally or if we quote again do all lives matter As in do they really matter To our system to our judiciary and even to our population Here s the stats Despite making up less than percent of the population Black people accounted for nearly percent of the over deadly police shootings by since according to the Washington Post police shootings database Police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people Although black drivers were statistically less likely to be carrying illegal things they were checked up to twice as often as white drivers Despite having similar rates of marijuana use black persons were times more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested for marijuana possession So coming back to the question Do all lives matter equally under the law Our system is so strongly against black people that they can t even voice their fears without being told off for it Yes all lives matter but to talk about that when black people are constantly facing the brunt of white supremacy and racism is like asking the fire department to turn their hose to a perfectly fine house while another house is on fire because All Houses Matter White people it s not about you You are not being threatened everyday of your life for your skin color So probably take a step back and do not be another hurdle in black people s fight for equality This attention craving needs to stop You need to join the fight and that would be the bare minimum
