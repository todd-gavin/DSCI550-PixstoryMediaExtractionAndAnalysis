Abstract Type diabetes most commonly presents in adulthood contrary to the widely held view that it is a disease of childhood Furthermore a substantial proportion of cases of adult onset type diabetes does not require insulin therapy at clinical onset Recent studies have emphasised the evidence that adult onset type diabetes is prevalent but often misclassified initially as type diabetes In this review we discuss that recent literature highlighting the similarities and differences between adult onset and childhood onset type diabetes exploring recent debates surrounding its epidemiology and genetics as well as expanding on important issues of diagnostic criteria for individuals presenting with adult onset diabetes and the subsequent management once identified as having an autoimmune basis In addition this review looks at the psychosocial challenges faced by T D patients and their possible management Sources
