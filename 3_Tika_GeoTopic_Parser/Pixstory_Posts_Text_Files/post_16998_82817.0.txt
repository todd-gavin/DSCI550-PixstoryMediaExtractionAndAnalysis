Lata and Raj became really good friends and later couldn’t help but fall in love with one another. He used to call her Mithoo with love.Lata Mangeshkar and Raj Singh were planning to tie the knot but that was not easy as he was from a royal family and Lata being a commoner and so Raj’s father was against it and was not ready to accept Lata in their family.Lata Mangeshkar respected Raj Singh’s decision and they continued to remain friends till his death. Also, Raj Singh had tremendous respect for his father and hence decided to go with the wish of his father but also never got married. He vowed to remain unmarried for life if he couldn’t marry his beau.
Though their love story didn’t have a perfect ending with a happily ever after story, it was love filled with dedication and admiration towards one another. A promise to be kept even in the grave!!
