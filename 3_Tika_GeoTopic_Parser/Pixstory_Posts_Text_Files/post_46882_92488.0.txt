‌Me too movement hit like a wave in America and inspired many people worldwide. Tarana Burke started the Me too movement. She used #metoo to help other women with similar experiences to stand up for themselves. The hashtag very quickly gained momentum providing a platform for many people to share their stories of abuse and stating that they are not alone and calling out for justice. 
‌
‌Born in a lower-middle-class family Burke was sexually assaulted and raped as a teenager. Her mother stood with her as strong support and helped her rise above the trauma. She became the voice of the marginalised through her activism and books. Through the Me too movement she raised awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society.
‌
‌Burke is currently Senior Director at Girls for Gender Equity. She continues her course of work through workshops to help enhance policies at schools, workplaces, and places of worship and focuses on eliminating victim-blaming for sexual violence. Tarana Burke is a benchmark of revolution; a voice of many!
