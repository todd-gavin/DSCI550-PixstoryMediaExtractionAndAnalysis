There was a time earlier this year when it seemed William Saliba would never really get the chance to showcase his talent in an Arsenal shirt. At the start of Mikel Arteta’s reign, he was shipped out on loan to Nice without him ever getting a chance to impress in the first team and there were rumours that the Frenchman was prepared to push for a return to Marseille after an impressive campaign with the French giants.
Murmurs of Marseille wanting to keep him was gaining moment at the end of last season when he won the Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year award. Reports kept pouring out of France that Marseille want to sign him on a permanent deal and Saliba was not prepared to stick around and wait to see whether he would be part of Arteta’s plans.
However, the Arsenal manager shut the door on all kinds of rumour-mongering when he stressed early in the summer that Saliba belongs to the Gunners and he would be in the first team plans in the 2022/23 season.
Eyebrows were raised when Arsenal splashed out a considerably big fee for a then-teenage centre-back in 2019. His struggles at the start of Arteta’s reign increased the din around his real qualities. However, Saliba’s performance this season has killed all the noise around him, his talent and his future at the Emirates.
The 21-year-old has looked class alongside Gabriel Magalhaes at the heart of Arsenal’s defence and his stunning strike from the edge of the box against Bournemouth showed that there is more to him than just a talented ball-playing centre-back.
In Saliba, Arsenal have nurtured a young centre-back who could be their mainstay for years to come. However, to keep hold of such a prodigiously talented player, the team would also need to grow and challenge for the top honours going forward.
