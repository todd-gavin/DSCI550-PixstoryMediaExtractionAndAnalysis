Eat tasty yet healthy ! Very often i have heard my loved ones or friends giving me this smart tip ! Is it so easy to find something on your platter that can satiate your taste buds yet is good for your health ? If you feel nothing like that exists , then think again ! 🤔

Paneer is one such wonderful option . Paneer is extensively used in Indian cuisine !  Be it a starter , gravy , or main course , you can include paneer in every step of your diet ! Paneer is to vegetarians what chicken is to non-vegetarians ! 😋😍

The best part is i can have paneer in both ways - Raw and cooked ! I usually have it raw with some masala on it in the morning time . And this has alot of benefits ! Let me tell you some benefits of raw paneer ; ✅

1 Reduces the risk of cancer .
2 Building better bones and teeth .
3 An essential component in weight loss programs .
4 Ideal food for diabetic patients .
5 Building a strong immune system .
6 Aids in the normal functioning of the digestive system .
7 Paneer prevents and protects you from diseases .

All you have to do is Cut Raw paneer into pieces and Sprinkle - salt , Black pepper and red chilli powder on it ! Eat it and enjoy ! Omg ! The softer the paneer , the more it melts in my mouth . And what experience i get is pure bliss ! 🤤😍

I just love it and i hope you will love it too ! Try it and thank me later . ✅✨
