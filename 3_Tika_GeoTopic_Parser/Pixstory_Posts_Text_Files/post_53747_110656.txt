Africa has great potential for drug discovery The continent has natural resources indigenous knowledge and human capacity And it has the need it bears more than of the global disease burden There are many internationally recognised African scientists undertaking cutting edge research But a lack of resources makes it difficult to conduct world class science A team of African biochemists cell biologists and bioinformaticians shares some thoughts on what it would take to establish an Africa wide drug discovery ecosystem The authors are the key members of the COVIDRUG AFRICA Consortium the consortium for rapid COVID drug development in Africa What are the challenges to drug discovery Access to infrastructure long term funding and supply chain constraints are among the challenges In South Africa spending on research and development R D as a percentage of GDP is low in down from in Most of this funding is from the government Business and other R D investment has also declined in recent years For many other countries in Africa expenditure on R D is non existent China the US Israel and Germany in contrast spend on average between and of GDP on R D These countries are among the world s top drug producers Drug discovery research in Africa receives modest but essential international funding through philanthropic foundations and selected pharmaceutical companies However substantial focused initiatives for long term funding are uncommon An exception is the H D Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa It did pioneering work in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture on a promising new antimalarial compound Funding calls are often restricted to diseases specifically associated with Africa The unintended consequence is that the breadth of research supported in some of the world s countries cannot be matched in Africa This can stifle innovation Another factor holding back African research is the lack of strong collaborative networks between African laboratories and institutions This is largely due to university policies and limited funding Read more
