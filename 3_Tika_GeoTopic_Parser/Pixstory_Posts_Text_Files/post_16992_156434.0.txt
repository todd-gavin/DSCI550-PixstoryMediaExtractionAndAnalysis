In my opinion Drishyam is one the greatest thiller Bollywood has to offer in recent times.It starts with a family, like any Indian household, so pretty relatable. The story, keeps you hooked till the end. Such brilliance. Commendable acting by the cast, be it Ajay Devgun, Tabu, or the kids even.The songs stick with you, its Gulzar Sahab and Vishal Bhardwaj magic after all. Goa is beautifully shown, the one which is less explored.Not every day a movie is made in varied languages, give it a watchGive your opinion in comments!!!
