Growing up, I was fond of pets, especially dogs, and I always wanted to keep one. Unfortunately, living in an apartment made that idea unfeasible. So, soft toys came to the rescue to give a similar experience of keeping a pet in the house. However, I was not a fan of soft toys until I stumbled across this cute thing. I kept his name as Scotty (don't know how I got this name, but I loved its sound). Scotty has been there with me through thick and thin. I have taken him everywhere, even if it was traveling to another country. It has been 12 years (and counting) since Scotty has been with me, and it's crazy how I got attached to him.
