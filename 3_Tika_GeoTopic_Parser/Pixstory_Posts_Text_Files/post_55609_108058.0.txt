It's a shame Topic's user interface is so difficult to use, because it houses one of the most diverse and eclectic collections of international television. Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby is a rave but underrated. 

For example, Hannah Gadsby's Oz is a three-part documentary in which the Australian comedian, perhaps best known in the United States for her role as Nanette, uses her knowledge in art history to expertly chronicle and interrogate the history of Australian fine art. 

Gadsby's Oz is a critical look at a large span of colonial history that American audiences are likely to know even less about than our own, but it still manages to be a very easy, if not downright enjoyable, watch.

As a bonus, once you’ve zipped through the series’s collective 81-minute run time, you can navigate on over to Hannah Gadsby’s Nakedy Nudes (another art documentary), F*!#ing Adelaide (a domestic sitcom), or Enterprice (not Australian, just very fun).
