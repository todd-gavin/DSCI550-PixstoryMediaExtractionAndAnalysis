Optimal nutrition and dietary nutrient intake impact the immune system; therefore, the only sustainable way to survive in the current context is to strengthen the immune system. Unfortunately, no evidence found that supplements can cure the immune system except for Vit C, which is one of the best ways to improve the immune system. However, a proper diet can ensure that the body is in an appropriate state to defeat the virus.

Researchers asked about 593,000 adults (primarily middle-aged and older) what they ate in February 2020 and followed their health through September. Scientists found that people who reported eating the most fruits, vegetables, and legumes had a 9% lower risk of getting COVID and a 41% lower risk of developing severe COVID during the study period than people who reported eating the minor fruits and vegetables. 

Researchers also found a link between COVID and a poor diet or socioeconomic disadvantages. "If you could remove just one of those factors — diet or disadvantage — we think nearly a third of the COVID-19 cases could have been prevented," notes Jordi Merino, the study's lead author and a research associate at the Diabetes Unit and Center for Genomic Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. 

The study was observational and didn't prove that a healthy diet prevents COVID. However, researchers point out that getting vaccinated and wearing a mask in indoor settings are still the fundamental approaches to warding the disease.
