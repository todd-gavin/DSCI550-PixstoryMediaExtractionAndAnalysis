Manchester United star Wayne Rooney believes it is time for Paul Pogba to find a new club as
the midfielder continues to disappoint at Old Trafford. The Red Devils' record signing returned to
Old Trafford in 2016 amid much fanfare, but has yet to live up to his high price tag with
inconsistent performances.

And, with the 29-year-contract set to expire in the summer, Rooney believes it's time for him to
go on.

“I think it’s got to the point now where it’s probably better if he moves on,” Rooney told Sky
Sports.

“If Paul is honest with himself, he's probably not had the impact he would have liked since he
returned.

“I watch him play for France and it’s a completely different player. His ability, his vision, control of
the game is there in every game for France.

“It hasn’t quite worked for him at Manchester United and I think there’s a few players they need
to let go.”

Man United are looking for a new head coach at the end of the season, with Ralf Rangnick
serving as an interim replacement.

 Rooney has backed Mauricio Pochettino, the former Spurs
and current PSG manager, over Ajax's Erik ten Hag, but has emphasised that whoever is hired
would need time to establish their authority and vision at the club.

“For managers now, they need time to put their blueprint on the club. If you give him time he’d
do well. He knows how to work with top class players and young playersyers, and I think you need
to get that blend right because they can’t afford to fail again.”
