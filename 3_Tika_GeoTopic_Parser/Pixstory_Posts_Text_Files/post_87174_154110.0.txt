Cristiano Ronaldo has finally broken his goal drought in Premier League 2022-23 as he scored a very vital goal against Everton in the ongoing Matchday 10 faceoff between Manchester United and Everton. This was his first goal of the ongoing league season. However, what makes it even more special is the fact that this was the Portuguese talisman’s 700th career goal in club football. 
The 37-year-old has had a decorated career right from his days at Sporting Lisbon and boy has he been blessed with goals. In his club career, Ronaldo scored 5 goals for Sporting Lisbon, 144 goals for Manchester United, 101 goals for Juventus and 450 goals for Real Madrid. As we can clearly see, the majority of his club goals came during his historic 9-year-long stay in Madrid. During this time, he also won 4 UEFA Champions League trophies with them. 
However, Cristiano’s performance in the ongoing season had been awful. Firstly, he did not get many chances in the playing XI and more importantly he was having a tough time in front of the goal. It is thus pretty understandable that he took so long to score his first league goal of the season. Fortunately enough, it co-aligned with this historic record. 
Another fact that made this goal even more special was the fact that with it, Cristiano gave Manchester United the much-needed lead against Everton just before halt time. He came in at the 29’ mark to replace Anthony Martial and scored within about 15 minutes. 
He needed this breakthrough goal and the fans would hope that this gives him a much needed boost in confidence.
