Marvel Studios just launched the trailer of their next web series called, “She-Hulk: Attorney at Law” and this series will be released on 17th August 2022, you can watch it on Disney+ Hotstar.

Talking about the trailer, one thing I want to say is the trailer is looking kickass. She-Hulk: Attorney at Law is the story of Jennifer Walters who is a lawyer by profession and Hulk (Bruce Banner) is her family member.

Going by trailer, the boss tells Jennifer Walters to be the face of the new project which is, the Superhuman Law division but the trailer didn’t reveal much about how and why Hulk is trying to make her another superhero.

Overall, the trailer looks so good to me because the story, emotions, comedy, and background music is all equally good and as a Marvel fan I can’t wait to watch this series.
