Lentils or dals are one of the healthiest choices for a vegetarian person as they are loaded with nutrients like protein, minerals and fibre. But, have you ever realized that there are a few dals which when eaten cause a lot of gas in the stomach and are not easily digested? Sometimes the repercussion of consuming these dals can create acid in the stomach, which can cause extreme discomfort. Thus, experts agree that most of these dals should only be consumed for lunch rather than dinner. Today, we’ll talk about such 4 dals and how to overcome gastric issues caused due to them using some simple tips.1 Matra DalMost of the street food vendors make these white peas or matra as a side dish served with pan-fried Kulcha. Well, matra is one of the most healthiest varieties of dals and is loaded with protein and fibre, and takes a longer time duration when it comes to digestion. To ease the gastric issues caused by this variety of beans, it is suggested to soak them for 8-12 hours and cook them with asafoetida (hing) and baking soda, which helps in the digestion process. And one should limit the number of white peas when eating, as they are super-delicious.2 Urad DalBe it whole or split, urad dal or black gram is said to be one of the heaviest dals one can ever have. It causes a lot of gas when consumed and takes a long time to digest. Thus, it is said that those who have a weak digestion system should not consume it. Also, as this is a gaseous lentil, it is advised that those who have issues related to leg or foot pain, must definitely avoid consuming it as this pain happens due to ‘Vai badi’ or indigestion. This dal should also be soaked for at least 8-10 hours prior to cooking and make sure that it is not consumed too often.
