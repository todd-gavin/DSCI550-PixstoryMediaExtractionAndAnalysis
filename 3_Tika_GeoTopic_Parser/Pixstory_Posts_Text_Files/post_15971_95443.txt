Xiaoxuan Zoua Wei Huang Abstract Background Ambient particles have been associated with gestational diabetes mellitus GDM however no study has evaluated the effects of traffic related ambient particles on the risks of GDM subgroups classified by oral glucose tolerance test OGTT values Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted among pregnant women who underwent regular prenatal care and received OGTT at Haidian Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Beijing China A total of pregnant women were diagnosed with GDM including with isolated fasting hyperglycaemia GDM IFH At a fixed location monitoring station routinely monitored ambient particles included fine particulate matter PM black carbon BC and particles in size ranges of nm PNC Contributions of PNC sources were apportioned by positive matrix factorization model Logistic regression model was applied to estimate odds ratio OR of ambient particles on GDM risk Results Among the pregnancy women recruited in this study were diagnosed with GDM including with isolated fasting hyperglycaemia GDM IFH and with isolated post load hyperglycaemia GDM IPH We observed increased GDM IFH risk with per interquartile range increase in first trimester exposures to PM OR Confidence Intervals BC OR and PNC OR PNC originated from diesel and gasoline vehicle emissions were found in associations with increases in GDM IFH risk but not in GDM IPH risk Conclusion Our findings suggest that exposure to traffic related ambient particles may increase GDM risk by exerting adverse effects on fasting glucose levels during pregnancy and support continuing efforts to reduce traffic emissions for protecting vulnerable population who are at greater risk of glucose metabolism disorder Sources
