Roma are willing to listen to offers for midfielder Jordan Veretout who is linked to Premier League clubs Newcastle United and Tottenham The Italian club are willing to let Veretout go for as little as million While the midfielder has a contract up until at the club Mourinho is ready to let the midfielder go The ex Villa player featured for Roma times this season scoring goals and assisting goals The midfielder enjoys a respectable career at Roma having joined from Italian side Fiorentina on loan in and then permanently in He has been involved with goals for the club in appearances and has been capped for France times Veretout would be a valuable addition to both teams At Spurs he would be unlikely to start but would provide quality cover as the squad would be competing across multiple fronts However Veretout would be sure to start at Newcastle and the prospect of joining a club with serious financial firepower could be an exciting prospect as well Newcastle were able to change their fortunes with midfield signing Bruno Guimares and would be hoping history repeats itself with the signing of Veretout Would Veretout consider Tottenham or Newcastle to be the more appealing destination Only time will tell
