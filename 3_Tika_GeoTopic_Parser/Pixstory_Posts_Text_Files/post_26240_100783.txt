Yesterday evening the most awaited event in the world of fashion in the past few months was held, the Gucci fashion show was held in the medieval castle in Puglia The thirteenth-century estate with an octagonal shape opened its doors to tell the myths and legends it holds for centuries through the magical world of fashion A parade of stars have arrived from all over the globe to join the constellations that reigned in the sky and on the garments designed by Alessandro Michele The castle has magical measurements as are the measurements of the shirt collars and the measurements of the jackets it seemed to me that here also the arrangement of the stones of the building tells the genesis of my work but above all tells how important it is to do my job to put together constellations of things says Alessandro Michele collector and esthete who roamed the halls of the Castle respectful and comforted by beauty The idea of Cosmogony born at the same time as the choice of place Before thinking about the collection, a small Gucci bag that belonged to Greta Garbo arrived at the office with Persian-inspired jacquard designs A signal meant something And it occurred to me that in daily conversations I am told that when I talk I build constellations In an instant the idea of the collection arrived and at the same time the choice of Frederick&#39;s castle continues Michele talking about the most esoteric and fascinating event of the season
