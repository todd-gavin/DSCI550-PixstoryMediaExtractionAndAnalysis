The Los Angeles Lakers announced that they have officially signed guard Mac McClung to a two way contract The roster spot was opened up when the Lakers signed Wenyen Gabriel to a standard NBA contract after waiving Trevor Ariza The move allows the Lakers to get a look at McClung in their final game of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets The terms of the deal were not released so it s unclear if the contract is just for the rest of this season or next year as well McClung originally signed with the Lakers after going undrafted out of Texas Tech last summer He played on their Summer League team and then signed a training camp contract before eventually being waived and joining the G League South Bay Lakers The year old had a very successful first professional season recently being named the Kia NBA G League Rookie of the Year McClung appeared in regular season NBA G League games for South Bay and the Windy City Bulls averaging points rebounds assists and steals in minutes He shot percent from the field and percent from point range When teams were dealing with coronavirus COVID and were allowed to sign extra players via the hardship exception McClung signed with the Chicago Bulls although only played three minutes in one game with the team With the Lakers likey needing players on minimum contracts again next season it makes sense to give McClung a shot once again and hope his development continues as it did this season
