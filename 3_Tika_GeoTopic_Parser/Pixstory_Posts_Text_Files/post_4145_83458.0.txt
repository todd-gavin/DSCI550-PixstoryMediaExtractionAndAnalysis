On Thursday Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine followed by explosions being heard across the country.

"I have decided on a military operation," Putin said in a surprise television announcement that accelerated immediate rebuke from US President Joe Biden and sent global financial markets into turmoil.

Weeks of discussions has no influence on Putin, who had flocked between 150,000 and 200,000 troops along theÂ borders of Ukraine.

According to AFP correspondents, shortly after the statement, explosions were heard in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and several other cities.

Air raid sirens have been documented in the centre of Kyiv.

Putin called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and rationalized the operation by claiming the government was overseeing a "genocide" in the east of the country.

"President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance, too many people have already died," Antonio Guterres UN - Secretary-General said.

Before Putin's announcement, Ukraine had urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave.
