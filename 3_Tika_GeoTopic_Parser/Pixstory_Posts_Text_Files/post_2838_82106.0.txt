Fouzia Azeem, aka ‘Qandeel Baloch’, was the first social media star in Pakistan – and an unlikely champion of women’s rights. As she lived her life on her terms, scandalizing the conservative society, her own brother, Waseem Azeem, chose to kill her in 2016 for sake of family ‘honor’. 

The killing ignited a debate in Pakistan and elsewhere about the heinous practice of ‘honor killing’. Lawmakers too, it seemed, felt those who strangle their own daughters or sisters (who might have, say, married against their wishes) to protect what they consider as family honor should be punished. The parliament passed an anti-honor killing law with harsher punishments, closing loopholes for some familial pardons. Waseem was tried and sentenced to life in prison in 2019.

Any hopes that might have arisen after his punishment were dashed this week when a court ordered his release following pardon from his parents – in accordance with Islamic law: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60388111 The court also cited lack of evidence though the man has confessed to giving her a sedative and then strangling her. He had even said, “I was determined to kill myself or her… I have no regrets.” Their mother has expressed happiness at the acquittal of her son, even as she remains sad for her daughter’s death.

The family found unacceptable her public (which began with this audition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO-alf0lBgY&t=274s ) For her thousands of fans on various social-media platforms, she often posted the kind of pictures of her that would be embarrassing in a society where veil is the norm for women. Once she even announced she’d pose naked in case Pakistan’s cricket team won a major tournament. From conservatives, she received vitriolic reactions and even threats to life. As she saw it, she was “an inspiration to those ladies who are treated badly by society”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/15/pakistan-qandeel-baloch-brother-honor-killing-acquittal/ 

The twist has left activists shocked. About 1,000 women are killed in Pakistan every year – by their own fathers and brothers: http://hbv-awareness.com/statistics-data/#Pakistan This practice is not like to end if the authorities show no inclination to ensure justice.
