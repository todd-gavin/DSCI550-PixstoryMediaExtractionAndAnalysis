The relationship that developed between Davidman and Lewis has been featured in a television BBC film, a stage play, and a theatrical film named Shadowlands. Lewis published A Grief Observed under a pseudonym in 1961, from notebooks he kept after his wife's demise indicating his immense grief and a period of doubting God.

Davidman was a child prodigy, who scored above 150 on IQ testing, with outstanding critical, analytical, and musical skills. She read H. G. Wells's The Outline of History at the age of eight and was able to play a score of Chopin on the piano after having read it once and not looking at it again. At an early age, she read George MacDonald's children's books and his adult fantasy book, Phantastes. She wrote about the influence of these stories: "They developed in me a lifelong taste for fantasy, which led me years later to C. S. Lewis, who in turn led me to religion."
