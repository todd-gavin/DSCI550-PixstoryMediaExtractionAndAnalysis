We have our very own restaurant run by students on campus Christ is home to many different students studying different courses Our university is also pretty famous for the industry level training of the hotel management division As part of it s practical coursework the students have to manage their own restaurant and cafe It s called the Experiential Learning Menu and happens every week The menu differs between Indian and International cuisines and the experience is elite It s a star experience at just a fraction of that price The food is commendable and I m not saying that just because I belong to the university You can see the dedication and effort the students of hotel management put in to run the restaurant as smoothly as possible As students we are always on a budget It feels good to indulge in occasional luxuries but splurging on some types of cuisines can still be out of our budgets The ELR makes it really affordable for us to enjoy the international and regional dishes we love so much without burning a hole in the pocket The quality is amazing the food tastes divine and the service is great It makes the PG Hostel food bearable Last time my friends and I went for the UP cuisine that was the first time I was having so many of those dishes but needless to say I ll be trying to recreate them at home Next week we are going for Indonesian It s just that difficult to resist it
