Keyboard warriors (trolls) have become a problem since COVID quarantines have made people agitated.  Although quarantines are not the real the issue anymore, trolling still persists.

Martial trolls love to troll martial artists with insults, disrespect, and issuing fight challenges. They love the idea that distance protects them from the person they challenged.  They also rely on expenses protecting them.

In honored tradition, the person issuing a fight challenge goes to the person they challenged. Yet these trolls always tell the person they challenged to come to them knowing that travel expenses protect them.

I cannot use my money to settle a beef some keyboard warrior has since my money is needed to care for my family.  However, if others were to help with expenses, I would happily travel to these keyboard trolls for a friendly spar to put them in their place.

Vids of the friendly spar will be made available on my Patreon account.

I will keep this a revolving account so that I can travel to friendly spar other keyboard warriors.  The first person in the list is a keyboard warrior from Toronto, Canada.  Expenses needing covered include airfare, room and board and missed time aways from work.

Depending on timeframe airfair may have to be round trip between Canada and Philippines.
