Novak Djokovic condemns Wimbledon&#39;s decision to exclude Russian and Belarusian players from the prestigious English tournament which will start next June. He defined it as a crazy decision and because of this, the world number one in the men&#39;s tournament will currently be missed by the Russian Daniil Medvedev and the Belarusian number number in the women&#39;s field Aryna Sabalenka I can&#39;t support the Wimbledon decision I think Djokovic&#39;s comment is crazy when politics interferes with sport the result is never good Words to which he added his opposition to war Always condemn war i will never support war being a child of war myself i know the emotional trauma that leaves a war we all know what happened in serbia in in recent history in the balkans we had many wars
