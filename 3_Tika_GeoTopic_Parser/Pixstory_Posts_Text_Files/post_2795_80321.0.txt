The latest Oscar nominations have reignited the debate over the diversity. The awards, the Academy behind it and Hollywood – all remain white-male-dominated. It could do well to have a more balanced representation not only of race and gender but also of other identities. After the #OscarsSoWhite campaign of 2015, there have been efforts to make Oscars more diverse. The latest nominations are not so diverse, leaving observers both skeptical and hopeful.

The nominations:

Take the acting categories. There are four Black actors: Will Smith and Denzel Washington for best actor, and Ariana DeBose and Aunjanue Ellis for best supporting actress. All nominees for the other two categories – best actress and best supporting actor – are white. In 2021, there were nine people of color among these twenty nominations: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/02/08/oscar-nominations-diversity-efforts-2022-oscars/6662632001/

But there are signs of hope too. There are two queer women among these top 20 – DeBose and Kristen Stewart. There is a documentary, ‘Flee’, about a queer refugee, which has earned three nominations. Deaf communities should be glad that ‘Coda’ gets best-picture nomination and Troy Kotsur gets best-supporting-actor nomination: https://variety.com/2022/awards/awards/oscars-diversity-denzel-washington-behind-camera-1235174558/ 

2021 was the first time there was more than one woman among the best-director nominations. This year, there’s only one, Jane Campion. But she has received multiple nominations between her 1994 debut, ‘The Piano’, and the latest, ‘The Power of the Dog.’

The much-discussed Murakami short-story adaptation, ‘Drive My Car’, and Spielberg’s vision of ‘The West Side Story’ (as also ‘Encanto’) nod to the Japanese and Latino communities, respectively: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/2022-oscars-diversity-deaf-japanese-latina-analysis-1235088896/

In short, quantitatively speaking, 2022 is not 2021, yes, and there is no forward movement. But the scene is not regressive either. We will have to wait for a few years to see if a movement is building up, and not indulge in numerical analysis of each year’s list. 

Among the Academy members, only 25% were women in 2015 (now 33%), and those of non-white racial/ethnic communities have nearly doubled from 10% to 19%. Among new members of 2021, 46% are women and 39% from non-White communities.
