A new multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of Parkinson&#39;s disease with SI ROBOTICS, the robot that accompanies people suffering from neurodegenerative disease in Irish dance, improving their physical and cognitive condition. In addition to a robotic device, the system makes use of an artificial intelligence platform and sensors for detecting vital and cognitive parameters conceived and developed by Exprivia, an international group of Information and Communication Technology in collaboration with public-private partners including the IRCCS INRCA of Ancona where the experimentation takes place. The project funded by MIUR aims to offer a innovative rehabilitation path based on Irish dance with which the patient learns and modifies complex movements to the rhythm of music generating a positive impact on motor symptoms through an engaging and fun activity Irish dance is in fact particularly effective in improving mind-body coordination and can be practiced at all ages contributing to the correct posture of the body and the maintenance of physical fitness Through sensors, the robot is able to collect physical and emotional data of those interacting in dance in real time, offering specialists the possibility to customize and adapt the exercise to the needs of the patient and monitor the progress of psychophysical re-education. The first tests on volunteer patients were successfully conducted at the INRCA IRCCS in Ancona. Our patients enjoyed themselves during the exercises and the system allowed us to work on improving movements by collecting data for a more accurate and functional evaluation with enormous emotional benefits comments Dr. Giovanni Riccardi director of UOC Rehabilitation Medicine IRCCS INRCA who conducted the tests The robot works by teaching coordination movements of the upper and lower limbs on cross patterns on movements in all directions in a rhythmic manner reducing the risk of falling and also improving the cognitive aspect The SI ROBOTICS study protocol was recently published in the international journal Frontiers in Public Health with the title Dancing With Parkinson s Disease The SI ROBOTICS Study Protocol
