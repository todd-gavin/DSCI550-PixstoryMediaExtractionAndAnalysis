Sadio Mane invited Liverpool reporters to his house to give one final interview as a Liverpool player before the club announced his departure for Bundesliga giants, Bayern Munich. 

The Senegal International had an outstanding career playing for Southampton and then with Liverpool, signing for the Reds six years ago. 

Now, after playing 263 league games and scoring 111 PL goals, Sadio leaves Liverpool as a legend marking his legacy with a league and Champions League title and setting a record of scoring the fastest PL hat-trick in history. 

Let us have a look at what the Liverpool legend had to say following his departure from the club:

The player was asked how is he feeling not being a Liverpool player? 

Mane replied: "Yeah, for sure, for sure. Obviously it is strange – really, really strange – to no longer be a Liverpool player after six years spent at Anfield. But of course I had a great time, an unbelievable time, and since my first day I really, really enjoyed training, playing, at Anfield especially and in front of these amazing supporters. Now it’s come to the end."
