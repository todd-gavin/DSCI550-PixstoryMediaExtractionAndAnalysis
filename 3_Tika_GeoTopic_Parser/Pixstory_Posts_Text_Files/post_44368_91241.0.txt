After a World Cup qualifying match, an overzealous fan intruded on the Paris Saint-Germain star's personal space.

On Wednesday night, an Ecuador fan invaded the pitch and grabbed Lionel Messi's neck in an attempt to film a selfie video with the Argentina superstar.

Ecuador and Argentina had already secured their places in the 2022 World Cup before their CONMEBOL qualifying match, but they still put on an entertaining show in front of a sold-out Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha.

Enner Valencia's stoppage-time goal cancelled out Julian Alvarez's opener, resulting in a 1-1 tie for the hosts, while PSG superstar Lionel Messi was unable to add to his tally of 81 international goals.

Messi was also involved in an awkward moment after the final whistle, when an Ecuador supporter gained access to the pitch and grabbed the 34-year-old while filming a video on his phone.

Lionel Messi may be struggling at Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) this season, but he remains one of the best players in history. It should come as no surprise that La Albiceleste's chances at the 2022 FIFA World Cup will be heavily dependent on how the 34-year-old performs on the biggest stage of all.

Argentina's captain is the team's most experienced player, and he will be competing in his fifth FIFA World Cup, having made his debut in the competition in 2006.

Despite his struggles at club level, Lionel Messi will undoubtedly give his all to lead his national team to more glory, after leading them to victory in the Copa America in 2021.
