World No. 1 Novak Djokovic who has not lost his last 25 games on the grass court is trailing 0-2 in the Gentleman Quarterfinals of the 2022 Wimbledon Championship against the young Italian lad Sinner.

Sinner outplayed Djoker in the second set with his powerful and clever shots. He is doing something, not even 8-time champion Federer was able to do against Djokovic in Wimbledon: lead by two sets to love.

Only players to ever do it: Garcia-Lopez, Grosjean (2005), Safin (2008), Haas (2009), Berdych (2010), Murray (2013), Anderson (2015), Querrey (2016).

Sinner is playing masterclass today, now Djokovic can win this match only two ways:
- A legendary performance and comeback.
- Or Sinner just losing out. 

However, it's a long way to go, though.

Can Sinner win the decider set and make Novak pack his way out of his favourite grand slam or say Are we finally about to witness the birth of the Next Gen of champions? 

That's a million-dollar question right now.

Let's see how it unfolds. I will keep you guys updated.

It's a super thriller!!

Update: Djokovic took the third set 6-3 to narrow the lead, still one more chance left for Sinner to claim the upset.
