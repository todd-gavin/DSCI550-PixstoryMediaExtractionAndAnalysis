“Döden” (Death) by Janis Rozentāls was the first painting I saw that interpreted death differently, completely in a new way. 
In the painting we see Death wearing all white, her face soft and feminine. She holds the scythe low and bends over the small child. 
She stoops low as if aware of the pain and apologizing for the sadness she was about to cause but also holding a certain respect and reverence for the position she holds and souls she reaps. 
Rarely ever, Death is shown as the saviour, rather than condemner. Liberating souls from pain. This painting is so peaceful to look at.
