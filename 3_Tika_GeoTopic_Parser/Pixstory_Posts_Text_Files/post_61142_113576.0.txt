Isn’t it amazing that you can wear 1 shirt in 12different styles. 
 A shirt is staple in any wardrobe because it can be worn pretty much all year long. I love it in the summer tied around my waist with a dress in case it is too cold inside! But it also looks great under a sweater or cardigan in the winter!!
Do try these styles 😁
