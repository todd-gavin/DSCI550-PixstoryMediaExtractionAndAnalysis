Short Crust Pastry
“We must have pie. Stress cannot exist in the presence of a pie”, said truly by David Mamet ( Pulitzer winner for his plays) .
Short - crust, short means easily breakable and crust refers to pastry. 
It is one of the easiest recipes there is basically 3 ingredients if your product is a sweet one then sugar otherwise just the other 2 are butter and flour. 
There are 3 types of Shortcrust 
Pate  Brisée ( Salted ) - Brisée means broken since this mixture dough is not like a bread sticky dough due to the fat presence. Define goes as a rich pastry dough used especially to make flaky tart shells for quiches and pies. 
Pate Sucrée  (Sweet ) - The addition of sugar in this dough makes the dishes sweet for pies and tarts. Pâte sucrée makes a wonderful base for almost any tart, especially custards or cream fillings topped with fruit. For a creamy, easy-to-make filling, see our Cream Cheese Tart recipe and make a full batch of the filling for a 9" round tart. 
Pate Sablée -  This one is an amalgamation of the both above made for various similar tarts and pastries. The addition of salt gives a special spark in the whole dish which is quite spectacular.
Most pies have a layer of mystery to them: a top crust that builds anticipation while concealing the delights to come. For quiches there’s base which is baked properly first then a custard with cream and cheese based with additional ingredients depending upon your requirements and how much you actually want to experiment.
