I don&#39;t fully understand why if a woman marries she should lose her surname Words and music by Lewis Hamilton who during a speech at Expo Dubai a few days before the start of the World Cup from neighboring Bahrain announced his intention to officially add to his surname also that of his mother It would mean a lot for my family explained the seven times world champion but also for me I want to let people know how proud I am of my mother&#39;s name Larbalestier and nobody knows it that&#39;s why I want to add it to my surname As soon as the documents will be officially ready the Mercedes driver will therefore become Lewis Larbalestier Hamilton with his mother&#39;s surname which will be inserted as middle name Photo Instagram lewishamilton
