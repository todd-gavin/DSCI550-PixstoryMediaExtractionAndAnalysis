By Arjun Sidharth Had India s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru written a letter to then Prime Minister of Britain Clement Attlee in referring to Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal Had Nehru alluded to Bose supposedly entering Russian territory A facsimile of a letter purportedly written by Nehru addressed to Attlee has been circulating on social media platforms for the last couple of years Link It was also shared in Link The copy of the letter allegedly written by Nehru castigates the Russians for allowing Bose to enter their country calling it a clear treachery and betrayal of faith by the Russians The letter further exhorts Attlee to take note of it and do what you consider proper and fit It may be noted that there are several versions of this letter doing the rounds Alt News found that BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy had made a claim in December about a letter supposedly dictated by Nehru Prima facie the above image that is shared repeatedly on social media appears to be fake It is replete with errors Clement Attlee has been referred to as Clement Attle and the first line of the letter states I understand from reliable source instead of I understand from a reliable source The letter is dated December It surprisingly refers to Russia as an ally of the British Americans when the opposite was true for when the world was divided into opposing ideological blocs There are two things worth noting here Subhas Chandra Bose has been referred to as a war criminal The date of the letter is December whereas the official account states that Bose died on August Did Nehru ever write such a letter How true is the claim that India s first Prime Minister had called Bose a war criminal Or that he was cognizant of Bose supposedly being alive and escaping to Russia referring to the same in his communication with Clement Attlee Read the full story here
