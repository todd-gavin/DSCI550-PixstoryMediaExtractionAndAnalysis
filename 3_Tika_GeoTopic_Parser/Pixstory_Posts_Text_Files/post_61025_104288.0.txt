Should I have ice cream or cheesy fries? It's always a question that boggles me where I don't know what my taste buds needs. I always considered myself a sweet tooth (brownies and cookies being my favorite treat), but since I started baking these goods, my interest in sweets has reduced compared to the craving for salty and savory snacks. I believe one of the reasons might be how I can easily get sweets and desserts than having to depend on others and outside outlets to have salty snacks. Nevertheless, the battle between sweet and savory will never come to an end, it will continue to go on, and sometimes we might get a mix of both flavors.
