 I have come to believe over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken made verbal and shared even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood Without community there is no liberation The difference between poetry and rhetoric is being ready to kill yourself instead of your children Unacknowledged class differences rob women of each others energy and creative insight I learned so much from listening to people And all I knew was the only thing I had was honesty and openness
