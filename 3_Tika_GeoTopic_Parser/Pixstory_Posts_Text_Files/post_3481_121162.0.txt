In a span of just seven days, a whopping Rs 1,50,173 crore worth of bids were received for the telecom spectrum in the latest 5G auction which came to an end on Monday.

With a bid of Rs 88,078 crores, Jio has secured nearly half of all the airwaves, with 24,740 MHz of airwaves across five bands which offer about 10 times faster speed than 4G. It has also acquired the coveted 700 MHz spectrum that can provide 6-10 km of signal range with one tower and forms a good base for offering 5G services in all 22 circles or zones in the country.

Meanwhile, Airtel had placed a successful bid of Rs 43,084 crore and bought 19,867.8 MHz of spectrum across five bands, but none in the 700 MHz spectrum. Vodafone Idea has also acquired 6,228 MHz of airwaves with their Rs 18,799 crore bid.

Airtel has acquired a total of 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radio waves, worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore, which was put on the block. The auction was held for spectrum in various low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz), mid (3300 MHz) and high (26 GHz) frequency bands.

Apart from the three telecom giants, Adani group has bought spectrum in the 26 GHz band, which is suitable for setting up a private network for end-to-end communication, in six states including Gujarat, Mumbai, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.

According to Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, “Of the total 72,098 MHz of spectrum offered across 10 bands, 51,236 MHz or 71 per cent was sold.”

As per Vaishnaw, the allocation will be made by August 10 and 5G services are expected to be rolled out from October.

“In fact, the spectrum purchased is good enough to cover all circles in the country and in the coming two three years, we will have good 5G coverage,” he stated.
