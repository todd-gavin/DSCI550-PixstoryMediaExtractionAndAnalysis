Murlitharan’s No-Ball Story

First incident took place in the year 1995, Murlitharan was the new bowler, and the umpire was Darrell Hair. The bowler had to face an accusation of chucking and we witnessed an unexpected scene where every delivery of Murli was considered as no-ball. ICC intervened and Murli had to undergo an intense investigation which resulted in declaration that it was completely legal bowling action. Three years later, the exact same incident took place again. The Sri Lankan bowler continued to face trouble against the Australian umpires, McQuillan and Ross Emerson as they called Muralitharan for throwing. Happening for the second time, the incident ended up becoming one of the greatest controversies. Sources suggest Emerson was given advice to go against the ICC’s decision and declare the bowler as a chucker yet again. But this time, the Srilankan captain, Arjuna Ranatunga had enough. He accused the umpires of unfair treatment. Ranatunga had an aggressive chat with Emerson. Beyond expectations, he along with his team, walked out of the field protesting the umpires. Looking at this, there was a lot of discussion that took place and finally Murli bowled again with his own set of skills without modifying any of his actions. Emerson did not have any other choice except to just watch Murli play. Though Ranatunga was given a suspended sentence of six matches with 75% of his match fees, he proved himself as the captain every team desires, the one who will always stand by his players and fight for what is right. Murlitharan now holds the record for the most wickets in cricket.
