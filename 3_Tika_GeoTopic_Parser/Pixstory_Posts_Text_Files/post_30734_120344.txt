Novak Djokovic does not yet know if he will be able to enter the United States as he does not have the vaccination against Covid but continues to hope that he will be able to participate in the US Open scheduled for the end of August. The Serbian tennis player wrote on social networks I am preparing as if I could compete while I wait to know if there is room for me to travel to the United States Fingers crossed Djokovic then thanked his fans who are supporting him in various ways by mobilizing for the US government to grant an exception to the former number already excluded this year for the same reason from the Australian Open I just wanted to take a moment and tell you all how grateful I am to see so many messages of support and love from all over the world these days I wasn&#39;t expecting this which is why it sounds so amazing I just wanted to say thank you
