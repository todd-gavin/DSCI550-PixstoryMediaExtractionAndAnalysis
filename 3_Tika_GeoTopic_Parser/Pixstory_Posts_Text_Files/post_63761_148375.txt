Polish extreme metal band Behemoth have been at the forefront of the black metal scene for over years making them both veterans and as their name goes behemoths in the scene Behemoth has come a long way from their early raw black metal years from the early s gaining quite a bit of notoriety for its unique mix of black metal and death metal making them a pioneering force in the genre Behemoth s latest album Opvs Contra Natvram is the band s th studio album Though enjoyable this album does not have much to offer and for those who are new to Behemoth this is going to prove incredibly forgettable in nature Dark intense and definitely strong with the black metal side going with some raw feral ferocity and theatrically bombastic there is a nice balance between atmosphere and straightforward songwriting nbsp displaying a level of restraint which is always good making it even a bit accessible Despite that there really is not much going on here as the album goes on to play it very safe The album opens up with the dark industrial ambient Post God Nirvana which opens as a decent opener The next track Malaria Vvlgata is where things start to get good with The Deathless Sun going on a rather operatic route Disinheritance is one of the best songs here being one of the most complex and nuanced songs rhythmically and compositionally while Off To War is both punky and yet somehow heavy and atmospheric The epic closer Versvs Christvs skews heavily towards the atmospheric side of things while at the same time being heavy and intense Overall a good record it is also frustrating as Behemoth is very capable of doing much more The sound is many ways derivative of the previous two albums having a raw and dark sonic signature full of violent feral intensity and a bit of romance which is at the same time unexciting and not very original proving somewhat a disappointment Score
