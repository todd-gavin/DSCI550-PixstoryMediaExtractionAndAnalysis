In a noble initiative, Jaipur's Pinjara Pol Goshala has built 6-storey building to house birds in Jaipur. The building is built at a height of 60-70 feet and has separate flats. The speciality of this building is that it can accommodate around 2000 birds and the arrangements have also been made near the building to provide food and water to the birds.
Nearly 2000 birds can stay in the apartments!!
Pinjra Pol Gaushala which built this building says, 
"It can shelter about 2000 birds at a time. Today people live in huge buildings but they forget about birds, which is why we came up with this. 
All the arrangements of food and drink are made for all the birds. Special care has been taken for the facilities of the birds in the 6 storey apartment. Environmentalists says that cutting down of trees has been increasing day by day because of which many species are losing their home, food, water etc. Keeping this in mind, this unique apartment has been designed just and only for birds.‚Äù
