Shaun King, a notorious Black Lives Matter activist, was recently scrutinized for spending $40,000 of his PAC's funds on a show dog. After inquiry, he rationalized the acquisition of the dog for home protection by stating that he and his family often experienced threats. The dog was returned to the breeder shortly afterwards due to its purportedly high level of activity.

Such situations are amusing. Not because of the foolishness, but because of the ignorance of those who continue to contribute enormous sums of money to groups like Shaun King's and black lives matter, who have mismanaged funds to such an extent that it would be a deception to argue that they serve the public good.

As you may already be aware, this is not the first time these far-left organizations have misappropriated funds, nor will it be the last. These are the same individuals who decried capitalism and demanded that the United States become a socialist nation; however, they only think this until they acquire a huge amount of oneym and discover that profiting from their labor isn't so awful.

It is unfortunate that people's money is being squandered. Though, even if the money was utilized for the reason for which it was donated, it was never for a worthy cause, so I can't say it's too disappointing.
