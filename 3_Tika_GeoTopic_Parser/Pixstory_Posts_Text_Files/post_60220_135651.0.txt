Partha Chatterjee, an arrested former West Bengal minister, requested release on Wednesday, but the PMLA special court denied his request, keeping him in detention for another 14 days.
The PMLA court also added an additional 14 days to Arpita Mukherjee's 14-day judicial remand.
Judge Jibon Kumar Sadhu granted the request of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is looking into the accused money trail in the School Service Commission appointments scandal, and extended the duo's judicial remand till September 14.
The court, which had previously denied Partha Chatterjee's requests for bail, noted that nothing has changed and that the inquiry into the case is still in its early stages.
The two suspects are being held in state prisons, and Judge Sadhu gave the ED permission to question them there further and record their comments.
Before the court, Arpita Mukherjee did not ask for bail.
The two accused were produced on Wednesday in a virtual setting, and the court ordered that this be continued on September 14. They were detained on July 23 as part of the ED's investigation into the financial backing of unauthorised hiring of teaching and non-teaching employees at West Bengal government-sponsored and -aided institutions.
They had been in Ed's care up until August 5 when they were taken into judicial custody at the request of the court.
The ED claims to have obtained paperwork showing houses and a firm in joint hands, as well as cash, jewellery, and gold bars totaling Rs 49.80 crore from flats owned by Arpita Mukherjee.
