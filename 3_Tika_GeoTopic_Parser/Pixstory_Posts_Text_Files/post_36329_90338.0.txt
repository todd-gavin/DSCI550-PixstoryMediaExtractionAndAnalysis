The environment is the most important aspect to survive on this planet. Humans tend to forget that without a balanced environment, life cannot be sustained. With climate change upon us, sea levels on the rise, and increasing numbers of earthquakes, floods, and droughts, we cannot stress this enough.

The increase in contamination and pollution of precious resources, and even more importantly, the exploitation of forest areas as they are roped in for various business ventures need to stop immediately if we are to hope for human survival.

Hence, to spread awareness and make people understand that a small positive step taken by each person can make big changes, 'World Environment Day' is celebrated every year.

The day is celebrated to highlight the importance of the environment and how to prevent environmental degradation and use natural resources within the natural discipline.
