During pre-sales, tickets for Harry Styles’ debut Australian tour sold out in seconds. 

Daily Mail reported that to fulfil the enormous demand, pop singer Harry Styles has added more dates to the tour's Australian and New Zealand legs. In February 2023, the 28-year-old former member of One Direction will go on a tour in Australia. 

According to NME, the English singer will perform solo stadium gigs in Perth, Melbourne, Gold Coast, Sydney, and Auckland. Harry's promoters have scheduled second gigs in Melbourne and Sydney due to overwhelming fan demand. 

For admirers of the singer, the tour has been a long time coming. He had planned to perform in Australia towards the end of 2020, but Covid regulations forced him to postpone his plans.

New songs from his upcoming third album, Harry's House, are set to be released in May. Harry recently played two new songs, which have yet to be released, at the Coachella music festival in California, in front of 100,000 fans.
