The long awaited Ms. Marvel will finally be hitting Disney+ in the upcoming week. Led by Iman Vellani, the series will see one of the most relatable MCU heroes come to life with fangirl Kamala Khan.

The character is notable for being a fan of superheroes. Which makes it a fantasy reality of every superhero fan, as everyone of us has always dreamed of being granted outrageous powers, so that we can team up with our favourite superheroes. 

Vellani has proven herself to be a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with an intense love of Iron Man (so realatable, am I right?) being a key part of that. 

The actress has jokingly made claims that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness actually lied to everyone when it labeled the MCU as Earth-616, showing just how deeply she's invested in the story, as reported by The Direct. 

In Multiverse of Madness, Strange is notified that he is on Earth-838, while his original reality was Earth-616. Vellani joked that no matter what Kevin Feige wants us to think, the MCU is Earth-199999. 

The actress is addressing how Strange in his latest appearance labeled the MCU-Universe as Earth 616. Vellani is pointing out that, for the last 80 years or so in Marvel Comics, Earth 616 has actually been the designation of the Marvel Comics' core reality, while MCU was christened as Earth 199999. 

Ms. Marvel is slated to release on June 8th, 2022 on Disney+.
