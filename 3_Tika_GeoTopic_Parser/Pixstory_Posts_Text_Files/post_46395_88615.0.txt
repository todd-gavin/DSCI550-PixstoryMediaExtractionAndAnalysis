Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder in which an individual has intrusive thoughts and/or feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly to the extent where it induces distress or impairs general function. As indicated by the disorder's name, the primary symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are persistent unwanted thoughts, mental images, or urges that generate feelings of anxiety, disgust, or discomfort .
Symptoms Of OCD - 
OCD involves two main types of symptoms: obsessions and compulsions. 
Obsessions -
The content of obsessive thoughts can vary widely, but a few common themes include:
1 worries about germs, dirt, or illness
2 fears of harming yourself or someone else
3 fears of saying something offensive or obscene
4 a need to have your possessions aligned, orderly, or symmetrical
5 explicit sexual or violent thoughts
6 worries about throwing things away
7 questioning your sexual desires or orientation
8 worries about the health and safety of yourself or your loved ones
9 intrusive images, words, or sounds
Compulsions- 
Examples of compulsive behaviors in OCD include:
1 washing your hands, objects, or body
2 organizing or aligning objects in a specific way
3 counting or repeating specific phrases
4 touching something a set number of times
5 seeking reassurance from others
6 collecting certain objects or buying several of the same item
7 hiding objects you could use to hurt yourself or someone else
8 mentally going over your actions to make sure you haven‚Äôt harmed anyone else. 
It might feel difficult to talk about OCD with the people in your life, and nothing says you have to share your diagnosis until you feel ready to do so. That said, isolating yourself usually only makes matters worse.
Reaching out to family, friends, and other loved ones can make it easier to get emotional support, plus any other type of support you might need ‚Äî which can, in turn, lead to improved well-being overall.‚ù§Ô∏èüí™
