Warframe developer Digital Extremes has unveiled the trailer for the sci fi third person shooter’s next upcoming big expansion : Duviri Paradox. The Duviri Paradox expansion was shown off at the TennoCon 2022 event, where gamers got to take a look at some of the roguelite flavour that’s been injected into the expansion’s mostly monochrome open-world.

The Duviri Paradox is an all-new open-world location that exists inside the mind of villain Dominus Thrax, the inhabitants of which are trapped in a grim, monochrome time-loop. You play as an outlaw known as the Drifter who must fight to break the endless cycle of death and rebirth.

The landscapes of Duviri are stark and grey, representing the mental state of Dominus Thrax. Moreover, death does not end the mission but rather revives the player right before being killed. A new mount is also available in the form of a skeletal steed called the Kaithe which will allow players to traverse vast distances. 

There appears to be some mechanic by which players will be able to restore colour to the world, but Digital Extremes didn't elaborate on that facet. The Duviri Paradox hasn’t been given a firm release date yet, but the expansion is due sometime during the last quarter of 2022.
