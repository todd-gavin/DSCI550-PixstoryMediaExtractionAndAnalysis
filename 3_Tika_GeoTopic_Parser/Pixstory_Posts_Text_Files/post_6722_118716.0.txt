Alt News retrieved a copy of the verdict passed by the Madras High Court bench comprising Justices VM Velumani and S Sounthar. The appeal was filed against an order of a lower court denying divorce to the petitioner (husband) on the ground of mental cruelty due to a lack of sufficient evidence.

The operative paragraphs of the judgment have been extracted below along with the Hon’ble benches rationale behind arriving at their decision.

17. “In the light of the decisions referred above, we have no hesitation in holding that in the present case, the respondent /wife caused mental cruelty to the husband by suspecting his character and making false allegations of extra marital affair in the presence of his colleagues and students and also before the police. We are given to understand that the appellant and the respondent are living separately from 2011 onwards and there is no evidence available on record to show that respondent has made any attempt for a reunion during this period.”
