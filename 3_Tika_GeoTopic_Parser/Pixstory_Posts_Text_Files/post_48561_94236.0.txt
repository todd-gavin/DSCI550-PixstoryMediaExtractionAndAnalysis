The triumph of Jesus Christ over death is the central theme of Easter. His resurrection signifies the gift of eternal life to all who believe in Him. Easter also serves as a complete affirmation of what Jesus taught and proclaimed during His three-year mission. He would have been regarded of as just another teacher or prophet if He had not risen from the dead, if He had merely died and not been raised. His resurrection, on the other hand, refuted all of this, providing definitive and irrefutable proof that He was truly the Son of God and that He had triumphed over death once and for all.

The Christian gospel revolves around the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Our preaching and hope, according to Saint Paul, will be in vain until Christ is raised from the dead (1 Cor. 15:14). There would be no Christian preaching or faith without the resurrection. The apostles of Christ would have continued as the dejected group depicted in John's Gospel as hiding from the Jews. They were hopeless until they encountered the risen Christ (John 20:19). They then touched Christ's nail and spear wounds, and they ate and drank with Him. "A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have," they answered (Acts 2-4), “...for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have” (Luke 24:39). The resurrection establishes Jesus of Nazareth as the King and Lord of a new Jerusalem: a new heaven and a new earth, as well as the prophesied Messiah of Israel.
