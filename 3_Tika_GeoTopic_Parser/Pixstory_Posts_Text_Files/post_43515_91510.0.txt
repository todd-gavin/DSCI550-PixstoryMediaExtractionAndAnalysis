1. Giving shoes to your partner will make them run away: Aside from the fact that it’s difficult to guess a significant other’s shoe size, giving shoes as gifts to a loved one in South Korea is a huge no-no. Superstition states that presenting a lover with a pair of shoes will make him or her run away… most likely in the same pair of shoes!

2. Writing names in red ink is a death threat:
In the past, red ink was used to write the names of the deceased on the family register. Therefore, writing someone’s name in red ink meant they had either passed away, or, if they were still living, you were wishing harm or death upon them. While this is no longer the case, many Koreans still consider it very rude to write someone’s name in red ink.

3. Dreaming of pigs will bring you wealth:
In many countries, pigs are often seen as dirty animals but in Korea, they are representative of fertility and wealth. This is because the pronunciation of “pig” is similar to the pronunciation for “jade.” Therefore, many Koreans believe that dreaming of pigs is a sign that great riches will soon be bestowed on them.

4. Four is an unlucky number:
This superstition stems from China, where the word for the number “four” sounds similar to the word for “death.” This rings true for Sino-Korean, which is rooted in the Chinese language. Many elevators in South Korea actually use the letter “F” in place of the number “4” to represent the fourth floor, similar to how some American elevators jump from the twelfth to the fourteenth floor, skipping the thirteenth.

5. Washing your hair washes away good luck:
In Korea, New Year’s Day provides the perfect opportunity to begin a new year with a fresh start. Often, Koreans will not wash their hair on this day, as it’s believed to wash away the good luck. Likewise, students will not wash their hair before a test so as to not ‘wash away’ all of the knowledge they’ve gained from studying.
