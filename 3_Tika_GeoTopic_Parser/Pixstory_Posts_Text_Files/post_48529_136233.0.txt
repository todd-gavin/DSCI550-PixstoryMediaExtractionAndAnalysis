We need that universe of pain and suffering. It makes sense from a moral perspective. The Bible says that God judges humans on the basis of their actions, and sinners deserve to be punished accordingly. Hell is a perfect place in which to punish sinners because it's a place of eternal suffering.
Second, hell serves as a deterrent for people who might want tosin in the future. It shows them what will happen if they do, and it ensures that they will never enjoy heaven. In fact, hell is actually necessary for salvation, because without it people would probably end up becoming complacent and forget about their need for redemption.
Hell helps us to understand the evil in the world better. It helps us to see how sinful human beings can be and how much damage they can cause. By punishing them in this way, we are able to learn from their mistakes and prevent them from happening again. Hell is also an excellent way to teach people about God's wrath and justice. By showing people what happens to those who choose not to follow His laws, they will realize just how important it is to live by His rules. In short, Hell makes sense because it benefits everyone involved - especially the sinners themselves! It's redemption.
