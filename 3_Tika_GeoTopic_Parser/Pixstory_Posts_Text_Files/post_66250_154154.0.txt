Im one of those who has love for both DC and Marvel and was for all my heart hoping that Justice League was going to be this amazing super hero film that we all wanted but sadly it was not to be. After the fun if idiotic BvS, I wanted JL to fill the void that BvS failed to do so.
Yes the film is a Frankenstein of a film, tonally inconsistent with comedic beats interspersed in-between randomly mismatching its darker moments. Joss Whedon had done wonders with Avengers but having to overtake a production that was underway was always going to be massive undertaking. Sadly he failed to continue the story that Synder had laid out and things seem to play out like a poor mans Infinity War.
We have story about 3 mother boxes but its laughable how easily our villain is able to obtain said boxes. During an internal scuffle betweenÂ  our heroes we see them completely neglect the box and the bad guys just takes of with it. There is no logic to any of the proceedings, if the box is so important then why is there no one competent protecting any of it and the villain can just teleport into the stronghold. Then we have the main villain of the piece Steppenwolf, a blank slate of a villain who has no real motivation or story. Matter made worse is that he don't seem all that powerful especially when Superman appears.
While BvS was fun and had some amazing moments, like the warehouse fight, JL has none of those moments. None of its elements work in its favour, its of kilter comedy and weak plot mixed with mediocre action just disappoints. Is there enjoyment? yes, seeing Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, Cyborg and Flash or join forces feels good but it kind of stops there.
