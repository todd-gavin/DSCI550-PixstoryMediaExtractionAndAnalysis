My favorite meal ! The smell of Sandwiches as you wake up , the aroma of fresh coffee !
Just Wow😍

When I think of breakfast foods , the first thing that comes in mind is cereal , waffles , pancakes 🥞 Sandwiches , Pasta and more ! But when I eat these foods , they quickly spike my blood sugar and also makes me gain weight ! It becomes difficult for me to concentrate and have steady energy throughout the day. It becomes even harder for me to lose weight !❌

Breakfast is called " the most important meal of the day ". As the name suggests , breakfast breaks the overnight fasting period . It replenishes your supply of glucose to boost your energy levels and also provides other essential nutrients required for good health !  So It's important to eat a great source of protein , healthy fats and fibre to help you stay fuller longer.✌️
