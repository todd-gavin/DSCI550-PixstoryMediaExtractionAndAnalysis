Chris Hemsworth, who has played Marvel superhero Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for eight films over the course of 11 years, claims to be done with the role. Chris revealed in a recent interview that the upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder might be his final appearance as the God of Thunder in the franchise. Chris previously expressed similar feelings, stating that his interest in the part was dwindling.

Chris made his screen debut as Thor in the 2011 film of the same name. Chris had his first major cinematic role in this film. Prior to this, the actor had only appeared in a cameo in the 2009 Star Trek picture.

Over the years, he has appeared in two solo Thor films as well as the Avengers flicks, making him one of the most well-known performers on the world.

"Well, the last I shot was Thor: Love and Thunder, and that might be my last Marvel movie, I don't know," Chris stated in an interview with Wired when questioned about his last Marvel picture. As with all Taika Waititi films, it was a chaotic, entertaining, and wacky experience." After directing the 2019 success Thor: Ragnarok, the third solo Thor picture in the MCU, Taika Waititi will return to direct Love and Thunder.
