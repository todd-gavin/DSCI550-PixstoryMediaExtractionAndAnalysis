This book deserves a read. When I read the title, I thought it will be about something completely else but I was surprised. I liked Radhika instantly, and could kinda relate to her when the question of her marriage comes up and so does her skin colour, so the book engrossed me and I finished it in 3 days. The book has an amazing start and captures your attention and you cannot put it down. The book correctly conveys what is is to be 'One Indian Girl', and at one level or another, I think Indian girls like me will relate to her. I think the book becomes some monotonus in the Hong Kong part, so I took one star out, but overall, this book deserves your attention. I almost was hoping for a sequel or maybe I was waiting for a happy ending but CB left the story on a cliffhanger. I WANTED to know whether Radhika eventually started loving Brijesh or not, because he seemed to complement her the moment they met.
coming to Debu and Neel, I felt Radhika should have said no to them straightaway instead of lingering but it's fine for the plot to progress. The character build was fabulous, and I liked how Radhika's character is built. The narration is, again, jumping between past and present, and it urges the reader to read on. What I missed, though, was the abscence of a good, loyal and a true friend who would counsel Radhika when she felt down or atleast would have made her feel better. Overall, you can't just get enough of this book. Real gem.
