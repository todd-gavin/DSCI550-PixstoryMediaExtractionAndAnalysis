"Thou lovest, but never knew love's sad satiety."
                                                              - P.B. Shelley

What is love?
If not a passion,
Which turns into inspiration,
For everything you set out to do,
Every belief becomes about her,
Every question I ask is about her.

Can it be called love?
If it's only from me,
No single trace of care from her,
Unrequited in a way,
I know her answer though,
Without fulfilment that is pure love.

Each moment passes,
All I think of is the next word,
That I may use to describe her,
Then, I scribble it out,
As words don't comprehend or say,
What my heart feels like.

I remember every inspiration I took,
For writing my every line,
No one had this affect on me,
I take her words for mine,
Write on them,
Till my blood poure into them.

Would have preferred these winds,
Swaying me to an unknown place,
Rather than writing something,
She wouldn't read,
That was only mean't for her,
My creation betrays the creator.

There are lines in my head,
That I want to write,
But I don't have the right,
I often wonder does she like my words
Or does she want them erased,
From my heart forever.

As these pages wither,
These words may not,
Only if I keep revisiting them,
Like her thoughts do,
In the darkest moments, 
Making me more confined,

I've always been confined in myself,
Thats why I write not speak,
I'm alone for days,
Yet I want her to talk,
For days and nights,
Thats a dream that I can only write.

As I write these words,
At every punctuation my hands shiver,
What if she gets angry with a word,
The only question in my head.
But there are always thorns,
With the prettiest Rose.

I may write the beautiful lines,
Staying inspired her,
She's the muse of my life,
She asks me why her?
The only answer I have is,
"Who else if not you."
