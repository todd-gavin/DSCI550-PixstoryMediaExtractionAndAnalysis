Every Christian is called to be perfect in the same way that Jesus was Every day of our life we should all be exhibiting the characteristics of a perfect Christian Everyone around us should desire to follow Jesus just because they know us because we are so biblically anchored That s a very high order and to be honest it s not possible God never said that we should walk in perfection or be perfect Yes Jesus was flawless and we are expected to follow in his footsteps but we are only human and we will never be as perfect as Jesus God is well aware of this and he does not expect us to achieve the unreachable That is why he bestows upon us the great gift of grace God saved you by his grace when you believed And you can t take credit for this it is a gift from God Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done so none of us can boast about it Ephesians We are created in God s image and likeness but we are also human beings with a sinful nature That means we will never be flawless while in our human bodies on this planet One of the most beneficial things we can do while on this planet is to accept our flaws and inadequacies and allow God to shine through them to help us grow Paul learnt this lesson after pleading with God to remove something that was holding him back and making him weak but God refused But he said to me My grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ s power may rest on me Corinthians
