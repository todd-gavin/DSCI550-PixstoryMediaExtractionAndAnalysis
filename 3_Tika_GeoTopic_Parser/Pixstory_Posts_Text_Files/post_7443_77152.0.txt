Mayor Adams has secured an ethics waiver to put his younger brother in charge of his security detail — but the post will be effectively unpaid despite an initial plan to give the sibling a six-figure salary.

The waiver, granted by the city Conflicts of Interest Board on Wednesday, spells out that Bernard Adams can be hired as a senior advisor for mayoral security.

But the younger Adams will only collect a $1 annual salary, according to the waiver, which was obtained by the Daily News via a Freedom of Information Law request. The “nominal” wage allows him to become a city employee, which is important as it subjects him to “the same integrity safeguards as other public servants,” including annual financial disclosures, COIB noted.

When the mayor first announced the hiring of his brother earlier this month, City Hall aides said the position would be salaried at $210,000 per year.

That sparked outrage from government watchdogs, who noted that Adams was likely barred from giving his brother a paid position in his administration under longstanding city laws against nepotism.

The pushback appears to have had an impact on Adams, as the COIB waiver makes clear that Brendan McGuire, the mayor’s chief counsel, stated in his initial request with the board that the mayoral security position would be “uncompensated.”

A City Hall spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday.
