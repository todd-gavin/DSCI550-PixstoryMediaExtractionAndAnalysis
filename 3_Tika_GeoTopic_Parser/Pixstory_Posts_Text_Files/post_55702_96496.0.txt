China is an increasing menace, according to Australia's Defence Minister, who claims the country might launch a chemical assault in the next four years. 

Mitchell Van Homrigh writes that during a wide-ranging interview with News Corp Australia, Peter Dutton made the startling statement. He asserted that defence chiefs across the country shared his concerns about China's military might and strategic position. 

“I think the circumstances are as dire as they were in the 1930s. I’m happy to present the facts … and then people can draw their own conclusions,” he said. “We want a normalised peaceful relationship with every country, including China. But China has changed. And it’s going to take money to respond to that both in terms of additional personnel as well as investment in technologies and equipment.”

He went on to say that Australia needed to preserve both its military and naval capabilities in order to "be prepared for what would have been unthinkable a year ago."
