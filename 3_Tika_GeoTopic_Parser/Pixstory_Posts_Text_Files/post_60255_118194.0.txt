Out of the 10,56,980 votes polled, the President-elect received 6,76,803 legitimate votes and defeated the opposition candidate Yashwant Sinha by a margin of 2,96,626 votes. In terms of vote share, she defeated Sinha with a victory margin of only 28.06 percent. She only managed to win 64.03 percent of the vote, falling short of the 65.65 percent won by departing President Ram Nath Kovind in 2017. But with only three years under its bag, the Modi administration was still in its first term.

Murmu was able to secure the support of the entire House in Andhra Pradesh, Nagaland, and Sikkim because Sinha received zero votes in these areas. Even in Kerala, where the BJP was unable to win any seats in either the Assembly or the Lok Sabha, she was able to secure one vote.

In the 15th presidential election in 2017, Ramnath Kovind received 7 lakh 2 thousand 44 votes out of 10 lakh 69 thousand 358 valid votes, or 65.65 percent. This is the least votes ever cast for a presidential contender in the previous forty years. Former Lok Sabha speaker Meera Kumar, Ramnath's opponent in the 2017 election, received 3 lakh 67 thousand 314 votes. About 34.35 percent of the vote went to Meera, a candidate backed by numerous opposition parties, including the Congress.

The loss of the BJP and its allies in significant states like Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu as well as the drop in their seat total in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, however, seem to have played a role in the decline in support for the NDA candidate.

In West Bengal, for example, where the BJP did well in the most recent elections, Murmu won 71 votes, up from just 11 in 2017. In Karnataka, it went up from 56 to 150. In 2017, 522 MPs backed Kovind while 540 MPs backed Murmu.

Rajendra Prasad, who ran for reelection in 1957, holds the record for the highest vote total ever received by a presidential candidate. Prasad's vote share was a stunning 99 percent, significantly greater than the 84 percent he received in 1952 when he first ran for office.
