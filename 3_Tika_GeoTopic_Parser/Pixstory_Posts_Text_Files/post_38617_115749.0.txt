He had an eye for picking out teammates who were in the danger zone as he had made 33 key passes per match. He ranked behind Bruno Fernandes who had 34 key passes in a match

We can see that amongst forwards, Marcus Rashford falls into the first quadrant.

Marcus Rashford Under Erik Ten Hag


With Erik Ten Hag in the helm, we can expect Rashford to have a more stellar season. With new signings potentially incoming in the form of Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen, Frenkie De Jong, Antony and Martinez, expect Erik Ten Hag to place more responsibility on Marcus’s shoulder in case Cristiano Ronaldo leaves. He might be used as a forward/winger depending on the circumstances. 


One formation could be with Rashford in the wings if Ronaldo does not depart Old Trafford. 

Operating in 4-2-3-1 formation transitioning to 4-3-3 or 4-3-2-1, this can be desired lineup if ETH manages to get his signings. It will tinker of course but you can expect him to go with this lineup.


Another formation we can expect with Ronaldo gone and Man United not able to get a striker. Rashford might start as a striker but he would transition to wing when United switch to 4-3-3 formation and Bruno Fernandes might operate as a false 9.
