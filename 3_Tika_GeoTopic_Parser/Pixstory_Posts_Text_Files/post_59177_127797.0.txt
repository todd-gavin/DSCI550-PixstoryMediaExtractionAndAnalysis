Atal Bihari Vajpayee's death anniversary: A prime minister for six years between 1998-2004, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a Bharat Ratna awardee, died in 2018 at 93 years of age.

Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee is the only leader of the country who has been equally respected not only in his party but also in the opposition party. While his image has been very popular as a liberal, judicious, fearless, simple-minded politician, his eloquent orator, his passionate heart full of poet's sensibility, and his personality who is faithful to Indian cultural values impress everyone.

He was a politician and a diplomat who served three terms as the prime minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. 

Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. He was the first Indian prime minister not of the Indian National Congress to serve a full term in office. He was also a renowned poet and writer.

God rest his soul. His contributions towards Indian politics will always be remembered. We are proud of them.
