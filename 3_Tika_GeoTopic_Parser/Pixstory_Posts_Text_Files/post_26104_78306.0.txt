Clouds are moving and so does our life 
Sun shines the same way everytime you smile 
The sky stays blue , the trees move by the wind 
Sometimes we lose ,sometimes we win 
Every tear is counted by a loved who watches you from the sky 
The sun too says goodbye 
It's fine to let go sometimes 
Time for sunset end of the day 
Tell yourself it's going to be ok 
Clouds are moving and so does life 
Sun shines the same way everytime you smile.

To be continued..
