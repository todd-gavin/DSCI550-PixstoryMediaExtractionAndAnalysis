This case is mainly applied in areas concerning mitigation of disasters safety environment It states that when someone is given an option to either completely eliminate a risk of lower magnitude or to drastically scale down a higher magnitude risk most people fixate on the former even though it is counterproductive to the cause To elaborate you are given two alternatives in first you have the power to bring down the suicide rate to zero and in second you have ability to drastically reduce the murder rate It s highly probable that most of the people would choose the first option The understanding behind this decision is that the full removal of an unwanted thing weighs more than reducing a bigger hindrance drastically Many times this type of option selection has been tagged as being myopic and discouraged due to limited reduction in overall risk aversion
