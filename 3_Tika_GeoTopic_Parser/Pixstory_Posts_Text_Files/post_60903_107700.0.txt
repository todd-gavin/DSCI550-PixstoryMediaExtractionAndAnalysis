Watching since my childhood. This show never gets old. The best thing which i like about this show is about the characters. Not only Shinchan, each and every characters are equally important and interesting. It will make you laugh hard, it will make you feel good, it will also make you cry. Shinchan unlike any other animated show is an emotion. Talking about the characters, as i have mentioned that each and every character plays an important role here. Each character have their own backstory. This is the thing which makes this show so special.
