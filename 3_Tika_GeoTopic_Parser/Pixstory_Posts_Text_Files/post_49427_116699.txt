Asking for money for the work you re doing is audacious Sir I ll tell you what s audacious expecting people to work for free is audacious You have a problem with people asking to be compensated for the legit work they are doing Unpaid internship is corporate slavery If they can t afford to pay you they most likely can t afford to coach you and support your personal development They can t afford a good mentorship for you They squeeze work out of you for free the work that s technically meant for your paid employees Unpaid internships don t mentor you they exploit you If the argument for not paying an intern is that they will learn a lot keep in mind that same justification ought to apply to all the other employees It s only fair to pay someone for the work they do Students have their expenses and experience will not pay for them Not paying them is exploitation in every form If a company values its interns they ll pay them for the work they re doing If they don t pay you they just don t value you enough and that s definitely not the kind of firm you want to work at
