Releasing on th August the new trailer for She Hulk Attorney at Law Marvel is adding yet more to its immense universe In comparison to its previous teaser this one features a lot better CGI though it is rather inconsistent and still needs a lot more polishing With the whole fourth wall breaking inclusion of Wong Abomination She Hulk seems to have a lot more to offer to the table than expected Furthermore the surprise cameo of Daredevil was a great addition and the best part of the whole trailer With all that said Marvel is yet to fail in not disappointing To make a character relatable you need to show her internal struggles and the obstacles they overcame in order to finally be at peace with who they are as is the case with Tony Stark Thor Natasha Romanoff Bucky Steven Strange etc All these characters had their own internal demons which they haunted them for a long time until they finally confronted them and attained a level of peace This showcased their growth in terms of both their personalities and their overall strengths However just like in the case with Captain Marvel She Hulk seems to be all perfect and powerful from the get go completely in control and fully unphased that her life is fundamentally altered at every single level Bruce Banner had to struggle a great deal with his Hulk persona before he made peace with him and by that point he had faced a bunch of adversaries such as Abomination Ultron Thanos etc which clearly helped him gain more and more control But right off the bat She Hulk is already better than him at controlling such a powerful force This makes her as alien as Captain Marvel who was basically a perfect character from the get go making her as fake as her CGI As for the trailer itself it is the same brain dead MCU nonsense that we have seen a thousand times by now With such potential watching Two Hulks with no rage is just lame
