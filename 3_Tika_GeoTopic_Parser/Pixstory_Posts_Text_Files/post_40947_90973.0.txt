Hollywood's history is riddled with films that were so poor and foolish that they bankrupted studios, ruined careers, and metaphorically set fire to millions of dollars. 

But, as Matt Neal points out, the term "box office bomb" does not always imply a poor film? 
Occasionally, films lose tens of millions of dollars due to a combination of strange occurrences, marketing blunders, and other external and internal causes – not because the film is terrible. 
It's difficult to estimate the amount of these losses. 

AbcNet reported that studios divulge production budgets, but marketing and distribution budgets are rarely disclosed, and are estimated to be anywhere from half to even equal to the amount spent making the picture in the first place.

For instance, let’s talk about John Carter. This adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' century-old sci-fi series cost around $US350 million to produce, but it bombed miserably, losing as much as $US225 million in today's money. 

Within days of the film's release, Disney took a $US200 million writedown, cancelled two sequels, and accepted the resignation of Disney studio president Rich Ross. 

However, unlike comparable flops such as Battleship (also starring Taylor Kitsch) and Mortal Engines, John Carter received positive reviews.

The majority of the blame for the film's failure, according to the book John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood and a recent analysis by The Wrap, lies in "a flawed and confounding marketing campaign" that ignored Burroughs and his story's influence on sci-fi and ultimately failed to sell it as the next Star Wars-scale franchise.
