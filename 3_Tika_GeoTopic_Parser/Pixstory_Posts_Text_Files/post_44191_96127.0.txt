Nobody could have expected Kompany's success at City when he arrived from Hamburg in
2008, but he was part of a group of senior players who guided the club to unparalleled
achievement.

We've looked back at the lineup with which Kompany made his City debut in a 3-0 win over
West Ham in August 2008, which was secured due to a goal from Daniel Sturridge and a brace
from Elano.

Here, we look at who Vincent Kompany's teammates were at that particular match and where
they are currently.

Joe Hart

Hart was a great servant for Manchester City, but since Pep Guardiola arrived at the Etihad, his
career has taken a plunge. The former England No.1 had a good season on loan at Torino in
Serie A, but a subsequent tenure at West Ham was less successful.

He joined Burnley in 2018 but was released on a free transfer after only 24 appearances two
years later, before joining Tottenham as Hugo Lloris' backup. After a single season at Spurs, he
joined Celtic in the summer of 2021.

Vedran Corluka

Have we spent too much time playing Football Manager, or was Corluka a fantastic defender for
both City and Tottenham?

He left Tottenham for good in 2012 after five years in England, joining Lokomotiv Moscow,
where he spent nine seasons and won one Russian title and four Russian Cups. Corluka has
been the assistant manager of the Croatian national team since his retirement in 2021.
