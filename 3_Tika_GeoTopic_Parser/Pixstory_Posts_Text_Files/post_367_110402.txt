Under an executive order of the government the next IB chief Tapan Kumar Deka is not entitled to get the apex pay scale since he is not among the senior most Indian Police Service IPS officers serving at the centre but there is another set of rules called IPS Pay Rules which on the contrary say he is entitled to get the top pay grade by virtue of holding the post of Director Intelligence Bureau DIB IPS Pay Rules were issued as part of a gazette notification in September while the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet ACC in July cleared an executive order saying only IPS officers serving at the centre and empanelled in the rank of Director General DG can get the apex pay scale in order of seniority So we have IPS Pay Rules and an order of the ACC and both are not in conformity The question here that needs to be dealt with is why there are two sets of rules order to fix the salary of top IPS officers of the country and which should prevail legally for deciding the pay grade says an IPS officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity Deka is going to take charge on June as the next DIB The DIB traditionally chairs the annual conference of all police chiefs of the country as he is considered the Head of entire police family in India and is the only four star police officer in the country at par with the army chief But still as DIB Deka will not get the apex pay scale due to the July ACC order which the IPS fraternity holds as a devaluation of the post of DIB As per the IPS Pay Rules IPS officers manning around a dozen posts at the centre are eligible to get the apex pay scale and these include the designation of Director Intelligence Bureau DIB These rules do not mention any criterion of seniority in grant of apex pay scale to senior IPS officers
