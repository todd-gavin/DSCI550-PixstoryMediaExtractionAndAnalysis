To Kill a Mockingbird is still relevant today because of what it taught us about life.
The way Harper Lee chose to inculcate some essential life lessons in each one of us who read her book is incredible.

This is what it taught us.
Atticus’s advice to Scout echoes throughout the novel as we encounter various characters, from Mr Raymond to Boo Radley and Mayella Ewell. With our world more divided than ever, Atticus’s words remind us to reach out to others, to try and see the world from their perspective before passing judgement.

Action always speaks louder than words; this is very well portrayed in the novel.
Miss Maudie teaches Scout a vital lesson: we are defined by how we treat others, and beliefs – religious or otherwise – can never justify cruel behaviour.

There are two lessons to be learned here – are we cheating? Firstly, Atticus is teaching Scout that responding to violence with more violence never achieves anything: two wrongs don’t make a right. And secondly, the only way to stop a bully (or an internet troll) is to let what they say slide over you. Their sole aim is to get a reaction, so patience and restraint are your greatest allies.
