As part of our महिला : मोहरा या मुद्दा series, we ask women of Uttar Pradesh what they want to see in party manifestos, what they want to hear from their candidates, and what they want their government to do. 

Kalavati, a veteran social activist from Chitrakoot district, tells us what matters to her most. She says political manifestos prefer to talk of freebies rather than core issues. Why is gender violence not a main issue? Why should women face institutional violence all over again when they try to seek justice? In fact, Kalavati wants candidates and parties to even talk about safety for women on the internet...

Why is gender pay gap not an issue? Whether it is in offices or in wage work, why are women being paid less than men? If gender equality is our concern, then the wage gap is also our concern. That's not all, Kalavati says that it is the time for women to talk about wages against housework, wages against carework, emotional and mental labour. If we can put a value to domestic work in the market, then why don't we talk about the value of housework? 

Is the government hearing what women have to say about 'swachh Bharat' toilets? Because our societies are not built for women to freely congregate, going for ablutions together in the fields is a community activity, where they get to meet each other, check in, laugh and bond. Kalavati demands that villages, towns and cities be designed for women - to rest, loiter, and feel a sense of community. We want young girls to have the right to dream...we want society to have the same expectations from women and men. If they expect us to behave like good women, they must expect the same from men. 

Our demands are not big-ticket ones like loan waivers or 1 trillion economy, our demands have a lot to do with how we lead our everyday lives, thus of the highest importance to us. 

But who is listening?
