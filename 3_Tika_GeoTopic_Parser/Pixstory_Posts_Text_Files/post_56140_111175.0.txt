Summer holidays are very important for children. The Welsh government education minister Jeremy Miles has ruled out cutting the break to two or three weeks or having fewer holidays. 

One union said there were "many more pressing issues that need attention".
Mr. Miles said public research indicated while there was "reasonable contentment" with the timetable there, was "openness" to changes. A public meeting on whether the summer holidays should be reduced is due to begin in the next academic year.

It is likely to illustrate different options for altering the habit of school terms. A report by Beaufort Research for the government came up with three:

	A five-week summer break with three school terms of about 13 weeks, with a one-week break halfway and three weeks at Christmas

	A four-week summer break with five school terms of about seven or eight weeks. Three weeks holiday at Christmas and two weeks between the other terms

A three-week summer break with terms lasting about six or seven weeks with fortnightly breaks in between.

I think children should get breaks even though their classes were online or offline this is because there is an increase in the level of stress among students. The need for summer vacations would give children the time to relax and find time for themselves to engage in extra circular activities.
