Supreme Court Justice Stephen G Breyer is stepping down at the end of the court s current term opening up the possibility of President Biden s first nomination Given the conservative majority in the top court the Democrats have been waiting anxiously for this chance even if this one vacancy is not going to reset the balance Justice Breyer is expected to make his announcement Thursday Biden is likely to make good his the campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the apex court At least three names are already doing rounds Going by the Constitution the president names judges but it is the Senate that confirms their appointment after an elaborate process Biden will have to complete the nomination process in a short time The Democrats chances could worsen if the Republicans retake the Senate this November and or the presidency in Today the Senate is split evenly and the vice president has the tie breaking vote Then some of the Democrats too have not played along in case of some of the president s legislative moves On the other hand Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky may try his best to block Biden s moves He has served the notice that he may not confirm Biden s nominee during the last two years of the president s term In the past he applied rules differently in and when it comes to confirming justices That is why Biden will have to fine tune his strategy After mid terms polls which usually go to the opposition Republicans could be in majority in the chamber Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointment Trump had a rare chance with McConnell s help probably to clear three appointments and tilt the ideological balance That is not going to happen again for a long time since the incumbent judges are not likely to retire soon The recent appointees are relatively young too so the next opportunity would be years away So the majority in the court will remain on the conservative side for a long while changing the course of the nation on issues like abortion
