Dreamers BY SIEGFRIED SASSOON Soldiers are citizens of death s grey land Drawing no dividend from time s to morrows In the great hour of destiny they stand Each with his feuds and jealousies and sorrows Soldiers are sworn to action they must win Some flaming fatal climax with their lives Soldiers are dreamers when the guns begin They think of firelit homes clean beds and wives I see them in foul dug outs gnawed by rats And in the ruined trenches lashed with rain Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats And mocked by hopeless longing to regain Bank holidays picture shows spats And going to the office on the train The poem talks about the life of soldiers in the trenches during WWI The poem describes the horrors of the war through this poem The poet moves through trenches to firelit homes The soldiers have only access to good memories in their memories They are described as those living very near to death as they face death every day The trenches have foul smells and rats and are ruined They can only dream about mundane activities and they barely survive in the trenches War does good for none
