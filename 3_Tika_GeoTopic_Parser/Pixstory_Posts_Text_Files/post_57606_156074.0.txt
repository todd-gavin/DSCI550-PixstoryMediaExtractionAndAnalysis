People are trying different ways to get the perfect and fit body they yearn for.
It could be a diet for some or a workout for others, but both need a balance to give a positive result.
Eating plans are essential to look at while embarking on this weight loss journey.
We know different diet plans and ways of losing weight, one of them are intermittent fasting.
With intermittent fasting, you only eat during a specific time. Fasting for a certain number of hours each day or eating just one meal a couple of days a week can help your body burn fat. And scientific evidence points to some health benefits, as well.
Some studies suggest that alternate-day fasting is about as effective as a typical low-calorie diet for weight loss. That seems reasonable because reducing the number of calories you eat should help you lose weight.
