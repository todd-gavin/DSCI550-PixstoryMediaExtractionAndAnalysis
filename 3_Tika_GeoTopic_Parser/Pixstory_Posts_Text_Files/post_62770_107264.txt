This book maybe for you if you want to learn about organic or home churches It makes some strong points about what s wrong with the the institutional churches without being offensive If you re not convinced with the idea of home churches this book maybe for you Frank Viola argues in Reimagining Church that today s organised denominational hierarchical clergy laity split audience driven churches are not only unhealthy but also unbiblical Viola claims that the apostles churches were home based non hierarchical community focused churches where members interacted as a healthy family caring for and encouraging one another on a regular basis The full reliance on Christ as the supernatural head of the church is perhaps the most powerful feature of Viola s experience with home churches He asks the question in this manner Consider a typical traditional church or what he refers to as an institutional church Assume that the Holy Spirit has left that church Would anyone notice or would things carry on as usual Imagine a small group of believers gathering in a home without a minute by minute worship schedule no hired clergy to lead the service and the intention of sharing a spontaneous time of fellowship and worship Consider the organic church with and without the Holy Spirit The difference is stark
