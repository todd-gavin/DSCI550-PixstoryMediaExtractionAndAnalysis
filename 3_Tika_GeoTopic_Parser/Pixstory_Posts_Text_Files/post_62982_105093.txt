I ve always been very interested in knowing that there are people similar or different from us somewhere in ths universe because that just makes sense The universe is trillions of years old and so endlessly vast it s just stupid to think that we re the only people to exist here or the only planet to have life on it I mean even on Earth for example we have so many mysteries to be unfolded yet So many things we aren t even aware of that exists So many different species of animals and plants some living in conditions that we couldn t have imagined Then how do we know there aren t creatures that can survive in those conditions that we think can t have life Not to mention the countless stories of people encountering them Do you believe in aliens
