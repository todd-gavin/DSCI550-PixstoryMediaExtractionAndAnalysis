Manchester City faced FC Copenhagen at Denmark’s Parken in their 4th match of the ongoing UEFA Champions League group stage. The Danish champions and the English champions shared points in an eventful 0-0 draw. The result did not affect the positions of either of these teams in the points table as Manchester City is still no.1 while Copenhagen are at the very bottom of the table but it was surely a match worth watching. 
Pep Guardiola rested many of his main team players in this match. For instance, Julian Alvarez replaced Erling Braut Haaland atop the City attack. Although the Argentine youngster was good, City surely lacked the sheer force of the Norwegian goal-machine in their attack. 
Right at the 12-minute mark, Rodri scored a screamer for Manchester City but a VAR check showed that a handball by Riyad Mahrez in the build-up was overlooked by the referee. The goal was thus disallowed - yet another example of how VAR is ruining the beautiful game. 
The VAR, however, redeemed their mistake by awarding a penalty to Manchester City at the 23-minute mark. Unfortunately, Copenhagen goalkeeper Grabara saved Riyad Mahrez’s loosely taken penalty.
Right at the 29-minute mark, VAR intervened for another big decision as Manchester City’s 21-year-old defender Sergio Gomez was sent off due to a rough tackle right outside the penalty area. For the remainder (almost 60 minutes of the match), Man City played with 10 men. Surprisingly, even then, Manchester City ended up dominating the majority of the second half. However, the match ended 0-0 with neither teams being able to find the back of the net. 
It was a shocking result for everyone as nobody had expected Copenhagen to eke out a point against the mighty Man City. The red card and some controversial VAR decisions helped them though.
