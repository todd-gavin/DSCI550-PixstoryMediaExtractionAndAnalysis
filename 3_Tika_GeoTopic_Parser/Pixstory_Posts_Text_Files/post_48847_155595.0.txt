When parents raise a child without imposing any preconceived gender standards on them and enable them to select which one they would prefer to adopt for the rest of their lives, that parenting style is known as gender-neutral parenting. This enables the kid to develop in accordance with traditional gender norms without being forced into a box.
According to studies, a male brain and a female brain are much similar. Although there are biological distinctions between the sexes, both genders share a variety of characteristics. Defining children by their gender more than their interests often leaves them not only insecure in their identity but also sets unrealistic expectations for them.
Consequently, it is crucial to give your child your whole attention as a person, not only as a boy or a girl. However, the topic is undoubtedly debatable. Many people don't agree with gender neutral parenting, what's your stand on it?
