The shot-stopper has moved ahead of Oliver Kahn to take over first place.

With his 311th triumph against Union Berlin on Saturday, Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer became the Bundesliga's all-time victories leader.
For the record mark, he beat off Oliver Kahn, the Bavarian legend.

Neuer has been out of action for much of this season due to injury, but he has returned at a crucial time for Bayern Munich as they attempt to hold off Borussia Dortmund for the Bundesliga title.

Neuer's track record is impressive:
Since joining Bayern Munich from Schalke in 2011, the goalkeeper has become an iconic component of the club's spectacularly successful previous decade.
Among his many club achievements, he has won the Bundesliga nine times, the Champions League twice, and the World Cup once.

He has been named to the FIFPro World XI four times and is a two-time German football player of the year.

On his 460th appearance in Germany's top division, the nine-time champion picked up win number 311.

The first 77 victories came in 156 games for Neuer's boyhood club Schalke, before he went on to solidify his status as the world's greatest ever goalkeeper during a decade-defining stay at Bayern, where he has now won 234 of 304 Bundesliga games.
He broke Kahn's record in record time. Before hanging up his gloves, the Bayern CEO and Neuer's predecessor as goalie and captain won his 310th and final game in his 557th game, beating Hertha Berlin 4-1 on the final matchday of the 2007/08 season.
Neuer has been snatching Kahn's goalscoring records, just like Robert Lewandowski is doing with Gerd Müller's.
At the start of this season, the current Germany No. 1 broke Kahn's Bundesliga record for clean sheets (204 for Karlsruhe and Bayern) - again in many fewer games – and is now well ahead on 211.
