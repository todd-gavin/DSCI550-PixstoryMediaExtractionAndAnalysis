It goes without saying the nominated actresses will dazzle the red carpet tonight but I am egarly waiting to see Zendaya and Lady Gaga slay the red carpet Lady Gaga has million reason not to attend the ceremony after being infamously snubbed for a best actress nomination this year for her starring role in House of Gucci But accordong to sources there are no hard feeling Going through this unique award season has gotten Gaga more and more motivated to do more film work It has lit a fire in her to get up on that stage again and win an Oscar in the future Zendaya has become the new style Icon and we look forward to see her bring her ace game this evening
