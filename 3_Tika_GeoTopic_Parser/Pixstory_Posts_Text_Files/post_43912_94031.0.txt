The German Manager has been harassed on social media, and his mother has also been abused, according to him.

In the aftermath of Bayern Munich's Champions League elimination, Julian Nagelsmann claims he has received roughly 450 death threats.

Bayern was eliminated from the Champions League this week after losing to Villarreal in the quarter-finals.

Since their loss, the coach has received hatred on Instagram, and his mother has also been targeted, according to the coach.

What exactly did Nagelsmann say?

"I have a general understanding of how to deal with criticism." "With the 450 death threats on Instagram, the situation is different," the 34-year-old told reporters.

"I get it after every game, regardless of whether we win or lose." I'm not one of those people who reads them. I always remove a lot of things. Normally, I just notice the first sentence.

"It's obvious that many people want to murder me, but now they're firing at my own mother, who has nothing to do with football or the elimination." That's a little strange, but if I consider everything, I won't be able to complete it.

"What am I going to do about it? I just cannot care less. People should write anything they want, but think about it a bit more. I'm not sure what you mean."

What does Bayern's future hold?

The Bundesliga remains the Bavarian team's lone hope of winning a trophy this season. With five games remaining, they are nine points clear of Borussia Dortmund and on the verge of clinching the league title.

On Sunday, they face Arminia Bielefeld.

"I want us to be champions in the next two games," Nagelsmann continued.

"I'll make a lot of plans and hope to perform better next year." If someone loves me, it should be because I'm Julian Nagelsmann, not because I'm Bayern Munich's coach, and if they don't, that's fine, too. Nobody but me has anything to prove."
