For the sole purpose of carrying the items I'll need for the flight with me, I always fly with a carry-on bag. I don't like dealing with a jacket or stuffing my pockets full of things.
Depending on why I'm travelling, checked luggage may or may not be available. I like to only bring a small bag on flights, there are times when I only bring my carry-on luggage. I've reduced the amount I need to bring to the point that I'll just have one additional change of clothes. My toiletries are also throwaway items that I can simply throw away to make room if I run out of room.
I don't like spending too much time in the airport, I don't like having my luggage go missing either. And honestly, carry-ons are just easier to travel with too. All it needs is some self control and practice, and you'll do just fine without that extra luggage (and extra charges)!
