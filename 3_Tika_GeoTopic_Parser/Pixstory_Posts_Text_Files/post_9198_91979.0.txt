On National Maritime Day, I extend my greetings to our courageous seafarers and marine workers.
It's because of them that the 🚢maritime sector has massively contributed to the economic growth of the nation.

Do you know?
The day is historically significant because it was on this day in 1919 that the first large-scale shipping company owned entirely by Indians, Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd, sent off the SS Loyalty on its maiden voyage.
