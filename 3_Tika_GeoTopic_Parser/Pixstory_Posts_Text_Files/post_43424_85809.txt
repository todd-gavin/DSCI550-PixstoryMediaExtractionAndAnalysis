I wear the Hijab for many reasons I wear it because my Lord has asked me to and not doing so would be disobeying Him I wear it because with the Hijab on the first thing people know about me is that I m a Muslim I wear it because it is a symbol of modesty Insha khan At present a lot of controversies surrounding the Hijab surfaced But despite all the hate and opposition They stand firm on my grounds to wear it The Hijab has been misrepresented as an oppressive practice but to me it is more liberating than anything else I feel confident about myself about my individuality and about my faith when I wear a Hijab and that matters Nobody has the right to ask me to take it off I have all the freedom will and liberty to wear it and so I will Jweriya Oppression I believe comes in many shades It is oppression when we ask women to act in a certain manner or dress in a certain way Whether it s forcing us to wear something or asking us to stop wearing something it is oppression either way I do not identify liberation with the length of a dress For me liberation is covering my body in resonance with my beliefs and my comfort
