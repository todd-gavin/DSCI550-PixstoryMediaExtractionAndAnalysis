ðŸ‘‰Start Your Day With a Parfait
To get a jump on your probiotic consumption, simply top a breakfast bowl of yogurt with your favorite granola (the lower in sugar the better) and some antioxidant-rich berries.

ðŸ‘‰Make Yogurt a Kitchen Staple
Just know that any recipe that requires heating the yogurt in any way is going to kill off its good bacteria. So stick to no-cook recipes to reap the most gut benefits.

ðŸ‘‰Broaden Your Sauerkraut Savvy
You can buy it or make it with traditional cabbage or sub in other veggies to give any meal a whole lot more flavor. 

ðŸ‘‰Add Kefir to Your Smoothies
Kefir, a tart and tangy cultured milk drink, is packed with various strains of beneficial probiotics and live cultures.

ðŸ‘‰Take a Kombucha Break
Kombucha is a probiotic-rich fermented drink made with tea, sugar, bacteria, and yeast â€” making it a great vegan alternative to other probiotic-rich dairy products, such as kefir or yogurt.

ðŸ‘‰Experiment With Kimchi
Kimchi, a super-spicy Korean condiment, is packed with healthy bacteria called lactobacilli, which gives it a probiotic boost. 

ðŸ‘‰Try Tempeh
For a tasty alternative to meat, seek out recipes that incorporate tempeh â€” a preparation of probiotic-rich fermented soybeans.
Tempeh is also a healthy vegan source of protein, fiber, and antioxidants.

ðŸ‘‰Add Miso Soup on Your Menu
Miso soup is easy to make with hot water and miso paste, and it adds a probiotic punch to any meal.

ðŸ‘‰Donâ€™t Forget Prebiotic-Rich Foods
Prebiotics are nondigestible components found in some fruits, veggies, and other foods that promote the growth of good-for-you bacteria in the gut.
