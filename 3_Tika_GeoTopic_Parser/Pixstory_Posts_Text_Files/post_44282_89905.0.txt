Newcastle United is putting together a squad "the correct way," according to a new report on the club's summer plans.

That's according to Frank McAvennie, a former West Ham striker who spoke exclusively to Football Insider about the Magpies' transfer ambitions.

Newcastle have ruled out making "superstar" recruits this summer, according to Luke Edwards of The Telegraph (24 March).

Eddie Howe will also be given a summer budget that is less than the £90 million spent in January, according to reports.

However, the sale of first-team players who are no longer needed could help raise revenue.
Newcastle can yet ascend to the top six of the Premier League, according to McAvennie, without spending a fortune.

“That’s the right way to do it,” McAvennie told Football Insider correspondent Ben Wild.

“You need to have the right balance in that dressing room. If you have a big ego in there all of a sudden, it can upset things.

“Eddie Howe seems to be getting that right, look at the players that were signed in January.

“They spent the money but I wouldn’t say any superstars came in.

“I think next season they will make the signings to get them into the top-six, that would be incredible.

“From there, who knows? Once they are established up there, players will want to join them.

“That’s key but I’m glad to see they aren’t just going to throw money at the situation.”

In January, Newcastle brought in Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Bruno Guimaraes, Dan Burn, and Matt Targett.

This site reported on Thursday (March 24) that Miguel Almiron is one of the senior players that could be sold this summer.

In other developments, a commentator thinks that Newcastle's ace is "on borrowed time" following a transfer update from a source.
