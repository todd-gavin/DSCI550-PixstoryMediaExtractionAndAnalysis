There are a wide range of back pain causes. They include acute conditions like a common muscle strain or chronic, more serious issues like scoliosis or even cancer. Getting back pain relief starts with figuring out which cause is at play so treatment can be tailored accordingly. 
Many back pain causes resolve in a few days or weeks with rest, over-the-counter medication, and other relatively simple measures. More severe causes may require ongoing care and treatment, including surgery for conditions . 
Common Back Pain Causes
There are many possible causes of back pain. Here are some of the more common ones.
1 Strain or Sprain ; 
Strains and sprains are the most common causes of back pain, especially in the lower back. A strain refers to the tearing of a muscle or tendon (which connects muscles to bones), while a sprain refers to the tearing of a ligament (which connects bones in a joint). 
2 Bulging or Ruptured Disc ; 
Intervertebral discs are located between the bones of the spine and serve as shock-absorbing cushions. The discs can break down over time, typically due to risk factors including:
Age and aging
Trauma or injury
Stress due to obesity
Repetitive stress injury
Smoking
3 Osteoarthritis ; 
Spine osteoarthritis is a form of arthritis that is caused by the wear and tear of cartilage between the spinal bones. As the cartilage wears away, you can experience a dull, aching, or throbbing back pain that worsens with movement. You can feel a popping sensation known as crepitus, joint stiffness, and a reduced range of motion.
4 Sciatica ; 
Sciatica refers to a feeling of nerve pain that goes down the leg. The term is a misnomer since the sciatic nerve (a large nerve in the leg that's formed by nerve roots that come off of the lumbar spine) isn't specifically irritated in this condition. Irritation of the lumbar nerve roots causes sciatica.
