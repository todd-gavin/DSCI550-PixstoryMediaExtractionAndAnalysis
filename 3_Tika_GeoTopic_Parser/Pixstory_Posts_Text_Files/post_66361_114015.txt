I got reminded of my engineering days when I ate out of other pockets rather than my own I graduated last year amidst Covid after not being able to attend college physically for more than a year Yet last week when I went back to collect my graduation certificate I made sure to relive atleast a part of my college canteen Nothing on my MBA delicacy can make up for the same There are two foods that stand out the most One is chicken chowmein which was available at our main canteen for rupees Me and my friends used to remain on stealth mode in the canteen Whenever one of us or an acquaintance bought food we used to move into action Hands flew in from all sides and plates got empty literally in seconds Then we moved on to the next target And generally the food used to be chicken chowmein with plenty of sauce on it I don t know but the sauce thing is probably common for all boys coz all of us loved our chowmein with the same Also how can I forget the rupees cold drinks in plastic cups I used to drink it all day On some days it also happened that I had spent my days savings on it The cold drinks machine was installed in a corner of the canteen A mix of all different drinks was my favourite The second most nostalgic one was not exactly from canteen but from a small shack infront of our college that everyone called macha It was luchi accompanied by aloor dom for rupees or chicken for rupees I who usually didn t eat in college from my own pocket sometimes used to go to macha alone to grab this splendid snack and spend some time with myself in solitude
