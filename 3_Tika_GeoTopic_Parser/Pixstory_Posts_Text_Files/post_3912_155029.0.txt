It's a fortunate moment to get a friend where you can open up at anytime maybe through various medium, but to have such a friend makes our mental health even more better. 
That one listener who listens up to all our thoughts, who calms us down and helps us find relief. Thanks to all those friends, friends do help us out at that moment, but seeking professional help is very important right after you feel a need of help.
