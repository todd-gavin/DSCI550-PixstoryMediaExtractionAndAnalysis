The Charlotte Hornets, a team that had Michael Jordan, have a history of being league underachievers. maybe the Sacramento Kings, though. 

That might alter right now. Sports Rush reported that Lamelo Ball's arrival has given the franchise new cause for optimism. Lamelo Ball must be compensated since the rebirth may be closer than we realise. 

He is the first top three pick for the team in eight years and the first to be qualified for a rookie maximum extension. Lamelo Ball should unquestionably receive that extension. 

He was very brilliant last season. 18.3 points, 7 assists, and 6.4 rebounds per game are his career averages! For this one, Michael Jordan ought to be spending all of his money.
