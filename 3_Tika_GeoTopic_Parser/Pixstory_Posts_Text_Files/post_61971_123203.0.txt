With the news breaking that Ben Affleck will be back as Batman in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom instead of Michael Keaton, it shook things up in the DC Extended Universe. However, while this might make some fans happy, bringing Affleck back might not be the best idea for the franchise's future. In fact, having Keaton return might not even be for the best, as it's time for the DCEU to move on from the Dark Knight for the time being.

Warner Bros. has relied on Batman for longer than any other superhero. While Superman made his big movie debut first, the Caped Crusader has been an almost constant since Tim Burton and Michael Keaton brought Batman to the big screen in 1989. Those early movies were all successful, even Joel Schumacher's critically panned fourth one, and then Christopher Nolan revived the character with his critically acclaimed Dark Knight Trilogy. And with Affleck showing up as Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Bruce Wayne has been carrying the DC movie franchise on his shoulders for over 30 years now. But that might mean it's time for someone else to carry the load, at least in the DCEU.
