I have always loved visiting my aunt's place during the summer. Usually this place would be blazing hot like a furnace but visiting this pond at the back of the house would provide some refuge from the heat.

There's a lot one can feel when you deposit yourself at the lap of nature. I have seen so many types of lizards (best not to go near them and observe from a distance) and if you're lucky you might spot a fox or jackal at night.

The pond is thriving with a healthy population of fishes and once in awhile you'd see birds that prey on these fishes come and hunt a few.

The prospective of taking a dip in the lake is quite tempting but I have never dared because the surrounding areas and the lake itself is a home to a few species of snakes. 

What's your summer retreat and how would you normally spend a summer afternoon?
