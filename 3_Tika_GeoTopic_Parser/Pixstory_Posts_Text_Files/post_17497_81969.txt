The Los Angeles Lakers did not make a trade during the NBA trade deadline and have shifted the focus towards the buyout market If the team is going to make any improvements this season it is going to be with players whose current teams no longer want them There are some decent buyout options for the Lakers to pursue that could actually help raise the floor of this team However it appears as if the Lakers are getting to caught up in external solutions when the best solution might come from within We have seen the Lakers promote players time and time again and it be successful The team should now continue its own trend and promote the best player from the South Bay Lakers Mason Jones For those who may not know Jones is a six four two guard who is tearing it up in the G League this season Jones has some of the best numbers in the entire G League and is going to be in the running for the G League MVP Mason is averaging points rebounds and assists per game while shooting from the field and from beyond the arc Obviously the numbers would not be as good in the NBA but the fact that he is dominating the G League shows that he is ready to be in the NBA rotation As seen in the above video Jones has a smooth stroke from anywhere on the court and would be a great off ball scorer for the Los Angeles Lakers but more importantly could be someone who the team brings in off the bench to create his own shot Jones is a solid defensive player as well He is averaging steals per game with a defensive rating for the South Bay Lakers While he is by no means an Alex Caruso level defender he is definitely not as bad as some of the defensive liabilities that the Lakers have on the roster today
