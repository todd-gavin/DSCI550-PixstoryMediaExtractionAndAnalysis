 Cruise Alakhnanda

After much awaited demand of local tourism department and  hoteliers, Cruise Service for promoting tourism among national and international tourists, was started and inaugurated by the UP Chief Minister, Yogi Aditya Nath  in September 2018. The demand was long pending as foreign tourists in majority were only visiting to Varanasi and Agra in Uttar Pradesh for tourism. Since, the price of Cruise is higher than the economic reach of majority of locals, so it was introduced keeping in mind the inflow of foreign tourists . However, rich Indian also have been enjoying ride on Cruise named after Alakhnanda. After the winning of Narendra Modi as Lok Sabha MP from here and installation of his government at the Centre in 2014, the UP tourism department geared up in this direction as a result of which, the service was flagged  off by the CM Yogi Aditya Nath  in 2018. This five star luxury bound Cruise, Alakhnanda takes tourists on ride for 84 ghats situated along the Ganges. A Jetty has been constructed at Khirkia ghat, close to Assi ghat in Varanasi.

This service is a joint initiative of  the UP Tourism department  and a company of Kolkata .  Cruise was brought here through the waterway on Ganges, en-route- Patna to Varanasi. Snacks, tea, coffee etc are served during the ride. The Prime Minister, considering the plying of Cruise on Ganges as the need of hour for visiting international tourists and to promote it more, had talked to the anchors of a TV channel by travelling in the Alakhnanda Cruise during 2019 General Elections.
