Pervez Musharraf's family said the former Pakistan President is critical and "recovery is not possible", indicating that he is unlikely to come out of hospital alive. Musharraf steered Pakistan when the country was in a very critical phase after the 9/11 attacks. He alligned with the US and tried to purge the Pakistan army from extremist elements. He managed to reach at an understanding with India over Kashmir but didnt have enough political capital left the make the understanding into an agreement. 

In India he will always be known as yhe architect of the Kargil misadventure which resulted in Pakistan's embarassment in the world community.
