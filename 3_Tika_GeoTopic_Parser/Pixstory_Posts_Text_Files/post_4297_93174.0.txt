I can freely speak for my team and the organization that this season was not at all what we expected.  Through it all, we remained resilient and fought until the end.  Today, I want to take some time to appreciate what I have accomplished throughout my career. While it has had its ups and downs, the numbers I have produced and my place in history I will always be proud of and hold dearly in my heart.  Never wait for someone else to validate your success and sense of achievement.  We are the ones who should give ourselves our flowers and let everything else be a bonus.
