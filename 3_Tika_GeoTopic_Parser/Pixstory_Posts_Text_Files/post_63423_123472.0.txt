Manchester United are looking to complete the signature of Adrien Rabiot after agreeing a £15m deal with Juventus subject to negotiations of personal terms between player’s agent and mother, Veronique. 

The French midfielder has emerged as a top target for the Red Devils who are looking to bolster their enfeebled midfield department ahead of the current campaign. Barcelona’s Frankie De Jong has been United’s primary midfield recruitment option during the summer and with the Dutch man valued at €65m plus €20m in add-ons but the players deferred wages at Barcelona coupled with the President’s loath to release the player has ensured that the transfer is stalled. 

The Erik Ten-Hag-managed side - who began their Premier League season with a 2-1 defeat at home to Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday - are now switching their attention to the 27-year-old Rabiot as a midfield alternative. 

The former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder won 5 Ligue 1 titles during his stint with the Parisian giant adding a Serie A title to his record at Juventus. He has also featured in 129 games for the Old Lady in the space of 3 years while having 29 international caps. 

Manchester United are also looking to revitalise their attacking unit before the closure of the transfer window by adding Bologna’s Marko Arnautovic for a fee in the region of £10m.
