An auto driver and two of his associates kidnapped and raped a 23-year-old woman while she was on her way to the Kavi Nagar police station with her mother and brother's identity cards around 1 a.m. on April 1. The woman was out on the streets at that hour because the Kavi Nagar police station's SHO and a sub-inspector had threatened to put her mother and brother in jail if she did not quickly present their identity documents in response to a cheating accusation. 
Following an internal investigation, Ghaziabad SSP Muniraj G suspended SHO Anand Prakash Mishra and SI Ichharam on Friday.
