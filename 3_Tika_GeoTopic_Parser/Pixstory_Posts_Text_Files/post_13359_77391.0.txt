Amna Yousefi, Maryam Bazrans and Maryam Sharifi are three students who went to the farthest districts of Badakhshan after the gates of the universities were closed and set up a school to provide education for the deprived girls of Badakhshan.
The Taliban closed the gates of girls' schools and universities to girls after taking control of Afghanistan.
Maryam Bazrans, a third-year student at Kabul University's Faculty of Economics, opened a school for girls, which offers 120 girls free of charge.
Following the outbreak of the Corona virus and the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, the girls of Badakhshan have been barred from attending school, and the school will remain open until the gates of girls' schools open.
Taliban officials recently promised that girls' schools would reopen next spring.
