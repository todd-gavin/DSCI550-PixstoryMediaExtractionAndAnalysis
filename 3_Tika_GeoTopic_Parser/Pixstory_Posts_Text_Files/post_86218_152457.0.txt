Warmth is in the air.
As I scroll through social media, I see families reuniting to celebrate this occasion; the delicious sweets, the warmth of home, happiness filled pictures, traditional attire, colors and celebration. 
However, I know somewhere someone is away from home, weighed down by the heartache from separation, missing the home made food, longing to be teleported home. 
To each one of you,"Happy Navratri"
