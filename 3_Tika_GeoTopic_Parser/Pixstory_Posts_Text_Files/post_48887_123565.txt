I have seen this thing way too many times About time it is addressed Men acting like they are oppressed or are entitled to women fighting for them when they barely even look at us like we re human beings has to be the most ironic thing ever I don t know how many times feminists have to say this but we re not playing on a leveled field Women are dying on a daily basis and the women who are not at that extreme level of danger are facing sexism everyday of their life Be it at home at their workplace or even walking down the street to the supermarket we are safe nowhere And after all of this we are expected to SOLELY carry the burden of fighting for everyone while men sit back and relax UNTIL it s a woman talking about her issues They have no care for the male victims until they see a woman talking about how she deserves to be treated like a human too It s unfair to overwhelm us with the burden of the entire humanity when men can t take responsibility even of their own likes Men jump up with not all men every time a woman is brutalized and they are asked to help spread awareness They can t keep their sexist homies in check because that s not their responsibility but women are expected to not only talk about their issues but also actively fight for them while they do nothing At least do some of your work
