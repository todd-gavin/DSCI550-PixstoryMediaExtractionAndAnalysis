O Sorrow Why dost borrow The natural hue of health from vermeil lips To give maiden blushes To the white rose bushes Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips O Sorrow Why dost borrow The lustrous passion from a falcon eye To give the glow worm light Or on a moonless night To tinge on siren shores the salt sea spry O Sorrow Why dost borrow The mellow ditties from a mourning tongue To give at evening pale Unto the nightingale That thou mayst listen the cold dews among O Sorrow Why dost borrow Heart s lightness from the merriment of May A lover would not tread A cowslip on the head Though he should dance from eve till peep of day Nor any drooping flower Held sacred for thy bower Wherever he may sport himself and play To Sorrow I bade good morrow And thought to leave her far away behind But cheerly cheerly She loves me dearly She is so constant to me and so kind I would deceive her And so leave her But ah she is so constant and so kind John Keats
