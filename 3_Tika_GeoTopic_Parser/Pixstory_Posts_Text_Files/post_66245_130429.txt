 You should be instantly suspicious of anyone who claims to have understood Tenet after having watched it just once Heck you should doubt their every word even if they say they ve seen it thrice Enigmatic to a fault and exhaustingly dense Christopher Nolan s latest sci fi spectacle leaves you with the unshakable feeling that you walked into the screening minutes late Like the director s previous smash hits Inception and to a lesser degree Interstellar Tenet demands repeat viewings but crucially doesn t encourage them The thought of having to sit down and be lectured to Nolan s preferred form of exposition doesn t seem all that compelling right now Although I can t imagine not giving it another go when the world calms down The stakes are astronomical a mysterious new technology poses a threat to all existence there are murmurs of a Third World War But here s the kicker the tech hasn t been invented yet It will be in the future though and the CIA has caught wind of it What unfolds is essentially Nolan s version of a Cold War espionage thriller less James Bond more John le Carr Incidentally despite being significantly larger in scope Tenet is tonally very similar to Tomas Alfredson s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy a film that I despite having watched twice could not tell you the first thing about They even share the same cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema It requires an uncommon commitment from the audience Unlike Inception or even Dunkirk unconventionally structured movies that took you along for the ride Tenet on several occasions leaves you in the dust And then to make matters worse it berates you for not being able to keep up While it is understandable for him to treat these minute details with the utmost gravity considering the many years that he has spent on the project Nolan confuses seriousness with sincerity For him these ideas are grounded in reality but for us they might as well be fantasy There is spectacle to be had here and at its best moments y
