After being decimated by the Golden State Warriors in Game of the NBA Finals the Boston Celtics will look to bounce back in Game on Wednesday night Limit turnovers When they take care of the ball they win When they don t take care of the ball they don t win They re including seven straight wins when they turn the ball over fewer than times For example they only had turnovers in Game against Golden State and were able to walk away with a win Perform better in the third quarter The third quarter has not been kind to the Celtics so far this series In Game they were outscored in the third even though they were ultimately able to pull out a win behind an incredible fourth quarter performance In Game they were outscored in the third quarter In total they ve been outscored by points in the two third quarters combined The Warriors are a notoriously dangerous third quarter team but Boston simply needs to be better in that frame This issue isn t limited to just this series after all The Celtics have been outscored by at least points four times in the third quarter in these playoffs including in Game of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat They were outscored by points in the third quarter of that game
