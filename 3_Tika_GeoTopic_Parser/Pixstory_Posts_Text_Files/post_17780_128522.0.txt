What a proud mother Angelina Jolie is!
With "Without Blood," the Eternals actress, 46, is back in the director's seat. She enthused about working with her two kids, Maddox, 21, and Pax, 18, who contributed to the Salma Hayek movie as assistant directors. On Wednesday, August 17, she told People, "We get along wonderfully." It felt natural since, at its finest, a film crew resembles a large family.

As the director's point person for various departments, Maddox and Pax had the opportunity to engage with their Oscar-winning mother while the movie was being made. As his mother added, "[He] worked hard," Pax, who previously collaborated with Angelina on her 2017 drama First They Killed My Father, earned an extra dose of admiration.

An adaptation of the "Without Blood" story by Alessandro Baricco, the film stars Salma and Demi√°n Bichir. First They Killed My Father was Angelina's last project as a director. She told the publication, "The book made an impact on me as it had on so many other people." It contains topics and issues that are crucial to examine, she continued. "I'm honoured to be here in Italy to bring this very special material to film, and to have been entrusted by Alessandro Baricco with the adaptation of his book," she told Variety in June while filming the movie in Europe. "With its unique poetry and emotion and way of looking at war, and the questions it poses about what we search for after trauma, loss, or injustice."

Together with her ex-husband Brad Pitt, Angelina is a co-parent to Maddox, Pax, Zahara, 17, Shiloh, 16, and the twins Vivienne and Knox, 13. Angelina and Brad are now engaged in a legal dispute in which she is vying for full custody of the children. The actress from Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is requesting the current shared custody agreement. The renowned ex-couples were initially rumoured to be dating in 2005. The couple wed in August 2014 but divorced two years later.
