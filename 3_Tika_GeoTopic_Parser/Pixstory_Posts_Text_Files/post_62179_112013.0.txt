Meditation directly relieves stress and anxiety issues, which can have an impact on biological processes, especially digestion. 

When stressed, our body is no longer focusing on its regular functions, which incudes digestion. Everything takes a back seat to our bodyâ€™s survival instinct in response to the urgency of our source of stress. 

This can lead to serious issues throughout our digestive tract, such as inflammation, acid reflux, ulcers and even food allergies.

 By calming our body and mind, meditation helps us escape our stressed state, thereby enabling deep relaxation so that our whole body, including our digestion, can improve.

Meditation is the jack of all trades that can help you through anything. This is just one of the ways you can change your life through meditation
