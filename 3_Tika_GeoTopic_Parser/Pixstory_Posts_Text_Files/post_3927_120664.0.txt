As we celebrate the breastfeeding week this week let's get to know what are the Do's and Dont's that the parent needs to know. 

Do's 

• Meet up with a lactation specialist.  

A lactation specialist can guide you through the process and they can help you get the process easier. There are also specialists in almost every area and there are also support groups for mums that are lactating.  

• Have patience.  

It takes sometime to get used with the sensation of breastfeeding. The baby might first refuse the nipple at first. Don't stress out yourself as it will affect the milk production. 

• Feed your baby 8-10 times in a 24 hour period. 

Consistent production and getting nourishment and staying hydrated is necessary. Also ask your doctor the number of time you will need to feed your baby. 

• Eat a few extra hundred calories a day. 

By eating some extra calories and some green leafy vegetables it will give the mother enough energy to produce a great deal of milk. 

Dont's 

• Bring your breast to your baby.  

Instead of taking the baby towards one. It's better to support the baby's spine and cradle the baby comfortably at the base of the head and guide the baby towards your body. 

• Shove your breast in your baby’s mouth. 

By doing this your baby will much of the breast as it can comfortably.  

• Get discouraged.  

If it hurts while providing milk, keep in mind that it will take sometime to build on the pain tolerance and get the right positioning. 

• Teach your baby to nipple feed.  

For the process to be pain free, easier and a bonding experience, teach your baby to nurse from one's breast by ensuring that the nipple is place between baby's hard and soft palette.
