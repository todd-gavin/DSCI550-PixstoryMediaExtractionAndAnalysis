Last night visited this beautiful place Ardour 2.1 Restaurant , Connaught Place Delhi .

 Ardor is a two-floor restaurant cum lounge that has borrowed traces of the British architecture reflects a colonial feel.
We had a huge digital thaali with a lot of dishes in it , i hardly finished themm😋👌🏻along with chocolate brownie icecream and pizzaa🫶( my love❤️) 
Also , All left over food goes to the NGO and that’s  the best part about it. 
The soothing music, ambience and quality of food is just wow. 
I would love to visit again and enjoy Indian meal.❤️❤️🤤
