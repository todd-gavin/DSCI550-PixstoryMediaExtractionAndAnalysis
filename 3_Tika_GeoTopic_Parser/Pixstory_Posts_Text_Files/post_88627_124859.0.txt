During the World War II , the Nazis occupied Netherlands. Inorder to save the natives of Netherlands from the Nazis ,  the Oversteegen sisters along with their friend Hannie Schaft turned out to become fierce resistance fighters. 
All three of them , were in their teens. And they would dress up in their best attires and put heavy make-up on and went to the bar. 
In their , they would start conversation with the Nazi men and the other Dutch officials. Then they would pick their suspected targets and lead them to the woods. And while in the woods  , they used to assassinate these Nazi soldiers and they also collected other vital information from such soldiers. 
And  they also  used to wreck bridges and other pathways , so as to block further Nazi invasion and to block upcoming projects of the Nazi federation. 
The Oversteegen sisters survived the war but Hannie was executed by the Nazis around three weeks before the war came to an end.
