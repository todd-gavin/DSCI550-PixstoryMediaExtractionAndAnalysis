A grandmother is a little bit parent, a little bit teacher and always a best friend.

She asked me to comb her hair today. While I was combing her hair, she told me that combining my hair doesn't hurt. I have no idea when or how you combined my hair. Always come over to comb my hair. And then she began telling me stories from my childhood about how I was mischievous and fought with the girls next door. 

I enjoy it when she tells me stories about my homeland when everything was peaceful and no one was separated from their loved ones.
