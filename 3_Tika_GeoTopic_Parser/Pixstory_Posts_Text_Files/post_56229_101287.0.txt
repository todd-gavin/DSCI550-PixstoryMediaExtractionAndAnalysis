The Royal Mint has released a commemorative 50p celebrating the 50th anniversary of Pride UK. The coin stands for the first time the LGBTQ+ community of Britain has been celebrated on official UK coinage, this shows the broader commitment of the royal mint to diversity and inclusion. The coin has been designed by Dominique Holmes, an east London artist, writer, and LGBTQ+ activist with a varied artistic background that includes tattoo artistry.

The design implies values of protest, visibility, unity, and equality in rainbows. With state-of-the-art colour printing technology, the iconic colours of the Pride progression flag are recreated with special-edition colour versions of the silver and BU coins.

Since 1972 when first the official Pride UK event, the Pride UK movement has been of significant political and cultural importance. Now in its 50th year, Pride UK is more popular than ever and continues to fight against societal intimidation and stand up for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community.

The 50p will not enter circulation but will be accessible to purchase via The Royal Mint website this summer. The range includes gold, silver, and uncirculated versions.

Today, LGBT citizens have most of the same legal rights as non-LGBT citizens and the UK provides one of the outstanding degrees of liberty in the world for its LGBT communities, although the UK has recently fallen behind other countries in international rankings. In ILGA-Europe's 2015 review of LGBTI rights, the UK received the highest score in Europe, with 86% progress toward "respect of human rights and full equality" for LGBT people and 92% in Scotland alone. Meanwhile, 86% of the UK agreed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center poll, and a 2017 poll showed that 77% of British people support same-sex marriage.
