This Transfer window looks so good for the Juventus F.C .

After the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo from the club and injury of the star stiker Federico Chiesa the performance is not upto Club expectations. 

The Best two transfers this season for the old lady are - 

• Ángel Di María  - Free agent 
 (34 years old ) 

 The former PSG player Is now the part of Juventus. The Argentinie agreed for 1 year contract as PSG now have Lionel Messi to take his place. 

• Paul Pogba - Free agent 
 (29 years old )

After the worst season of The Red devils and the elimination from the UCL cup. The 29 year old Midfielder decided to go back to the club where he belongs. 

-According to me this must be one of the best transfer so far this season.
 Looking forward to some magical football by these two players, 

What are your views about this transfer , let me know in the Notes.
