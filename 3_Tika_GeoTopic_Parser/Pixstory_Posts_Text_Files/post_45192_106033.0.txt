The Reds have revealed who they will be letting go this summer, with the Belgian
forward and German goalkeeper among those heading for the exits. Liverpool has
announced their retained list at the end of the 2021-22 campaign, with it confirmed that
Divock Origi and Loris Karius will be among those released by the Reds as free agents.

The Premier League heavyweights are allowing seven players to move on in total, with
four senior staffs departing alongside three from the academy ranks.

Origi and Karius are the mist notable names to be heading through the exits, with the
Belgian forward who netted in the Reds’ triumphant 2019 Champions League final and
the German goalkeeper who flopped in the European showpiece 12 months prior to that
now looking to land contracts elsewhere.

Will Origi be remebered fondly at Liverpool?

The Reds have said in their official website of the man who secured cult hero status on
the back of the continental derby day heroics, “Eight years after a agreeing a move to
Anfield from Lille, Origi will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of June.”

“The striker began his Reds career in earnest 2015 - having remained in France for a
season long loan with Lille and would go on to be involved in some of the most iconic
and important moments in the club’s modern history.”

What about Karius?

The 28-year-old shot stopper fluffed his lines badly in the 2018 Champions League final
with Real Madrid but Liverpool have said of him, “Karius joined Liverpool from FSV
Mainz 05 and went onto play 49 games under Klopp during his first two seasons at
Merseyside. He started every Champions League game in 2017-18 campaign as
Kloppe’s men surged to the final in Kyiv.”

are Sheyi Ojo and Ben Woodburn.
