For me, lyrics can make or break a song, and the feel of a song can radically shift my mood. It depends on the situation, but I prefer music lyrics since they tell a story and give the song significance. I place a higher value on music that isn't just catchy or a "banger," but also moves me and connects me with my thoughts/feelings through finely penned lyrics. Lyrics carry so much of the song in them. Stories, ideas, and raw emotions are all part of the package. But what's fascinating is how much a song can make one person feel, while the person next to them may be utterly unaware if they aren't paying attention to the lyrics.

Bad lyrics are a deal breaker for me. A song can have great beats – and sometimes that's enough to enjoy it – but carelessly handled lyrics put me off. I need to really connect to a song to be able to enjoy it truly. It's always fascinating to me how people put random words together and turn them into such heart touching masterpieces.
