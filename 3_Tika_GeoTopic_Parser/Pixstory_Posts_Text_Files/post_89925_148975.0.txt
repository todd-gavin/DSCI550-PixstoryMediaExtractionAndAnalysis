In the past 25 years, Paul Clegg has travelled to several countries to watch the England football team play. He has already ticked three World Cups off his list and is now gearing up for his fourth in Qatar.
Lke the previous editions, he plans to track England's journey through the tournament and has purchased tickets for their matches all the way until the finals, if they qualify.
The only challenge for him is that he is not sure where he is going to sleep for most of the tournament.
"I've just booked a room for the first four nights and I am paying a lot for it. I haven't found any reasonably priced options, so I am not sure where will I be staying after that," he says.
Paul is not alone in his struggle - thousands of others are facing the same problem.
The BBC spoke to more than two dozen fans who still have not managed to book any accommodation. With less than two months to go, their concerns are growing.
The World Cup is expected to attract more than one million visitors, but by March Qatar only had 30,000 hotel rooms, 80% of which had already been booked by Fifa for football teams, officials, and sponsors.
To boost accommodation options, the organisers are offering shared rooms in empty apartments, villas, fan villages and traditional-style tents in the desert.
Two cruise ships are being converted into floating hotels that will be moored at Doha's port. All these measures are expected to add up to 70,000 rooms to the market.
In a statement to the BBC, the country's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said the Gulf state would deliver up to 130,000 rooms in time for the tournament.
"This is a comfortable inventory for fans, teams and sponsors travelling to the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022," it added.
Despite this announcement, accommodation options on the ground in Qatar are scant and expensive.
Refabricated cabins at so-called fan villages built in the desert on the outskirts of Doha are being sold as a budget option.
