Excuse me Choosing to demonize any nation its people who have suffered at the hands of autocrats war mongers and conflict is so incredibly harmful We must not forget that Afghans including my family fled a peaceful Afghanistan when the Soviets invaded That invasion is what led to decades of conflict violence instability occupation This narrative is what makes people turn away at the suffering of some As if anyone from Iraq or Afghanistan or anyone anywhere deserves or we should accept violence and bloodshed thrust onto them Afghans have been watching everything unfold in horror standing with Ukraine its people and President Zelensky What we are witnessing is terrifying and we deeply understand the suffering and trauma that comes with war Afghans stand with Ukrainians
