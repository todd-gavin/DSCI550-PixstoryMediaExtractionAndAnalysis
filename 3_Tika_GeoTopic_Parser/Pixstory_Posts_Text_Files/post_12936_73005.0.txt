VARUN DHAWAN 

Varun Dhawan portrayed the protagonist in the film Badlapur, portraying the character of a psychotic, depressed son and brother, who seeks cold-blooded vengeance. It was a role that needed Varun to immerse himself in the character to the point where he actually felt depressed. Varun Dhawan was caught off guard by the unexpected turn of events.
 He stated that he was suffering from depression during shooting the film.

“I was depressed. I was not clinically declared depressed but I was heading there. I was very sad to a certain degree. I don't want to use the term 'depression' loosely because it's a serious illness. It definitely effected my mental health. I was prescribed and did see a doctor for it as well.”

Speaking about what caused depression, Varun had to say, “I don’t know. But maybe because I am young and I had not seen the things I got to see during the making of Badlapur. I think, that is why it hit me harder than it would affect a person older than me.”
