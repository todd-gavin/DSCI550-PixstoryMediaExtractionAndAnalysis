According to new study, some workouts can aid people with muscular dystrophy.
Muscular dystrophy is a severe condition that causes skeletal muscular weakening and disintegration, which increases over time. Certain activities, according to a group of University of Maine researchers, may assist strengthen muscles afflicted by muscular dystrophy, and they discovered this by activating zebrafish and watching them exercise.
Because of the genetic similarities between zebrafish and human muscles, zebrafish are a useful test model for muscular dystrophy. Zebrafish may also be developed with a mutation that closely resembles Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a severe form of the disease that affects young boys.
Because zebrafish are unable to lift weights, UMaine researchers adopted a technique known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), which involves stimulating particular neurons to cause muscle contraction. The NMES regimens were created by the researchers and named after four popular weight-lifting routines: power, strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. After that, the zebrafish were placed in an underwater 3D printed "gym" with tunnels and electrodes, and the researchers examined their skeletal muscles to see how they had altered.

The study found that while each of the NMES weight lifting "routines" affected the zebrafish neuromuscular junction morphology, swimming and survival differently, only one -- the endurance neuromuscular stimulation (eNMES) -- improved all three, as long as it was accompanied by a certain antioxidant, heme oxygenase, and a receptor called integrin alpha7.

The study was published March 24, 2022, in the journalÂ ELife. The research suggests that the right type of resistance training might be beneficial to human patients with muscular dystrophy. There is also potential for NMES to improve mobility and strength in patients with muscular dystrophy, though not much is known about applying the technology this way.
