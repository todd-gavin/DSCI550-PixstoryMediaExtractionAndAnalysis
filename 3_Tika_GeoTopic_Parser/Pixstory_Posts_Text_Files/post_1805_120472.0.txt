Victoria Woodhull was a leader of the women's suffrage movement. She was the first woman to own a brokerage firm on Wall Street, the first woman to start a weekly newspaper, and an activist for women's rights and labor reform. At her peak of political activity in the early 1870s, Woodhull is best known as the first woman candidate for the United States presidency, which she ran for in 1872 for the Equal Rights Party, supporting women's suffrage and equal rights.

Victoria had announced her candidacy in 1871. It would be 50 years before women could vote, but there was no law preventing women from running for office. She was nominated for President of the United States by the newly formed Equal Rights Party on May 10, 1872, and her nomination was ratified at the convention on June 6, 1872. They also nominated the former slave and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass for Vice President, but he never acknowledged the nomination.

Woodhull was arrested for her 'free love' philosophy. The arrest prevented her from attempting to vote in the 1872 presidential election, which was won by incumbent Ulysses S. Grant. 

Victoria said, "Rude contact with facts chased my visions and dreams quickly away, and in their stead I beheld the horrors, the corruption, the evils and hypocrisy of society, and as I stood among them, a young wife, a great wail of agony went out from my soul."

Victoria Woodhull was a popular and controversial figure in her day. In many ways she was ahead of her time and was an important trailblazer for women in generations to follow. She advocated for equal education for women, women's right to vote and women's right to control their own health decisions. Above all, she criticized the Victorian ideal of women's place being first and foremost in the home.
