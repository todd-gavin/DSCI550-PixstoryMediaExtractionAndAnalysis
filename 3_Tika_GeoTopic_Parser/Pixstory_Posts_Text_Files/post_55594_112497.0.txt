Fans of cult comedic duos, rejoice: Jane Turner and Gina Riley’s iconic Y2K-era sitcom, which ran for four seasons from 2002 to 2007 and included two stand-alone film outings (2005’s Da Kath & Kim Code and 2012’s Kath & Kimderella), is currently available on Netflix in its entirety, as per Vulture.

A suburban satire filmed with a mockumentary cinéma vérité lens—think This is Spinal Tap meets mall-walking Melbourne—Kath & Kim stars Turner as Kath Day-Knight, a brassy, fitness-loving empty nester, and Riley as Kim Craig, Kath’s romantically flighty, self-obsessed adult daughter. 

Broad, awkward, and goofy to the extreme, Kath & Kim is the ultimate slice (pun intended) of Australian television history. As a bonus: Already the ne plus ultra of mother-daughter cringe comedy, Kath & Kim manages nevertheless to up the absurdist ante with the fact that Turner and Craig are just one year apart in age — a surreal detail echoed by one of today’s own cringe cult comedies, PEN15. It’s the circle of life!
