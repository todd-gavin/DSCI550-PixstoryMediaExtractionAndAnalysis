While Disney has been tight-lipped, CinemaCon guests are expected to receive a first look at James Cameron's highly anticipated Avatar sequels — the first of which is set to release on December 16 — during the confab's slate presentation on Wednesday. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the impact of Avatar on filmmaking, from production to distribution, cannot be overstated. With $2.84 billion in box office receipts, James Cameron's Avatar is the highest-grossing film of all time, and exhibitors are hoping for more of the same in the pandemic era. 

Avatar also contributed significantly to cinematic innovation, from ushering in the digital 3D movie age to introducing new production techniques such as performance capture and virtual production.

When Avatar 2 is published, it is expected to be available in a variety of formats to accommodate a wide range of movie theatre setups in the United States and around the world, including 3D and 4K with a high frame rate of 48 frames per second. 

In fact, according to John Fithian, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners, at CinemaCon on Tuesday, there will be more versions of Avatar 2 than any other film "in the history of movies." "High resolution, high frame rates, 3D, IMAX, PLF, various sound systems, and 160 different languages are all on the table."
