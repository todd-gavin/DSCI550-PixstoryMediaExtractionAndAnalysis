All the rumours have finally been laid to rest surrounding the Bigg Boss 16 house as Salman Khan welcomed 16 contestants including one controversial name – Sajid Khan. ✅The director who was accused of #MeToo by not one but multiple actresses hasn’t been getting any work in the industry for the last four years. Tonight as Salman introduced him on the show, Sajid spoke about how success destroyed him and revealed how his credit was taken after he was convicted of the serious s*xual allegations against him. Now, netizens are reacting to it on social media While talking to Salman Khan on Bigg Boss 16, Sajid Khan said, “Last four years se main ghar par baitha hoon, not really getting much of work. Toh jab Colors ki team ne mujhe invite kiya to I just felt ki it’s time ki main ghar main bhi jaun, thoda apne baare me bhi sikhu.” 💯Sajid Khan continued, “Maine zindagi main bohot utaar-chadav dekhein hai. Pichhle chaar salon main bohot niche…” Salman Khan then interrupts the director and smirkily adds, “Ek hi utaar dekha hai. Baaki chadav hi chadav dekhein hain. “ The Houseful director then adds, “Ek bohot bada utaar dekha hain.” The host then mentioned Sajid working with A-list actors in Bollywood and becoming arrogant as you become successful at work. Acknowledging that, Sajid said, “Ek kahawat hai ‘Failure destroys people’, mere case main ‘Success destroyed me’. Main bohot arrogant ho gaya tha, back-to-back teen hits thi… toh I thought I had become infallible, main koi galat film bana hi nahi sakta. Arrogant statements de raha tha, upar wale ne phat karke jhapad maara ‘Himmatwala’ niche… thoda sa humble hua phir se jhapad maara aur ‘Humshakals’ niche. Humshakal ke baad to maine apni shakal hi chhupa di.”
