With almost 40% of their population being vegetarian, Indians have mastered the art of plant based cooking. There's nothing you wouldn't find there, and there's not much one needs to say about the vast cuisine of that land. One of my favorite such dish is the Soya Chaap. It's a popular north Indian delicacy, a sort of mock meat. Mouth wateringly delicious and very healthy too.
All of the necessary amino acids that our body requires are present in soy chaap, making it a good source of protein. Additionally, it is a good source of iron and dietary fibre. Soya chaap is also low in fat and cholesterol, making it a healthy option for those who love meat but don't want to consume all those calories with it.
And would you believe if I said it contains more protein than meat? The most reliable sources of protein have traditionally been thought to be milk, meat, and eggs, but plant-based sources are equally as, if not more, protein-rich. Soya contains a substantial 36 gm of protein per 100 gm, with pea protein at 26 gm per 100 gm and Mycoprotein (protein derived from fungi) at 11 gm per 100 gm, which is still higher than the protein content of milk. In comparison, chicken, meat, milk, and eggs contain 27 gm, 26 gm, 3.4 gm, and 13 gm of protein per 100 gm, respectively. With a 63% protein content, algae are a great source of protein as well.
