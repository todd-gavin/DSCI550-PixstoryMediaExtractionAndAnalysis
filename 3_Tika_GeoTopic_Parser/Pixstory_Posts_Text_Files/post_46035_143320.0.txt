The decision by the monarchy to send redundancy letters to select employees at King Charles III's former royal house this week was criticised as "callous" by a British trade group on Wednesday. TOI reported that during a prayer session for the late Queen Elizabeth II on Monday in Edinburgh, it is alleged that up to 100 Clarence House employees—some of whom had been there for decades—received the notices. It comes after Charles's Thursday ascension to the throne following the passing of his mother, which required him to renounce his duchy of Cornwall estate and prince of Wales title. His office has now announced that those operations, which were previously managed out of the Clarence House residence, will end. The development was first reported on Tuesday by The Guardian newspaper.A spokeswoman for Clarence House said "as required by law, a consultation process" had begun following last week's accession. "Our staff have given long and loyal service and, while some redundancies will be unavoidable, we are working urgently to identify alternative roles for the greatest possible number of staff," she added. What do you think about this decision?
