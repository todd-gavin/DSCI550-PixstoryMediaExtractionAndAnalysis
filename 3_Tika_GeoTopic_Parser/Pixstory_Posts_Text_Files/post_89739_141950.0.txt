Plasma spark generators are simple electronic circuits designed to exhibit a high-power pulse circuit, which stores incoming electrical energy from the ignition system and releases the stored energy in a powerful pulse of power. They are commonly used in designing electric bug zappers to exterminate pests & insects from common households and offices. So, In todayâ€™s project, we are going to go over a step-by-step procedure on how to create a Plasma Spark Generator, using a 4V DC Battery & a small number of other components.
