Disney's Broadway adaptation of the movie brings the fantastical world of streetwise hero Aladdin, his love Princess Jasmine, his evil nemesis Jafar and his magical sidekick the Genie to the Great White Way. With beloved songs from the film's acclaimed soundtrack, this high-energy, visually stunning musical is directed by The Book of Mormon's Casey Nicholaw.

You can watch the musical on New Amsterdam theater throughout the week except on Mondays. 

Join the cast of ALADDIN on stage at the legendary New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City for an immersive performance of “Friend Like Me.”

The show’s music was written by 8-time Oscar winner, Alan Menken, including “A Whole New World”, which won the Academy Award® for Best Original Song.

Featuring an extended tap break, glittering gold costumes and massive towers designed in art deco style, the musical number “Friend Like Me” is an homage to Busby Berkeley’s 1933 classic movie musical 42nd Street.
