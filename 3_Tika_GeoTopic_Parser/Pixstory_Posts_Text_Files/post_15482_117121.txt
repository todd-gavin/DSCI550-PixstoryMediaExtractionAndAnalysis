In the end, the uninhabited village of Savogno in Valtellina is not even that high up. A little less than meters away. Yet the sensations you will have after having traveled the steep mule track that connects it to Borgonuovo di Piuro six hundred meters further downstream are almost Tibetan. Austere and gray Savogno is not it has seen a living soul on a permanent basis for decades but hikers and nature lovers meet here more luxuriant and overbearing than ever Its stone walls contrast with the delightful wooden loggias and the houses do not seem abandoned for decades Built far from the stables they reveal attention rare for those years And of great dignity are also the simple church of Sant Antonio Abate the tiny cemetery the beautiful portals of the houses, some from the fifteenth century and an old washhouse Don Luigi Guanella recently proclaimed a saint by Benedict XVI spent many years there leaving ample traces of his operates from to Today this ancient village that never saw roads and therefore cars abandoned in wears a beautiful chestnut forest as its crown The grape press the old elementary school that has become a welcoming refuge a poignant panorama are the reward for the steps you will have walked to get there A mule track that kisses the rock and surprisingly doesn&#39;t take your breath away at least in summer When dozens of people from Savogna return to the village to meet again to celebrate the rituals of a community lost for almost fifty years Just as the old rivalry with the less well-off Dasile has been lost, also abandoned some kilometer further north The postcard that leaves Savogno in the heart is that of a pastoral and inviolate nobility never disheveled by time and for this reason fascinating and definitively beautiful Like an eternal gem These are the words of Antonio Mocciola writer who with Archeoclub D Italia is making a journey into the Paese dei Borghi Fantasma From his book My sleeping beauties starts the narration of a less known but very beautiful territory, a true tourist heritage for today&#39;s Italy
