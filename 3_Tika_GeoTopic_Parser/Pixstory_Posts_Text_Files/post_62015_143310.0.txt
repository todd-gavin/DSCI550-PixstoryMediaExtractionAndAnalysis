Robert Lewandowski made a quick exit at the Allianz Arena after enduring a difficult night as Bayern Munich sealed a 2-0 win over Barcelona in the Champions League.
Lewandowski, meanwhile, was back at the Allianz Arena for the first time since his €50 million (£42.5m) to Barcelona this summer.
But Lewandowski was unable to make an impact against his former club as a glaring miss from close range by his standards in the 18th minute set the tone for a miserable evening.
According to Bild, Lewandowski left the stadium quickly after Barca’s defeat, while his only words to reporters after the game were, ‘it wasn’t that easy’.
Meanwhile, Xavi said he is ‘angry and proud’ after the loss to Bayern Munich and believes his Barcelona side did not deserve to lose the game.
‘I think we were better in many ways, we matched them physically, we dominated the ball. But you can’t let them off that much. The feeling is that you dominate, but you lose. Learning is hard,’ said Xavi.
‘I’m angry. Angry and proud too. We were better, but this is about winning. They are already built [as a team] and we’re in the process. We have to improve.
‘The result is bad. The process is very good. You have to minimise errors. We failed a lot, there was a lack of effectiveness. The game was very good, but I’m upset, it was an opportunity to win in this place once and for all.
‘I don’t like losing and we didn’t deserve it. I think we were better. I’m trying to be honest, we dominated and subdued them.
‘We learn from our mistakes. Unfortunately, that’s the way it is. What happens to us in the corner or in the counter-attack cannot happen to us.
‘You leave with a 2-0 which is not what happens on the pitch, but this is the Champions League.
‘We have to keep the positive things. The result is totally negative and we have to learn from our mistakes. It is a step backwards. The defeat is not deserved but it is due to our mistakes.’
