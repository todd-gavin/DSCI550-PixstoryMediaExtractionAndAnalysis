Tottenham is set to make Tanguy Ndombele train alone this summer when he returns from Lyon. The club’s record signing rejoined his old side in January on loan to buy a deal that has an option to become permanent in the summer.

A source has agreed that they do not expect Lyon to trigger the 50 million pound option in Ndombele’s loan deal and he is in line to head back to his parent club while his future is sorted.

The midfielder does not figure in Antonio Conte’s plans and another transfer saga is expected in the upcoming transfer window.

Conte stopped the French international training with the first team and made him work independently before his Lyon loan. A repeat of that set-up is expected when the stars return from pre-season training in the summer.

The 25-year-old has made 14 appearances for Lyon since joining the club in January.

These outings have yielded one goal and two assists.

After immediately being thrown into the starting XI upon his return to his former side, Ndombele’s game time has diminished in recent weeks.

He played the full 90 minutes in Lyon’s first three Europa League knockout games but was hauled off at half-time in April’s 3-0 home loss to West Ham United.

He has only started one Ligue 1 game since his side crashed out of the Europa League and was not included in the matchday squad for the three games immediately after the loss.

Ndombele has scored 10 goals in 91 appearances for the Spurs. Two of them came in the 13 appearances he made in the first half of the season.
