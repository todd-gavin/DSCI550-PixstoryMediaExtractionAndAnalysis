All this legend has now faded out so far as the people of the locality are concerned It can be found only in books after painstaking effort The legend needs to be publicly displayed for the benefit of the tourist So far as the relics are concerned carved slabs of large size and architectural fragments of all kinds are found in plenty often built into the walls of the houses votive stupas of different sizes are seen in number on the edge of the large tank adjoining the village on the south where they now serve as washerman s stones as well as in other Places and great quantities of large bricks of ancient make are still being dug out of the great mound south of the village Cunningham mentions that The monastery of the Cock s foot Hill is now represented by a high mound about feet square to the north of the village This mound is called Sugatagarh or Buddha s house Sugata being one of the well known titles of the Buddha But the most extensive remains lie to the south of the village where they form a mass about feet square Here numerous Buddhist Statues were dug up by Major Kittoe and myself and at a latter date by Mr Broadley Several of these I have described in my former report But numbers of figures still remain to attest the former importance of the Buddhist establishment of Kukkuta pada giri I have a record in my note book of figures now collected together at and near the temple of Bagheshwari I found also ten inscriptions of about AD to of which one was set up by two Sakya mendicants from Kanchi Kanchi vasika or Conjeevaram To be continued
