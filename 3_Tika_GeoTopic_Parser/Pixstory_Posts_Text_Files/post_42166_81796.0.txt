Haha, planning for good time with your better half but lockdown spilt water over it. No worries, love is about the connection and not the distance so wish your loved ones via online mode, can soend time virtually. Since its more important to enjoy there presence not physically but the presence of their sweet voice, gentleness, care and concern and their sweet cute little gestures that drives you crazy. Wishing all loving ones Happy Valentine's Day !
