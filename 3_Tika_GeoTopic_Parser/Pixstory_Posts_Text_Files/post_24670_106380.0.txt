Former Italy captain and AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gettuso will be in role of Valencia's head coach. It is a great opportunity for the remarkable player to make his name as a coach, after leaving Napoli. At Napoli he failed to get European qualification, when they finished the season with a draw on the last day, finishing 5th, just 1 point behind Juventus. 



Gattuso : “I would like to work with players that have failed, with a profile almost of a loser, I like that profile, players that think that Valencia truly believes in them and that arrive with desire.”


He also added, he wants "Players that think that playing for Valencia is like playing at Real Madrid and Barcelona.”



Valencia were able to reach the Copa Del Rey final under manager Jose Bordalas. They lost in the final against Real Betis in penalties after the score stayed 1-1 till extra time. But in Laliga, they finished 9th, with 48 points from 11 wins and 15 draws. Spanish defender Jose Luis Gaya is the captain. Goncalo Guedes and Carlos Soler were top scorers with 11 goals last season. 


They have conceded 53 goals against 48 scored in the league, that might be the area Gettuso focuses on first in the season. Athletic Club, who finished 8th had scored only 43, but conceded 36, thus getting 7 goal difference and Real Sociedad finished 6th with 40/37 (3 GD). The World cup winner with Italy and Champions league winner with AC Milan, well known for his ball retrieving abilities and hard tackles, Valencia will be coming out with a tougher defense in the next season.
