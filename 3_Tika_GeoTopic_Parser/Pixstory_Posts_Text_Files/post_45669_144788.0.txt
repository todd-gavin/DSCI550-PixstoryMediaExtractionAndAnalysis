The asteroid that a NASA spacecraft will intentionally collide with is growing closer. CNN reported that after being launched 10 months ago, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART mission, will collide with the space rock on September 26. To see how it influences an asteroid's speed in space, the spacecraft will crash into an asteroid's moon. At 5:30 p.m. ET that day, a live stream of images taken by the spacecraft will be accessible on NASA's website. The impact is predicted to happen at approximately 7:14 p.m. ET. Dimorphos, a tiny moon orbiting Didymos, a near-Earth asteroid, is the target of the expedition. According to NASA authorities, the asteroid system poses no threat to Earth, making it an ideal target for testing out a kinetic impact -- which may be needed if an asteroid is ever on track to hit Earth. The occasion will serve as the organization's first large-scale demonstration of planetary protection deflection technology.
