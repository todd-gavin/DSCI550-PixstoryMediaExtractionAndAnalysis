The adorable hero tree of a few words Groot is making his return in Marvel s latest upcoming animated series I am Groot One thing is for sure Vin Diesel is certainly doing a great job in saying just three words serious respect Debuting next month I Am Groot arrives on Disney on August There will be a collection of five shorts starring the Guardians of the Galaxy character in Marvel Studios second animated project after Marvel s What If Most likely functioning as a kind of anthology series the show is likely to follow the baby tree just enjoying his days off The trailer is as dumb fun as it gets showing baby Groot interacting with other miniscule alien life forms and providing them with nutrients from a leaf that he farts out The teaser trailer also showcases Marvel s brilliant visuals with I Am Groot possessing exceptional photorealistic animation style with an incredible attention to detail both in Groot itself and also on the landscape and other characters present in the background We can also expect to see a short story that takes place between the events of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol The series is as simple as it gets being childish adorable and fun possessing a concept infinitely more interesting than the likes of Ms Marvel and CGI a gazillion times better than the unrefined mess of She Hulk Disney finally seems to have landed themselves an interesting story different from the standard generic senseless nonsense they keep regurgitating out in the name of cheap entertainment Even though the premiere date of I Am Groot is close Disney is yet to provide further details from each of the short stories including a synopsis and possible guest stars So there s a chance we will get another more revealing trailer in the coming weeks
