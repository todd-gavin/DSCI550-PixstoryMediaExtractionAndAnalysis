The Parc des Princes outfit is unrivalled in France when it comes to squad investment, especially after a busy transfer window last summer.

Neymar and Lionel Messi are at the top of the list of highest Ligue 1 earners, which is entirely made up of PSG players.

Since Qatar Sports Investments' successful takeover of Parc des Princes in 2011, PSG has become one of the wealthiest clubs in the world of football.

Over the previous decade, marquee signings have become commonplace, and L'Equipe says that the squad is now worth €629 million (£525 million/$692 million) after the arrival of numerous more renowned names last summer, including Messi.

PSG has the highest pay in Ligue 1.

The French daily also produced a top 30 list of Ligue 1's highest pay for 2021-22, with Brazilian striker Neymar topping the list with €4 million in gross monthly earnings.

Messi, who joined PSG on a free transfer after leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2020-21 season, is in second place with €3.3 million, more than €1 million ahead of Kylian Mbappe in third. 
Fourth and fifth place go to Marquinhos and Marco Verratti, with Achraf Hakimi, Keylor Navas, Angel Di Maria, Georginio Wijnaldum, and Gianluigi Donnarumma rounding out the top ten.
