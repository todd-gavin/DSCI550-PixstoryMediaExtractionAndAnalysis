Po Jen Yang M D Ph D Weu Wang M D Abstract Background Limited studies have focused on diabetes relapse after metabolic surgery especially among Asians Objectives To identify the predictors of diabetes relapse following initial postoperative remission in Asia Setting Four tertiary hospitals Methods We assessed patients age yr body mass index BMI kg m with complete diabetes data before and and years after metabolic surgery A total of and patients had diabetes remission at and years after surgery Logistic regressions were performed to identify the independent predictors of diabetes relapse Two published predictive models for diabetes remission were also tested for relapse Results Of the patients with year diabetes remission experienced a relapse at years after surgery The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the ABCD score in predicting year remission year remission and year relapse were and while those of the DiaRem score were and respectively The baseline age BMI and insulin use were independent predictors for relapse The most powerful predictive model for relapse was composed of preoperative insulin use year A C and a change in BMI between the first and third year C statistic Conclusion The ABCD score predicted both mid term postoperative diabetes remission and relapse in Asians Initial older age lower BMI insulin use higher year A C and weight regain were independent predictors of relapse Personalized strategies should be proposed for those at risk of relapse to optimize diabetes outcomes after surgery Sources
