World Cup semi-finalists in 2018, European Championship runners-up last year, England were surfing a wave of optimism, but the wheels have come off spectacularly and they now look anything but potential winners in Qatar.
Friday’s 1-0 defeat in Italy relegated them from the Nations League top tier after a campaign in which they lost twice to Hungary - including 4-0 at Wembley - and once to Italy along with two scrambled draws.
Their only goal in five games was a late Harry Kane penalty against Germany and they will hardly be brimming with confidence for the return match at home on Monday.
Manager Gareth Southgate had a relatively settled side during the Euros, when England posed threats from all over the pitch and were solid at the back.
Sorry run
After this sorry run, however, there are only a handful of players who can be confident of making the starting 11 in Qatar and the coach now seems unsure of his best system.
His oft-quoted policy of picking on form has shown to be hollow after he started Harry Maguire on Friday despite the centre back barely getting a game at Manchester United.
His chopped and changed midfield failed miserably to get hold of the game - despite Declan Rice’s faintly bizarre claim that England had controlled it.
Jude Bellingham, still only 19 despite all his experience for Borussia Dortmund, probably did as much as anyone to enhance his World Cup prospects while Kane remains a world-class threat if he can stay fit and Reece James remains ever-reliable.
However, Raheem Sterling struggled for impact, as did Southgate’s undroppable favourite Bukayo Saka and ineffective substitute Jack Grealish.
Even the ultra-reliable Kyle Walker had an off night, giving Giacomo Raspadori way too much time to pick his spot from just inside the box and score the winner midway through the second half.
