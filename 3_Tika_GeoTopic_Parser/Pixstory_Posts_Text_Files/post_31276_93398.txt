Alzheimer&#39;s is one of those genetic diseases caused by mutations at the level of a single gene, i.e. in which a single nucleotide variant SNV Single Nucleotide Variants is sufficient to cause the genetic pathology The gene and mutation involved in the onset of Alzheimer&#39;s are currently known only half of these diseases Several large-scale studies called GWAS Genome wide association studies have uncovered information about single variants associated with a patient&#39;s propensity to get Alzheimer&#39;s but VNS cannot be used effectively for predictive purposes without considering the relationships between them and the potential relationships with other elements of the genome Just think that many subjects with a specific gene variant associated with Alzheimer&#39;s such as the mutation in the APOE gene do not develop the disease To understand how this can happen a team of researchers from the Department of Biology and Biotechnology Charles Darwin of Sapienza together with the Italian Institute of Technology IIT and other international research centers has used a machine learning approach to analyze the entire genomic profile of patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease and identify the genetic predispositions underlying the onset of pathology The results of the study conducted by the young researcher Magdalena Arnal in the Sapienza laboratory of Gian Gaetano Tartaglia were published in the journal Alzheimer s Dementia Diagnosis Assessment Disease Monitoring In particular, a subset of data was used to build the genomic profiles, built starting from two of the largest existing databases UK Biobank and ADNI In this way the researchers have identified six SVN variants in an area of the genome the chromosome which allow to identify a large number of individuals as potential Alzheimer&#39;s cases The next step for the researchers will be to identify new patterns involved in other diseases
