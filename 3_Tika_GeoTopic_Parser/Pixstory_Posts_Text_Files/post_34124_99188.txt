After the victory at Bentegodi against Hellas Verona Stefano Pioli spoke to DAZN I am very much in love with this Milan and my players a good victory but still missing another difficult one against Atalanta Even if you go down but you feel good on the pitch and you play well you believe even more in your qualities Now the last two steps are missing Two words for leao and tonali Young but strong I said it right away at the beginning of the year after days of vacation I found them completely different Sandro has incredible leg but he is demonstrating quality even in insertions I don&#39;t like talking about precise roles but he could also be a great midfielder All these positive performances are giving him even more awareness and confidence Talking to Sandro on the first day about which position to occupy on the pitch he told me Everyone compares me to Pirlo but I feel a little more Gattuso If we want to make a more complete comparison, perhaps he looks like De Rossi This Milan was born precisely in the humiliating defeat against Atalanta From there we figured out what to do It will be the end of a cycle
