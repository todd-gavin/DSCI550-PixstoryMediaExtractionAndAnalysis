Kobe Bryant's Vanessa took to social media to show her happiness after she was awarded USD 16 million as part of a USD 31 million jury verdict on Wednesday against Low Angeles County for deputies and firefighters sharing grisly photos of the NBA star, his 13-year-old daughter and other victims killed in a 2020 helicopter crash.
The nine jurors unanimously agreed with Vanessa and her attorneys that the photos invaded her privacy and caused emotional distress. She cried quietly as it was read.
Vanessa took to social media to hail the decision. "All for you! I love you! JUSTICE for Kobe and Gigi! #Betonyourself #MambaDay 8•24•22 #MambaMentality," she Instagrammed the message along with a picture of Kobe and daughter Gianna.
The jury deliberated 4 1/2 hours before reaching the verdict on Kobe Bryant Day, which is celebrated in LA on August 24 because it represents his jersey numbers - 8 and 24 - and is the day after his birthday. Tuesday would have been Bryant's 44th birthday.
An attorney for the county declined to comment on the verdict outside the courtroom.
The pictures were shared mostly between employees of the LA County sheriff's and fire departments including by some who were playing video games and attending an awards banquet. They were also seen by some of their spouses and in one case by a bartender at a bar where a deputy was drinking.
Vanessa Bryant tearfully testified during the 11-day trial that news of the photos compounded her still-raw grief a month after losing her husband and daughter, and that she still has panic attacks at the thought that they might still be out there.
