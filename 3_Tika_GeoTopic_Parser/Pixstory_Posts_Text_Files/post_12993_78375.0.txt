Ethnic diversity has been a major factor in the political upheaval and conflict in Afghanistan for more than a century, and the Taliban are expected to play a key role in forming a new government.

Pashtuns
Pashtuns make up more than 40 percent of Afghanistan's population, the country's ethnic majority. They are mostly Sunni Muslims and speak Pashto. This people has been in regular control of the government and the army since the 18th century.
The superior position of the Pashtuns, whose main residence is in the crescent-shaped regions from the border of Pakistan to the border of Iran in the east and south of the country, usually provokes a sense of criticism and dissatisfaction of other ethnic groups because they treat the Pashtuns politically, economically and They see a culture marginalized.

Tajiks

The second largest ethnic group in the country, which makes up about a quarter of the population, is Tajik, who speaks the Dari dialect. They are mainly present in the north and west of the country and have positions and fortifications in the Panjshir Valley, the city of Herat in the west and also in some northern provinces.
The Panjshir Valley is famous for its resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s and for its first Taliban rule. The site is home to the most prominent Tajik political and historical figure, Ahmad Shah Massoud, a hero of anti-Soviet resistance and the Taliban who was killed by a suicide bomber attributed to al-Qaeda on September 9, 2001, two days before the 9/11 attacks.

Hazaras

The Hazaras, who make up about 10 percent of Afghanistan's population and speak the Dari dialect, are of Central Asian Turkic descent and live mainly in the center of the country.
They are a Shiite minority who have been severely persecuted for centuries by various groups, especially the Taliban, who consider them heretics of Islam. The Hazaras have also been the target of deadly ISIL bombings and attacks.
