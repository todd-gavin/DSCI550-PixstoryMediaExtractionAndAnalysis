Yesterday, Real Madrid wins their 35th La Liga title and with that, Marcelo who plays for Real Madrid in a  Left Back position became the most decorated player in Real Madrid, which means in the history of Real Madrid, no other player win more trophies than Marcelo.

Including yesterday’s La Liga trophy, Marcelo won 24 trophies in total which includes,

1. 6 La Liga 
2. 4 Uefa Champions League
3. 3 Uefa Super Cup 
4. 4 Club World Cup 
5. 2 Copa Del Rey 
6. 5 Supercopa De Espana

Marcelo’s contract with Real Madrid will expire at the end of this season and both Marcelo and Real Madrid are in contention to win one more trophy which is Uefa Champions League. 

I wish that Marcelo will end his career at Real Madrid with a UCL trophy. It will be a perfect farewell for him.
