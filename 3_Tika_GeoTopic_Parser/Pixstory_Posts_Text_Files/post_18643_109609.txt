After the two tournaments won in Stuttgart and at Queen&#39;s Matteo Berrettini is also among the favorites of Wimbledon tournament in which last year he reached the final lost against Djokovic He could get far ahead in the draw but even if he were to win he would not receive any ATP points because the circuit in contrast to Wimbledon&#39;s decision to exclude Russian and Belarusian tennis players has decided that there will be no points for this Grand Slam And the serious thing for Berrettini who has had to miss several tournaments for surgery on his right hand Knowing that winning three tournaments in a row including a Grand Slam won&#39;t stop you from falling out of a bad place he said I decided to miss Roland Garros due to my injury because I wasn&#39;t ready and I didn&#39;t accelerate to make it If I had known earlier that there would be no points at Wimbledon up for grabs maybe I would have pushed I would have modified my program to recover some points In the standings I will inevitably go down but it won&#39;t break down It will be difficult but I know I can get back into the top because I&#39;ve done it before Let&#39;s say I feel disarmed It doesn&#39;t matter how I play in the end I will fall ranked Disagree with the decision of the organizers of the oldest tournament in tennis I didn&#39;t like that decision and still don&#39;t like it I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very fair They should have at least let the players know what was going on No one called us I know the situation complicated which is not right for Russians and Belarusians But when you are about to make such a decision with such serious consequences the least you can do listen to the players inform them in advance It should have been different
