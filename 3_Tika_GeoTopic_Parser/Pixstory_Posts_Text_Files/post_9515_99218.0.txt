External Actors in the Afghan Problem continues...

Pakistan’s attempts to influence the course of events in Afghanistan have been the most persistent. Two areas—North-West Frontier Province and Balochistan—have long been complicating Afghanistan’s relations with Pakistan.

Controversies involving these areas date back to the establishment of the Durand Line in 1893 dividing Pashtun and Baloch tribes living in Afghanistan from those living in what later became Pakistan.

Afghanistan vigorously protested the inclusion of Pashtun and Baloch areas within Pakistan without providing the inhabitants with an opportunity for self-determination. Since 1947, this problem has led to incidents along the border, with extensive disruption of normal trade patterns. In 1947, when Pakistan came into being, the government of Afghanistan did not recognise Pakistan. 

Afghanistan’s policy towards Pakistan at the time of the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 was not a friendly one. The most serious crisis was from September 1961 to June 1963, when diplomatic, trade, transit, and consular relations between the countries were suspended.
