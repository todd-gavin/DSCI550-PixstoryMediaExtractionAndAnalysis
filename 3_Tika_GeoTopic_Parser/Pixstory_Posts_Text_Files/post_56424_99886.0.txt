You might be in a long, short, deep or any kind of relationship with an individual. Toxicity is not something that can be ignored and so are the red flags in a relationship.

You don't have to endure any kind of sexist 'casual' jokes, casual abuse, anger issues or controlling behaviour. Some of the major red flags that help you realise what kind of relationship you are going through are: 

Love bombing: Intensity rather than intimacy designed to pull the wool over your eyes and secure narcissistic supply fast. Modern social media can heighten the effect of love bombing since it gives the abuser nearly steady contact and communication with the victim. One of the signs of love bombing at the start of a relationship is intense attention during a short period and pressure for very rapid commitment. Another sign of love bombing is being intensely showered with affection, gifts, and promises for the future with the predator so that the victim feels or is made to believe that all this is a sign of "love at first sight". 

Gaslighting- Fantasy rather than reality designed to cause mental and emotional confusion. Gaslighting happens when an abuser tries to control a victim by twisting their sense of reality. An example of gaslighting would be a partner doing something abusive and then denying it happened to make your question your sanity! 

Jealousy- Deep insecurity masked as affection designed to create obedience and instil fear. Often, the red flag of an extremely insecure partner looks like attentiveness at the start of a relationship, but there's an underlying control problem below all the attention.
