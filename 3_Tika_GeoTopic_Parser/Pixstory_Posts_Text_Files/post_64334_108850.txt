The Supreme Court while convicting the accused in August in a Criminal Appeal imposed a fine of Rs crore This amount has been paid to the Delhi government to set up another trauma centre in Dwarka New Delhi AVUT is following up with the Delhi Government for the implementation of the same Our nation has witnessed innumerable tragedies Although the magnitude of these tragedies varies there is one common thread that runs through each of the aforesaid mass tragedies in the last quarter of a century all of them were man made Each tragedy represents man s never ending greed and or intentional ignorance to public safety laws Under our current system such offenders are booked under Section A of the Indian Penal Code which translates into causing death due to a rash and negligent act However this in itself is a mockery of justice since the irony of the situation is that the said provision is classified as bailable In other words unless the accused is convicted by the Supreme Court there is no fear of his being incarcerated irrespective of the number of deaths he might have caused In this grim scenario incidents of such catastrophic magnitude are bound to recur since there is no legal deterrence that can emphasise the overwhelming importance of safety and instill fear in the minds of possible wrongdoers
