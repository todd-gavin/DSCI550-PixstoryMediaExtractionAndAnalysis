Buzz Lightyear gets his own film over three decades after his big screen debut. But it's Alisha, one of his fellow space rangers, who has stolen the show and provoked a ban across most of the Middle East and Asia. 

Vice reported that at least 14 countries, including the UAE, Egypt, and Malaysia, have banned the release of Disney's latest animated feature, Lightyear, because of a scene in which Alisha kissed her female companion on the lips. Most importantly, the Toy Story spinoff is unlikely to be released in China, which, as of 2021, has the world's largest box office. 

“What’s at stake here is one second of a lesbian kiss,” Timmy Chen, a research assistant professor, who studies Asian cinema at Hong Kong’s Baptist University, told VICE World News. “Disney is not willing to cut it and cater to the Chinese market, which shows that the Chinese box office has become irrelevant due to pandemic lockdowns.”

While the Chinese government has not announced a ban on Lightyear, the country does not allow any depictions of homosexual relationships on film.

Although subtle portrayals have slipped past censors in the past, there is no way a same-sex kiss would make the cut.
