I am what I write Revering the words for they have become a part of me I write because It says a thousand words even when there s nothing to say When the sheer fight between my mind and heart makes me tired It provides me with the solace which is nowhere to be found I write because It feels like a homecoming From the humdrum of this world That has succumbed itself To the misery of the mankind Writing paves a path for me It makes me numb to the voices That reminds me of the calloused reality I wished would not have existed I write because it pushes me to what I have always wanted to be And I write because it holds the truth that I want to seek Image Source Pinterest
