I heard the old man saying One day a little bird lost its way and came to our house For several days he was fearlessly walking in the corridors and houses Then the children bought him a cage and he found a separate room for himself I didn t want to see him in the cage he was silent But it wasn t long before he started reading Every day I wanted to let him go but he made me close to him by reading him One day when no one was home I took the cage outside and hung it on a tree branch I opened the small gate of the cage so that if he wants he can fly and go where he wants I stood in a corner wondering what was going on Not many minutes passed when he flew out of the cage and sat on a branch I remembered that he breathes the air of freedom and goes wherever he wants I returned to my room and got busy with my work Not an hour had passed when his singing voice was raised I looked into the cage and saw that the cage loving songbird was back in the cage and singing I also went and closed the gate of his cage and came He sings I don t know why I felt that the bird is alien to the concept of freedom and flight Like people who get used to slavery and think that the whole world is what they live on
