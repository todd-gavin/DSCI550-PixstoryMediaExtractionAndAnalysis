Don’t touch pickles during your cycle; they’ll go bad. Don’t cook. Don’t enter the temple. Sleep on the floor – use a rug given to you especially for these days. If you don’t get your period, you’ll die.

By now, I have heard every myth about menstruation.
bloating
acne breakouts
leg, back, or stomach cramping
premenstrual syndrome
And many more ups and downs during the time ! 🤦🏼‍♀️ 
Hormones plays Very important role in all this ! Hormones are Messengers to regulate physiology and behaviour . Hormonal imbalance cause many symptoms and a massive drop in life quality !
Estrogen is the primary sex hormone in women and it functions during the reproductive menstrual cycle. Women have three major types of estrogen: estrone, estradiol, and estriol, which bind to and activate receptors within the body.

Typical root causes of estrogen dominance are negative stress, medications, environmental toxins like xenoestrogens, and dietary factors with a critical view on the often underrated phytoestrogens. It is often overviewed that estrogen dominance also occurs on normal levels when other essential hormones are too low. That's why estrogen as a single parameter doesn't give any feedback on potential estrogen dominance. Suppressed progesterone or testosterone levels are a potential root cause of estrogen dominance!
