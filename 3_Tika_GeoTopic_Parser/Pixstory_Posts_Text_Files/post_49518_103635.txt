A woman whose niece was killed in the Uvalde School Shooting questioned how a gunman not yet old enough to buy beer in Texas could have purchased two semiautomatic rifles and a massive amount of ammunition without raising concern outside a memorial service Saturday at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where many of the funerals are scheduled to be held in the coming days Which is such a valid question The gun laws in America are hilariously unfunny year olds are not considered mature enough to buy liquor not considered mature enough to want a gender affirming surgery but are considered completely capable of owning a gun without even a background check He looked like my grandson I mean they could have been twins They have the same face a year old retired high school history teacher said his voice shaky with emotion It just stirred something in me Richard Small has always been pro gun accusing anyone asking for tighter gun regularions of politically pointing fingers He always thought guns are necessary for safety much like most Texans until he saw the photo of one of the victima of Uvalde shooting Small and his wife Marina travelled from their ranch in Charlotte a small hamlet south of San Antonio to pay their respects in Uvalde following the massacre The anguish they were met with scarred them To quote them tears didn t feel enough Small always called himself a Devout NRA Republican and admitted what he did would have been unthinkable just days earlier He turned in his AR to the local police department of the town I m a gun advocate I believe in the Second Amendment But this AR after what I saw in Uvalde I m done with it Small said as he turned the rifle over to an officer with the Charlotte police department I m sick over it It took Richard Small children and two teachers being slaughtered to come face to face with the reality of gun violence how long will it take the others If Uvalde doesn t open your eyes what will
