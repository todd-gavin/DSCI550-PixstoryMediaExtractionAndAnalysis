Why Don't We Have a National Game in India?
All sports are to be promoted by the Indian government. In order to find out whether hockey was recognised as India's official national sport or not, a teacher from the Dhule region of Maharashtra filed an RTI with the government in 2020. The Ministry of Youth Affairs responds that there isn't a sport declared as the official national sport of the nation.
