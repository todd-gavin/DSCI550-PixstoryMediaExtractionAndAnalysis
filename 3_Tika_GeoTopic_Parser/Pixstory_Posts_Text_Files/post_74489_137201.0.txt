Vicky Jain and Ankita Lokhande have stated that they do not have any immediate plans to start a family. When asked when she intended to become a mother, Ankita responded that she felt like a child herself. Vicky and Ankita were married in December of the previous year. ✅✅✅✅❤️❤️❤️

Ankita made the remark when she and actor Usha Nadkarni joined the DID Super Moms team in a special relationship-themed episode. Ankita performed Rangeela Rangeela, the title song from Urmila Matondkar's 1995 film Rangeela, with the judge in a preview for the upcoming episode. As the two danced to the song, Urmila's fellow judge, actor Bhagyashree, and Usha Nadkarni applauded them. 🎬✅✅✅✅

After their performance, host Jay Bhanushali asked Ankita, "Bata bhi do kab super mom aap ban rahi hain (please tell us when you are becoming a super mom)," in reference to the reality TV show DID Super Moms. In the response, Ankita said, "Abhi to main baby hoon, khud baby hoon (I myself am only a baby now)" in a baby voice. ✅✅✅✅✅😱😱😱

Usha Nadkarni, who portrayed both Sushant Singh Rajput's mother and Ankita's mother-in-law in the well-liked TV series Pavitra Rishta from 2009 to 2014, had a hilarious response to Ankita's assertions. Ankita, co-judge Remo D' Souza, and others laughed as she said "aaja" (come here) and motioned for Ankita to sit on her lap because she was a baby. ✅

It happens only a few weeks after Ankita dealt with speculation about her first pregnancy. Vicky Jain had put his hand on Ankita's stomach in a photo she shared from their vacation together in Goa. Many fans began speculating that Ankita was pregnant.✅✅✅
