Mr Inbetween is a dark and eccentric humorous drama about Ray Shoesmith (Scott Ryan), who is an assassin during the day and a father, divorced, brother, and boyfriend during the night. 

As collider tells us, the show illustrates these two somewhat opposing worlds and Ray's attempt to strike a balance between them over the course of three seasons. We observe his struggles in keeping the violence and rage he needs for his job from hurting his personal connections. It portrays a supposedly cold-blooded killer in a humanist and comic light. Mr Inbetween, directed by and starring Scott Ryan, was shot largely in Sydney and is based on Scott's feature film The Magician from 2005.
