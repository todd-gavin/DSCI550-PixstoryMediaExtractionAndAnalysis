A Lady By Amy Lowell You are beautiful and faded Like an old opera tune Played upon a harpsichord Or like the sun flooded silks Of an eighteenth century boudoir In your eyes Smoulder the fallen roses of out lived minutes And the perfume of your soul Is vague and suffusing With the pungence of sealed spice jars Your half tones delight me And I grow mad with gazing At your blent colours My vigour is a new minted penny Which I cast at your feet Gather it up from the dust That its sparkle may amuse you Lady by Amy Lowell contains a speaker s analysis of the life appearance and goodness of an old woman It describes women in all her beauty as well as flaws embracing each and every part of her including her appearance and her smell
