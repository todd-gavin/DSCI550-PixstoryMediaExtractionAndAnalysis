The lineup that Ole fielded mostly

With Cavani leading the lineup and Greenwood playing in the right-winger position, it means Rashford could play on the left-wing with devastating effect.


Looking at his 2020/21 seasonal heatmap we can see that he mostly operated down the left side and very occasionally came to the right side when the manager wanted to tinker lineup or if anyone was injured. 


Passing Stats


He had made 30.67 passes which put him in the 64 percentile. He has been devastating inside the penalty box as he has delivered 56 passes which put him at the 81 percentile. He had 9 assists to his name ranking at the 90 percentile. He had an eye for gold as he had ranked in the top quartile.

Goal Scoring

Rashford had scored 11 goals, scoring at every 267 minutes. He had 0.3 goals scored per match. He had 2.43 shots taken out of which he had 1.1 on target. Even though he missed big 11 chances to take his tally to 22 goals, it shows his rustiness in front of goal which would improve as he becomes more seasoned. 


From the heatmap, we can see that he had converted 2 shots out of the 6-yard box and 9 were inside the box. He scored 3 goals with his left foot, he had been awarded 2 spot-kick which he failed to convert. He had a goal conversion of 14%.

In the 2019 season Man Utd had bought a host of signings in the form of Dan James, Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan Bissaka and star signing Bruno Fernandes in January 2020. 


Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had a whole season to build his squad. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial were the leading men. Rashford and Martial scored 17 goals apiece and Bruno Fernandes chipped in with 8 goals, which saw United finish 3rd amidst the Covid outbreak. Ole had fielded this lineup:

Rashford was deployed mostly as a left-winger and occasional striker and he performed well as shown by the heatmap.
