What an interesting way to celebrate our downfalls dissatisfaction anger on something It just gives us all reason bring out all our anger apathy and everything once and for all on this day Personally I haven t heard about this day and it was just anew to me that even when I tried checking it on Google it gave me results for a sick day Anyhow it would definitely be a sick day thinking about all the messed up events It is a day that s observed in the US on th April and it is a day that s used for celebrating people s failure incompetence dissatisfaction and all things that suck So here is my experience where I was super dissatisfied when I couldn t properly enjoy my burger meal With great patience me and my friends went to a cafe to have a meal after having a long day and we really needed some sort of relief and so we just thought we would treat ourself into this cafe nearby to our hostel The moment we got into the cafe we all just loved the ambience and we looked through the menu and ordered the meal And then to our surprise we got complimentary drinks which just made us so happy Like even if it was just a way of welcoming their customers it just made our long day a better one Now after a wait for quite sometime our meal came As we started eating I understood that there was nothing more worse than the filling inside the burger going out I really couldn t enjoy eating the burger and we all ended up eating the breads with few filling and the filling alone Well this wasn t a great dissatisfaction but to an extent it was a dissatisfaction that even after setting a good mood we couldn t enjoy our burgers thoroughly Another annoying thing we can most commonly find is eating shawarma with lots of veggies in it how does that even work
