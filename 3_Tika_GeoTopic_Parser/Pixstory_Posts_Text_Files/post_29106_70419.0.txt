Reading books is my interest . I developed this hobby as a child when my parents recited stories from the storybooks to me. They regularly bought storybooks for me. The stories enchanted me and I began to treasure those books. At that age 1 listened to stories from “Thakurmar Jhuri’ and ‘Alif Laila’ and got lost in the imaginary (Peau) world of those books. The beautiful pictures of the books also charmed me very much. This fascination with books continued till I got admitted into primary school. At one stage my father bought me a beautiful bookcase. I began to put my collection of books in that bookcase. My parents continuously gifted me with good books Gradually my love to read books began to get enriched. When I grew up I also bought many books about my taste. My books are more like my friends to me they are also a source of great pleasure and joy to me. This habit of mine has made me a better person.
