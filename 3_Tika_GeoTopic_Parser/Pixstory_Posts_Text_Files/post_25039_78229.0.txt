Tottenham have been in the thick of things in the last couple of days. Spurs boss, Antonio Conte is desperate to add a couple of players of his liking before the winter transfer window draws to a close.

Juventus pairing of Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur are expected to join the London club before the transfer window ends. As reported by the Evening Standard, Kulusevski has already arrived in London, and has completed his medical. An announcement in relation to his signing will be made soon by the club. Originally, the Swedish winger will arrive on loan for a sum of €10million for 18 months. Spurs can secure a permanent signing for a further sum of €25 million, if the club manages to return to the Champions League football and the Swede plays 50% of the matches.

Rodrigo Bentancur, Uruguyan midfielder has also agreed a move to join Spurs. The initial fee is around €19 million with 75% of the sum being paid upfront. Bentancur has played a part in three league winning campaigns for the Old Lady in the past 5 years 

Rodrigo Bentancur is a player who is expected to thrive under Conte's wing, as the Italian manager is a huge fan of dynamic midfielders who can excel both, at breaking opposition play and getting the ball forward.

This has been a really last minute effort from Spurs to make two high-profile signings. However, with the current depth of their squad and the lack of options up front, they really need to add a few names in the winter window. Spurs are still in the shout for an opportunity to finish in the top four, and the newly signed Juventus duo will surely play their part in the same.
