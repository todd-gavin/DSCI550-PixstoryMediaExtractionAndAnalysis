In order to kick off their preseason, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will play Quevilly-Rouen on Friday at the Ligue 1 powerhouses' training facility, the Center d'entraînement Ooredoo.

Christophe Galtier, who took over as manager earlier this month after Mauricio Pochettino left, will oversee his debut game in this one. He will be able to use Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Neymar since they have all practiced together in preparation for the first preseason game.

The preseason activities for Quevilly-Rouen began on Saturday when they played Le Havre. Andreas Hountondji scored the lone goal for Les Rouges et Jaunes in their 2-1 defeat.

The Ligue 1 champions' upcoming friendly matches will take place in Japan against Kawasaki Frontale, Urawa Red Diamonds, and Gamba Osaka. The visiting team's subsequent friendly will be against Amiens, a team from Ligue 2.

In all tournaments, the two teams have only faced off once, which occurred in the Coupe de France semifinal of the 2009–10 season. In that game, PSG was able to win by a score of 1-0, and they went on to overcome Monaco in the championship game to take home the title.
