Tornadoes tore up homes in New Orleans and its suburbs and were reported in communities from Texas to Mississippi and Alabama as severe storms swept across the South in late March We asked tornado scientist Ernest Agee to explain what causes tornadoes and how the center of U S tornado activity has shifted eastward from the traditional Tornado Alley in recent years What causes tornadoes Tornadoes start with thunderstorms Think of the thunderstorm as the parent of the tornado When atmospheric conditions favor the development of severe storms tornadoes can form The recipe for a tornado requires a few important ingredients low level heat and moisture and cold air aloft coupled with a favorable wind field that increases in speed with height as well as changes in the wind direction in the lower levels The right combination of heat moisture and wind can develop rotating thunderstorms capable of spinning off a tornado or a tornado family Thunderstorms capable of spinning off tornadoes typically develop along and ahead of a frontal boundary where warm and cold air masses meet often accompanied above by a strong jet stream Why do tornado outbreaks seem to be getting more frequent and intense Is climate change playing a role Studies do show tornadoes getting more frequent more intense and more likely to come in swarms The most intense and longest lasting tornadoes tend to come from what are known as supercells powerful rotating thunderstorms The December outbreak with more than tornadoes that swept across Kentucky and neighboring states came from a supercell The outbreak in Alabama was another All of this unfolds under the umbrella of global warming While it s still hard for climate models to assess something as small as a tornado they do project increases in severe weather Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
