There have been rumours suggesting that Marcus Rashford would leave United in the summer. Barcelona and Arsenal are reportedly moniroting the player at the moment. But Wayne Rooney wants his former teammate to stay and break his record. 



What did Wayne Rooney say?

The former Manchester United captain has since moved on to become the manager at Derby County. As per the Daily Mail, Wayne Rooney wants his former teammate to stay at the club for a long time!

Wayne Rooney scored 253 goals in 560+ appearances for the Red Devils. The Derby County coach wants Marcus Rashford to stay, rediscover his form and break his goalscoring record. 

In a recent interview, Wayne Rooney said, "What I hope is that Marcus Rashford f***ing gets his head out of his a*** and go and breaks that record. He is a Manchester lad and needs to become the highest goalscorer of the club."

Marcus Rashford has scored 97 goals in 297 appearances for Manchester United over the years. Hence the 24-year-old forward would have to dedicate most of his career to United if he has to break Wayne Rooney's record. 

The United winger suffered a huge setback after he was snubbed from Gareth Southgate's England squad. The Three Lions are playing friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast in the international break. 

With just eight-months remaining for the World Cup, Marcus Rashford would have to rediscover his mojo. Only then would he have a chance to break into the England squad for the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
