The majority of facilities falsely state that the lion cubs that take part in the petting activities are orphaned, although this is not usually the case.

A 2019 research states that while there are only 3 000 lions in the wild, there are between 8,000 and 10,000 that are maintained in captivity on roughly 300 farms for commercial breeding and keeping.

"These cubs are bred in captivity on demand to supply these petting farms with a constant supply of lion cubs," the statement reads.

Big cats, especially young cubs, sleep for several hours each day. However, they become worn out when required to engage with paying customers for eight to ten hours a day. Cubs must be habituated before they can interact with people in a safe manner. This entails taking the cubs away from their mother as soon as possible so that they can be raised by people.

Honestly, not a good idea. Leave the wild alone.
