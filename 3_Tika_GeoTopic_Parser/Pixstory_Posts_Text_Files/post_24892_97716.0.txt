Real Madrid sealed their 35th LaLiga title on Saturday with a 4-0 win over Espanyol, giving them an unassailable advantage over Barcelona at the top of the league with four games remaining.

Rodrygo's first-half double sent the champions elect on their way to the title at the Santiago Bernabeu, before Marco Asensio made it 3-0 immediately after the break. Benzema added a fourth goal in the 89th minute after coming off the bench amid frenzied celebrations.

The league trophy is Madrid's second of the 2021-22 season, following their Spanish Supercopa victory in January. They'll try to keep their Champions League semifinal hopes alive against Manchester City on Wednesday, after a 4-3 loss in England.

Carlo Ancelotti, who returned to the club this summer for a second tenure, becomes the first coach to win a title in each of Europe's "big five" leagues: Italy's Serie A, England's Premier League, France's Ligue 1, Germany's Bundesliga, and now Spain's LaLiga.

Ancelotti said: "It's emotional. It's an achievement. The season we've had in the league has been spectacular, with a lot of consistency. It's thanks to the work of the players, and their commitment. Today we have to celebrate, I want to celebrate.

"It fills me with pride. I like what I do, and the five leagues [I've won] mean I've done quite well. I'm proud to be here and to win trophies for Real Madrid and I want to carry on winning trophies for Real Madrid."

Real Madrid now has 35 league titles to Barcelona's 26. Since 2010, the team has won four titles: in 2012, 2017, 2020, and now 2022. During that time, Los Blancos also won four Champions League titles.
