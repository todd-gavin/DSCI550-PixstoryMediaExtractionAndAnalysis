An on-site crocodile at a government school inside this city caused panic among the pupils, according to school officials on Wednesday.
Diwakar Vashisht, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), told reporters that the reptile that was taken on Tuesday from the school in Qasimpur village has been released into the Ganga.
Villagers armed with sticks raced to their aid when the kids and staff sounded the alarm after spotting the reptile and managed to corner it, they claimed.
They claimed that until district officials and workers from the State Forest department arrived and captured the crocodile, they had kept it inside a classroom.
Numerous rivulets as well as the neighbouring Ganga River can be found here.
Various crocodiles have reportedly been spotted in the village pond, according to school staff. The villagers have repeatedly attempted to get the attention of the local authorities but in vain.
Locals claim that it is quite likely that the crocodile reached the school during floods after making its way from these rivulets to the village pond.
According to the DFO, steps have been taken with the assistance of the village panchayat to look into whether there are any further crocodiles living in the pond.
He explained that if they are found, they will also be seized and released into the river.
