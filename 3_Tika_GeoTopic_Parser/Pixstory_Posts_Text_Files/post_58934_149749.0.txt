As the crisis in the Rajasthan Congress unit continues, CM Ashok Gehlot met with some ministers and party MLAs in Jaipur on Tuesday. He also spoke on the phone with Sonia Gandhi, the party's interim president.
The Rajasthan CM's position will most likely be decided after the Congress Presidential Elections next month.
