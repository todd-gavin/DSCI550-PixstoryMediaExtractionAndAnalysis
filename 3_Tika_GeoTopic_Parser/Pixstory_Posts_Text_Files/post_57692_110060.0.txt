Substance abuse can be recreational or a coping mechanism. It should be avoided in either case due to its side effects, long term effects and addiction issues. Create a barrier, a filter that allows you to not give in to substances that can cause harm. Identify when you're vulnerable to it and choose a healthier alternative, that heals without hurting. 
Also, shaming and antagonising people who have these addictions and issues is not the right way to make th understand that its not good for them. If its someone you know, help them via the appropriate methods instead of causing them more hurt. Support them in their time of need and vulnerability.
Healthy substances keep a healthy body and a healthy mind.
