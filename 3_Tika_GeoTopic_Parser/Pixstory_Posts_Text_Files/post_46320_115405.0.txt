It is rightly said that ‘ if you have it at your home , you are more likely to eat it .’ 🥲🍟

So better be mindful when doing grocery shopping . 🍕🛒

3 rules I follow -

1️⃣ I always make a list before going so that I don’t end up buying stuff that I don’t need . Specially something to munch on to .

2️⃣ I always buy only basic groceries - like rice , flour , nuts , green tea , seeds , coffee ,  makhanas , pulses , legumes etc . You will not even find a packet of biscuit at my place .

3️⃣ I always make sure I read the ingredient list before buying anything from the store . If it has any latent items which could be unhealthy , I don’t take it . For example , low fat namkeens . It is a marketing gimmick and nothing else . There’s nothing low fat about that namkeen .

Try and be aware of what you are putting inside your body . ✅👍

If I feel like having nachos or a chocolate , I only get it the day I want to have it . I never store it at my place .

These 3 things really helped me . 👍✅

Thank me later and make sure you are buying healthy groceries !💪🏻
