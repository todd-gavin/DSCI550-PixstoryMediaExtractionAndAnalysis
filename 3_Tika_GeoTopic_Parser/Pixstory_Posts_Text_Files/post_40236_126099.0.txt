I am all for personal choice and rights over your body but is it fair if they come at the cost of your health? Getting a tattoo is simply not safe! 

As Carrie Modromo points out, don't get a tattoo from someone you haven't met, just as you wouldn't get surgery with an unknown surgeon. 

How often is it possible to know your artist, check over her portfolio, and enquire about recommendations before you start? You can never be sure when it comes to these things! Unfortunately, there are individuals who lack experience and expertise. 

As she further states, a subpar tattoo artist might give you a shoddy tattoo at best or, at worst, a deadly illness. 

Health Technician Matt Kachel highlighted to Baraboo that it exposes people to catching Hepatitis C and HIV. "These are illnesses that a person could develop without realising it for a very long time. We don't want to see breakouts because that could result from it." 

Still tattoos sound like a good idea?
