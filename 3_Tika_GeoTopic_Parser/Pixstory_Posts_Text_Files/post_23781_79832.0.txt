Surrounded by the ruins of smaller stupas and monasteries, Sanchi Stupa is an architectural marvel in Sanchi, believed to house the relics of Lord Buddha. Also known as the Great Stupa, this famous pilgrimage site in India was built by the Indian Emperor Ashoka, the Great in the 3rd century BC.

As the oldest stone sculpture of the country, this UNESCO World Heritage Site takes you back in the days of the prosperous Mauryan Era. There are four intricately designed gateways surrounding the Stupa known as toranas, each individually symbolizing the four emotions of love, peace, courage and trust.
