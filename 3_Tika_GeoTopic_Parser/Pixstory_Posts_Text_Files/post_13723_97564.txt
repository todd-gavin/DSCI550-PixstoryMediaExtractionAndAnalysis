If it were not for death I would have left most of the work for later I was not in a hurry and I would safely do what I wanted to do later Later I would go to the places I like to go I exercised later Later I read and saw the books I like to read and the movies I like to watch Later I would visit the ones I love Later I got news from friends I had not heard from for a long time Later I apologized for my mistakes and later I forgave the mistakes of others I ran later He later quit addiction Later I would go to Koh i Baba I would read Masnavi later I would watch the sunrise later Later a few of us went on a trip together Later I would do everything do all the things I wanted But there is death So live now
