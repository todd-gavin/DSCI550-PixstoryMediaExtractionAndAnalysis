The holiest river of India - The Ganga is being murdered by us and is dying a slow death. Once the symbol of purity is today a foul respectacles of toxic waste. Not just Ganga but most of the Indian rivers share the same story! We dump are domestic & industrial waste, defecate, bathe, perform rituals and last rites in our holy rivers.
During the pandemic last year, corpses glutted the Ganga and we were mere spectators. How will we survive if the rivers get toxicated have you ever thought?
We blame government, but we being hypocrites do the the same. The dying rivers calls for their resurvival. Let's make them pure as they were earlier!
