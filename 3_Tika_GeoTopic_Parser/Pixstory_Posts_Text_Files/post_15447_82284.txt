In Antarctica in the remote field of Little Dome C the first drilling campaign of the Beyond Epica Oldest Ice project was successfully concluded an unprecedented challenge for paleoclimatology studies The goal of going back in time one and a half million years to discover temperatures and past greenhouse gas concentration through the analysis of an ice core extracted from the depths of the ice cap Funded by the European Commission with millions of euros and significant financial contributions from participating nations the project extends for seven years starting in ed coordinated by Carlo Barbante director of the Institute of polar sciences of the National Research Council Cnr Isp and professor at the Ca Foscari University of Venice Twelve partner research centers from ten European and non-European countries Little Dome It is an area of km located km from the Italian-French station Concordia one of the most extreme and difficult places on Earth Glaciologists, engineers and technicians of the international team worked at an altitude of meters above sea level over km from the coast Strong gusts of wind and a temperature almost always below C with minimums of C have made the work for setting up the field even more demanding The main objectives completed by the Beyond Epica Oldest Ice team were in fact the setting up of the field which can now accommodate up to people during the Antarctic summer and the installation of the complex drilling system necessary to continue this extraordinary work in the coming seasons The researchers will therefore be able to establish the quantities of various greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the past by relating them to the evolution of temperatures We believe that this ice core can provide us with information on the climate of the past and on the greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere during the transition of the Middle Pleistocene MPT occurred between and millions of years ago concludes Barbante During this transition the climatic periodicity between the ice ages passed from to years why this happened the mystery we aim to solve
