Love Commandos is a organisation which has started to work in favour of the couples While during the Valentine s week most couples are harassed in different ways by several groups Love Commandos fight back for them I had a chance to interview Mr Sanjoy Sachdeva He says that for them each day is a valentine day that love is the only thing that will bring peace into the world will stop all the problems of violence and their motto is the one which promotes love in all it s forms They have approximately lakh volunteers all over India but says that many people still struggle in enrolling to become a volunteer due to the thought of going against the law the police and getting the feeling of a rather vigilant initiative but Mr Sanjoy pointed out that the police has helped and worked in favour of the couples during valentine to save them from all the vandalism they suffer He also stated that many people have started to get motivated for this cause and many boys and girls have bought things like pepper spray and spices in order to fight the vandalism during the Valentine s week He also pointed out the number of people harassing the couple during Valentine s week has significantly lessened At last he said that love is nature and whoever goes against nature gets destroyed So people who goes against love will not find a way out of it easily He ended the interview citing a poem by Robert Frost But i have promises to keep And miles to go before i sleep Miles to go before i sleep
