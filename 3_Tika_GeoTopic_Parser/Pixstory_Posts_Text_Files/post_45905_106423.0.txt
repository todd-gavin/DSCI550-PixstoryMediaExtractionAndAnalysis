According to Radar, former first lady Melania Trump is the underlying reason behind Ivanka and Donald's legendary daddy-daughter feud. 

While an animosity between the former president’s wife and his one-time special advisor in the White House had been widely assumed, the real degree of the family’s in-fighting was not uncovered until last night. 

Despite her father's repeated claims to the contrary, Ivanka said she "agreed" that former Attorney General Bill Barr had discovered no proof of fraud that might overturn the 2020 election at the first primetime session of senators probing the January 6 incident at the Capitol. 

It earned a severe censure from her father almost immediately. 

“Ivanka Trump was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results,” he wrote on social media. “She had long since checked out and was, in my opinion, only trying to be respectful to Bill Barr and his position as Attorney General (he sucked!).”

After being subpoenaed in an ongoing civil investigation, Ivanka Trump was unconcerned and smiling while on vacation with her family. Even before the hearing, Ivanka had been iced by Melania despite living almost around the corner from each other in Florida!
