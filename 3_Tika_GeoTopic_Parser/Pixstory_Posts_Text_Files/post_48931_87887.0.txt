Hens are very gregarious animals who like foraging for food, taking dust baths, perching, and caring for their young. Hens are selectively selected to lay the most eggs, and they spend up to two years in metal cages with six other birds. Hens are unable to extend their wings or engage in other natural behaviours because the cages are too small and crowded.
Male chicks are unable to lay eggs and are not the meat chicken breed. The egg industry considers them worthless, therefore they are disposed of like rubbish after being removed from the females, either smothered to death or mashed and ground up alive in enormous industrial macerators. Barbaric!
Did you know that around 75% of chickens in the United States are kept in wire cages? Each hen has about the same amount of living area as a regular sheet of printer paper. They are forced to stand or squat on the rough wires of the cages, which slash their feet. Hens frequently die in their cages as a result of their living conditions. They're sometimes dumped in the same area as live birdanaesthetics.In the egg industry, chicks are mutilated. Hens exhibit strange behaviours as a result of the stress of such close confinement. Cannibalism and self-mutilation are frequent. As a result, employees were forced to remove a section of their sensitive beaks without the use of anaesthetics.
