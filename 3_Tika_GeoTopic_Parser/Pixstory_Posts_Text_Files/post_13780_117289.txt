When was the last time India engaged an Indian coach for its senior national team It was more than years ago when Armando Colaco was given the job he didn t stay more than three months Since then the foreign coaches are dominating the scene Igor Stimac the current national coach of India is from Croatia and he succeeded British coach Stephen Constantine who replaced Wim Koevermans the soft spoken lanky coach from the Netherlands Now if anyone says India will never win the World Cup because they have a foreign coach it will simply evoke laughter Languishing below in the FIFA ranking India can not even dream of qualifying for the World Cup leave alone winning it The fans however can always say that the first thing India need to do if they plan to win the cup by the wildest stretch of imagination is to appoint an Indian coach Because no nation in the history of the World Cup has ever won the trophy with a foreign coach All World Cup triumphs since have come under local coaches It is worth noting that there have not been champion coaches but as the first two time champion in the history of this tournament Italy were coached by the same manager in both editions Vittorio Pozzo in and At the same time does it mean that of the National Teams that have qualified for Qatar teams stand no chance of winning the Cup since they are not being coached by a coach from their own nation They are Belgium Morocco Qatar Saudi Arabia Korea Iran Ecuador Costa Rica Canada and Mexico All these teams have employed foreign coaches for their World Cup campaign But then all said and done apart from Belgium to some extent the nine other teams have little chance of winning the cup be it under a foreign or local coach The traditional powers of world football like Brazil Argentina Uruguay Germany England France or Spain are all coming to Qatar under coaches from their own nations
