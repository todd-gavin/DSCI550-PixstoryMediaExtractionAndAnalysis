“Snags” or sausages are Australia’s version of the USA’s hotdog. Our version is simply a slice of white bread paired with a sausage and whatever sauce you fancy, and even caramelized onions if you want to be fancy. Head to the hardware store Bunnings Warehouse on the weekend to find yourself an iconic sausage sizzle.

On the other hand, Pods are crunchy yet gooey bites of heaven with Mars Bar, Snickers or Twix filling. Shockingly, you’ll only find them in Australia and New Zealand.
