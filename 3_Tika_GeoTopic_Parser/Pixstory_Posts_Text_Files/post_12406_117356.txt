Struggle can be in different ways and in different forms Everyone have their own struggles and it doesn t need to be the same at all And it is okay to be struggling because that s what makes us stronger and wiser And so have you been struggling lately Struggling can be different and especially when it is with our mental health we often come to conclusions too soon believing that those thoughts or voices are true and not our capabilities Trust me it is just a thought a voice that doesn t define you you may become a judge of your own which creates a lot of negative aura around the struggles we are facing So this story is to acknowledge your struggles and just take a moment and think about where you are today is something you might have wanted to be at some point of your life Life is a rollercoaster that takes us on an unexpected turns but you overcame that till this point and so you really need much of an appreciation for it Remind yourself that its okay to struggle it s okay not to be okay There are difficult moments and we deserve to acknowledge them so that we ensure and support ourselves with compassion and love that we deserve
