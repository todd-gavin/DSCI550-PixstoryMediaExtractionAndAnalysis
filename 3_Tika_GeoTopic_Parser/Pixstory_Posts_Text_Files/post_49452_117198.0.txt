While individual action is extremely essential for community effort and helping towards not making matters worse, it is also important to realize the quantum and magnitude of the impact individual habits and lifestyles have on the environment - vs industries and corporates. 

It can also shifts the focus away from politicians and regulatory authorities from bringing in proper systems and regulations in order to tackle change as well as corporates that are heavily a part of the problem.

By promoting individual involvement, the fossil fuel business has produced persuasive ideas that offers people a sense of power over the climate issue and shifts our attention away from the perpetrators and toward the crisis. 

Itâ€™s time we rethink individualism - a classic textbook example of performative activism by corporates, and ask for concrete, appropriate action by lawmakers and hold industries accountable.
