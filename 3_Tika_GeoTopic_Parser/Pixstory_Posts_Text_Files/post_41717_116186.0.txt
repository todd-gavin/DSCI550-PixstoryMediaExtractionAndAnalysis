If you loved Bridgerton, there are many options for you out there when it comes to period dramas! One  of them is Mary Queen Of Scots!

Bridgerton has explored lots of relationships between women, whether they be friends, family, or rivals, and this is also the central story of Mary Queen of Scots, which stars Saoirse Ronan as the titular character alongside Margot Robbie as her cousin Queen Elizabeth I.

Mary Queen of Scots features outstanding performances from its core ensemble, which also includes Gemma Chan and David Tennant, as well as a variety of notable costumes, despite historical mistakes regarding the dynamic between Mary and Elizabeth.

Plus, people who have an inclination for the royalty, specifically British will prefer this over anything.
