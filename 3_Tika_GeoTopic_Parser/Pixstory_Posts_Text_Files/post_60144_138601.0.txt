I’ve been an avid reader from my childhood. There were times when I sneaked in the book I was then currently reading in my classes and read it during the lectures. I have always found a friend in books. Although now I don’t get much time to spend some amount of time reading, I still take out a bit of time once in a while for my books. Picking out a single favourite book is tough for someone who loves books of all genres, but if I had to choose one it would be The Fault In Our Stars by my favourite writer John Green.
Reading the book was one emotional roller coaster and needless to say had left me crying at the end. On behalf of all the bookworms it would be safe to state that a part of us died with Augustus. Although there’s not just one but two movies in both Hollywood and Bollywood based on the same storyline, it’s true that the book version is definitely better than the movies, as expected.
Talking about National Read a Book Day so on February 6th 2005, the National Association of School Librarians (NASL) established this Day. Later the name and date was changed to National Read a book and date to 6th September.
The goal is to convince kids between the ages of 5 and 18 to read for 30 minutes each day.
People should take advantage of this day to read literature they have been meaning to or have never read before. People can take part in this Day in a variety of ways. While some people like to read books at home, others might visit a library or bookshop. Some folks can also decide to take part in a reading challenge or listen to an audiobook.
Promoting reading books is the aim of this day. Reading has several benefits, including raising vocabulary levels and improving concentration and critical thinking skills.  Everybody can find a book they enjoy because there are so many different kinds available. Any reader can find a book that appeals to them, whether they love reading fiction, non-fiction, biographies, or romance novels.
