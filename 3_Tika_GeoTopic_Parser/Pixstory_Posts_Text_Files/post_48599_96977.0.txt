According to text messages provided to the select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) told then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that some members of Congress were calling for Donald Trump to declare martial law in order to remain president.

Greene brought up the subject in a text message to Meadows on Jan. 17, 2021, more than a week after the insurgency and just days before Joe Biden's inauguration as president, according to CNN.

“In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall law,” Greene texted Meadows, misspelling the word “martial.” “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”

A request for comment from Greene's office was not immediately returned Monday. Greene claimed she couldn't recall if she pushed Trump to declare martial law when testifying about her alleged role in the Jan. 6 attack as part of a case trying to ban her from running for reelection last week.

During the hearing on Friday, Greene stated dozens of times that she couldn't remember her tweets or statements about the Capitol attack. Greene's presence in an Atlanta courtroom was the first time a member of Congress was questioned about the incident under oath.

Free Speech for People, a campaign finance reform organization, brought the complaint against Greene on behalf of a group of citizens in her area. Greene, who has become a lightning rod for controversy and has earned a reputation as one of the Republican Party's most hard-right members, allegedly assisted in the ransacking of the Capitol in an attempt to prevent Biden's victory from being certified, according to the Free Speech group.
