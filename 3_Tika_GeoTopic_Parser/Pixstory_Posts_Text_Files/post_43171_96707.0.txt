The fight first started between Payal Rohatgi and Saisha Shinde. Payal asked the fashion designer not to use the woman card in the house. The duo then started ridiculing each other's career. As they continued to argue, Payal questioned why Saisha why she was trying to bond with her boyfriend Sangram Singh, when outside. Replying to this, Saisha said, “Agar maine bata diya na jo meri baat hui Sangram se, tu sun lego to teri ch**di geeli ho jayegi.”

Prince Narula interrupted the conversation which irked Payal. She questioned if he is also there because of some setting. “Tu kyu fatak raha hai.” On this, Prince said, “Main Sangram ki setting se hoon.” Payal then shouted at him saying, “Tu kiske support se aaya hai, Nora Fatehi ke support se aaya hai. Ab bol.” In reaction to this, Prince said “Tere to ex gin bhi nahi sakta main.” Payal answered, “Haan hai mere itne ex, teri kyu jal rahi hai. Hain mere ex uske bawajood hai 12 saal ka relationship. Ukhaad ke dikha jo ukhaad sakta hai.”
