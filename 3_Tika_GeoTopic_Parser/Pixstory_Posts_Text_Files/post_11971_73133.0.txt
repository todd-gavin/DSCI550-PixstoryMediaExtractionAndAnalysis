A new study finds that COVID-19 vaccines can temporarily and slightly affect a person’s menstrual cycle, but that the changes are barely detectable.

Experts also stress the vaccines do not impact fertility.

The study, published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, found that the changes to menstrual cycles were barely detectable and showed no signs of being harmful to study participants or their levels of fertility.

The relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and menstruation cycles

The study involved nearly 4,000 individuals, of which 2,403 were vaccinated and 1,556 were not.

There was a mix of vaccines used in the group, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.

What the study found is that there was a small change in menstrual cycle length, but no change in the length of the period itself.

COVID-19 vaccines were associated with a less than 1-day change in cycle length.

“The vaccine has shown some mild disruption in menstrual cycling for some women,” said Dr. Taraneh Shirazian, associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Langone Health. “This has been reported as a brief change, such as a few days in the menstrual cycle, and does not result in any long lasting changes or disruption in fertility.”
