Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own And that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women my sisters and lovers And that a kelson of the creation is love And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields And brown ants in the little wells beneath them And mossy scabs of the worm fence heap d stones elder mullein and poke weed A child said What is the grass fetching it to me with full hands How could I answer the child I do not know what it is any more than he I guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green stuff woven Walt Whitman
