Everything is on the line. On Monday, Australia and Peru will compete in an intercontinental 2022 World Cup qualifying final for one of the two remaining slots in Qatar 2022. 

On Tuesday, CBS Sports reported that Australia beat the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in Asian Football Confederation qualifying, while Peru placed seventh in CONMEBOL qualifying. Australia has qualified for the past four World Cups, reaching the knockout round in 2006, but is yet to win a group-stage match in 2018. 

Peru, which was making its first appearance since 1982, was one of its losses. The Peruvians won 2-0 in that encounter in 2018, and it is the only head-to-head contest between the two teams. The match will take place at Al Rayyan's Ahmad bin Ali Stadium on Monday.

For those of you who don’t know kickoff is set for 2 p.m. ET. 

Let’s see what happens next!
