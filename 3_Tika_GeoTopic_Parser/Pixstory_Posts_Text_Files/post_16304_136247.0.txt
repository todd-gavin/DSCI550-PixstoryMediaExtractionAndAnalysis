The entire Brahmastra team including Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, Mouni Roy, Nagarjuna, Ayan Mukerji and Karan Johar along with ace filmmaker Rajamouli were present in Hyderabad for the film's pre-release event. However, Alia and Karan got brutally trolled by netizens who felt that they were using the actress' upcoming baby to promote their film.👶🍼

At the Brahmastra pre-release event, Alia was seen wearing a pink sharara. She had a note written on her back which read, "Baby on board." While being on stage, Karan asked Alia to turn around and show the audience how cutely she has scribbled a note on her dress for her upcoming baby. Alia happily obliged to Karan's request and thanked the filmmaker. 🤗🤗

However, their actions didn't go down well with netizens who slammed them for picking up an unusual way to promote their upcoming film. "Baby abhi se promotion me help kar rha hai," one Instagram user wrote, followed by another user who took a dig at them commenting, "Bcche ke release ke phle uska bh ek premier toh banta hai."🙁🙁🙁
