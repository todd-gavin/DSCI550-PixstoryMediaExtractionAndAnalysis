As per the Daily Mail, Mauricio Pochettino wants a return to the Premier League. But the Argentine wants to go back to Tottenham Hotspur rather than joining Manchester United next summer. 

Alan Brazil, talksport's pundit suggested that "Pochettino is not going to United. Manchester United have been warned by PSGs sporting director Leonardo that Pochettino has no intention of leaving Paris."

He would then conclude by saying "From the horse's mouth, Pochettino wants to come back to the Premier League. He wants to come back to Spurs, I'm not saying it's going to happen, but that's what he wants."

Tottenham Hotspur are currently being led by Antonio Conte. The Spurs management have reportedly put their faith in the Italian and want him to continue at the club for a few years. 

Meanwhile Manchester United are actively searching for a new manager. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick will reportedly leave the club at the end of the 2021/22 season. 

Owing to this, Mauricio Pochettino is being rumoured to be the number one choice of the Red Devils management. Legendary United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is also a huge fan of the Argentine. Hence the Scotsman himself wants to see Pochettino at the club.





Will PSG let their manager leave?


As per reports, Paris Saint-Germain have no intention of making any changes before the end of the season. PSG are on top of the Ligue 1 table and they are also one of the favourites in the Champions League. 

The Parisians could end up replacing their manager if they underperform in the Champions League once again. Hence, it has to be seen if Mauricio Pochettino would continue with Paris Saint-Germain when the new season starts in August.
