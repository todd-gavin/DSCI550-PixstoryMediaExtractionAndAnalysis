7 Joel Matip
Matip joined the Reds on a free transfer in 2016, becoming one of the best deals in Liverpool transfer history as he played a significant part in the club's success under manager Klopp. He was physically strong and tall, and he worked well with defensive partner Van Dijk.
Matip's defensive prowess enabled Liverpool to go the entire 2021-22 season without conceding a goal, putting the club on track to win the quadruple. He appeared in two Champions League finals and totaled 171 appearances.

6 Andrew Robertson
Since joining Liverpool, Robertson has been perceived as one of the best left-backs in history, and he has been Klopp's go-to player in every game. Because of his small stature and pace, he is able to make in-between runs and work well with wingers. Many top players have praised him as the best left back in the Premier League.
Robertson is one of the few players who has twinkled in a red shirt and has remained an important defender under Klopp's regime. He has appeared in 232 games for Liverpool, winning the Premier League once.


5 Sami Hyypia
A premier league defender and foreign player who wore the number 4 jersey and captained Liverpool to ultimate greatness throughout his time at the club. He was signed for a fee of 2 million pounds, one of Liverpool's best bargains. Hyypia remained at Anfield for ten years, serving as an encouragement to his teammates.
He was a firm Premier League defender who scored many memorable goals, he was combative in areal duels and scored many wonderful headers, he passed the captain armband to Gerrard and left the club after 464 appearances.

4 Dejan Lovren
He was the first expensive defender in Liverpool history, joining from Southampton for a fee of 20 million. Lovren may have had a bumpy start to his Liverpool career, as he was frequently out of form and was oftenly replaced by many short-term defenders.
