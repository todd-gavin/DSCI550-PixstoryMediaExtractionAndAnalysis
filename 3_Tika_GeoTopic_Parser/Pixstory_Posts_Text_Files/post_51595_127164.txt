Don t be an irresponsible citizen of the country This is the harsh reality of Indian patriotism by some of our citizens Just going with the trend like what other people are doing and showing fake patriotism just for a day is what most of the Indians are doing Buying an Indian flag and waving it in the air is the most proudly thing a person can do But doing it just on independence day or republic day is called as fake patriotism Teenagers are the most influenced age category who do all these things to just look cool on social media apps But what after independence day Or republic day The Flags are seen thrown in the trash bins roadsides Junkyards and other places This is the respect our people have for the flag Actually they don t know the struggles our freedom fighters did to make our country free from the cruel britishers They are not aware of what our soldiers are doing every second for our peaceful life They are not aware of how the police is saving us from a lot of crimes They are not aware of how many Legends this country had given birth and how many martyrs have struggled for the independence of our country The respect should come from inside the heart and not just for showing off Our country had given us everything and what had we given back to our country Nothing Our country only needs Real love and respect and nothing else I REQUEST YOU ALL TO PLEASE RESPECT OUR FLAGS AND DON T THROW IT ANYWHERE THANK YOU
