Lodge Heather is located near the High Range Club and the old CSI Church in Munnar. The logo of the Lodge is  a Tusker standing between two plants and above the Tusker there's a divider and  a protractor. And the motto is : Wisdom, Strength & Beauty.
Lodge Heather was constructed some 8 years before the construction of the Old CSI Church. In the past , almost all major tea plantations at Munnar were under the control of British men . And the British officials used to assemble at Lodge Heather mostly on all Fridays to do their rituals related to worship. Even after the construction of the Old CSI Church many officials resorted to worship  at Lodge Heather.
Munnar when translated to English symbolize either 3 rivers or the number 6 three times -  666 , which is known to be a satanic number .
Hence a lot of people have claimed a connecting link between Satanic mass and the rituals practiced by the British officials at Lodge Heather. 
Among the locals , this place is also known as    " thalavetti kovil " or " Mandavetti kovil " which means 'a temple or place  where people  were decapitated ' .
As a part of their worship rituals these British officials used to decapitate people and offer the blood and soul of such people to Satan.
Till date Lodge Heather remains like an unsolved mystery . A lot of tourists who visit the lodge every year comment about the various demonic experiences and energy they feel there. And not many choose to live near Lodge Heather for some baffling reasons.
