Neutrality is easily obtainable. 
Psychologists say, "Body neutrality makes you dig deep and ask those questions about how you came to adopt and internalize the unrealistic beauty standards and ideals. It breaks you from that nagging inner voice because you choose not to entertain it. This allows you to devote more time and energy to other important things in your life."

Unrealistic standards and conventional views never leave one's way; trying to tell yourself to love your body when you actually don't want to would instead suppress your feelings.
Suppressing these emotions would lead to issues like anxiety, depression, eating disorders and sometimes even suicide.

Pretending or forcing positivity when it really doesn't exist would not bring any change. And for someone with an eating disorder, it would worsen the situation.

Hence, it is necessary to balance body positivity and neutrality, so even if you choose to talk about loving your body, there is an unfiltered thought that makes you feel genuine and keep you away from unrealistic ideas.
