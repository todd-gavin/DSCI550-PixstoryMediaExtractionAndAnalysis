Mahindra unveiled 5 new electric SUVs under its Mahindra Born Electric Vision. These electric SUVs will be positioned under Mahindra’s two EV brands – XUV, and the all-new electric-only brand called BE. 

The first SUV will be launched by the end of 2024, and these products promise to be very impressive be it in terms of design, technology, and more critically, performance and range.

Let's take a look at these upcoming EVs 

1. XUV.e8

This will be an electric equivalent of the Mahindra XUV700. It will be offered with an AWD driving terrain.

2. XUV.e9

This will be bigger than the e8, and most probably will rival the likes of Fortuner or Gloster. Its design is more of an SUV coupe than a conventional SUV.

3. BE.05

Mahindra is calling the 05, a sport electric vehicle. Its dimensions put be above the Creta & Seltos but slightly lower than Tucson.

4. BE.07

This will be an electric alternative to Kodiaq or Tiguan as per its dimensions. In other words, a family SUV.

5. BE.09

Not much has been revealed about the 09 except that it will be a four-seater vehicle, which will be a segment-first feature.

The upcoming Electric Vision portfolio looks exciting and futuristic. If done right by Mahindra with affordable prices, a good service network, and uncompromising quality, Mahindra might revolutionize the entire EV industry and can become the ultimate champion of electric vehicles in India.
