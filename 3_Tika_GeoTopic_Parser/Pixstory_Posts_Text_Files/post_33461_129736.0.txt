A few Buddhist sculptures were also seen by Buchanan in the ruins, two of them containing inscriptions of the usual Buddhist type. Buchanan mentions

“Among the others were two of Buddh, the only ones which contain inscriptions. They were broken, and the head of one and legs of the other have been lost, but the whole figure may be made out from the two. Their hands are in a posture different from the common, but over the head of one is placed a smaller Bouddh in the usual posture. I could hear of no other inscription at the place.”

The sculptures are primarily hindu; but how they are associated with the present temple is not still fully clear; for they certainly did not belong to the sanctum or to the mandap (tower) which has no provision to accommodate these images. Beglar quotes Kittoe for a local tradition that the temple was originally dedicated to the Surya; but Cunningham mentions that since the present Lingam appears to be in situ, it appears, there existed some other temple or temples in the locality, from which some of the sculptures may have been collected. It is also not unlikely that a Buddhist temple also existed in the vicinity.
