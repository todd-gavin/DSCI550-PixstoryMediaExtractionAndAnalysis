Seriously ! 😅Balenciaga Collaborates With Lay's, Makes a Bag Which Exactly Looks Like the Packet of Chips :-
✨Luxury fashion brand, Balenciaga, is yet again grabbing headlines for an outright bizarre product that it recently launched. Balenciaga has launched a bag in collaboration with Lay's, the American potato chips brand.
👉As similar as they are to the packet of chips, the bags made their debut at the Paris Fashion Week. These bags have been released in three colours- blue, yellow and a mix of red and black. Not just this but the detailing of the bag also imitates the chips cover design. The only difference is the zip attached at the opening of the bag.
👉Since its launch, the images of these bags have gone viral on social media. The creative director of Balenciaga, Demna Gvasalia, posted pictures of the same on his account. In the caption, he wrote, “Balenciaga's next must-have bag, Lay’s-Branded Bag.”
