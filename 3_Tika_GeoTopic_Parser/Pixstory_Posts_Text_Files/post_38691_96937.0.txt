Eye For Goal

The fans usually expect that their centrebacks usually have goal-scoring abilities. Not much, but the expectation is to pop in during the crucial times to score, and Pau Torres does not disappoint. He has scored a total of 4 goals.

Transfer Rumors

Manchester United's defense has been in shambles this season. Last season the combination of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof was in the top 5 defenders in the Premier League.  This season with the addition of  Raphael Varane they have shipped in 51 goals this season. It led interim manager Ralf Rangnick to list potential defenders. The incoming gaffer Erik Ten Hag has sounded like he needs defensive reinforcements as a part of the rebuilding process.  Man United is looking to acquire Pau Torres to plug in the defensive gap. If he joins United his partnership with Harry Maguire will be great as Maguire is an aggressor and Torres's positioning is great. He can cover for him at the back.  


Tottenham had attempted to sign the Spanish left-footed center back in the January transfer window, but they were turned down. 


Now, Chelsea and Manchester City are looking for his signature. Big clubs won’t have a problem acquiring him if they sit down and try to negotiate his salary (his release clause is 70 million pounds). Villarreal will play Liverpool in the UCL semi final and all eyes will be on Torres, how he deals with Liverpool's front 3 and their fullbacks bombarding down the wing. 


Torres is destined to play in the Premier League and this summer, he might be donning a Premier League jersey. But at which club remains to be seen.
