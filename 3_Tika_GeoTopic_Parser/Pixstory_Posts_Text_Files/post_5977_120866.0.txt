Suchika started judo at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi, and later shifted to Dada Dev Mandir centre at Palam, Delhi, under the coach Vikram Solanki.

“A medal in the state championship in the very first year of my joining judo changed my perspective towards the sport and I decided to pursue it seriously. In 2007, I won my first medal at the national-level in the age group category and very next year I was among the top names in the senior’s category,” says Suchika, whose first international exposure was a World Cup in Paris in 2011. “Though I have been representing India regularly since 2011, my best performances at the international arena started coming after marriage. I got married in 2018 & after that I won two medals in Commonwealth Championships (silver - 2018 & gold - 2019) and also won two gold in the SAF Games. Marriage turned out to be a great blessing for my sports career. Kapil has always been a great support to me and before a husband, he is a friend,” adds Suchika.

After the 2019 senior national championship, Suchika switched her weight category from 48kg to 57kg. As she is around five feet five inches tall, so she was finding it difficult to maintain her body weight at 48kg. “In 2019, I decided to switch over to 57kg weight division and it’s paying dividends,” says the judoka.

“Last year in November, while participating in a reality TV show ‘India’s Ultimate Warrior’ Suchika hurt her right hand very badly. Doctors had told her to go for a surgery, but she didn’t opt for it, as surgery would keep her out of action for at least four-five months. The CWG trials were scheduled in that period, so surgery means missing the opportunity for which she made a lot of sacrifices and was training hard for the last couple of years. She put a sling on her hand and continued with the training and her hand healed on a natural process. I have seen her training even in pain, but that didn’t deter her from her target,” adds proud husband Kapil Hooda.
