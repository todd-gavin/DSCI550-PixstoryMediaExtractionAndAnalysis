I know there are lot of societal pressure that forcefully convince you that you are alright. But there is nothing as such . Mental Health is as equally important as Physical Health. Feel free to share with the person you are more close to everything with what it was troubling you inside... because of which you feel your heart beat pumped, goosebumps, oversleeping or no sleeping, anxiety... then you must encounter first to your close one. Don't hesitate to share. The person may look the situation in a broader way and give you a new perspective which can bring hope to you. Happiness, tears, anxiety, joy ...all kind of emotions are meant to share. The way you just share your happiness ...share your stress as well. Trust me it will relieve you.

Emotional pain is not something that should be hidden away and never spoken about. There is truth in your pain, there is growth in your pain, but only if it’s first brought out into the open.Take your time healing, as long as you want. Nobody else knows what you’ve been through. How could they know how long it will take to heal you? You don’t have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop letting them control you.
