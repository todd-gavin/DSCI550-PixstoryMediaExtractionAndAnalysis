I don’t know who needs to hear this, but I am still going to write it down. It is ‘OK’ to not be okay every day, it is okay to have some hard days, it is okay to not be able to give your 100 percent every day, and it is okay even if you fail some days.

We all are scared of failures, disappointments, and rejection, but we need to realize that these feelings are a part of life, and this is how life is... life is everything but a consistent graph. I don’t know anyone who has a perfect life graph. And come on, wouldn’t it be boring to have a perfect life graph with no learning and experiences? Doesn’t experience and challenges make us strong? Little bumps on our life graph are important. Moreover, I think they don’t depict our failure but our experience and learnings.

Falling, rejections, and bad experiences aren’t failures. The real failure is when we refuse to get up after falling and forget why we started.

So to all those who had rough days for the past few days or months or years...listen! You got it, and you will be okay and shining like a diamond soon. Meanwhile, let's appreciate the little things around us (just like this little flower) and be grateful.

It is all about time and patience. ♥️
