It seemed that the fall had left no aftermath, instead Marc Marquez stopped in the pits again due to a new episode of diplopia The problem that had stopped him last year is back even if it seems in a milder form In any case, the Spanish champion will have to stop in time indeterminate I seem to be experiencing dejavu On the return journey to Spain I started to have vision problems and we decided to see Dr. SÃ¡nchez Dalmau who confirmed that I have a new episode of diplopia Marquez wrote on social media Fortunately less serious from the injury I had at the end of last year but now it&#39;s time to rest and wait to see how the injury develops As always thank you all so much for your support
