Abstract 

Aims 

The aim of this viewpoint was to discuss a profound health gap in type 2 diabetes that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. 

Data synthesis 

In Australia, type 2 diabetes is ranked as the fastest growing chronic condition, with the rates of type 2 diabetes higher among Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australians. Improvements to diet could aid in reducing overweight and obesity in the Indigenous community, with sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) examples of discretionary foods that contain a high amount of sugar. The marked increase in type 2 diabetes, obesity and consumption of SSBs in the Indigenous community may suggest that type 2 diabetes may result from weight gain caused by SSB consumption. Recent evidence suggests that higher consumption of SSBs was associated with greater incidence of type 2 diabetes independent of adiposity. Some determinants influencing increased SSBs consumption in the Indigenous population include advertising, marketing, availability and affordability. 

Conclusions 

The prevalence rates of type 2 diabetes continue to be higher among Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australians and overall, a link between SSBs and risk of type 2 diabetes is reported. Three solutions to high SSBs consumption in Indigenous communities include increased availability, affordability, and accessibility of healthy food and drink, engagement of Indigenous people in offering solutions including discussion of a sugar tax on SSBs framed with Indigenous input, and the provision of clean community water supply and water bubblers.
