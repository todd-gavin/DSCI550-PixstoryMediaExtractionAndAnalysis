Fabio Quartararo increasingly master of the MotoGP World Championship The Frenchman won the German GP and further extended his lead in the general standings where he now leads with a points margin over Aleix Espargaro The race quickly became a formality for Quartararo who started very well at the start from second position and immediately leader thanks to Francesco Bagnaia&#39;s crash at the start of the third lap Another disappointment for the official Ducati rider after the pole position conquered yesterday and the Piedmontese brought heavy accusations against the Michelin tires The Borgo Panigale manufacturer consoles itself with second place from Johann Zarco and Jack Miller&#39;s third place that takes away the podium from Espargaro Ducati again in fifth and sixth position with Luca Marini and Jorge Martin The Italian manufacturer continues to prove itself to be the best bike but it lacks a rider who is able to have continuity in the results
