UEFA Women's Champions League has entered the showdown phase where the top four will contend for the coveted Euro title when the first leg of the semi-finals begins tomorrow.

The UWCL semi-finalists have 10 titles and 18 final appearances between them. Let's look down at their journeys to the semi-finals:

1. Barcelona vs Wolfsburg

>>Barcelona (ESP, holders)

UEFA ranking (end of 2020/21): 2
How they qualified: Holders, Spanish champions
Group stage: Group C winners (W6 D0 L0 F24 A1)
Quarter-finals: W8-3agg vs Real Madrid (W3-1a, W5-2h)
Top scorer (group stage onward): Alexia Putellas 8
Last season: Winners
Domestic honours: 7 x league champions, 8 x cup winners
Previous European best: Winners (2020/21)
Semi-final record: W2 L2

Campaign in a nutshell:

Their group headway was never in doubt after the opening 4-1 defeat of Arsenal and their executions throughout matched the domination they showed in beating Chelsea 4-0 in last season's final. That continued against Madrid as they had to come from behind in both legs, doing so in style and thrilling the record 91,553 crowds at Camp Nou!

Barcelona were the first Spanish finalist in 2019 and winners two years later.

>>Wolfsburg (GER)

UEFA coefficient ranking (end of 2020/21): ﻿3
How they qualified: German league runners-up; W5-5agg (3-0pens) vs Bordeaux
Group stage: Group A winners (W3 D2 L1 F17 A7)

Domestic honours: 6 x league champions, 8 x cup winners
Previous European best: Winners (2012/13, 2013/14)
Semi-final record: W5 L1


Campaign in a nutshell:

They needed penalties to beat Bordeaux to a group stage berth, then let a 3-1 lead slip away against Chelsea before picking up just one point from two games against Juve.


Already decimated by injuries, Wolfsburg's prospects were hanging by a thread, but they beat Servette and, more importantly, old rivals Chelsea 4-0 to reach the final eight dramatically.


After being beaten in the last minute by Arsenal in the quarter-finals, the Germans produced another strong effort at home to reach the semis.

Wolfsburg has reached seven semi-finals in their ten European campaigns since their 2012/13 debut.
