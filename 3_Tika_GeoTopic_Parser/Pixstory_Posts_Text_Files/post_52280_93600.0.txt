For me home is a place where i can feel at ease ,where i can feel peaceful like heaven.
Home for me is a place which contains everything i will need -a fridge full of pantry,a wardrobe full of clothes yet there always be a place for new items.
Home for me is a place where i would keep all my achievements,which i will decorate with passion, which will have enough space to accommodate everything i wish for .
The most important thing for a home is that it should always be full of people whom you love - can be family members,can be a pet.
