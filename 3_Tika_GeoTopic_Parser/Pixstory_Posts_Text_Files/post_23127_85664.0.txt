Dal suo account di Instagram, Sting prende posizioni sul conflitto in Ucraina. “Per gli ucraini che lottano con coraggio e per i russi che protestano”.

Ecco il testo integrale che accompagna l’esecuzione su Theofficialsting on Instagram.

“I’ve only rarely sung this song in the many years since it was written, because I never thought it would be relevant again. But, in the light of one man’s bloody and woefully misguided decision to invade a peaceful, unthreatening neighbor, the song is, once again, a plea for our common humanity. For the brave Ukrainians fighting against this brutal tyranny and also the many Russians who are protesting this outrage despite the threat of arrest and imprisonment - We, all of us, love our children. Stop the war”.
