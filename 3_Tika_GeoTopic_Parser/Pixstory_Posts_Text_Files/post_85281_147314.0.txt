#3 Karim Benzema
Karim Benzema played a vital role in Real Madrid's successful campaign last season. He was at the top of his game, helping the Spanish side win the domestic title and Champions League. He is already a strong contender for the 2022 Ballon d’Or.
The French striker’s contract which he signed in 2021, will expire at the end of the ongoing season. Though the club is already in talks to extend his stay for another year, an official announcement is yet to be made. Considering his form, the Whites will be more than happy to keep him in the squad.
#4 Marcus Rashford
Marcus Rashford will be a free agent in the summer of 2023 as his contract expires, which he signed with the Red Devils in 2019. Though the club could trigger an additional year of stay, they are yet to make a decision on him as no talks have been initiated till now.
The 24-year-old forward is a promising talent who is yet to reach the peak of his powers. If the English club doesn’t renew, several other clubs will be running behind him to acquire his services. It will be interesting to see how Rashford performs at the Qatar World Cup for the England national team.
#5 N’Golo Kante
N’Golo Kante is arguably one of the best defensive midfielders across the globe. He is a tank on the field as he has incredible stamina and is technically strong. With Chelsea, the Frenchman has won almost all the trophies possible. But he has been struggling with injuries for the past two years.
On that fact, the Blues are offering him a two-year contract with an option to extend it for 12 months. However, the Frenchman is forcing a contract which would see him stay long at Stamford Bridge. If the terms don't match, Kante will probably leave the club after completing his contract.
