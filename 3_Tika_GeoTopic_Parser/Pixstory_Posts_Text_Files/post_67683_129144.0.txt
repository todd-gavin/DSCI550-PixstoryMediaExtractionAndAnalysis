Everybody knows about biryani and raita, but have you ever come across Biryani and waffles? Quite an exquisite combination let me assure you guys!! 
Vadodara is a new city for me and I am all about exploring food from different corners of the city. So today I ventured out to the Hyderabadi's to check out their special on the chef's menu that is Boneless Chicken Tikka Biryani and since I am from, you can say The land of Byriani that is Kolkata, I've realized that different places have a unique notion of spices when it comes to biryani. So, one can't really measure it on the basis of whether it tastes good or not. In Hyderabadi's I found the rice to be too spicy but nevertheless it was so damn yumm!!! 
Our next stop was at Santushti and we had to check out their lip smacking collection of waffles! I think Kit kat Ferrero rocher chocolate rush waffles was the highlight of my day since this was the first time I had ever tasted waffles and it was bomb honestly! 
Waiting for tomorrow's day to kick in!!!
