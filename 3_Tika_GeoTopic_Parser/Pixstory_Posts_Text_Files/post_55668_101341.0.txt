Allegra Spender, a Sydney businesswoman, is the daughter of a conservative federal lawmaker and the granddaughter of a conservative cabinet minister. She has an impeccable pedigree for a career in Australian politics. 

Critics say that more shocking than her choice to run for office is her decision to run as a high-profile candidate for a breakaway political party that has emerged as a major challenge to the ruling Conservative Party ahead of Saturday's elections.

ABC News reported that Spender is described as a "teal independent," referring to his preference for a greener hue than the Liberal Party's typical blue. The goal of the 22 teal independents is to sway moderate voters who are concerned about government inaction on climate change away from Liberal candidates in seats that have traditionally been considered conservative strongholds. 

Because they are primarily supported by Climate 200, a campaign war chest formed by billionaire former Liberal Party donor Simon Holmes Ã  Court, conservatives label them "fake" independents.

Critics argue Climate 200 is akin to a political party. But the teal candidates insist their funding comes with no strings attached, leaving them truly independent.
