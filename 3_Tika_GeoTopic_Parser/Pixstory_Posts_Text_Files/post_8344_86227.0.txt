Indiaâ€™s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme embarked on a crucial phase on Wednesday with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited(HAL) starting the manufacturing activities in association with Aeronautical Development Agency. The news was announced on HAL's official Twitter handle.

The AMCA programme plans to equip the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Navy with a 5th Generation twin-engine stealth fighter.

While the design and development will be carried out by HAL and ADA, the private sector will also be roped in to manufacture the combat jet. 

The AMCA will be a multi-role fighter capable of carrying out air superiority, ground strike, suppression of enemy air defences and electronic warfare missions.

The fighter is likely to be ready for the first test flight by 2024-25 while the production is expected after 2030.

PS: AMCA is nothing less than a dream project for Indian Defence Industry, if it fructifies in the stipulated timeline, it's not only gonna give India a winning edge in future war scenarios vis a vis its arch-rivals (mainly China), but it will also project the national defence industry at the global level as a reliable, defence manufacturing hub of modern-day warfare technologies.

Still, it's too early to ascertain as to how things are gonna play out in the time to come but this update surely comes as a sigh of relief after the project almost went into limbo with clouds of uncertainty hanging around.
