New details of our past are coming to light hiding in the nooks and crannies of the world as we refine our techniques to go looking for them Most lauded is the reconstruction of the evolution of humanity since our African origins around years ago by analysing our living and fossil DNA Replete with the ghosts of African and Eurasian populations of the deep past these have been resurrected only through the ability of science to reach into the world of the minuscule by studying biomolecules Now digital analysis of rock surfaces reveals how other ghosts of the deep past this time from almost years ago in North America have been coaxed into the light Writing in the journal Antiquity Professor Jan Simek of the University of Tennessee and colleagues have published images of giant glyphs carved into the mud surface of the low ceiling of a cave in Alabama The motifs which depict human forms and animals are some of the largest known cave images found in North America and may represent spirits of the underworld In the first image below a drawing of a diamondback rattlesnake an animal sacred to indigenous people in the south eastern US stretches almost metres long The next one down shows a human figure just over m in length In terms of dating the findings ancient people rejuvenated a light in the cave a flaming torch of American bamboo by stubbing it against the cave s wall This left a residue that the researchers were able to date with radiocarbon to AD This was also in accord with the age of pottery fragments ancient artists left in the cave The problem is seeing the paintings The cave ceiling is only cm high which makes stepping back to view the large images impossible They were revealed only through a technique called photogrammetry in which thousands of overlapping photographs of an object or place are taken from different angles and digitally combined in D Read more
