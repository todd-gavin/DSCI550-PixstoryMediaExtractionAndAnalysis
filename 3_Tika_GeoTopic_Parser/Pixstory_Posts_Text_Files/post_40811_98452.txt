Five years have past five summers with the length Of five long winters and again I hear These waters rolling from their mountain springs With a soft inland murmur Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs That on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect The landscape with the quiet of the sky The day is come when I again repose Here under this dark sycamore and view These plots of cottage ground these orchard tufts Which at this season with their unripe fruits Are clad in one green hue and lose themselves Mid groves and copses Once again I see These hedge rows hardly hedge rows little lines Of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms Green to the very door and wreaths of smoke Sent up in silence from among the trees With some uncertain notice as might seem Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods Or of some Hermit s cave where by his fire The Hermit sits alone These beauteous forms Through a long absence have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man s eye But oft in lonely rooms and mid the din Of towns and cities I have owed to them In hours of weariness sensations sweet Felt in the blood and felt along the heart And passing even into my purer mind With tranquil restoration feelings too Of unremembered pleasure such perhaps As have no slight or trivial influence On that best portion of a good man s life His little nameless unremembered acts Of kindness and of love Nor less I trust Of aspect more sublime that blessed mood In which the burthen of the mystery In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world Is lightened that serene and blessed mood In which the affections gently lead us on Until the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended we are laid asleep In body and become a living soul While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony and the deep power of joy We see into the life of things William Wordsworth
