Multiple explosions were reported near the major airport in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, just after Russia began a military intervention in the country, according to media sources. 

CNN said that numerous explosions were recorded in the Boryspil neighbourhood to the east of the capital. At least two big explosions were reported in the early hours of Thursday, according to the American broadcaster.

ANI reported that announcing a special "military operation" in the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to "consequences".
