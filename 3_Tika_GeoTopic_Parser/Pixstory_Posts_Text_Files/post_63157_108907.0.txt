By the end of 2027, Ericsson estimates 5G subscriptions in India to account for about 40% of all mobile subscriptions, with over 500 million customers. Despite the fact that 5G services have yet to launch in the world's second-largest smartphone market, the Ericsson mobility report highlights the strong demand for data connectivity and digital services, which is resulting in the addition of hundreds of millions of new mobile broadband subscribers each year. 

During the first quarter of 2022 alone, almost 70 million 5G subscriptions were added. According to the estimate, roughly three-quarters of the world's population would have access to 5G by 2027.
