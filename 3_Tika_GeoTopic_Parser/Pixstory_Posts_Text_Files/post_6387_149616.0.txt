It has been close to 6 months since I underwent FFS.( facial feminization surgery) this is a gender affirming surgery that helps some trans women have a better life and mental health.  I can attest that the benefits have been amazing. Iâ€™m at one of the highest points of my career and part of it has to do with my gained confidence and comfort of living authentically in my personal life but also in my career as a luxury boutique director.
