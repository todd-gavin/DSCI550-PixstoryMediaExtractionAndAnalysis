Just finished watching Season 4 Volume 1 of Stranger Things, available on Netflix and one thing I want to say is that season by season Stranger Things is getting better and this season is also the same.

Season 4 started from the point where Season 3 ended where Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Max, Steve, Robin and Nancy stayed in Hawkins but their friends Will, Eleven, Jonathan and their mother Joyce left Hawkins because of the scary past but the writers of the series cannot see them happy and they add another antagonist in this series which is Vecna.

Vecna is one of the greatest villains in Dungeons and Dragons and he is living upside down and right now he is killing people and Vecna becomes the talk of the town when he attacked Max but somehow she survived because of the help from her friends.

There are 4 stories which are going on simultaneously this season and they are interconnected to each other which made this season super gripping. 

The first story is about the friends in Hawkins who are finding a way to tackle Vecna, the second story is about Joyce and Murray who are trying to rescue Hopper from a Russian jail, and the third story is about Eleven and she is trying to get her powers back by having the treatment in Hawkins Lab where she got to know a lot about her past and Elevenâ€™s side of the story is very important in this season and last story is about Mike, Will, Jonathan and their new friend Argyle and they are trying to find Eleven.

Every episode of Stranger Things is so good that you can binge all 7 episodes at once and you will get involved with all the characters.

At last, I will strongly recommend you all to watch Stranger things if you are a fan of genres like Horror, a little bit of comedy, emotional drama and action.
