Beautiful Queen Elizabeth, may you rest in peace. You will be cherished for your fidelity to your country, your dignity, fairness, and beauty as a woman. My sincere condolences go out to your family and friends. You were a queen but you were also very much the queen of the people. We, in America, will keep you and your people in our thoughts.
