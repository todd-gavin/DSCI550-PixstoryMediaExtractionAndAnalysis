In 1962, Yale economics student Fred Smith wrote a paper about the automation of society and the transportation of goods.
While business was booming, the company struggled to keep pace with rising fuel costs. Suffocating in debt, FedEx resorted to extreme measures such as pilots using personal credit cards to pay for fuel.
It didn't matter, nothing could stop the bleeding. In 1973, FedEx had just $5,000 left in the bank. 
What does one do when they need to create thousands of dollars out of thin air?
 Take a trip to Sin City and roll the dice.
Smith withdrew the company's remaining cash and headed to Las Vegas for a night.
His game of choice?
Blackjack.
Fortune favors the bold, and Smith had a hot hand that night. 24 hours and $27,000 later, Fred wired all of the funds back to FedEx's bank account, and they were able to keep the lights on for another week. â€œThe $27,000 wasn't decisive, but it was an omen that things would get better," Smith said.
After his Vegas detour, Smith successfully raised $11M in additional capital, and they turned profitable in 1976.

In an essay published by Forbes, Smith wrote, "No business school graduate would recommend gambling as a financial strategy, but sometimes it pays to be a little crazy early in your career."
Obviously, management execution played an outsized role in FedEx's success, but luck favours the brave!

Story of Tesla, and Apple are part of folklore.
In 2000, just one month before the Dot Com crash, Amazon sold $672M in convertible bonds on the European markets. Had the e-commerce giant waited just two weeks later, it would likely be remembered as another Pets.com.
One hiccup in Tesla's production, a bit of pettiness from Bill Gates, or a week's hesitation and we could live in a world with no Teslas, no iPhones, and no Amazon Prime. Instead, these three companies are worth trillions of dollars.

Incidentally, Fred Smith has now stepped down and appointed and appointed Raj Subramaniam as his successor.
