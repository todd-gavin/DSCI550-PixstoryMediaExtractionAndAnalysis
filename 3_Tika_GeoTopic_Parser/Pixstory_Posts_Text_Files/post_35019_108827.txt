The era of Gianmarco Pozzecco as coach of the national basketball team has officially begun There will be a friendly against Slovenia to be played on Saturday and the chosen city is Trieste where Pozzecco was born and began his career which has led him as a player to great achievements including a silver at the Athens Olympics Now on the bench, however, something that is not new for him that comes from the scudetto won in Milan but certainly a first with the blue Being a coach is an enormous responsibility, greater than when I was playing When I started, few thought that I would reach Serie A A or in the national team And I never created expectations about the fact that I could become a coach It has always been like this and my satisfaction is even greater His arrival on the bench immediately made us think of a return of some players of advanced age but with sure performance like Daniel Hackett or Marco Belinelli Pozzecco immediately wanted to stop the enthusiasm Delicate chapter For me the most difficult part because I feel the need to create a harmonic group he said If I received no No at most no because we haven&#39;t discussed it They have to disconnect then there hear Out of ethics since I was in Milan I didn&#39;t talk to the Virtus players I want to do it in person or by phone If they say no I&#39;ll understand because they are extremely serious guys I have great respect for them I know what it means to manage a career and age that advances The national team must be lived with seriousness and as an opportunity It gives unique emotions They don&#39;t have to say yes because we are friends or we have played together We are not going to eat a pizza
