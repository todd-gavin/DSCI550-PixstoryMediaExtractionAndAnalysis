Divorce has a significant impact on the parent-child connection. The amount and quality of contact between children and non-custodial parents—usually fathers—tends to decline, while the relationship with the custodial parent—usually the mother—becomes tense.

Furthermore, divorce necessitates a clear definition of child rights in the current environment, as well as how they must be represented in a divorce case. Divorce is a traumatic event for all children, regardless of their age or maturity level.

In the post-divorce period, some children are left with a guilty conscience, especially if they were a frequent witness to the parents' conflict. They are left wondering what they did to bring about the divorce. Furthermore, in older age groups, the assumption of hyper-maturity is prevalent, as youngsters frequently assume adult responsibilities in order to keep the custodial parent's household in order.

Children are unquestionably distressed by divorce. Outside of the family, the youngster has a difficult time trying to fit into a narrow-minded culture because of the stigma of divorce. Children who see their parents' divorce have lower educational prospects than children who grow up in intact families. The physiological behaviour of the child is the most evident influence within the family.

It is sad that even after all of this, many parents go ahead and put their children through this misery. Compromising is always an option. You have brought a child to this world, it's your responsibility to do anything in your power to protect them.
