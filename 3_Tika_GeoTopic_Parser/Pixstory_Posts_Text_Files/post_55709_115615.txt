According to Catherine King the minister of infrastructure some of the projects promised by the previous Coalition administration will be impossible to complete As per The Guardian she claims Barnaby Joyce her predecessor left behind a substantial mess after lavishing Nationals seats with taxpayer funded largesse Some people I know are calling this cheating because continuing the inland train and developing infrastructure for the Melbourne Commonwealth Games and the Brisbane Olympics were among King s goals in an interview with Guardian Australia although she said that several projects ordered by the previous administration would be cancelled So can we say that we were warned I am still on the fence about this To be honest I m a bit shocked at what I m finding in terms of the way in which the previous government used this portfolio she said As per news portals King said all of Labor s election promises on infrastructure over m would be given a merits review by her department with projects to be scrapped if they don t stack up Furthermore she committed to greater transparency around discretionary grant funding decisions and clearer guidelines and more regular rounds of applications for grants as priorities in her role Let s see what happens next
