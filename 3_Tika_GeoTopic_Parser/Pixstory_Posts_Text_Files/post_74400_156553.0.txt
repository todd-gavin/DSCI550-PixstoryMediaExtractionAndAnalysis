In an exclusive interview, Debina Bonnerjee opened up on how she dealt with trolling after announcing her second pregnancy. 💯The actress said, “I feel it was unnecessary, but I feel as actors that is the world that we have chosen, of being exposed to the world. If I had not been a public figure, not a lot of people would have come to know about it, and not a lot of people would have dissected or bisected it and thought more than I have thought about it. 💯So, I think it comes along with the love and adulation that we get so if I’m taking the ‘Wow, this is nice’ (appreciation) I have to take that (trolling) also. I think over the years I have learned that.”✅Debina further added that the comments did affect her because she knew that would happen as they have been in the industry for such a long time.💯 She said, “We have got the opinion of people, for eg. ‘You don’t look good in this, You don’t look good with this person, That person looks better with the Heroine .’ And I have always taken this, so I know people judge your situation at the drop of a hat, and this is going to come. 💯So, even before we spoke out to people, I was anticipating it, it took me some time to tell the world so that they understand and are not as harsh as they would be otherwise. ✔️So it (the trolling) was all anticipated, and then we came out, and it happened. It is not that I came out, and then it came as a shock. Our life has taught us that it would come, and it came.”👍👍👍
