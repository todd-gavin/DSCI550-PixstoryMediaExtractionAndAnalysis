Caught his little fragile hands tight, 
Touched his body parts and made him cry
Little did the lad know... what happened with him was even right ?
Yes he was a victim of sex  crime. 
I who witnessed it chose to remain quiet,
Rest in peace my inner voice
My silence haunted me every night. 
Oh god! Save these kids from the evil eyes
Guide the lost with a bright ray of light.
