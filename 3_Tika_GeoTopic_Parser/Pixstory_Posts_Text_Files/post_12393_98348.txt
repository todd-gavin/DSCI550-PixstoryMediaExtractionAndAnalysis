Have you often felt nothingness or the blah feeling Well I know procrastination would be on high point during this time and the thoughts just comes in ugh I know it s just too much of thoughts This feeling could resolve in days or weeks which is well and good But if this persists it could be because of many reasons This could be because of any physical factors like lack of sleep exhaution and so on Other possibilities are mental and emotional factors like boredom grief depression or other memtal issues Now to get over this feeling of Emptiness is through enrolling yourselves into some works that keeps you going It could be maybe signing up for a dance class of any form so that you could be totally involved into it Or you yourself can also get out from it through your own ways of coping like maintaining a journal or drawing and so Other method could be by talking to your close friend who is ready to hear you This could be effective because you could be possibly building thoughts in your mind but the listener will be able to identify your problem and could suggest you some ways to come out from it Gently acknowledge the emptiness You need to first accept that you feel empty acknowledge it and be gentle upon yourself Save time for yourself every day Keep some time for yourself maybe you could think about some moments that made you smile or laugh out in your whole day Contemplate on it and that can ease you down Explore your current feelings Keep a timer for minutes and observe what you are feeling right in that moment Practice self care While you go through this phase you may tend to not take care of yourself Maybe too much of sleep or less intake of food could happen But just make sure you are having a better sleep and better appetite Take each step by step let s not rush to the final destination immediately Each step carries you to your goal I know it s hard but don t loose yourself in the process
