Fundamental victory in terms of salvation for Cagliari who beat Sassuolo thanks to Deiola&#39;s goal and I hope to see them so excited in Genoa too Today we dominated in the first half and maybe we were too hasty in the last few passes since there was a great desire to score a goal it&#39;s a shame we only won Now a tough team like Genoa awaits us now we&#39;re enjoying the Easter but nothing has been done yet and therefore we will already have to start concentrating on the next match If I don&#39;t get into trouble I&#39;m not happy I experienced a championship like this at Reggina then luckily I no longer fought for these goals being able to save yourself would be like winning two badges
