The Oscar winning Parasite is one of the best movies in all of cinema, Director Bong Joon-Ho is known for ending his films in places ending his films in places that often find the hero right back where they started and Parasite is no exception. The ending of the movie brought us one of the most unexpected twists anyone ever seen. But there are a lot of stuff that you might have missed.

Lets see where the Kim family stands once the credits roll.

The movie begins with min giving Ki-woo a rock, this rock is actually a metaphor for the entire film. The rock symbolises wealth,and when Ki-woo ends up getting jobs for his entire family with the parks he begins the process of finally making something of himself but wealth isn't a black or white idea holding on to wealth could be poisonous just as much as beneficial and this is why Bong Joon-Ho went a dark route with the ending of his movie so that it could reflect the equally dark reality of living poor and trying to become something more. When the basement dweller Geun-sae escapes his confines in the park house he attacks ki-woo but ki-woo was on his way to take care of the loose end anyway with the rock as his weapon. But, Instead of Geun-sae he get hit and left severely injured as havoc is wrought on the park family and their guests during their son's birthday party. The rock is no longer a hopeful tool but one that causes devastation Mr. Kim who is being forced by Mr. Park to play cowboys and Indians with the children is outraged when Mr. Park expects him to grab the keys and drive his son Da-Song to the hospital with absolutely no regard for others who are hurt including Mr. Kim's daughter Ki-jung while they are being attacked Mrs. Kim stabs Geun-sae, the keys end up under his body Mr. Park runs to grab the keys but holds his nose to avoid the smell of the man who's been living in his basement.
