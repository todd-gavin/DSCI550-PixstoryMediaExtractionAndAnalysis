As the Italian Federation of Pediatricians FIMP we thank the Minister of Health Roberto Speranza for the extension of the terms of the dematerialized prescription Now we need to continue in the direction of simplifying the certificates for primary and secondary school students affected by Coronavirus And what the president of the FIMP said today Antonio D Avino after the publication in the Official Gazette last March of the Legislative Decree with urgent provisions for overcoming the measures to contrast the spread of the Covid epidemic In particular, the article paragraph establishes new rules for participation in integrated digital teaching DDI We need to slash the bureaucracy and make it easier for families to access digital services for pupils and consequently the work of family pediatricians continues Dr D Avino This does not currently happen and we therefore make two concrete proposals to the institutions All students in solitary confinement must be automatically considered suitable for DDI unless they present a certification of temporal unsuitability To access the DDI, an official certificate and therefore a positive swab presented by the parent to the school manager should be sufficient.
