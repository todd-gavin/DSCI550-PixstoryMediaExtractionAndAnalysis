While abortion debate is heating up in the west, the Supreme Court todayallowed an unmarried woman to abort a 23-week pregnancy.
The termination will be subject to the report by a medical board at AIIMS. Earlier, the Delhi High Court had refused to let the woman undergo abortion on the grounds that the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules 2021, do not extend the 24-week limit to unmarried women.

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971
was amended in 2021. In this amendment abortion limit was increased to 20 weeks from 24 but for some categories-victims of rape victims, minors,
or women wanting to change in marital status
during pregnancy (widowhood and divorce). Parents who diagnosed foetal after 24 weeks are also allowed termination. 
Todayâ€™s judgment however extended to I married women without the above criterion for abortion.
