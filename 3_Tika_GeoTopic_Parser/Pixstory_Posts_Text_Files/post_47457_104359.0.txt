In the 2022 UEFA Nations League action this week, Slovenia will host Sweden at the Stozice Stadium on Thursday night.

Slovenia missed out on qualifying for both the European Championship and the World Cup this year, having last competed in the former in 2000 and the latter in 2010.

Meanwhile, the hosts are ready to make their League B debut in the competition this week after spending the previous two editions in the lower division.

Sweden lost both of its final two FIFA World Cup qualifying games, dropping out of the top slot in the group and into the playoffs.

They subsequently went on to lose 2-0 in the final against Poland, therefore eliminating their World Cup hopes. As a result, Sweden's focus will now shift to the Nations League.

The Blagult had a disappointing season last year, placing last in their group after winning only one of their six games, and will be hoping for better fortune this time.
