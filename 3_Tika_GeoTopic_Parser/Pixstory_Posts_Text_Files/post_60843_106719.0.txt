I personally love exploring different places. Especially historical ones.

Victoria Memorial Hall (built between 1906-1921) is another British era relic that was dedicated to Queen Victoria. I liked the architecture and the surrounding gardens.

Even though the place was dedicated to Queen Victoria, it now honours Indian freedom fighters like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and houses historical relics containing their memory.

If you're looking for a good day out in Kolkata, visit the Victoria memorial hall and then walk down to Birla planetarium for a quick astronomical show or the St. Paul's Cathedral for some calm and quiet.
