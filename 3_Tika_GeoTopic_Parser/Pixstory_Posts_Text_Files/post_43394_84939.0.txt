Do you know how traditional gender roles and stereotypes can affect children?
Boys from a very tender age try "being tough" and take this as an important trait. They are being taught not to cry because according to people "girls cry but boy don't". This has been in trend for decades, because people expect boys to be strong and strong poeple do not cry.

There are specific types of stereotypes which are based on traits, abilities, and motivations of males and females, which eventually results in sexism. Sexism usually leads to the belief that one gender is intrinsically superior to another. 
Worldwide, men have conformed to some stereotypes and agreed that people tried pushing them in an unhealthy manner.
The unhealthy stereotypes related to men are- self sufficiency, acting tough, rigid gender roles, hyper sexuality, aggression and controlling and many more.

The most stupid of all "stereotypical" statements I've heard is - "That men love blue and girls love pink".

What's the most silliest statement have YOU heard?
