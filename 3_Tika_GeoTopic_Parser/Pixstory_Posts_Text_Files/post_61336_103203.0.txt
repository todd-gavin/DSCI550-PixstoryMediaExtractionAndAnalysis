Today I woke up a little late and I saw that both of my parents had gone to their work.I woke up around 11:30 in the morning because I had slept very late last night.Then I found that nobody was there at home except my grandma and she was chanting prayers.She called me up and said that your breakfast is ready , go and wash your face and brush your teeth. Then I had my breakfast and called my mommy. She gave me a surprise by calling me at a caffe in Sector 10. There I got surprised to see my lovely Seema massi. I was very excited and happy to see her after a long time. I also met with Saurabh sir who inspired me for creative writing. Together we spent quality time and enjoyed every moment in the company of my favourite massi and Saurabh sir. As usual me and massi talked about exchanging of shoes but unfortunately the deal couldn’t be settled due to size issues.But massi had nothing to give to me finally she removed her apple watch strap and gave it to me as a gift . For me it’s a very special and memorable gift
