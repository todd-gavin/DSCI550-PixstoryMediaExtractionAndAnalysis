Jesus was recorded to have said seven phrases when he was hung up on the cross for all to see. The sixth phrase he uttered was ‘It is finished’.

When he said that, he was referring not to his own life but the purpose for which he was sent down to the earth according to the Christian belief.

He was sent down to be the ‘sacrificial lamb’ and take the punishment of for the songs all mankind, for all generations to come. 

Great to see my grandmother up there explaining one of the phrases even at this age.

May we all have a blessed Good Friday 🙏🏼
