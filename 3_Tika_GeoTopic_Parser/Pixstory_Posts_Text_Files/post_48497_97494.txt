In Mark Jesus says that whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven they are guilty of an eternal sin Matthew s account adds that even blasphemy against the Son of Man will be forgiven but not blasphemy against the Holy Spirit Matthew What is this unforgivable sin and why is it associated with the Holy Spirit Doesn t the blood of Christ cover every sin Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit Mark gives us some help for interpretation by noting that He said this because they were saying He has an impure spirit Mark Jesus has been healing the sick and casting out demons in the power the Holy Spirit Matthew Luke Yet the religious leaders attribute the work of the Spirit to Satan Mark In other words they look right into the light and then turn to the darkness The key to the unpardonable sin then seems to lie in the role of the Holy Spirit which is to reveal God and draw people to the truth Anyone who rejects the work of the Spirit in their life is essentially rejecting any hope of salvation John Corinthians And so I tell you every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come Matthew
