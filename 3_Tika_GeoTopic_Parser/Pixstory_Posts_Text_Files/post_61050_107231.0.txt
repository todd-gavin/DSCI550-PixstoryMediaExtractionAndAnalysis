As a result, things never get too intense even while heavy themes are explored- the course of the film is punctuated with jabs of relief (“pillow moments”, as Miyazaki refers to them) which is an essentiality for every kids’ movie. This enchantment is only furthered through the backdrops- which unlike the CGI of Disney, are purposeful, conscious. As accurately stated by the legend himself, “crowds of people are not a miserable, faceless bunch. They make up society”. 

Another integral component of his films is that they have a therapeutic, optimistic quality (and message too once the studio started complying with Western-animation happy-ending strategy since Kiki’s Delivery Service). Essentially, what lies at the heart of Miyazaki’s work is his love of life- in fact, he has professed to finding motivation when he thinks back and tries to untangle how his mother, who passed away due to cancer when he was young, could have lived more fully. This, it seems, sparked the meticulous observations- that came to encompass the dominance of the human spirit (in every aspect) spilled over all his work.

This enchantment, the blending of all these aspects into something that becomes difficult to localise, is also what manages to keep adult-viewers, already familiar with the whims of the story, at their tiptoes to be able to truly engulf themselves in this experience. There are minute details of innumerable stories, brimming at the borders of possibility, within the frame of one- thus, wholly being able to capture any viewer’s attention, irrespective of their age.

The interweaving of these elements allows an almost effortless transition between worlds and plots, allowing softworld building to thrive. To be able to seamlessly tap into this methodology requires a truly proficient storyteller, which time and again Miyazaki has proven himself to be.
