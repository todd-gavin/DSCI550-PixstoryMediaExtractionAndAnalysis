Over the years we have witnessed several iconic goals in football that will be etched in our memories forever. Of all these goals, bicycle kicks have been the most pleasing to the eyes. The bicycle kick is undoubtedly one of the most delicate and creative moves and is one of the most spectacular sights to behold on a football pitch. It is considered a fantastic football play due to the odd sight of an upside-down completion with the boot over one's head, the striker appearing to hang in midair for an outrageously long period of time, or even just the pinpoint accuracy and beauty of the touch.
Few players have the courage to attempt this move since it is so difficult. Although mastering it and executing it is not for everyone, we have seen certain players performing this kick to produce memorable moments for a lifetime. 
On that note, let’s take a look at the five best bicycle kicks in the history of football. 
Cristiano Ronaldo- Real Madrid vs Juventus (4th April 2018)
Cristiano Ronaldo is unarguably one of the best strikers in football history and has given the world many iconic goals and moments to remember. One such moment was created by him in a much important UEFA Champions League Quarter-Final against Juventus in 2018. 
Ronaldo scored the incredible bicycle kick by leaping 7.5 feet in the air. He received a cross from Martin Vasquez and launched himself high into the air to execute a beautiful bicycle kick that sailed past Gigi Buffon into the Juventus goal. The goal was so great that not only the Real Madrid fans but the home Juventus fans in Turin also couldn’t resist themselves from giving a standing ovation for that effort. It was one of the few moments in football when opposition fans applauded for a goal.
