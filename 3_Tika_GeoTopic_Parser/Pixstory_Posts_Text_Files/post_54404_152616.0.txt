The stakes could not have been higher as Liz Truss delivered her first party conference speech as prime minister. Against a backdrop of economic chaos, open party warfare and polling that shows she’s on course for a spectacular election loss, Truss insisted she was “determined to get us through the tempest”.Perhaps unsurprisingly given the circumstances, the speech was short, at just 25 minutes. Pundits expected her to say little that would spook the markets or shake her audience. And, indeed, she hardly dwelt on the chaos her mini-budget triggered. Instead, she doubled down, emphasising that growth was her main priority and the only way forward.She linked economic growth with people’s everyday struggles and, notably, began talking of “levelling up” – a move probably designed to recall Boris Johnson’s election winning formula.Growth, growth, growthTruss introduced her plan to rebuild Britain through reform and deregulation, by referencing her childhood growing up in Paisley and Leeds, witnessing boarded-up shops, people turning to drugs and families not eating. “For too long, our economy has not grown as strongly as it should have,” she said, emphasising that low growth means fewer wages, lagging regions falling even further behind and the UK falling behind other countries.She thus positioned growth as the best – and only – strategy on individual, national and international levels. She was adamant in her support for “dynamic” Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, with whom she said she was in “complete lockstep”.The relationship between prime minister and chancellor really has to work. Truss will have been keen to emphasise their agreement, particularly as earlier interviews hinted at some disagreement. She will also have been keen to avoid providing fault lines for rebels and opponents to chip away at, perhaps thinking of the fractious relationship former prime minister, Theresa May, had with her own chancellor, Philip Hammond.Read more: https://theconversation.com/liz-truss-what-her-conservative-party-conference-speech-revealed-191917
