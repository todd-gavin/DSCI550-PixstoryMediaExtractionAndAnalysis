India won the toss against Sri Lanka in the first test of the two test series and the Indian captain Rohit Sharma opted to bat first. Mayank Agarwal and Rohit Sharma opened the innings and both could not score big. Hanuma Vihari scored a half century and established himself as an anchor. Virat Kohli plays his 100th test but could not score big as he got out scoring just 45. Rishab Pant played in his usual quick fire fashion and scored 96 off 97 balls but Suranga Lakmal did not let him score a century. India currently stand at 357-6 with both Indian veteran all rounders Ashwin and Jadeja at the crease. 

Lasith Embuldeniya was a standout bowler from the Sri Lankan bowling attack as he picked both Mayank Agarwal and Virat Kohli's wickets. Suranga Lakmal, Vishwa Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Dhananjaya de Silva all picked up one wickets each. 

India will look to score 450+ before letting their bowlers take a chance at the Sri Lankan batsmen. With the shocking news of Australian Legendary spinner Shane Warne's passing away players will probably be wearing black bands to express their condolences.
