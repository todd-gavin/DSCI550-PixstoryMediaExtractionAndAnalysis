After Barthez and Lloris, a keeper with solid performances and techniques. 

When AC Milan crowned champions of Italy after 11 years, change at the goal was also important. When they lost Donnarumma, who is a good shot stopper, moved to French club PSG seeking glory, Milan found their solution also from France, Lille, for just 13 mln Euro initial fee. He proved to be real worthy, more valuable with 18 clean sheets, shot stopper and better with foot. 

Maignan was born to a Haitian mother and French father. He is a PSG youth academy product. He has played for France from U16. He was captain of the U17 team when they played in the European championships in Slovenia, 2012. 

His career took a turn when Marcelo Bielsa used him at Lille (2017-18), and ended the season as Goalkeeper of the year in the Trophées UNFP du football. His record was 30 goals conceded, 17 clean sheets, 233 saves and three penalties saved. Lille finished as runners up to PSG in the Ligue 1 that season. 

In 2020–21, Maignan won the Ligue 1 title, finishing the season with 21 clean sheets, one short of the league record. 

Milan had scored more goals (74) in the previous season than 2021-22(69), but conceded more (41/31). There was the importance of Maignan for Milan. He was selected as the best Serie A Goalkeeper of 2021-22 with 18 clean sheets and an assist to Rafael Leao. Pioli used him as a deep centre back, and while keeping possession deep in their own half, attacking with accurate long balls to the opponent half. 

Going by the stats alone, Maignan is definitely one of the best shot-stoppers in the world. 

Maignan received his first senior call-up in May 2019, ahead of UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers against Turkey and Andorra and a friendly with Bolivia. He made his debut in October 2020 as a half-time substitute in a friendly against Ukraine, which ended as a 7–1 win. With his quality, it is assured that he is going to be doing that job for a long time, as a successor to Lloris.
