Sanskrit for "circle," mandalas are geometric diagrams that serve as symbolic maps for sacred rituals and meditation in such religions as Hinduism and Buddhism. Thought to represent the cosmos and other deities, they're often used as tools for a spiritual journey.
research has also linked mandala-making, even just the act of coloring in, to stress-relief.1 In fact, renowned psychologist Carl Jung studied mandalas as a window to the subconscious and believed the creation of these images encouraged focus and personal growth in patients.2

Today, coloring as a mindful practice has become increasingly popular, with some adult coloring books devoted entirely to mandalas. But what is it about these shapes that gear them toward a more present, mindful state? A new study exploring the connection between mandala coloring and mindfulness suggests that brain-sensing technology can help us understand the connection.3
