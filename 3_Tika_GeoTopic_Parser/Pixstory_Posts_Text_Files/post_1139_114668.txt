Historically marriage or monogamy was an externally imposed system to control female reproduction Today there is substantial scientific medical and research evidence to show that human beings evolved in intimate nomadic hunter gatherer groups of to people where everything was shared including partners The shift towards marriage monogamy happened primarily with the advent of the agricultural civilisation just years ago On an evolutionary time scale that s less than per cent of the way we lived on this planet With agricultural civilisation came the idea of property and possession Deciding things like which is my child Who gets to inherit my land and cows when I am dead became extremely important Since paternity was crucial for answering such questions sex and reproduction had to be regulated and monitered Organsied religions like Christianity legitimised this arrangement and became the biggest promoters of monogamy marriage the world over This is quite laughable because Christianity traditionally had a very low opinion about both marriages and married women It s better to marry than to burn wrote apostle Paul the man who never met Jesus in his life but on whose claims the edifice of Christianity primarily rests It s also good to remember the Tenth Commandment Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s house thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbours Women were the biggest losers in this shift aside from slaves and cattle perhaps So it s only natural that with more effective egalitarian and less misogynistic ways to control reproduction and determine paternity these days the younger generation especially financially independent women are seeking for a realignment in the flawed arrangement by opting out of marriage altogether
