Climate change is a phrase that is chilling. It is enough to send shivers down anyone’s spine, be it old or young, rich or poor, regardless of gender, caste, creed etc. It has affected and will continue to affect future generations, and judging by the current situation, probably to a much larger and possibly unfathomable degree. One such incident that shook India to the core was the floods in Kerala, India in 2018. 
The Kerala floods in 2018 were one of the worst floods that affected the state in nearly a century. Caused by unusually high rainfalls during monsoon, about 483 people passed away and approximately 140 people went missing. The authorities were forced to stop pumping water, which resulted in dearth of clean drinking water. Understandably, there were food shortages as well. Many people were left homeless due to damage or complete destruction. Schools, colleges and public services like railways, airports had to be closed to ensure public safety. The rescue operations were mostly a success, and the donations made by individuals, corporations and NGOs helped in rehabilitation of the victims.
Climate crises like these are a wake-up call for humanity. How much longer does our earth have to bear the brunt of our greed? The earth only loves us so much more than we love it. It keeps on giving. It is indeed shameful that we continue exploiting it, as giving without taking is nothing but thievery. As rightly said by Stephen Hawking, “We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity. We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet.”
