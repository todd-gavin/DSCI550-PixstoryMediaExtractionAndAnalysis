I think that all prayers are answered in the way that they should be I like the idea of knowing what we want in the present but not knowing what is best for us until we view the bigger picture I m not sure how vastly different my life would have been if I could have twisted God s will to grant me my wishes like a fairy godmother but I know I wouldn t have the family I do If this is because God did not answer my prayers I consider myself to be extremely fortunate However your prayers WILL be answered In a yes a no or a No not yet but it will be answered By unanswered prayers I mean the last two
