Bayern Munich, in association with Adidas, have released a special jersey to mark 50 years of Olympia Stadion.
The venue holds a special place for the German side as it was their home from 1972 to 2005 before the Allianz Arena opened. They tasted high success in the stadium, which went on to see them become a top club across the globe.
The purple, orange, and teal crooked stripes on the jersey are taken from by the vibrant accents from the surroundings of the venue. The club and adidas' logos are placed centered on the player's chest. The year 1972 is written on the back, which indicates the year in which the stadium was opened.
As usual Bayern München is also written, followed by the player’s name and number. Overall, the jersey has a stylist finish, making it an impressive one. Notably, this is Bayern’s fifth jersey of the season. However, no official information has been provided on whether the jersey will be used in an official match or not.

Bayern are doing good but still not enough
One of the dominant sides in Europe had an unusual start to the season. They have dropped points and are lacking consistency. In the Bundesliga, the Bavarians are currently ranked third in the points table with 16 points in nine games.
However, Julian Nagelsmann’s side have been impressive in the Champions League. They recently beat FC Viktoria Plzen 4-2 to stay at the top of the group table with four wins in four games.
Despite leading 4-0 at half-time, the German club went on to concede two goals in the second-half. Reacting to this, manager Nagelsmann said: “We of course changed a little bit and needed to...that’s normal. It’s also normal that we have Sunday on our minds, after being up 4-0 at the break.”
Bayern will challenge SC Freiburg at their home ground on Sunday (October 16) in the domestic league. A win would take them to second position in the points table.
