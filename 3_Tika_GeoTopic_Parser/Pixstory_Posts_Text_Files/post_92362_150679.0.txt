Kylie Jenner has been taking Paris Fashion Week by storm and her outfits just keep getting sexier. 🤌🏻🥵The 25-year-old continued her stylish streak when she attended the Schiaparelli show on Sept. 29, wearing a strapless blue velvet gown with an incredibly plunging neckline.💙😌
Kylie’s fitted blue gown featured coned cups on her breasts while the neckline ended all the way at her belly button. Kylie put her ample cleavage front and center while the cups barely covered up her chest. The rest of the dress featured a corset bodice that flaunted her tiny waist while the rest of the skirt flowed down and straight.👄🌊
The mother-of-two styled her dress with a thick black choker necklace with a massive black heart medallion hanging off it. She topped her look off with black pumps and stunning old-Hollywood glam.🖤🕶 Her jet-black hair was slicked back into a high curly bun while the front of her hair was parted in the middle and swooped to the sides. 👱‍♀️She added a super sultry smokey eye and thick black cat-eye liner while a deep red matte lip tied her entire ensemble together.👁👄👁
