Timo Werner is on his way from Chelsea back to RB Leipzig after the two clubs confirmed a transfer agreement for the Germany international on Tuesday.

The deal -- a permanent move for the 26-year-old -- is reportedly worth in the region of â‚¬30 million, although various performance-related add-ons could be included.

"I'm very happy to be able to play for RB Leipzig again," Werner, who has signed a four-year contract, said. "I had a great time here between 2016 and 2020, when we performed brilliantly as newcomers in the league. It was a dignified departure for me to leave the club as record goalscorer, but that's in the past now and I'm looking ahead, because both I and the club have developed in the past two years.

"I had two great years at Chelsea that I'm really grateful for and were crowned with the Champions League trophy. The experience to play abroad in a new league really helped me and my career. Now I'm looking forward to the new season with RB Leipzig and above all to meeting the Leipzig fans again, who mean a great deal to me. We want to achieve a lot and of course, I want to become the first Leipzig player to reach the 100-goal mark."

Werner will be looking get his career back on track ahead of the World Cup in Qatar after a disappointing two-year spell at Stamford Bridge.

Werner has exited Stamford Bridge never quite being able to tap into his potential and would like to start back his journey to the top again.
