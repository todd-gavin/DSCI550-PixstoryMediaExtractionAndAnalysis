July 17-how many of us know it’s marked on your Calendar as Emoji Day- the day we celebrate the new language of the modern day world. The language of emojis where a character displays your emotions and you don’t feel the need for word. 
It was around this time last year, ok may be a bit earlier that a friend started teaching me or rather introducing me to the world of emojis. The best I could do was send a smilie😊
A year later, what have I been upto. Well 
I am trying to use emojis now but somehow know only some and relate to a few . The one with a shy smile☺️, another a relatively confident one😊, the grin and laughter types —yes the ones which tear up while laughing. The ones that are red with anger and purple with rage. 
I have also learnt that emojis and have various degrees of expression. Take for example a laugh - 😊😃😁😬🤣😂. Well. 
Same for sad ones also -🤨😭🥲😢🥺. 
Ok look at love ❤️😊🥰😍😘 💕💖💙💗💜💔💞💓💛🖤💚❣️😻🧡💘💝🤍❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥. 
Hold on, what do they mean , the blue heart, white, purple, green, black, uff even a yellow. When does one use these. 
The list of ones I don’t understand is endless. 😇🥸🥶🤮👨‍👩‍👦‍👦🙅‍♂️🧟‍♂️👨‍🎤😿🎃🤖, common on. 
And more important I have stopped asking my friend and my friend has stopped explaining. The attempts seem vain and I might seem so out of touch .
I am part of the minority who can express better with words. And when u are in the business of words only- what can you say I’ll still bore you with words. So 😊 this little fellow is the only one you might see in my conversation these days. The max I go for is this 👍.
Sorry i can’t find all my expressions and emotions there. Give me a bigger bank. Sometimes may be the heart is more hurting than this ❤️‍🩹 and none of these 😢☹️😞😪🤕 seem to express or I am more happy than these 🤣☺️🥳. I will comply then. What about you. Join the conversation.
