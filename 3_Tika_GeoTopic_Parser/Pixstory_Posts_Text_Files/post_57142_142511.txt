After the demise of Queen Elizabeth II there have been different discourses where people are talking about the lost legacy and mourning At the same time on the other side there are the ones remembering the trauma and criticising the fallacy of glorious Britain Why would they not do so After all there are countless reasons to believe in it As long as the Queen reigned the empire could deny the horrors of her rule But now that it s the end to all the voices need to be heard Voices of the colonised were unheard and ignored in the chaos of her rule For the ones who experienced it all there s a whole new narrative lying for them waiting to be expressed and acknowledged The onerous task of truth telling won t be easier for some in Britain who apparently admired the Queen but how social media has portrayed the reality is quite admirable From the time the Queen s death was announced people worldwide who were the victims of those shackles chose to speak They spoke of the plunder crimes rape and genocide all of which remained concealed in the light of honouring the godlike Queen But fortunately Britain s ability to believe in the fallacy has been broken
