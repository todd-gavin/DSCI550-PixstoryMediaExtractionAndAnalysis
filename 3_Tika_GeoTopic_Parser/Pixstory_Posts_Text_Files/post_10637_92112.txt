Austria s attacking game pays off Argentina win South American clash counter attacks give India the edge and Germany hit top gear against Wales Highlights from Day in Potchefstroom Austria Korea Pool C Potchefstroom North West University RSA Although a draw would have sufficed for them to continue to the quarter finals Korea started the game with a keen intent to win three points However it was Austria who had the first real attempt at goal when Sabrina Hruby won a penalty corner The ensuing shot from Helene Herzog was well saved by Kim Eunji but this was a signal that Austria were determined to finish the pool phase in style What followed was a game of back and forth hockey but with no goals to reward the efforts Austria enjoyed the greater spells of possession but were unable to make the pressure count Korea for their part began to slow their game and sought to take the sting out of Austria s attacking moves One of the best chances in the third quarter fell to Austria s Isabella Klausbruckner as a searching ball was played into the Korea circle but Klausbruckner was unable to finish and the frustration was etched on her face As the third quarter counted down the Korean side started to up the ante and a sense of urgency entered their passing A penalty corner was fired over the Austrian cross bar and Austria found themselves needing to defend with commitment As the teams came out for the fourth quarter this was a match that could clearly go either way Austria were playing with a structure and confidence that had been missing in their earlier pool matches Korea for their part needed to play with more ambition as they lacked the edge to their attack necessary to break through the Austria defence The match was resolved in the th minute when Herzog found the back of the net after yet more good build up play from Austria The result left Korea dependent on the result between Argentina and Uruguay to discover if they had done enough to seal a plan in the quarter finals
