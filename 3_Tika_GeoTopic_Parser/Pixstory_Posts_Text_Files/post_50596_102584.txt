 Your mistakes are part of your learning Learn to be resilient in the face of failure Don t compare yourself to others because you aren t them You re you so accept yourself for who you are faults and all There is no right way to do anything Don t limit your thinking to a right or wrong way there s no right way to do the wrong thing and no wrong way to do something right Stand up for what you believe even if it s unpopular Make everyone understand your big crazy ideas Learn from people who criticize you Don t let criticism get you down let it inspire you to work Accept your weaknesses as your features You aren t good at everything you do but nobody else is either Look at your past as an adventurous biography Your past isn t your identity and doesn t dictate your entrepreneurial destiny Don t underestimate your talent until you apply it times Are you applying your natural talents Every single problem you have is not unique Put your problems in perspective and solve them faster Intelligence is relative self esteem is not Stay positive take care of yourself forget about being perfect and always keep improving yourself Express your anger in a creative way Feel you anger express it and learn from it Surround yourself with people who want you to succeed Having people you can trust and rely on will make you happier and feel better about yourself
