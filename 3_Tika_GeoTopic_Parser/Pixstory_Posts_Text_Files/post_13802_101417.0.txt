After ruling the All India Football Federation with iron hands for 14 years, Praful Patel has finally been unseated as the president of the national federation. Interestingly, his exit has not come through elections in the AIFF, but through an order passed by a division bench of the Supreme Court. While hearing a plea by petitioner Rahul Mehra, the Supreme Court constituted a three-member Committee of Administration (CoA). It passed an order saying the CoA will henceforth be responsible for running the day to day administration of the AIFF and will conduct the elections of the federation in the next few months. The Supreme Court has also dismissed the entire executive committee of Patel.
Those who are closely associated with Indian football are certainly not surprised by the development. To say that Patel himself was responsible for this mess won’t be an exaggeration. That he didn’t allow the elections to be held in time in December 2020 on the pretext of some legal problems was to keep himself in power beyond his term of 12 years. A revisit to the events that led to the AIFF being handed over to CoA by Supreme Court for the first time in the history of the federation, would reveal how a simple matter was made to look a complicated one with full of legal jugglery that helped no one except a particular individual.
Having been ousted by the apex court for holding on to power illegally for the last 16 months, people in the Patel camp are saying the Supreme Court move could invite FIFA ban for India as the world body doesn’t like executive or judicial interference in any of their member associations. While the apprehension is definitely true, the blame for this should squarely be put on Patel and his men, who avoided polls in the AIFF on some pretext or the other. And last but not the least, Patel should also share the blame for court interference. In November 2017, it was AIFF under Patel, which approached the court of law; no other member can be blamed for this.
