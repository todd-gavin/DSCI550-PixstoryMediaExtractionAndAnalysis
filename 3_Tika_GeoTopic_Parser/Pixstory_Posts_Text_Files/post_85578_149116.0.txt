A white dress is beautiful and cooler in the summer than black dress that soaks the heat in. 🤍🥵
I think wearing white is really feminine and cute in itself.🤌🏻🥰
My opinion on wearing white is that it stands out and it's so noticed. It's both crisp and bright plus whenever I wear it, it really gives ANGELIC VIBES.👼🏻🫶🏻🥹
It's a shade you can accessorize with any other colour in spectrum. 
So why white? Because white is so beautiful and looks good with everything. 🤩
