For decades for centuries and more You call me the holy mother or call me the whore You think I am a property to buy and sell Likeacow oracamel orapieceofland And you secure me with shackles or a wedding band Never occurred to you that my body is my soul Just like yours And I have a role To decide and determine what I want to be My body my soul and just be Me You are alarmed by my autonomy You censor my senses You cut me and bruise me put me under your lenses That little transparent box in your head You want me to reside there like a shred My body is my soul it s not for you to trade I am growing out of your box to fly to explore to pervade Never occurred to you that souls can defy Cages confines containers no matter how hard you try My soul spreads her wings with my body in her hand Hear hear what she says and try to understand Not a mother not a mistress not a piece of land Mahamuda Rahman
