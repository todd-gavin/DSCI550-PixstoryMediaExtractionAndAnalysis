Japan reached consecutive finals after defeating Brazil in the semi. Final will be a repetition of the 2018 final, in which Japan won 3-1. 
Yamamoto(30') and Hamano(84') scored for Japan to overcome Brazil in the semi final. Cavalcante scored for Brazil in the second half, but Japan were cool enough to clinch the win. Spain defeated Netherlands in the first semi final, for the same score(2-1). Final will be played on 29 August. 
Match was colored with beautiful moments. Japan scored the first goal when Brazil failed to clear their lines, and Yamamoto found the net from outside the box. Brazil's reply was also from a long shot, which Japan goalkeeper touched, but couldn't push out. Hamano beautifully finished with a chipshot, at the end of a patient build up attack. 
Spain scored their first goal when Netherlands lost possession in their own box, and gave the ball cheaply for a chance. Spain doubled their lead from a scintillating shot from Gabaro. She controlled the long from midfield, and took a volley on turn. Ball reached the net without giving any chance to the goalkeeper. The Netherlands consolation goal was also a beautiful one. 
Inma Gabaro of Spain is leading among the goal scorers with 7 goals. Japan's Maika Hamano has got 4 goals. Gabaro scored a brace in the semi final against Netherlands also.
