During a tournament going on in Madhya Pradesh, his coach told him that if he performs well he'll get the opportunity to go to the Homeless World Cup with Slum Soccer. That's how his career with Slum Soccer started.

Michael also got the opportunity to act in the movie Jhund, which is the story of how Slum Soccer was started and Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of Vijay Barse in it. Michael got a audition call to be in Nagpur and his interview went well, so he was selected to be a part of the movie. The shooting began in Nagpur and he got a chance to act with the legendary Amitabh Bachchan. He says that he got pretty nervous around Amit Ji but after a few days, he felt like he knew Amit Ji from a long time.  He also says that Amit Ji around the set seemed exactly like Vijay Barse and he couldn't tell a difference between them.  

Michael's family is really happy about the movie. He feels that acting is very difficult for him as compared to playing football. He got nervous in front of the camera. His future plans are to become a coach in his hometown and teach the beautiful game to the children there.
