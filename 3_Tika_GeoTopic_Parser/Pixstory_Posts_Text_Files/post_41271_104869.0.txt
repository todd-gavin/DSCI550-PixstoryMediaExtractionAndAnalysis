In the year 2022, Sweden is the host of world environment day. Being the host, this year Sweden is going to celebrate the World Environment Day. 

The theme of World Environment Day this year is ' Only One Earth'. All official events will be organized in Sweden. The idea of the theme of ' Only One Earth' is to focus on the world's togetherness in the direction of creating the atmosphere conducive for peace, harmony, prosperity and health by saving the nature and life. 

As per TOI, the policy of the theme is to create and adopt a lifestyle which should be pollution free and full of green land. The moto is still the same as it was 50 years ago to protect the mother nature. This planet is our only home and we need to save it for upcoming generations.
