The Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds has been in the news after he became the co-owner of
Wrexham FC. The Welsh club was formed in 1894 and is one of the oldest clubs in the world.

Reynolds is famous for his performances in Hollywood movies like Deadpool, Good Life and
Green Lantern etc. He is also known for his sense of humor on talk shows.

After his induction into the ownership of the Welsh Club, one of the Manchester United fans
requested the actor to buy the Red devils.

However, Reynolds who is known for his amazing sense of humor gave a witty reply to the
request and said, “I’m already seeing someone.”

The Manchester United fans have been waiting for a change in the ownership roles. The
Glazers have been the owners of the club for more than 15 years now. Joel Glazer has been a
disaster for the Red devils and they want anyone except him.

The protests against the glazers clearly indicate that the fans are ready to do anything to get the
ownership out. But the question remains how much criticism could the glazers take before they
decide to sell out.
