Paul Pogba is all set to leave Manchester United this summer, after an unsuccessful stint of almost five years. The Frenchman is expected to return to his former club, Juventus on a free transfer. Pogba arrived at Old Trafford with a host of expectations, but he has often failed to deliver on a consistent basis, being riddled with injuries for the most part.

Manchester United’s track history in terms of signings has certainly not been on the brighter side in the last decade. Former Red Devils defender, Rio Ferdinand believes that Paul Pogba has been unjustly criticised for his Manchester United spell, and that he has often been made the ‘scapegoat.’ 

Rio Ferdinand added that no Manchester United player has left the club as a better player in recent years. There have been several unsuccessful big names signings in the form of Alexis Sanchez, Romelu Lukaku to name a few. 

“I do believe if Paul had a better team around him, a better chance, and better players, you look at that whole team and he has been the scapegoat for a lot of players. I don’t know any player that’s actually come in to United during these times and left a better player,” Ferdinand said to Vibe to Five.

Rio Ferdinand believes that Paul Pogba might have excelled at Manchester United, if he had players of his calibre fielded around him. The Frenchman’s only taste of success at Old Trafford came in his first season in 2016/17, when Jose Mourinho guided the Red Devils to three titles. Regardless of his form at Manchester United, Paul Pogba has always excelled for his national side. In fact, he was a key architect in France’s World Cup winning campaign in 2018.
