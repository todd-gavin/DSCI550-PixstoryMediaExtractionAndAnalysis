Sri Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji was 6th  amongst 10 Sikh Gurus. He succeeded Guru Arjan Sahib in 1606 to the spiritual throne of Guru Nanak Sahib Ji, at the age of eleven years.

Guru Arjan Dev was martyred at Lahore on the 30th May 1606 A.D., after great torture on the order of king Jahangir. After that, at the time of the ceremony of assuming leadership of Sikhs, Guru Hargobind addressed the congregation saying, “I have to raise an army that will fight the tyranny being carried out in the country. Come, join that army and get the blessings of the Guru.”

In August 1643 A.D., at the time of entrusting the responsibility to his grandson (Guru) Har Rai, Guru Hargobind said, “Always keep twenty-two hundred horse-men in fighting fit condition with you.” Acting upon the command of the Guru, he and his successor-Guru Har Rai continued the program of weapon training and teaching of scriptures as before. The teaching of Guru Nanak had awakened the people of India in such a way that they're were always ready to fight tyranny. The barbarity of the rulers could not waver them from their faith. They attained martyrdom smiling.
