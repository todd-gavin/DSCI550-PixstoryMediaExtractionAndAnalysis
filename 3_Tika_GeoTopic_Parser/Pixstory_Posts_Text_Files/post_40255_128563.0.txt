I agree with one thing you said: love is not the same as they show in real movies. Itâ€™s much more beautiful than that because after a certain point of time, love is all about choices. 

Over the course of a relationship, there will be many occasions when you won't feel love or even like for your spouse or partner, and you'll regrettably never reclaim the blissful innocence you had when you first started dating. When you continue to wake up next to them every day, you must make a decision to work hard on your relationship!

You'll be more able to let go of that addictive high and move toward making deliberate decisions that promote respect for one another if you think that love isn't all butterflies.

And that is a cause enough to celebrate couples!
