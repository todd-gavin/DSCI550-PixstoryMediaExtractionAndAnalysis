The Premier League fans will be experiencing another extremely intense match between two of the most unpredictable teams this weekend as Liverpool will be locking horns with table toppers Arsenal at the Emirates stadium. 
Both the teams though have had a pretty memorable rivalry in the past with Liverpool having the upper hand on majority of the ocassions, their present scenarios are quite contrasting to each other. While the gunners are sitting at the top of the table with 7 wins out of the 8 matches so far. Jürgen Klopp's men on the other hand have been far from their decent best until now as they're in a spot of bother and are currently placed 9th in the table with just 10 points to their name in the first 7 matches. 
Both these sides will be meeting in this season of the premier league with Arsenal clearly looking the stronger of the two sides. It's time for us to have a look at the head to head records of both these sides whenever they've faced off against each other till now.
