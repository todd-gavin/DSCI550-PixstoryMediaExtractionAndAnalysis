No I am not talking about that remake I am referring to the animated version of Mulan It follows the story of young girl called Mulan who disguises herself as a man to serve in the army on behalf of her sick father It is based on the Chinese legend of Fa Mulan Mulan is the best example of I am not like other girls done in the right way From the start we see how she differs from the ideal image of a woman created by the society She has her own talents and struggles to find her place in society But after her enlistment we see her try her best bond with fellow soldiers and learn to adjust in a new environment The best part is she does develop as character in the end but retains her spirit With beautiful characters storyline melodious songs and heartwarming moments It is a film for everyone
