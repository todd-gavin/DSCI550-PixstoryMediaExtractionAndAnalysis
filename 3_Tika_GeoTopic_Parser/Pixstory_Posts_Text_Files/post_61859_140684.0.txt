Britain’s new monarch, King Charles III, addressed a mourning nation and the Commonwealth for the first time Friday, a day after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. 
Charles also declared his “love” for his estranged younger son Harry and Harry’s wife Meghan and elevated his heir William to become the new prince of Wales, in an emotional televised address. 
He shook hands with some of the thousands of well-wishers gathered outside Buckingham Palace as he returned to London after visiting the Balmoral estate in the Scottish Highlands where the Queen breathed her last. 
Britain’s new king, Charles III, said Thursday that queen Elizabeth II was a “cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother” who would be missed around the world. 
Here is the full statement issued by Buckingham Palace after Charles, 73, ascended the throne following his mother’s 70-year reign: “The death of my beloved mother, her majesty the queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family. We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world. During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the queen was so widely held.”
