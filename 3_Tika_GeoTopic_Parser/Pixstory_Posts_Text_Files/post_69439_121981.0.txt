The Drung Waterfall is an extremely popular tourist attraction located in the Tangmarg tehsil of Gulmarg, Baramulla. A cascading waterfall set amidst majestic mountains, it freezes completely during winter due to the extremely low temperature. This frozen waterfall is a must-visit in the area.
The cascading waterfall mixes with the water that originates from the magnificent glaciers and makes for an unforgettable sight. During the summers, one can spend some quiet time here while enjoying views of the waterfall, lakes, streams, surrounding greenery as well as explore the caves. The area is even more breathtaking during the wintertime when everything is frozen; the waterfall freezes as it comes down, forming icicles. Even the lake and streams freeze, though they remain accessible, and one can have some fun in the ice-cold waters if brave enough! There are stalls around that serve tea and snacks for people to have while they take in the magnificent scenes. There is also a small temple in the vicinity.
