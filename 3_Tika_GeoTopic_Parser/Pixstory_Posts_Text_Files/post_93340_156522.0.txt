Oscar Wilde, one of the revolutionary writers of Victorian era, had reigned supreme in the literary sphere but had lived a very tragic personal life. 
In 1895, he was sentenced to two years of hard labour for “gross indecency”, the maximum sentence at the time, just because he was gay and society during Victorian era criminalised homosexuality due to which he was forced to hide his identity.
Various homosexual undertones have been found in his works, which depicted Victorian society's aversion to homosexuality. 
Through his works and his life experiences, many LGBTQ+ folks see him as LGBTQ+ icon, paving the way for LGBTQ+ rights.
