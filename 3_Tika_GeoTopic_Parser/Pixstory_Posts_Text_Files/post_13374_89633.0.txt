Another look
The education of girls and education in Afghanistan in general is not considered a fundamental and strategic value by groups and large numbers of people. In a country where some people want to sell their organs because of poverty, education will by no means be a primary need and value.
The culture and view of the majority of people about life is formed around a very primitive livelihood economy, and the ruling group represents such a culture very well. In this culture, modern education, beauty and many other values ​​are not of strategic importance.
For example, over the course of twenty years, schools or workshops were set up in many areas by bribing and enticing local influential people. Most people participated in the programs for money.
Sometimes the culture formed around the economy is a culture of looting, looting over many other values. Hence, the Taliban's view of educating their daughters is a looting one, it wants to sell it, for example, so that Westerners can give them concessions so that they can allow girls' schools. The same method existed in another way during the Republic, many traded in the name of women's rights and girls' education and the spread of civic values ​​in their country, these values ​​were not considered valuable for themselves.
In the economy of incense, the needs of the first level and more or less the second of the Mozelo pyramid create increasing attractiveness and greed, but the needs related to humanity, dignity, morality, beauty, etc. are not understood. There is an insatiable thirst for food, clothing, shelter, and the necessities of life, plus sex, but beauty and order, for example, are meaningless. I have heard that our newly fled compatriot, the first curious question he saw from his European compatriot was the possibility of access to free sex.I have seen with my own eyes that our compatriots were picking up extra clothes, each of them was collected so much that it was not needed at all.
