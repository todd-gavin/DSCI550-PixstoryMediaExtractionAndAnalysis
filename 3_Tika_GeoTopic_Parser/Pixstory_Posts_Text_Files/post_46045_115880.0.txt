Students and staff at the University of Texas at Arlington are working to offer a Native American studies course to students in Texas' public schools. 

As per their official website, as part of a team working with Grand Prairie ISD on an American Indian/Native Studies pilot course that could be made available as an elective statewide as early as the 2024–25 academic year, Stephen Silva Brave, a student in the School of Social Work, and Kenneth Roemer, a retired professor from UTA, are involved. 

The Dallas Morning News and Winds of Change magazine have both featured the labour that went into creating the course.

Brave first learned of the course in January 2020, when Grand Prairie ISD hosted a gathering of Native teachers and leaders from Texas and Oklahoma to receive insight on what it should look like. Brave, who is Sicangu Lakota and a parent of two Grand Prairie ISD students, attended and offered his thoughts.

“I thought we needed to gear the course toward non-Natives and make it where non-Natives can also teach the course,” Brave said. “Grand Prairie is not on a reservation, and it’s not a town near one.”
