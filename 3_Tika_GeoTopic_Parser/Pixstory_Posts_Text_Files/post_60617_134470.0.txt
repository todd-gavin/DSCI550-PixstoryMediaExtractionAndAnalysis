Throughout our youth, Boys Over Flowers was a definition of entertainment, becoming one of the most endearing doramas we can remember, we cried, we fell in love and most of all we had fun relating to the great adventures of the main characters that’s why we love that Boys Over Flowers is back. 
Recently Lee Min Jung and Kim Bum, attended an event of the prestigious luxury brand Montblanc, where Min didn’t hesitate at any time to share on social media the nice reunion she had with Kim, which definitely melted our hearts.

Lee Min Jung wrote in her caption, “I met an F4 at a Montblanc event,” with a tag for Kim Bum. In the comments, Kim Bum replied, “It’s been a while, Ha Jae Kyung.”

More than 13 years ago, the two actors starred in “Boys Over Flowers,” where Kim Bum played “F4” member So Yi Jung and Lee Min Jung played Ha Jae Kyung, Goo Jun Pyo’s fiancée.
