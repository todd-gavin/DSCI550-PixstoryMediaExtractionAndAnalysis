Even if the weather is hot, I enjoy going on evening walks and small shopping sprees whenever possible.

I went out today and it was great to just take a walk around the neighbourhood and market area. I'm visiting my hometown after a long time and it surprises me to see how things have changed. Over the years I have seen this quaint little town change into a mini city complete with shopping malls and food delivery services.

At least the culture and traditions haven't changed despite the technological progression. I still celebrate the same rituals and hangout with family and friends at the same spots I'd visit all those years back.

Today, I visited the shop I'd go to for a glass of cold lassi (sweet yoghurt drink) because I probably couldn't have missed out on that on a summer evening. 

How do you spend your summer evenings?
