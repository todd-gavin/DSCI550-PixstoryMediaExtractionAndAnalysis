In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an emergency COBRA meeting. These meetings are often called in times of emergency or to face threats like war, extreme weather, or terrorism.

A COBRA meeting is designed to bring all the key decision-makers and advisers into one place.

It is a similar idea to the White House’ Situation Room.

First formed in 1972, COBRA meetings have been used to handle situations like terrorist attacks at home and across Europe and the United States, and the Novichok poisoning case, as well as the recent storms plaguing the UK.

The acronym stands for ‘Cabinet Office Briefing Room A’ and refers to the British emergency council that meets when a crisis arises.

These councils are designed for situations that call for various different departments to work closely with one another.
