After what Beijing did at the border, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar stated on Thursday that India and China's relationship was going through a "very tough phase." He also stressed that the Asian Century would not occur if the two neighbours were unable to work together.

After presenting a lecture on "India's Vision of the Indo-Pacific" at the esteemed Chulalongkorn University here, he made the comments in response to a series of questions.

In response to a query, Mr. Jaishankar stated that while the Asian Century might be possible if China and India could unite, it would be challenging to achieve.

After what China did at the border, he continued, "the India-China relationship is currently going through an incredibly tough phase."

In eastern Ladakh, Chinese and Indian forces are locked in a protracted confrontation. 16 rounds of Corps Commander Level negotiations between the two parties have been held thus far to end the impasse that began on May 5, 2020, following a violent altercation in the Pangong Lake districts.
