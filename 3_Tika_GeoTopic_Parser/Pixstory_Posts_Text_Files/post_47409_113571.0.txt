Steven Gerrard:

In 1997, Stevie G joined Liverpool and stayed with them for a total of 17 years. From 2003, he
led the team as captain for 12 years. Gerrard made his entrance and scored several screamers
from midfield. He also shown maturity far above his youthful age.

The UEFA Champions League title that Liverpool won in Istanbul after trailing AC Milan 3-0 at
the break was Gerrard's finest hour while wearing a Liverpool jersey. As Liverpool drew the
match and went on to win in penalties, Gerrard scored a goal and then won a penalty.

Gerrard has scored some truly amazing goals with his wicked right foot. He was a great
deep-lying playmaker as well, and his squad benefited from his superb passing and vision.

Frank Lampard:

There is no need to introduce the Chelsea maestro. Frank Lampard, one of the all-time greats in
the Premier League, was a key member of the group of players that would propel Chelsea from
obscurity to the pinnacle of club football. Lampard has been an absolute genius in midfield for
the Chelsea Football Club.

Frank Lampard made a name for himself at Chelsea as a box-to-box midfielder who is also a
prolific goal scorer. He is imaginative and technically adept. He has scored more goals than any
other player in Chelsea history and has helped the Blues to three Premier League and one
Champions League championship.

He was the 2005 FWA Footballer of the Year winner and came in second place for the Ballon
d'Or and FIFA Player of the Year awards.
