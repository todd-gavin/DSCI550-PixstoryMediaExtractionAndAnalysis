      
Truth be told, I am no social butterfly who finds it easy to casually walk up to a stranger and initiate a conversation. I've never understood how someone can do it and make it look like a walk in the park.
 I try to go out of my way to strike up a conversation but often fail to do so. In the event I do manage to initiate a conversation, I find it extremely difficult to maintain the conversation, worrying about the impression I had just made a few seconds ago, rather than thinking about what to say next. People always assume I am a silent person who does not enjoy group settings and would rather spend his time in his own company, how mistaken they are! I too have much to share, like how I enjoy playing basketball, or how I also wish to go on an adventure with others, yet I am unable to convey my words properly. 
I'd like to think that i am one, who enjoys the little things in life like playing with my pets, enjoying good food and having a good laugh with friends while remembering the good ol' days, a glass half-full kind of guy. 
Whilst I am grateful for my friends for accepting me as I am, I don't plan on being an introverted little cub all my life. I want to improve myself and enjoy my life.
