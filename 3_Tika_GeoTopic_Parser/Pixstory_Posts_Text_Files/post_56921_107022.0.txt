The song released by American singer Lizzo on the 10th of June received criticism immediately after it was released.
Fans asked Lizzo to remove the offensive lyric from the song.

The singer has been accused of using offensive lyrics in the opening verse of her latest song, which reads: “Hold my bag, b**h (girls)/ Hold my bag/ Do you see this s**t? I’ma sp**z/ I’m about to knock somebody out (girls).”

This is a derogatory term for cerebral palsy; the disappointed fans find it harmful and offensive to the disabled community.


These tweets show how fans condemned the song,
“Hey lizzo my disability Cerebral Palsy is literally classified as Spastic Diplegia (where spasticity refers to unending painful tightness in my legs) your new song makes me pretty angry + sad. ‘Spaz’ doesn’t mean freaked out or crazy. It’s an ableist slur. It’s 2022. Do better,”

“It doesn’t matter if lizzo knew the ableist connotations of the word sp*z, it is still problematic. so many people will sing this song and integrate the word into their day to day language.”

“Hey lizzo please remove the word ‘spaz’ from your new song because it’s a slur and really offensive to the disabled community,” one wrote, signing off, “From a disappointed fan.”
