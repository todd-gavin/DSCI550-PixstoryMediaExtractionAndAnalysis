Celin’s commitment to consistent growth and her openness to challenging herself can be understood from a small anecdote about her tattoo appreciation journey.

"I said to myself before, maybe two years ago, I'm not gonna have tattoos -- like only small ones. But I met a really good person, an important person to me,” she explains. “He just told me, 'It's coo-ol' – like he had tattoos all over, stomach, back, arms, everything – and I just fell in love with it,” Celin says.

From words like “guerencia”, “cooleu cooleu” and “amor” to symbols showing slightly startled eyes, Ancient Egypt Queen Neferreti, Celin has evolved to love sporting her tattoos, with getting up to three in a day by Rosita, a realism tattoo artist based in Oslo.

“I have meaningful tattoos but some of them are just because I like them," Celin explains.

This balance is replicated in how Celin decompresses before a big game – while most athletes might prefer getting their head in a game through rhythmic boom-bass songs, the young forward is more drawn towards R&B and soul artists like Jorja Smith.

“I listen to chill, almost sad songs, just to relax my body and my mind – be at my lowest almost, where I'm chill,” Celin says. “Because then the game comes, and I'm like intense."

If Celin could travel back in time, she would tell her younger self to: "Just be happy and confident. Your time is coming. Just wait for it."

And to supporters and young athletes in the making, the athlete would reiterate: “It's going to go how it goes. Some things you can control, but some things you can't control, it just has to be like that. Just don't let other people change you, if you're not open for it. Just be yourself for the most part."
