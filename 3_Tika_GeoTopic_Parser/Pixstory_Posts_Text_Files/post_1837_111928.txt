I vaguely remembered seeing this comic book series even buying reading it but yesterday when my friend sent me an image from an Instagram story it all came rushing back When Amitabh Bachchan was at the peak of his career in the s he was launched as a crime fighting superhero called Supremo in a comic book series published by India Book House Adventures of AB was the result of an incident that IBH publisher Pammi Bakshi witnessed while she was standing in the balcony of her flat or so the story goes Bakshi saw a group of children playing in the compound of a neighbouring building One boy declared he was Superman and could fly Another said he was Batman and could scale any building A third declared he was Amitabh Bachchan and could beat up ten baddies with one hand in Bakshi met Bachchan on the sets of the movie Pukar in Goa where she convinced him to lend his name to the comics Bachchan s Pukar co star Randhir Kapoor used to call the actor Supremo and the moniker seemed like a memorable name for a comic book character Bakshi recruited Pratap Mullick an illustrator with Amar Chitra Katha to agree to draw the comics Mullick watched Bachchan s movies and devised costumes for Supremo s character Bachchan approved one a pink fitting outfit with a wrap and holster and a pendent around his neck The series took off with an adventure called The Lost Idol Supremo looks after two boys Vijay and Anthony When Supremo is in his non super heroic avatar he is seen shooting with Manmohan Desai or Prakash Mehra He is even seen making a film with Gulzar a partnership that had no parallels in real life Gulzar wrote the initial comics Initially the scripts were sent to Bachchan for approval but he never interfered with the text or the illustrations in any way He did make one request that the comics be sent to hospitals orphanages and welfare organisations Adventures of Amitabh Bachchan was published for two years But after Bakshi got married and left India the series came to a halt
