According to what is being reported by the journalist Rudy Galetti on Twitter, Milan had a ‘subdued winter market’ to go ‘all in’ when the window reopens in the summer, and one of the areas Paolo Maldini and Ricky Massara will target is a long term striker.

At the moment the asking price for Jonathan David of Lille is too high because the Ligue 1 champions are asking for €70m to sell the 22-year-old Canada international, so they have already moved on to Huge Ekitike of Stade Reims.

According to Sky, Ekitike was heading towards a deadline day move from Reims to Newcastle but it fell through because the 19-year-old has decided to stay in France at least until the summer, with a bid worth a total of €40m accepted.

Late interest from Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain made Ekitike decide to reassess his options in the summer, having netted 8 goals in 18 Ligue 1 appearances this season.
