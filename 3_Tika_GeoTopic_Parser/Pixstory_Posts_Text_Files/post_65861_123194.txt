Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has claimed that Virat Kohli should have played T Is and ODIs against West Indies and that he can t understand why Virat Kohli was rested for the West Indies tour Chopra while speaking on Jatin Sparu s YouTube channel said that off late Kohli hasn t played too many games and it is often that they are forced to remind people about Kohli s stats and numbers The problem is that you need to remind people of Virat s numbers This is because he has played very little and missed more games of late Even Rohit and Suryakumar won t score in every game But since they play continuously we remember the good knocks that they played Virat walks into the team no doubt but he should have played at least the ODIs or T Is against the West Indies said Chopra
