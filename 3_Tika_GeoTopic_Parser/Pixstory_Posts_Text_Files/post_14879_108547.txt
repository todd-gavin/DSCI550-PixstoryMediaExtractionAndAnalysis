Research carried out in the United Kingdom by a team of Italian and English researchers has demonstrated the causal link between the quality of work and the mental health of workers, especially in women. The study published in the journal Labor Economics was conducted by Professors of Political Economy Michele Belloni from the University of Turin Elena Meschi from the Milan Bicocca University and by Ludovico Carrino researcher from King&#39;s College London and the University of Trieste The analyzes carried out used data from over British female and male workers who carried out the same job between and The conditions within which these people worked have changed over time both due to technological progress and the phases of economic growth and decline that have affected the work of companies. The study analyzed how the mental health of workers in general has reacted over time to changing working conditions Researchers have found that the main characteristics of a job that have an effect on the mental health of its employees are two flexibility in organizing working hours and the degree of autonomy people have in applying and develop their skills in the workplace The research has found that these job characteristics have different consequences based on the sex of the worker, in particular the mental health of women appears more sensitive to variations in the quality of work Finally, the study underlines the great importance economic and social results for the context of the female working figure also considering that in England, as in Italy, women tend to cover more frequently a multiplicity of crucial roles such as looking after the home and children which create conflicts between family and work The analysis carried out evidence that improvements in the quality of work lead to large reductions in depression and anxiety for women This evidence suggests that public and private policies that improve occupational health could lead to greater efficiency in health services and for the well-being of the whole of society given that the costs associated with mental health are notoriously very significant
