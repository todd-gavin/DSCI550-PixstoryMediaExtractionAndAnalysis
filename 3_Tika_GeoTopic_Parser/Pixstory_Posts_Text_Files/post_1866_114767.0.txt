People of ripe vintage would be familiar with the terms "Current Booking" & "Advance Booking". 

Such was the mania for popular Hindi films in the 1970s that it was impossible to get current tickets, even if the film was 'Gai Aur Gori'. 

This pic was recently tweeted by Amitabh Bachchan & he said this was the crowd of people waiting to get tickets for his film 'Don'. 

'Don' was released in 1978. 

'Don', today regarded as a classic, had an interesting history. Produced by Nariman Irani, a cameraman in the unit of Manoj Kumar, it was directed by a banker from Nairobi, whose name is Chandra Barot. Barot was then working as an assistant director to Manoj Kumar for the film 'Roti, Kapda Aur Makaan'. 

The film was made so that Nariman Irani could pay off his debts. By the time 'Don' was released, Irani had unfortunately died. 

Barot counted Bachchan and Zeenat Aman as his personal friends. Bachchan reduced his fee & Zeenat Aman worked for free. The film started sometime in 1974 & finally got released in 1978. 

Don proved to be a "sleeper hit", that is, it took time to gather steam & once it did, it became a golden jubilee hit. 

Strangely, Barot never directed a Hindi film again.
