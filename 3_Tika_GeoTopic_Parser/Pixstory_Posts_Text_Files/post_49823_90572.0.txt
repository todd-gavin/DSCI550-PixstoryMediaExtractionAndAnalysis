‌Yes, we all know the history of America and guns and we had enough of it! Guns aren't reducing any violence here and doing the opposite. 
‌
‌Accidental gunfires, suicide, abuse, everything have surged in America and all fingers point toward the lack of gun control in the many states. The main argument stands upon protection. Does protection only come from guns? Many alternatives solutions can be used for protection such as pepper spray, safety kits, alarms anything but not guns. Use it only for protection and nothing else is another option but none does that. Many countries live without guns in the hand of civilians. Hence the force of the country works more efficiently and on time. If a country is concerned with the safety of its citizen; ensure it through security forces and not by giving weapons into the hands of civilians.
‌
‌Not to mention the mental state guns puts a person in. It does give the advantage to take a life and law in hands. Remember a society with guns tends to be violent.
