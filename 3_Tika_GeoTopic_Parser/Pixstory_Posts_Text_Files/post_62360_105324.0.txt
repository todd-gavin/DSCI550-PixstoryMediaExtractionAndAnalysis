Nature is beautiful. But isn't it even more wonderful that we can capture the beauty of the skies, of the flowers, the meadows, the humans-living and breathing, smiles, laughters, love, of everything else exactly as it is. And sometimes, the captured image transcends the beauty of the original object - it becomes immortal and immortalizes the object captured. The impressions in our minds might fade but the image lives on in our drives, in our files, in our google photos. When we feel nostalgic, we return yet again to these, remember these moments fondly, smile and laugh a little. After all memories are the most precious gift that we humans have.
