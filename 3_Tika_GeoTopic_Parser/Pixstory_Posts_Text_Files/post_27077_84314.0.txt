When it comes to revolutionising sci fi movies Star Wars get all the credit, the sheer craze of Star wars brought Sci fi into light and people started to notice it. Back to the future trilogy took things further and the love began to grow, but the real MVP of sci fi movies should be Interstellar. 

Interstellar has all the elements that according to me all the Star Wars and Other sci fi movies lack, the movie id brilliant in all its aspects. It is full of emotion and science. Nolan’s trilogy of time includes Inception, Interstellar and then Tenet with Interstellar being the most brilliant one of the three. Interstellar deals with a near apocalyptic world where humans have to deal with extraordinary climatic conditions in order to survive with earth nearing towards its end. 

The movie follows an extraordinary adventure where some scientists try to find out the answer for earth’s problems and find a civilisation worthy planet. 

The movie is packed with emotions and reality of life with hard hitting dialogues and a oscar worthy performance from Matthew McConoughey. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are forces to be reckoned with in their screentime. 

Most importantly on this World Science day, if you want to see a good science fiction movie, Interstellar is the one for you as it checks all the boxes for the perfect Sci Fi film, and for me, the greatest Sci fi film ever made.
