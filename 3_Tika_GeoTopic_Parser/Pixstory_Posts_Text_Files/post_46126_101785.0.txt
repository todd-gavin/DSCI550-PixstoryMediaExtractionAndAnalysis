No meal in India is complete without this quintessential flatbread , Roti ! Roti is simply Jaan Of Indians ! ❤️🥞

But sometimes There are days when i Don't feel like having normal roti ! And at the point I can't decide how to eat a normal roti ! ❌😩

And on all those days stuffing certain veggies and things into the roti comes as a rescue for me ! A Normal roti when suffused with veggie or spices makes for a healthful and delicious eat ! ✅🤤

I have my own 3 ways of Roti ! And These 3 ways are my absolute Favourite ! 

1 Spinach Roti -
Spinach , yes i know how nutrient-dense it is , especially with iron . It is also a great source of B vitamins , vitamin E , vitamin K , and minerals like calcium , magnesium ! Spinach Roti Helps Boost Immunity , Helps Combat Anemia and Helps Boost Hemoglobin !


2 Beetroot Roti - 
These beautiful looking chapati are healthy and quick , easy to make . Beetroot roti -
1 Increase Stamina
2 Prevent Heart Disease and Stroke
3 Lower Blood Pressure
4 Boost Your Immune System .


3 Dal roti - 
Packed with nutrients like zinc , protein and iron dal roti helps to maintain the elasticity of your skin and help to keep it moist . Fiber , potassium and magnesium from dal will work together to regulate blood pressure and soothe the nerves and is diabetic friendly .

All these Roti's have There own Benefits and Are Tasty as well ! Among all 3 i love Spinach Roti alot ! I always have Spinach roti With Chutney , Curd , pickle ! And the best part is You can have These Roti's In any meal of the day ! I usually have them in Lunch or breakfast ! ❤️😋
