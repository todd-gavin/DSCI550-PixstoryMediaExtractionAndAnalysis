If you have to look up Romelu Lukaku s Chelsea career up until now it could be summarized in his miss against Real Madrid The Belgian international has a lot of expectations from him given his price tag But it is just not going right for him at the moment Romelu Lukaku had a golden chance to redeem himself in front of the Chelsea fans in the UEFA Champions League The Blues were down at home and Lukaku had just been subbed on Cesar Azpilicueta floated in a delightful ball for the Chelsea striker in the th minute But an unmarked Romelu Lukaku headed the ball just wide of Thibaut Courtois s goal to everyone s disbelief The year old forward scored four goals in four games after his much anticipated Chelsea return But things just fell flat after that Things started going southwards for Romelu Lukaku after he suffered an injury against Malmo in the Champions League in October The Belgian international returned from the injury in late November but he has lacked his edge since Lukaku has since been given a place on the substitutes bench and has rarely started games for the Blues Romelu Lukaku has scored goals in Premier League games this season But in this the Belgian has just started games Overall the striker has scored just goals in games and these are certainly not the numbers that you expect after paying million for a player What has gone wrong with Lukaku Romelu Lukaku is certainly lacking confidence at the moment You could have bet your house while saying Inter Milan s Lukaku would have buried the chance against Real Madrid in the Champions League To add to this Romelu Lukaku s comments about wanting to return to Inter Milan have not helped his case The fans have turned on the striker and he has since felt unloved Hence it has to be seen if Romelu Lukaku can redeem himself in the coming games or would it be the end of the road for him in the summer
