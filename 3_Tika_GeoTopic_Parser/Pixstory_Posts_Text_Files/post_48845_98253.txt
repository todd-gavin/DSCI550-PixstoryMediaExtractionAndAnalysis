 This is my death bed confession Norma McCorvey tells director Nick Sweeney as she turns to the camera with an oxygen tube dangling from her nose in AKA Jane Roe In a scene taped in she informs Sweeney that she never actually supported the anti abortion cause I took their money and they put me in front of the camera and told me what to say and I spoke exactly what they wanted me to say It was all an act the director asks Yeah she says I was good at it too The reveal occurs minutes into the documentary s minute runtime McCorvey died at minute succumbing to sickness leaving those she knew on both sides of America s most controversial cultural issue slack jawed and stunned McCorvey never had an abortion She d been forced to carry through her pregnancy by the time the Supreme Court made its verdict the child had already been adopted It was her third time as a mother McCorvey s mother had raised one daughter primarily and McCorvey had placed a second child for adoption McCorvey worked a series of low paying jobs in Texas and struggled with substance misuse at various times she wasn t ready to start a family Her dire circumstances qualified her as a viable plaintiff Her counsel would not have been able to argue that the present state by state solution placed an onerous burden on their client if she had the financial means to go to a location where abortion was already allowed So while Roe didn t help McCorvey it did aid other women in similar situations Might wanna update that knowledge there Sir Campbell
