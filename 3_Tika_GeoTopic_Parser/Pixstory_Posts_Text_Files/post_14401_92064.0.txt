While Juventus' defeat to Inter came in controversial circumstances and it was disappointing, Juve were perhaps never going to win the Serie A anyway.

The style of football has often been dire, with many wins coming in the same way as Inter won despite an average performance. That has always been reminiscent of the rebuild the club needs, now more than ever.

The performance against Inter was really good and those haven't been seen too often. To have more of those performances, young blood is needed in the squad.

To expect to win the league was largely unrealistic and it is now time to get back to the job that was being done - rebuild right and don't postpone it anymore.
