Juventus are on the verge of signing Olympique de Marseille striker Arkadius Milik, per transfer football expert Fabrizio Romano. 

Barcelona’s Memphis Delay has been the Serie A giant’s primary transfer target in the attack but upon several days of deadlock negotiations, they have switched interest to the pursuit of the Ex-Napoli forward. 

The Polish international will join Juventus on an initial loan deal worth €2 million and a buy option can be activated the following season for a fee in the region of €8 million.

The Bianconeri have been looking for a back-up striker to Dusan Vlahovic in the transfer market, and they have settled on the Polish player.

Arkadius Milik has netted 30 times  and provided three assists in 55 appearances for Marseille.
 
The major stumbling block in the Dutch striker Memphis Depay’s deal is a high wage demand of which The Bianconeri are unwilling to match. As a result, final communication has not been made with regards to Depay’s transfer.
