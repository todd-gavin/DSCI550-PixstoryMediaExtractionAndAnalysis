A blast from the past might be in the works for the Los Angeles Lakers as the franchise keeps inviting young prospects for pre-draft workouts.

About a dozen potential 2022 draftees have presented their skills to Lakers coaches since May. Unfortunately, L.A. still doesn’t own a single pick in the 2022 NBA Draft. However, vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka has confirmed the franchise is looking to acquire a second-rounder — most likely in exchange for cash considerations.

With those plans in mind, The Athletic’s Jovan Buha reports the Lakers have reportedly booked a workout with Shaquille O’Neal’s oldest son, Shareef, who is draft-eligible this year.

Although Shareef was one of the top high school prospects out of California in 2018, his college career has hardly resembled that of his Hall of Famer father. The 6-foot-10 forward averaged 2.6 points and 3.0 rebounds in three seasons. However, the 22-year-old struggled with injuries in college, preventing him from displaying his full potential.

Shareef represented UCLA for one year before transferring to LSU, Shaquille’s alma mater.

The 2022 NBA Draft will take place at Barclays Center in New York City on June 23.
