Robert Eggersâ€™ The Northman has earned $3.4M in the movie's international opening weekend in 15 markets. Although the movie has been praised by the critics a lot and even by the audience, the people just aren't coming out to see the movie, this won't be the first time a historical period drama hasn't earned money at the box office, the recent example is The Last Duel by Ridley Scott. The Northman has a budget of 70-80 million USD and its not likely that it will earn the money back for the producers.
