Women protesters return to the streets; The protesters demanded that women have access to work and education

A number of women protesters in Kabul held a street rally calling for women to have access to work and education in Afghanistan.

 Afghanistan will not achieve stability and justice without the participation of women in power and politics.
This is the first protest by women since the recent arrests of protesters by the Taliban.

The Afghanistan Transformation Wave Party, which organized the demonstrations, told a news conference on Saturday that it supported women's protests in the country.

The party has said that barriers to opening schools and universities to women remain in place and that there has been no change in restrictions on women.
