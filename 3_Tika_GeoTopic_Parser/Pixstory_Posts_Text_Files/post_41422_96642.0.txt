Liverpool's triumph in another quick and furious Merseyside derby wasn't just about staying in second place in the Premier League title race behind Manchester City. 

US News reported that with a month left in the season, Liverpool's 2-0 win at Anfield on Sunday also pushed Everton into the relegation zone, putting Everton's 68-year run in England's top flight in jeopardy. 

Liverpool won thanks to second-half goals from Andrew Robertson and Divock Origi in a game that ended with euphoric home fans screaming "Going down, going down" to their opponents from across Stanley Park. 

Everton's day was rounded off by relegation opponent Burnley's 1-0 victory over Wolverhampton at home, their second consecutive win since sacking long-serving manager Sean Dyche.

Everton are now in third-to-last place, two points behind Burnley, who have finally escaped the relegation zone. 

Everton, who has been in the Premier League every year since 1954-55, has played one fewer game than Burnley, but faces a difficult final stretch that includes games against Chelsea, Arsenal, and in-form Brentford. 

More significantly for Liverpool, the Reds have regained a one-point lead over City with five games remaining in a title fight that appears likely to go down to the wire.
