Iran and the United States have returned to the negotiating table in Vienna for yet another round of talks to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement that the Trump administration tore up. The European powers are negotiating on behalf of the U.S. with the Biden Administraion officials operating in the background. This is the most crucial phase that could make or break the deal, and there are indications that the talks have again hit a deadlock.

Iran is sticking to its demand that the U.S. guarantee that it will not walk back on the agreement like it did under Trump. But the U.S. is unlikely to agree to such a commitment. 

The rhetoric from Tehran is not encouraging the negotiators, although Russia only recently said that talks were progressing on the right track. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian has said that a “good deal” would be within reach provided that the US,  Britain, France and Germany  are “serious in returning to their commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal.” (https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/08/middleeast/mideast-summary-2-8-2022-intl/index.html)

A senior U.S. official has been quoted by the Washington Post as saying that major issues on the table have remained unresolved. The official has been quoted as saying that the negotiations are both “closer than we have been to a deal,” and “closer than we have been to breakdown” as time for agreement runs out. “Both outcomes are still very possible.” (https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/10/iran-nuclear-us/)

The pressure is building on the Biden Administration, too, with several Republican Congress members saying that they want President Biden to present the deal to the Congress before it is struck with Iran.

The U.S. has accused Iran of introducing new demands that were not part of the 2015 deal. U.S. officials have said that the deal may not go ahead If Iran keeps demanding that sanctions unrelated to its nuclear program are also lifted. These include sanctions against Iran for its alleged human rights violation and others.

Negotiators have time until the end of this month to strike a deal or throw the world into yet another crisis.
