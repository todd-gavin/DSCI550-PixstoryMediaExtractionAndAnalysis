First of all what is power oppression and privilege The ability to modify influence and effect things is referred to as power The use of authority to disempower isolate silence or otherwise subordinate one social group or category usually in order to further empower and or privilege the oppressor is known as oppression It s important to note that oppression isn t reversible It doesn t work in reverse for example misandry heterophobia reverse racism since the oppressed minority is powerless in the scenario A privilege is a right or advantage that is only granted to a certain group or category of people Privilege is about groups of people rather than individuals For example a poor man still has a privilege over a poor woman due to the long going system of patriarchy Many men often ask Why must we take accountability for what men in the past did And the answer to it is simple Because you still exercise the privileges men in the past kept for themselves It is ironic to complain about being blamed for patriarchy when you re an active participant of the system and are consciously or unconsciously benefitting from it Denying that you are profiting off of it is ignorance at its best because you know in your heart that s not true Part as a support post
