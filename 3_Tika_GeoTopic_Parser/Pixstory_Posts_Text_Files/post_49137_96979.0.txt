You say there's "gender policing" of women going on in sports, whatever that is, but that's necessary. Sports differ a lot for men and women.

Females do not have the same athletic ability as males. Because males are taller, faster, and stronger than women, the standards of men's sports are naturally higher, and as a result, there is a lot more interest in them. You can spend as much money as you want on women's football, but people will never be as interested in women's sports as they are in men's sports.

This is the only reason women's, or for that matter children's, and disabled people's leagues exist because they are incapable of competing with open-age, able-bodied men. People are more interested in seeing the best than they are in watching mediocrity. As a result, the World Cup Final is more popular than my local pub football club.

Women's sports and leagues follow the same principle. The only reason women-only events exist in the first place is that, according to basic biology, the best women are impotent in competing with the best men. 

It's all about the money, as Matthew Bates put it. To take it a step further, is it because you follow women's sports? I don't think so. I have nothing against female athletes; in fact, I think they should be encouraged to participate in sports, but it isn't as intense as it is for men. Watch it for yourself if you don't believe me. Choose a sport you're familiar with and watch both men and women compete. Tell me which one you think is more interesting.
