Black women have always had it tough in sports. Institutional racism and other structural impediments that have long harmed Black women and other oppressed groups in the United States are designed to keep them from achieving success. 

However, it is great to see that times are changing black people, especially women, are carving their own space in sports and this provides opportunities for future Black athletes, and reflect the community's strength, hard ethic, and beauty.

For instance, Peres Jepchirchir, the reigning Olympic champion, finished first in the Boston Marathon for the first time in a half-century. 

US News reported that on Monday, the 28-year-old Kenyan won a see-saw sprint in the last mile of the world's most renowned 26.2-mile race, which returned to its usual Patriots' Day slot in the schedule for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began.

On the 50th anniversary of the first official women's race, Jepchirchir exchanged places eight times in the last mile with Ethiopia's Ababel Yeshaneh before breaking away for good on Boylston Street and finishing in 2 hours, 21 minutes, 1 second.

“I was feeling she was strong. I pushed it,” said Jepchirchir, who earned $150,000 and the traditional gilded olive wreath. “I fell behind. But I didn’t lose hope.”

Let’s hope that this becomes the norm and nothing out of the ordinary.
