Ayan Mukerji's directorial venture Brahmastra is a super hit! Starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, the film managed to shatter all records on its opening day.✅🔥🔥🔥The film garnered absolutely impressive numbers in its opening weekend as it minted Rs 125 crore worldwide. On Day 5, September 13, Brahmastra remained rock steady as the film collected in the range of Rs 12.75 crore to Rs 13.75 crore, taking the five-day total collection to Rs 150.50 crore, according to early reports.On day 5, the collections went down by around 20%. ✅✅😱😱😱😱The drop was not huge, and can be recovered if the film sees a rise in collections in the coming days. As per a BoxOfficeIndia.com report, Brahmastra collections at the domestic box office fell the most in the national chains across the country.✔️✔️✅✅👍👍The fifth-day collection of Brahmastra is marginally lower than the first-day collection of this year's second biggest opener, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2. ✔️✔️The Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt film directed by Ayan Mukerji has headed for an opening week of around Rs. 170 crores and will surely enter the Rs. 200 crore club by the end of the second weekend.👍✅✅✅Earlier, Ayan Mukerji had taken to Instagram to share that Brahmastra had taken a solid start at the box office. He said that in a span of only three days, the film had crossed the ₹100 crore mark at the domestic box office, while it collected ₹225 crore gross at the global box office. ✅🙏🙏🙏🙏The director also expressed his gratitude to the audiences for accepting the movie.
