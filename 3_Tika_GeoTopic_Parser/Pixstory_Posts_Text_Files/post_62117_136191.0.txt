Fabrizio Romano has given Chelsea‘s move for Juventus‘ Denis Zakaria the “Here we go”, confirming the Swiss midfielder’s move to the Premier League. The Swiss defensive midfielder joins a raft of signings at the West London club, including Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella, Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly.
Chelsea sign a midfield monsterThe Swiss midfielder, described in some scouting reports as a “midfield monster”, is moving to Stamford Bridge on loan. Personal terms between Chelsea and Denis Zakaria are also in place, which means that there is no potential friction or cause for concern in the move. According to The Athletic, the player is already undergoing a medical in Italy, so there is little risk of him pulling out of a move akin to Bamba Dieng.
Thomas Tuchel’s side have looked relatively weak in midfield throughout the earliest stages of this season. With Ngolo Kante and Mateo Kovacic both spending a lot of time on the sidelines, the Blues have struggled with ball recovery and transitioning the play up to the front three.
Introducing Zakaria is an ideal step to resolving this issue. Statistics show that the player is dominating Serie A, completing a lot of interceptions, passes and even scoring more goals than average. The Swiss player is a complete midfielder and adds necessary depth and quality to the depleted ranks at Cobham.
Chelsea are celebrating the arrival of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona, ending the club’s time without a clear centre-forward option. This should make finishing easier for Thomas Tuchel’s side, with the chances that do break through having a lower conversion rate than the German manager would hope for. This is the main necessity left for Chelsea, with other arrivals a bonus for the club.`
