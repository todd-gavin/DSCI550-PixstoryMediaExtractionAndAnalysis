Cyprus will face Kosovo in a match at the AEK Arena stadium in Larnaca, Cyprus, on June 2, 2022, at 16:00 UTC. The game is part of Group 2 of League C.

Cyprus has had an unpredictably bad run of late. In recent years, their most common result has been defeat. Their defense also appears to be a disaster. They had gone 10 games without a win before winning the game mentioned above. Such a streak is extremely unappealing.

Kosovo, on the other hand, has recently improved their performance. Their most recent recordings appear to be rather good. Among them are a couple of drews versus European teams such as Switzerland and Greece. Such results may instill enough confidence in them to take on this Cyprus team. They'll be hoping for a strong showing in their first Nations League match of the season.

Kosovo vs Cyprus: Probable Playing XI

Cyprus: Neofytos Micheal; Pieros Sotiriou, Konstantinos Laifis, Andreas Karo; Paris Psaltis, Grigoris Kastanos, Kostakis Artymatas, Ioannou Pittas; Marinos Tzionis, Pieros Sotiriou, Fotis Papoulis

Kosovo: Arijanet Muric; Mergim Vojvoda, Amir Rrahmani, Fidan Aliti, Florent Hadergjonaj; Valon Berisha, Florian Loshaj; Zymer Bytyqi, Milot Rashica, Milot Rashica; Vedat Muriqi

Kosovo vs Cyprus: Prediction

When we look at the form of both of these teams at their various

patches in terms of recent performances, we believe Kosovo has a stronger run.

We are favoring Kosovo with their decent on-road run at the moment, despite the lack of head-to-head facts to evaluate.

Prediction: Kosovo 2 - 0 Cyprus
