The picture used in the story is false No such claim was made by the American publication The New York Times has itself denied that it published no such story in their paper The actual front page of the Sunday edition of the New York Times is different and had been morphed to include the supposed article Last Best Hope of Earth is a phrase made popular by Abraham Lincoln which he made in reference to the United States of America Freedom and Democracy during the Civil War in There are no recent news articles in the New York Times which call PM Modi as the Last Best Hope Of Earth Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE
