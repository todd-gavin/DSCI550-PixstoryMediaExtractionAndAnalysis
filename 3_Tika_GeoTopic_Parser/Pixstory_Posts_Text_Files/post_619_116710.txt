July how many of us know it s marked on your Calendar as Emoji Day the day we celebrate the new language of the modern day world The language of emojis where a character displays your emotions and you don t feel the need for word It was around this time last year ok may be a bit earlier that a friend started teaching me or rather introducing me to the world of emojis The best I could do was send a smilie A year later what have I been upto Well I am trying to use emojis now but somehow know only some and relate to a few The one with a shy smile another a relatively confident one the grin and laughter types yes the ones which tear up while laughing The ones that are red with anger and purple with rage I have also learnt that emojis and have various degrees of expression Take for example a laugh Well Same for sad ones also Ok look at love Hold on what do they mean the blue heart white purple green black uff even a yellow When does one use these The list of ones I don t understand is endless common on And more important I have stopped asking my friend and my friend has stopped explaining The attempts seem vain and I might seem so out of touch I am part of the minority who can express better with words And when u are in the business of words only what can you say I ll still bore you with words So this little fellow is the only one you might see in my conversation these days The max I go for is this Sorry i can t find all my expressions and emotions there Give me a bigger bank Sometimes may be the heart is more hurting than this and none of these seem to express or I am more happy than these I will comply then What about you Join the conversation
