Do you remember that episode of Sex the City in which Carrie drunk in the Vogue wardrobe remains amazed in front of a pair of Mary Janes by Jimmy Choo Who knows if this scene will be repeated in the reboot aired on HBO but above all who knows if this time it will surprise her it will be the fact that those mary janes are for men Fendi Comme de Garons Erdem and JW Anderson are the first brands to have presented a male version of the famous shoes with one and two straps on the instep Once upon a time at the beginning of they were shoes for children and then over the years they became exclusively female footwear But today, almost a hundred years later, men are re-appropriated this type of formal shoe from school echoes The reconquest of the eclectic and feminine side began five years ago when men&#39;s fashion abandoned with the great renunciation of the nineteenth century in which embroidered suits, heels and noble furs had been replaced by sad three-piece smoke-colored suits of London Men, indeed better, people are ready to shape a fashion characterized by genderless in which you wear what you burn regardless by who brought it in the previous hundred years
