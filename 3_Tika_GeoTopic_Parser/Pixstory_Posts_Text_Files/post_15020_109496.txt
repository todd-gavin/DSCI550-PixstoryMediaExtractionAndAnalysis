A new study has revealed the mechanisms through which the Zika virus transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes can damage the brain development of unborn children. The discovery comes from research conducted at the Institute of Neurosciences of the National Research Council Cnr In and at the University of Pisa and published in the journal Stem Cell Reports Congenital Zika syndrome was first described in Brazil in some newborns whose mothers contracted the infection during pregnancy Zika virus crossed the placenta during pregnancy causing serious injury to the central nervous system of unborn children including microcephaly and other pathologies of brain development To understand how the Zika virus can cause these alterations, researchers have used an innovative system of human neural stem cells Starting from the intuition that congenital Zika syndrome has strong similarities with the FOXG syndrome studied for a long time by the Cnr research group It has been seen that the Zika virus also alters both the quantity and the intracellular localization of FOXG a protein that is the protagonist of the development of the cerebral cortex The latter in fact represents the most evolved part of our brain and ensures man&#39;s cognitive abilities self-perception of the surrounding world The correct dimension and architecture of the cerebral cortex acquired during embryonic development in a process that perhaps represents one of the most delicate and intimate complex aspects of the human being
