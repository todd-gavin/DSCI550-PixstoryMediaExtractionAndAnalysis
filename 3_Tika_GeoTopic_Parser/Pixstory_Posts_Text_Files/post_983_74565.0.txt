India Divided was published in 1946, a year before India's partition. Most of the book was written in Barabanki jail by Rajendra Prasad, who went on to become the first president of independent India. The crucial historical document questioned the two-nation theory and concluded that Hindu-Muslim discord could be settled with the formation of a secular state where there is cultural autonomy for both groups.

Printed on Indian handmade paper, a rare first edition of India Divided will be up for sale in the third edition of the Nationalism Book Auction hosted by Prinseps. With a price estimate between Rs30,000-50,000, India Divided is among a rare catalogue of books from the pre-independence era which are going under the hammer on January 25.
