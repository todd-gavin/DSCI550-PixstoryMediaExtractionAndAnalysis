There had been a time when words had been the only place he could find solace. No book ever lost patience with him or told him to sit still. When his tutors had thrown up their hands in frustration, it was the library that had taught Nikolai military history, strategy, chemistry, astronomy.

Here is a place to hide when you’re frightened, to play when you’re bored, to rest when the world seems unkind.
