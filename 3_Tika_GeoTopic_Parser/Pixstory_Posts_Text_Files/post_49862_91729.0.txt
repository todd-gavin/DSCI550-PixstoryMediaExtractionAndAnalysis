Children are always curious. Guns are a source of curiosity to most of them. ‌Gun violence among children is on the news every day, and the incident in Missouri is heart-breaking. Children and guns never go together. What does a weapon's influence cause in children? Insensitivity, intolerance and violence.
‌
‌A bill intended for at keeping guns from kids failed to gain traction in the Tennessee General Assembly. Meanwhile, it's happy hour for adults as the types of weapons they can carry without a permit expanded😒. 
‌
‌The bill to keep guns from the reach of children below 12 failed without any debate in the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee, which is dominated by Republicans whereas the same committee passed on the loosened gun laws without any hesitation.
‌
‌I say the gun isn't definitely an option even for teens. An armed generation is not what we are expecting. As adults, if they have an affinity for guns; join the police or military for training. They could help the nation. Children don't want guns near them. As guns are not easily going to disappear from American households at least ensure the guns are locked. It's not something to play or show off for kids. Never promote violence but yes teach them self defence, through sports such as Karate or Kickboxing. We all know that once we resort to gun violence then there is no turning back. We have an example happening just a few kilometres away.
