The 171st birth anniversary of Angelo Moriondo, an inventor of the Espresso Machine, is being celebrated by Google on June 6. The search engine has honoured the Godfather of Espresso Machine with an artistic Doodle which is a delight, particularly for Coffee lovers. Angelo Moriondo was credited for patenting the earliest known Espresso Machine back in 1884. 

Google Doodle celebrates Angelo Moriondo with a Gif of the first known espresso machine. It was created by guest artist Olivia When and it is painted with coffee. 

Todayâ€™s Google Doodle celebrating Angelo Moriondo is also a reminder of a time when coffee was at its peak in popularity in Italy. However, coffee lovers had to face extreme inconvenience as they had to spend a lot of time waiting for the coffee to brew. Here stepped in Moriondo with his revolutionary machine.
