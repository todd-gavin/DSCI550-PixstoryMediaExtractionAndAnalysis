Loving yourself is the most sweetest thing you can do for yourself. You are important , you'll take time to realise this but know that your important. I know sometimes we all feel low about ourselves. We feel we are not special , unique . Feeling like your completely worthless there is nothing left to do . You don't feel pretty and your heart aches a lot . But know that we all are humans we do make mistakes we were never meant to be perfect. Sit and count your blessings and then you'll know they are endless. You are strong , you just need to lighten it. Giving up is ok sometimes but not losing yourself. It's ok to cry sometimes or feel sad it's fine but after that tell yourself that you are strong and trust me you can do it .
