Pedri has been confirmed as Barcelona’s new no. 8, for the 2022-23 season with the teenage superstar taking the shirt made famous by the Spanish legend Andres Iniesta.

The 19-year-old who moved to Blaugrana from Las Palmas in the year 2020, has enjoyed two successful seasons at the club even though his team has failed to find out the silverware.

The rich form has seen him rewarded with a bump-up pecking order from the next term - and it will see him follow in the footsteps of Iniesta as well as some other famous names at Camp Nou.

What was Pedri’s previous number at Barcelona?

The youngster was handed over no.16 after he arrived at the Camp Nou, as no.8 was worn by the Bosnia international Miralem Pjanic. With the no. 8 shirt occupied, Pedri was forced to fight for his place and did so, helping his team to the 2021 Copa Del Rey under the leadership of Ronald Koeman.

Yet when Miralem Pjanic was loaned out to Besiktas, the no.8 was handed over to the returning club legend Dani Alves. But now, as Dani Alves has departed the club, Pedri has been allowed with a starting number.

Who else has worn no.8 at Barcelona?

A litany of the major players has worn the number 8 for the Blaugranas, including Guillermo Amor, Hristo Stoichkov, Albert Celades and Phillip Cocu - plus former boss and now Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.

But it is Andres Iniesta with whom the shirt has been mostly associated. He took the reign of the number 8 in the year 2007 and handed it over in the year 2018. During his time at Barcelona, he arguably became the most feared midfielder in Europe and the world and led Barcelona to a raft of major trophies at home and away.
