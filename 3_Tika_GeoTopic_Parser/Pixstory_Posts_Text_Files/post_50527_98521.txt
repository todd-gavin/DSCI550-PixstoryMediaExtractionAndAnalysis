Oh man I am right now years old and going to turn in this June but I still watch Shinchan I don t know who still watches cartoons like Shinchan in this age as well But honestly I can t never get rid of this cartoon One of the best memories I had from my childhood is that whenever I came back from school I just start watching Shinchan My obsession was on another level I mean I used to be known among my friends circle through Shinchan just everybody knew about it Now I can even imitate just like Shinchan another talent and used to do activities just like he do like teasing your mom Well I specifically don t know why I had so huge obsession But yes it may be because it is such a joy to watch so relaxing Just like any another cartoon it does not display any superpowers which becomes just so boring with time Well we all had some of our favourite cartoons to watch which meant special to us Do just let me know
