Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, a Republican, slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin's provocations as a clear breach of international law as Russia escalated its assault against Ukraine earlier this week. 

The Senate's Ukraine Caucus co-chair encouraged the Biden administration to work with allies to ensure a coordinated reaction to this unjustified ongoing intrusion on Ukraine's sovereign land. 

However, U.S News reported that one of the Republican candidates hoping to succeed Portman had a completely different message.

“I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” J.D. Vance said in a podcast interview. “I’m sick of Joe Biden focusing on the border of a country I don’t care about while he lets the border of his own country become a total war zone.”

The Republican Party's divided — and swiftly changing — attitude to Europe's most serious foreign policy crisis in years reflects a fractured — and rapidly changing — Republican Party. An ascendant generation of conservatives is confronting an old guard, largely centred in Washington, that has long warned of Russian aggression. They openly question why the US should care about Russia's moves at all.

After Putin initiated a military incursion in Ukraine on Thursday, the GOP's foreign policy strategy took on new urgency. The party's divisions in the run-up to the vote served as a reminder of Donald Trump's long-lasting impact on the Republican Party, even after he left the White House.
