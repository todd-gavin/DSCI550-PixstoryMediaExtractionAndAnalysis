The first game of a three-match series between Australia and Zimbabwe featured Cameron Green taking his first five-wicket haul before David Warner and Steve Smith easily handled the run chase to set up a five-wicket victory for Australia over Zimbabwe. 

AP News reported that this was the first one-day international series the African nation had played in the country since 2004. 

On Sunday, after Australian captain Aaron  Finch had invited Zimbabwe to bat, Green collected 5-33 as the visitors lost their final six wickets for 15 runs and were eventually dismissed for 200 in Townsville, a city in tropical north Queensland. 

The run chase was subsequently easily accomplished by Australia thanks to Warner's 57 off 66 balls and Steve Smith, who served as the innings's captain and struck an unbeaten 48 off 80 balls.
