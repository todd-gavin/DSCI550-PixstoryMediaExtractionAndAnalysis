IS CONGRESS IN TROUBLE? As a matter of fact yes! This election has once again proved that Congress is slowly losing its momentum. It's high time for the party to make necessary amendments to the structure. In spite of the vigorous campaigns of Priyanka Gandhi in UP, they couldn't revive the party. In Punjab, Priyanka Gandhi's favouritism towards Navjot Singh Siddu backfired and made the internal conflicts in the state even worse. Even in the elections last year in Kerala; Congress had a substantial loss to LDF despite the miserable position of CPI in Indian Politics. Even switching Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot—a staunch Gandhi family loyalist—to improve the party’s prospects in the next state election is no easy choice considering the case of Amarinder Singh in Punjab.

BJP CONTINUES TO WIN.‌ Does this mean religious intolerance working? Not the Covid-19 crisis, petrol prices, religious intolerance, farmer's plight (in this case last minute amendments of bills made difference) did cause any negative impact on the image of BJP or the mascot Narendra Modi. This means that the connection between religion and politics is no longer a possibility but a truth. Moreover UP election shows the calculations of caste politics of BJP is on point. Even though Yogi Adityanath was considered as a bad choice of CM in 2017, in his 5 years he proved himself worthy to people of UP. Even he has a great influence on the youth of UP.
