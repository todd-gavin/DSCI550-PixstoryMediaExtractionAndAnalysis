1. Song Kang
Though he rose to fame for his roles in "Nevertheless" and "Sweet Home," Song Kang went through extra miles and learned intensive ballet training for his coming-of-age drama "Navillera." For six months, the South Korean star learned the art and found that he actually enjoyed ballet. Maybe it runs in the blood as his father was a former gymnast!

2. Shin Hye Sun
Just like Song Kang, the award-winning actress was cast as a ballerina who became blind in the 2019 drama "Angel's Last Mission: Love."
Shin Hye Sun enrolled in ballet classes the second she was chosen for the role. In spite of her busy roster, the actress diligently learned the art even while filming a different drama.

3. Lee Jong Suk
In "Doctor Stranger," Lee Jong Suk proves that he's not only cut out for kissing scenes, but he's also amazing in action stunts! Though he's adept at driving cars, it's different when he's on a two-wheeled vehicle. For his acting role, Lee Jong Suk learned how to drive the bike for the popular chase scene in the drama.

4. Kim Ji Won
Kim Ji Won is known as one of the Korean celebs with aquaphobia or fear of water. For her role in "Lovestruck In The City," the actress became bigger than her fear and learned to love big bodies of water. She successfully learned how to surf for her surfing scenes with Ji Chang Wook, earning respect from fans for her dedication.

5. Lee Je Hoon
Lee Je Hoon transformed into an underground MMA fighter in the popular Netflix series "Move To Heaven." The actor made time to exercise intensely for four months prior to filming as his role required a lot of shirtless scenes.

6. Song Joong Ki
In 2021, the actor was given the role of an Italian-Korean lawyer and a mafia advisor in the hit series "Vincenzo." Though he didn't fly to Italy, he certainly learned the language for his role! The catch? The actor has never spoken Italian before prior to the drama, which made him more afraid of his Italian teacher than the drama director.
