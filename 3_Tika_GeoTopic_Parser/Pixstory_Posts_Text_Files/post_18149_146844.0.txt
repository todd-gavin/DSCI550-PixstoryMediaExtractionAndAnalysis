Gigi And Zayn Seemingly Hung Out While Celebrating Their Daughter’s Birthday Amid Reports That She And Leonardo DiCaprio Are Officially “Dating”.
It looks like Gigi Hadid and her ex, Zayn Malik, are as friendly as ever — despite reports of her budding romance with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Following his split from his 25-year-old girlfriend of four years, Camila Morrone, in late August, Leo reportedly has his sights set on Gigi.
This new and somewhat unlikely pairing has been the talk of the town for a couple of weeks now, particularly after People reported on Sept. 12 that 27-year-old Gigi and 47-year-old Leo were “getting to know each other.”
Fast forward two days, and Entertainment Tonight dropped the bombshell that Gigi and Leo — who is notorious for only dating people under the age of 25 — had already taken things one step further.
“Gigi and Leo are dating and into each other,” a source told ET, before spilling the tea on their “very flirty” outing to Casa Cipriani in NYC, where they were photographed together for the first time last week.
“They were sitting in the dining room area and were canoodling and having a fun night out with each other,” the source said, with a second insider adding that they're “having a good time together and Leo is very attracted to Gigi.”
Of course, neither Leo nor Gigi have directly commented on the reports, but her dad went on the record last week to give his take on the reported romance.
Real estate developer Mohamed Hadid told the Daily Mail that he was unsure whether or not the pair were dating, but he had met and liked Leo in the past.
“I met Mr. DiCaprio in St. Tropez four or five years ago and he is a very nice man,” Mohamed began. “I liked him.”
Little Khai turned 2 in style, marking the occasion with a spectacular Peppa Pig cake. Sharing a photograph of the colorful creation to her Instagram story, Gigi made sure to tag Zayn, who was presumably celebrating with them.
