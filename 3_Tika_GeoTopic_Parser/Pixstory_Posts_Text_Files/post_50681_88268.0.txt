Why We Buy: We decide to satisfy a need by making a purchase. We then determine that we
can afford the cost. Then we look at the alternatives (choices) available to us in regards to that
purchase (new car or used car, etc.)
Gathering Consumer Information: The amount of information we gather will depend on whether
the product is consumable (used up or thrown away after use) or not. You will usually make a
more satisfying purchase of reasonably expensive items if you research your alternatives.
Some things to consider are:
1. Quality: Is the product well constructed?
2. Cost: What is the lowest price for this product?
3. Availability: Where is it available? Is it in stock?
4. Warranty: If I'm not satisfied, may I return the product for a full refund? 
 5. Reputation: Reputation is the general opinion people have of a person or
company
