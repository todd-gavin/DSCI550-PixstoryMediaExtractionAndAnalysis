This installation in São Paulo by the Brazilian artist Siron Franco entitled Renascimento, or Rebirth, pays tribute to the more than 620 000 people who have died from covid-19 in the country.

Composed of 365 suspended mannequins, the work also honours Brazil’s health professionals, who are facing a huge surge in cases caused by the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, with 69 010 new daily cases on 14 January, up from 22 626 a week earlier.1 The true figures are likely to be much higher as a cyberattack on the health ministry last month has limited the collection of data from state health authorities.

Despite the figures, and unlike previous waves, omicron has not caused Brazil’s health system to collapse, thanks in part to 67% of adults now being fully vaccinated.
