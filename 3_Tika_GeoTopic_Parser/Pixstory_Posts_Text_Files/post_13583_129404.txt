Love for my country made me proud Wherever they ask me my nationality I say that I am Afghan Yes I am Afghan and I am proud of it Some may look down on me Some may belittle me And some may even insult my country But they don t know where Afghanistan is and how its people are Afghanistan is a land of love and sacrifice and I am also born in Afghanistan So I will dissolve all those insults and insults in the sea of my forgiveness and love I am rooted in the soil there I love this soil if it is polluted or clean I will stay there as long as I have breath I don t know what I want from there Although there is no hope of light in this darkness I m still thirsty in this dry plain One day I will pick flowers from the heart of this earth with my bare hands I will sing the hymn of victory there one day from the summit of the mountain like the sun And I know you will come back one day
