Had this tastyy dhokla with chai for my evening snackkk ❤️
Actually this dhokla is home made by my mother❤️

Dhokla is a vegetarian culinary dish that is native to the Indian state of Gujarat and parts of adjacent states.❤️

Dhokla is a savoury cake made out of Bengal gram flour and is steamed to get a fluffy texture. The dish occupies pride of place in its state of origin — Gujarat, and has become a favourite across the country. It’s a low-calorie, healthy and protein-packed snack. It’s cooked with little or no oil and takes very little time to prepare. The fermentation of the flour enhances its nutritive value. 🥳🤤😋

Dhokla has a low glycemic index which makes it good for diabetics.
