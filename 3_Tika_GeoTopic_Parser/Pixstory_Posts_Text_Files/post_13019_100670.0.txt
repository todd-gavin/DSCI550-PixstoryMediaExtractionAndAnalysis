Herat the Silk Road the heart of the country, with a stunning Friday mosque, and stronghold. The mosque was commissioned as early as 1,200 AD and was completed, during the centuries. Herat, the third-largest city in Afghanistan, is an ancient city in western Afghanistan and, its legacy is all the more remarkable, given that it was destroyed and rebuilt many times during its history.

Today, the Old City of Herat is home to a splendid collection of medieval Islamic buildings, including the Great Mosque complex. This ancient city of western Afghanistan which has many ruins and historical sites, such as the tomb of Maharani Goharshad or Herat Citadel.
It has such a Persian flavor- the city is situated, on only a stone boulder from the Iranian outskirts and was once inhabited by the Timur dynasty (dynasty that blended elements with Persian, Turkic, and Mongol culture in their age), besides, Tamerlane and Gengis Khan wreaked havoc on the city, but Herat was determined to live a period of unending glory during the reign of the Timur kings.

Today, Herat’s minarets, shrines, mosques, and monuments bear witness to the glory of the period when literature, art, and sophistication attained a high degree of perfection. The city preceded the Timurid Line home.

Around the colorful Persian mosques, caravanserais, ancient houses, and a recently restored citadel, Herat is one of the most beautiful cities in Afghanistan, apart from this you can see the Herat Citadel and the tombs of revered Sufi writers. Behind the main entrance is an artisan shop where you can see artisans at work, doing mosaic work, cutting tiles, and laying out new pieces, which are used in restoration and maintenance.
