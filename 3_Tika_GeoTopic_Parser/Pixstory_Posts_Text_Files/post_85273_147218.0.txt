Former Turkish International Arda Turan is undoubtedly one of the most gifted and popular footballing talents of his nation. The 35-year old winger was once one of the top footballing prospects of the world during his years in Spain. He played for two top La Liga sides during his prime - Atletico Madrid and FC Barcelona. In fact, Arda Turan was a vital cog in Barca's 2015 UEFA Champions League winning side. 
However, that was the peak of Turan's career and it was all downhill from there. He was soon sent away to Basaksehir on loan transfers due to alleged disciplinary lapses and various other reasons. The 2019/20 season was Arda Turan's last year at FC Barcelona and soon joined Galatasaray on a free transfer. 
Arda Turan has played a total of 527 matches in his career. He has scored 90 goals and provided 127 assists in those matches. His numbers in the Turkish Super Lig are particularly praiseworthy. These numbers do not do justice to how incredible Turan was as a winger. 
It was at Turkish club Galatasaray that he started his career and it was there that he also ended his career. A few days ago, the 35-year old announced his retirement via an emotional YouTube video on his own channel. There, he also mentioned his ambition to return to the field as a manager one day. 
Despite having a not-so-great ending to his career, Arda Turan made some good bucks during his years in La Liga. His net worth is estimated to be somewhere around $40,345,781 or 40 Million dollars. During his days at FC Barcelona, he used to earn a whopping 8 Million dollars per year. Arda Turan is also a well known face in Turkey and he earns a good deal of money from brand promotions as well.
