During the OT7 performance of Agust D‘s “Daechwita,” V, dressed up in costume, is tied up and seemingly executed by RM. Being the talented actor he is, his pose and facial expression captivated ARMYs’ attention, and they’ve been unable to get over it ever since.

Not only did ARMY finally get to see the transformation from V to “Taechwita,” and the reactions from the members on seeing this new look

In new behind-the-scenes footage, ARMY got to see the rehearsals with RM and V of the opening moments. In particular, it seems like RM had different plans for the iconic opening which V decided to have some fun with.

Although it might not have been intentional at the start, there is no denying that seeing V fall to the wrong side and his facial expressions after falling was truly iconic.
