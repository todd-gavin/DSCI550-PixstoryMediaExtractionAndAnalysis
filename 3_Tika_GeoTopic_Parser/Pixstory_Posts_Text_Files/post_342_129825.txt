These pics might look fun it is and it isn t This is my personal story of the climate change Best of my earliest memories were always connected to monsoon and the muddy water that rushed in front of my maternal home It was fun community fishing and the knee deep water that has now covered our fields is a delightful play ground Then I got a chance to live next to a river Of course it was fun But for years I wished the water made it up to my house so that I can skip the school Finally that day came in sometime end June mid July the water almost made it inside I remember guarding the place from snakes making into the house along with the water it became real We tuned into radio since electricity is the first causality to figure our any landslide upstream It was a natural phenomenon but really an early warning Year after year the frequency of landslide kept increasing so did the water levels It s almost granted today that water will gush it way into the house at least once a year The floods changed in Kerala brought the province to the brink of total collapse I can never forget that day August deadline for my dissertation got a call from my mom telling I have become an uncle and another call telling water flowed nearly over the first floor of my house I was still at a safe distance All those wishes to skip the school has come to haunt me this time I barely slept I couldn t because I was keeping an eye for water levels The natural disaster led news is a mere statistics in the newspaper unless it start to interfere with your life I think of those who lost their lives and livelihoods in natural calamities I wonder whose fault is it Was it theirs Just like these picture that looks like fun it is and it isn t
