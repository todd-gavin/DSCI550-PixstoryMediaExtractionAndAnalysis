If your friend has recently lost weight, you might want to tell them how great they look.

Maybe you also say that you wish you had their body or self-control or you ask them how they did it.

Perhaps you’ve been on the receiving end of such a compliment in the past.

Such comments are well-meaning but can have unintended negative consequences, according to experts in eating disorders.

“We are unintentionally exacerbating or affirming the thin ideal that our society tends to emphasise and idolise,” said Alvin Tran, an assistant professor of public health at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, who does research on eating disorders and body image.

“We need to be very cautious when we do approach conversations around someone’s physical appearance, especially their weight.”

This is especially important when talking to people with eating disorders or serious body image issues, since such remarks can worsen their situation.

Compliments about someone’s weight loss or thinner body perpetuate society’s deep-seated diet culture, Tran said, and the idea that thinness is inherently good.

“We do tend to operate (as if) we can somehow look at people and, based on body size, determine whether they’re healthy,” said Tamara Pryor, a senior fellow and director of research at ED Care, an eating disorder treatment centre based in Denver, Colorado.

“We have people in large bodies that are in a state of malnourishment as well as people in extremely low size that are malnourished, and people that are standard size but still very severely compromised by an eating disorder. People can’t look at them and tell that.”

But if you’re pleased or wowed by how someone looks, should you compliment them at all?

What is and isn’t OK to say?

CNN asked for advice from Pryor and Joann Hendelman, clinical director of the National Alliance for Eating Disorders.
