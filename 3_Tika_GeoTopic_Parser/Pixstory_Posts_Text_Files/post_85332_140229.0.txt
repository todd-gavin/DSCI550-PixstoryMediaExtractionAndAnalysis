#13 Marco Van Basten
Van Basten, the Dutch legend, had tasted the international trophy, but the one he wasdesperate to win never got there. Marco van Basten only appeared in one World Cup in1990, where the Netherlands were eliminated from the group stages despite compromisingRuud Gullit, Gerald Vanenburg, Ronald Koeman, and Frank Rijkaard to reclaim the success
of Johan Cruyff.
1992 was the last time Basten was seen playing for the World Cup qualifiers, but a horrificinjury ended his football career.
#12 Alfredo Di Stefano
The Real Madrid legend played for three countries, Argentina, Colombia, and Spain, but themost surprising thing is that he never played in a World Cup. His disputes with the BrazilianFootball Confederation, saw Argentina being withdrawn from the 1950 World Cup.
And when the 1954 World Cup arrived, Di St√©fano was prohibited from playing in the
tournament, and he had made appearances for Colombia two years earlier.
#11 George Best
A player who defined football represented Norther Ireland and made 32 appearances forthem. Having teammates with lesser ability or character, he was the only player who couldtake Northern Ireland to success.
However, Northern Ireland had lower expectations, including not having many star players.He was regarded as one of the best players who never played in the World Cup. Best had achance to play in the 1982 World Cup, but being 35 with drinking problems and waningfootball skills, he was not selected by the manager.
