The last thing that Emma D'Arcy expected to become was a meme.
The House of the Dragon actor is opening up about going viral over a TikTok where they explained their drink of choice to co-star Olivia Cooke.
In the popular clip, posted by HBO Max, Olivia asks Emma about their favorite drink of choice, in which Emma promptly answered "a Negroni Sbagliato, with Prosecco in it."
Now, in a new interview, Emma is opening up about the hype of the clip.
Speaking to The New York Times, Emma explained that they're actually embarrassed by it.
"I feel so embarrassed," they said. "Because in those interviews, when we've been at it for six hours, I'm honestly only trying to make Olivia laugh."
Emma then added that they "keep thinking I should tell my mum that I've become a meme in the hope that she'll be happy for me," however, "I'd have to explain what a meme is, and I've decided it's too much effort."
Later on, Emma and Olivia made an updated clip for her Instagram, where they were indeed drinking negroni sbagliatos.
"Stunnin," Olivia had captioned on top of it.
