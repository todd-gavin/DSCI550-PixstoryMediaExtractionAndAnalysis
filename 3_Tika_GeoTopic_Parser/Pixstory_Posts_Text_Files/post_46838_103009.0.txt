Managers in various disciplines (sports, business, life coaches) are talking about the importance of noticing personal strengths and weaknesses, this time its all about what to do after you figured them out.
Despite from having or searching specific trainings, every person who tries to improve should ask a question first: do i need to become talented or experienced?
If you dont keep the difference in mind, it can get difficult to develop any of them.
These two principes are not necessary disconnected, as experience is the base for being good at something. Its no wonder that a focus on training your strengths results in talent. But dont take talent for granted: situations change and an unknown or new challenge has still to be managed.
Thats the key point in becoming experienced, every error will result in a learning effect if you focus on it.

To summarize it, you will need to behave the following way
	• For Talent focus on your strengths, teams are providing benefit, search for an Idol
	• Experience comes trough focus on weakness, keep teams small to lower risk of simple mirroring, try things yourself
