The green screen is the only thing that makes your fantasy real on screen. A green screen is a large green backdrop placed in the background of a shot to allow for the digital effects later. 

Everyone who is a crazy fan of MARVEL would know there is no Asgard or Wakanda etc they are probably filmed in a warehouse and it's all magic of green screen but people go watch the movie and believe in superheroes and their powers they have to protect their imaginary world. That's because it's all their fantasy on the screen they enjoy and entertain themselves. 


What are your views on the green screen?
