One underrated joy of being a reader is having a favorite spot to read Reading is nice Always anywhere But there s also that one spot that s just ours We read the best there it lets our imagination run wild and make us picture what we are reading to the best of its accuracy What s that place for you Do you like some music to go Do you have a particular scent you like to surround yourself with For me it s sitting near a window in a cozy setting I like complete silence when I read it helps me get into the book better I don t have any particular fragrance that I need the smell of books is just fine for me But some days I do prefer scented candles in the room When outside I like to sit on the window seat of course One thing that I really really like is getting to rest my back against the wall or a cushion or something I like being comfortable when I read I also like reading in the dark No distractions whatsoever It helps me immerse into the book completely Let me run my mind and picture what would be the best
