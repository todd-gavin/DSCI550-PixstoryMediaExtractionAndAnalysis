According to what is being reported by Le10Sport, PSG know that they are at serious risk of losing Kylian Mbappé to Real Madrid and that is why their sporting director Leonardo is looking for a new striker, including Jonathan David of Lille or Amine Gouiri of Nice.

The report goes on to mention that Milan will carefully monitor the evolution of the situation of Gouiri as they too are on the lookout for a long-term option to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic and eventually Olivier Giroud.

Calciomercato.com recently reported that Milan are among the clubs that are monitoring the progress of Gouiri as he continues to have another impressive campaign in Ligue 1 with 10 goals to his name, while La Gazzetta dello Sport (via MilanNews) stated that Milan are keeping an eye on David too.
