The presence of a methane reservoir above a large active fault indicates that that fault is unlikely to generate strong earthquakes and vice versa. This is demonstrated by an article just published in the scientific journal Scientific Reports, the result of a collaboration between researchers from the National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics OGS and the INGV National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology By analyzing a robust set of geological and geophysical data, the researchers saw that the presence of methane in natural deposits constitutes a sort of insurance against such extreme events. The research promoted by OGS and INGV has concerned a large sector that extends from the western Po Valley to the northern Adriatic and Abruzzo, an area historically considered the most promising for methane extraction in Italy, explained Gianluca Valensise, research manager at INGV and coordinator of the study, specifying that it was made possible by the existence of three important geophysical databases an almost unique heritage worldwide available to the scientific community The first database called ViDEPI and created through a collaboration between the then Ministry for Economic Development UNMIG Assomineraria and the Italian Geological Society reports the essential data relating to various thousands of hydrocarbon exploration wells drilled in Italy since the last century still managed by INGV, it records the main earthquakes that have occurred in the same area of which we have news from historical sources. This exceptional set of data has been jointly analyzed through statistical techniques which have made it possible to make the starting hypothesis solid and methane above a large active fault indicates that that fault is unlikely to generate strong earthquakes and vice versa explains Stefano Parolai director of the OGS Seismological Research Center
