A Good Night Sleep ðŸ’¤ ,
Is the Easiest and the cheapest way to recover effectively. 

There is a big question mark on How much hours a person should need to sleep ? 

It is always adviced that sleeping 8 hours a day is enough,
This statement is partially correct as sleeping 8 hours a days is enough for people living a sedentary life. 

But as an Athlete, Sleeping Just for 8 hours is not enough, cause the amount of work we do is so much more than normal people. 

As being a footballer , i feel like that a footballer should always Sleep in range between 9-10 hours for better muscle recovery. 

The sleep is only the time when the body heals and do all metabolic changes. 

Synthesis (formation) of protein inside the body from amino acid chains occurs when the body is sleeping ,
Which means the minor tears in the muscles created by training Recovers while sleeping.

All the inflammations , cortisol(stress hormone) and swellings are reduced while sleeping , so if there maybe any injury then sleep will surely heal everything. 

its okay that you got to know about how sleep is important for recovery, 

But do you know how to sleep even more better ? 

â€¢ Try Sleeping Early 

Its a saying "Early to bed early to rise" follow this basic saying.

â€¢ Sleeping in a dark room 

Switching of the lights and making the room dark just to avoid any other distraction.

â€¢ Avoid using mobiles/other screens at night

The lights from the mobile phones keeps you awake for a long time which may affect your sleep cycle 

â€¢ Less Caffeine 

Caffeine in Coffee , tea or any pre-workout supplements should always be avoided 4-5 hours before sleeping as caffeine may not let the brain to sleep. 

A good quality sleep will make your whole day energetic and more fun, But a bad Sleep will ruin all of it. 

You will feel more energy , motivation and will to train even more harder after a good sleep. 
Whereas, a bad sleep will make you skip training sessions.
