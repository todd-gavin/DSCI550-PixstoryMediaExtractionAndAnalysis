Morningside Heights July BY WILLIAM MATTHEWS Haze Three student violists boarding a bus A clatter of jackhammers Granular light A film of sweat for primer and the heat for a coat of paint A man and a woman on a bench she tells him he must be psychic for how else could he sense even before she knew that she d need to call it off A bicyclist fumes by with a coach s whistle clamped hard between his teeth shrilling like a teakettle on the boil I never meant she says But I thought he replies Two cabs almost collide someone yells fuck in Farsi I m sorry she says The comforts of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon The sky blurs there s a storm coming up or down A lank cat slinks liquidly around a corner How familiar it feels to feel strange hollower than a bassoon A rill of chill air in the leaves A car alarm Hail Morningside Heights July by William Matthews explores a cityscape in July moving through image after image of the busy city There is a variety of human and natural life the weather is both the opening and closing images Morningside Heights July by William Matthews explores life within a city Matthews begins with the weather looking at the Haze of the location He moves through a group of student violinists the sound of jackhammers the quality of Granular light that he sees The final few images focus on blending city and nature the chill air and Hail sandwiching the city sound of A car alarm The poem provides a summer view of a city everything inside following each other in an eternal hum
