The club's spending power has been curtailed due to UK government sanctions, but the coach maintains their trip plans have not been disrupted.
Thomas Tuchel has stated that if required, he will personally drive his Chelsea players to Lille for their Champions League match.
On Wednesday, the Blues will travel to Lille for the second leg of their last-16 contest, which the London club leads 2-0 on aggregate.
However, the UK government's sanctions against Russian owner Roman Abramovich have reduced the amount of money the club may spend, including travel to away matches.
What's been said so far?
Tuchel believes that the club's travel preparations have not been disrupted, but says that if they are unable to fly, he will drive the team to France in a seven-seater.
Asked if there have been any changes, Tuchel said: "No, my last information is that we have a plane, that we can go by plane and come back by plane.
"If not we go by train, if not we go by bus â€“ if not, I drive a seven-seater! And I will do. Mark my words I will do; I will arrive there.
"If you'd asked me 20 or 30 years ago if I would join a Champions League match at the sideline and what I was willing to do I would have said okay, when do I have to be where.
"And why should this change. I will be there; we will be there.
"Of course, organisation-wise there are some negotiations going on and some talks, but it does not influence me.
"We have brilliant guys who organise the travel, and in every department, we have such committed people that for the moment things feel normal."
The coach was asked if he can drive on the left side of the road, to which he replied: "That is a very good question! And then we would have to change to the right [in France]. At some point, we need to have trust in the coach."
