Rashtriya Janata Dal RJD leader and former union minister Lalu Prasad had once described Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar as paltu ram turncoat of politics Prasad suggested that Kumar has been inconsistent in politics and known for his U turns Having been together during the JP movement Prasad and Kumar fell out in and were arch rivals till when they once again teamed up for the Bihar assembly elections However this friendship was shortlived as Kumar dumped Prasad within two years in to once again join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP He had quit the NDA in after the BJP named Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections Kumar is yet again restless with the BJP and on the verge of calling it quits Perhaps he is vary of the rise of the BJP in Bihar and apprehends that there might be a split in the Janata Dal United akin to the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra Kumar is of the view that the BJP is prompting his one time close confidante RCP Singh to go against him like it propped up Eknath Shinde to replace Uddhav Thackeray as the Maharashtra chief minister Unlike Thackeray Kumar acted fast and prevented an immediate takeover by Singh But the question is how long To counter the BJP Kumar has dialled Congress president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the possibility of a realignment The Congress won t have any problem as long as someone is ready to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi However it remains to be seen if the RJD would be willing to accept Kumar as the chief minister and agree to play a second fiddle given that the JD U is much weakened now as compared to No doubt the BJP has pushed him to the wall and the relations could have reached a point of no return but the bigger question is whether Kumar will do another volte face of his political career If Kumar does so he will prove Prasad right and if he doesn t the BJP leadership will force him to surrender and play the role of a junior partner
