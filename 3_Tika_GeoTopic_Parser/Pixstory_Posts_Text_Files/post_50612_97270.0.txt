Well! Well! Well!

It's totally controversial. Well in terms of making money, it will surely be a successful 😏....common...the movie is of Bhool  Bhulaiyaa franchise ...how can't it just 😁

Beside that ...there are some other factors as well to look upon

In Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, it would be a big challenge for Kartik Aaryan to step into the shoes of Akshay Kumar. Well according to me...no one can take place of Akki. He was just so good from his comic timing, his dialogue delivery, his energy; everything about him in the movie was just perfect😍. 

Well ...we don't have Akki unfortunately 🥺
But we have our old Rajpal Yadav character back 😎 for which I am very excited to watch. 

And we also have Tabu...the limelighter. I just can't exaggerate how excited I am to watch her...she is just so perfect 🤩
