BJP member Priti Gandhi tweeted the clip with the hashtag #ModiMagic but she quickly took it down.

The video was also broadcast by India TV in 2020
In a broadcast aired on October 28, 2020 India TV also claimed that slogans of ‘Modi-Modi’ were raised in the Pakistani parliament. India TV editor-in-chief Rajat Sharma said while anchoring the show, “Today I want to first show you some pictures of Pakistan’s parliament. And I want to narrate what happened in the Pakistani parliament. You will also be shocked. I was also shocked to hear that slogans of Narendra Modi were chanted there. At first, I thought how could this happen? Pakistan’s parliament and chants of Modi’s name, how can this happen? Who raised them and why? So I watched the video multiple times and confirmed with several people from Pakistan. And the truth came out that Narendra Modi was remembered in the parliament of Pakistan. Many slogans were chanted in his name… heard in Pakistan’s parliament, ‘The one who is a friend of Modi is a foe of Pakistan’.”

The following news tickers were flashed on the screen during the length of the show:

1. ‘Pakistan’s parliament fears Modi’s name’

2. ‘Amazing… ‘Modi-Modi’ echoed in Pakistan’s parliament’

3. ‘Pakistan is afraid of Modi, it chants ‘Modi Modi’

4. ‘Who teased Imran in the parliament in the name of Modi?’

Deepak Chaurasia, consulting editor of News Nation, tweeted a part of the India TV broadcast.
