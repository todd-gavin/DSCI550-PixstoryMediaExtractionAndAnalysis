Aurangzeb Naqshbandi New Delhi On July Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma met West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and chief minister Mamata Banerjee at the Raj Bhavan in Darjeeling Banerjee greeted both with shawls and the three sat for a discussion Dhankhar tweeted the pictures and the same were retweeted by Sarma Banerjee chose to remain silent Three days later Dhankhar was named as the Bharatiya Janata Party s vice presidential candidate Is it some kind of a coincidence Was the meeting a prelude to the announcement There is a lot of curiosity and speculation over what transpired in that meeting The frequent run ins between Dhankhar and Banerjee are not hidden from anyone The two have been at each other s throats ever since Dhankhar took over as the West Bengal governor in July Banerjee wanted him out of West Bengal at any cost He was undoubtedly a thorn in the flesh of Banerjee So why did the BJP leadership shift Dhankhar out of the state when he was literally functioning as the leader of the opposition The answer to this question will largely come on July when Banerjee will discuss the vice presidential elections with her party colleagues But for now Banerjee has been given a breather and how long this ceasefire will prevail could be anybody s guess By nominating Dhankhar the BJP has attempted a big reach out to Jats who along with Sikhs from Punjab were at the forefront of the year long agitation on Delhi borders by farmers who eventually forced the government to withdraw the three agricultural laws Dhankhar is a Jat from Rajasthan which goes to polls in November December next year Jats constitute around of the total population of Rajasthan This explains BJP chief JP Nadda s description of Dhankhar being a Kisaan Putra son of a farmer while announcing his name on Saturday Read the full story here
