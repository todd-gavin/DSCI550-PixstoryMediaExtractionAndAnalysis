The Gen Z today might not get it but in my opinion, nothing beats Tim McGraw when it comes to country music!One of the countryâ€™s most adaptable performers, McGraw's discography includes emotional ballads like "Don't Take The Girl" and the stirring "Live Like You Were Dying," as well as '90s dance hits like "Indian Outlaw." As Billboard says, he collaborates with musicians like hip-hop icon Nelly because he isn't afraid to push his boundaries. Moreover, in addition to his success as a singer, McGraw has also established himself as a successful actor in Hollywood, giving admirable turns in films like The Blind Side, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Friday Night Lights, which won the same award.So, what is your favourite McGraw song?
