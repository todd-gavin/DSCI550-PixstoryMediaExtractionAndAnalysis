Abstract 

Background and aim 

The field of diabetes reversal is continuously evolving. Strategies for implementing diabetes care towards diabetes reversal are still being worked out. We aim to analyse data from available literature to ascertain factors allowing patient centric dietary approach to achieve diabetes reversal in clinical practice. 

Methods 

In this exploratory review, an update on current knowledge is presented to delineate factors driving diabetes remission in an individual based on major studies in the field. This knowledge is then applied to subtypes of type 2 diabetes to optimise dietary approach for reversal of diabetes. 

Results and conclusion 

Shorter duration of diabetes, lesser number of medicines needed to achieve euglycemia and 15 kg weight loss are common factors favouring diabetes remission in all major studies. A patient centric approach to diabetes reversal taking into account the recently described diabetes subtypes is being proposed to improve the proportion of patients achieving remission. We also propose the parameters of a novel diabetes remission prediction score, based on patient motivation, interaction with the care-team, level of diabetes self-care and the intent of the care-team.
