As a nation we have long accepted this very cruel practice of using children as very cheap and often free labour We have turned a blind eye to children being denied their right to be in school and an opportunity to better their lives This problem is across both urban and rural areas and we have been by and large living with this black truth Children are working in hazardous export oriented industries like fireworks match works electroplating beedi rolling glass blowing brassware lock making glass blowing lead mining and stone quarrying amongst several others These are places that have a severe negative impact on the health of anyone working there In the case of children by the time they begin touching their teens they are already inflicted with several life threatening diseases
