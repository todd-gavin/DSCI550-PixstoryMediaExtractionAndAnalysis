Cinema has the ability to influence and affect the viewers vastly so whatever they re depicting is of utmost importance For the past decade changes have been perpetual and cinema has been relentlessly experimenting in all its phases From strictly following the stereotypes to trying to eradicate them the creators of movies have taken a subtle turn in representing their work Although to a certain extent it could be said that we are now given options that would not objectify or decry women onscreen many women centric movies are being made with different trials and experiments even the taboos are portrayed in rather a pragmatic way But there are a lot of instances that shed light on the topics mentioned above but what always is left behind is the way cinema is making men look onscreen Yes of course they re showcased as superheroes always powerful portraying the manliness every man should possess But isn t cinema so blinded by these thoughts of masculinity that it forgets to show what is relevant or correct Something that would not pressure a man or to say even a boy watching a particular movie or any piece of entertainment to adhere to such standards to become an ideal man Toxic masculinity never ceases to find its place in cinema somewhere or the else the writer who is giving the story or the one who is deciding how it would look to the viewers all have these set notions of depicting masculinity The idea of men needing to act stern and not show their emotions that s what it takes to become a hero of a movie There is a massive list of male protagonists who went all their way to show their manliness Like Nobody released in March showed how a man is a loser unless he becomes a rampaging warrior to prove his manliness This is the point where i think cinema still lags behind
