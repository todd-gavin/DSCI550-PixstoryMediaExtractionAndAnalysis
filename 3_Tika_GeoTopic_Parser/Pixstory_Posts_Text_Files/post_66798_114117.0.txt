Time Machine Simulations
Scientists create “time machine” simulations studying the lifecycle of ancestor galaxy cities.

Many processes in astrophysics take a very long time, making their evolution tricky to study. For example, a star like our sun has a lifespan of about 10 billion years and galaxies evolve over the course of billions of years.

One way astrophysicists deal with this is by looking at various different objects to compare them at different stages of evolution. They can also look at distant objects to effectively peer back in time, because of the length of time the light took to travel to reach our telescopes. For example, if we are looking at an object 10 billion light years away, we are seeing it as it was 10 billion years ago.

Researchers have created simulations that directly recreate the full life cycle of some of the largest collections of galaxies observed in the distant universe 11 billion years ago, reports a new study published on June 2, 2022, in the journal Nature Astronomy.
