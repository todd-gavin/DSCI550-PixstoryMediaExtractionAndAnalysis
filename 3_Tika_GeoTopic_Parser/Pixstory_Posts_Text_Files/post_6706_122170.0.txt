A photo of a woman in a catholic nun outfit offering prayers to a photograph of the Hindu deity Ganesha is viral on social media. It appears to be a religious gathering with the presence of a few children in school uniforms on the left side and some men in relaxed formals on the right. On the top of the image, a text written in Tamil can be seen which reads, “To not have any obstacles while building the church, they are doing a Ganapati pooja.“

[Original text in Tamil: “சர்ச் கட்ட தடங்கல் வராமல் ‘ இருக்க கணபதி பூஜயாம்..”]

The same photograph has multiple shares on Twitter.

It is widely viral on Facebook with the very same claim.

Alt News has received multiple requests on our WhatsApp helpline (76000 11160) to verify the authenticity of this claim.

Fact-check:
On performing a reverse image search on Google, we found out that the photos were picked from a report by a website named Omlanka. Neither the webpage nor the website is accessible.

However, an archive of the website is available on the Wayback Machine which helps us to see what the websites looked like at various points of time in the past. We retrieved the article from Omlanka through this service and took a screenshot of the article dated January 20, 2016. It states that the event was chaired by Zonal Director of Education Sahadul Najeem and Srila Siri Nirmaleswara Kurukal conducted the poojas. We also found the same viral image along with several others from what appeared to be snapshots of this event.

The article stated that this was a custom native to the Sammanthurai district in Sri Lanka during the celebration of the Thai Pongal festival. In this particular region, the Buddhist, Christian and Muslim religious leaders come together to celebrate the auspicious festival.
