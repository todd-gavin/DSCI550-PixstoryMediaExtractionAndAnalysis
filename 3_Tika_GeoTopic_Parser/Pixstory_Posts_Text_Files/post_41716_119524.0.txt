Aussie world champion Kelsey-Lee Barber has tested positive for Covid-19 and her Commonwealth Games campaign now hangs by a thread.

It was reported that the 30-year-old javelin champion tested positive following a routine test, the Australian team has confirmed.

As per news au, she is now set to become a high-profile guinea pig for the Commonwealth Gamesâ€™ controversial Covid-19 restrictions.

Athletics Australia had advised Barber is asymptomatic and is still expected to compete.

Barber would have been ruled out instantly if the Commonwealth Games were operating with the same Covid rules as the Tokyo Olympics last year.

The Commonwealth Games Authority confirmed this week that each individual nation will be responsible for policing its own athletes surrounding Covid-19 infections.

It essentially means the Aussie team and its chief medical officials face the difficult decision of banning Barber from competing if her test results show she has a high likelihood of infecting others through her participation.

Barber is the first of the 433 Australian athletes to test positive in Birmingham.
