Graham Arnold; the manager of the Australian side has been fined a massive penalty by Football Australia as he breached the NSW self-isolation protocols, just days before Australia’s crucial match against Japan in World Cup Qualifiers. 

Arnold tested positive for the second time last Thursday in the past 8 weeks, acknowledging that he breached the Covid isolation rules while he was taking a short stroll Narrabeen Beach this Sunday.

The 58-year-old has been fined a total of $25,000 which will be donated to the Red Cross Flood Relief Fund by Football Australia. 

“I sincerely apologize for my error of judgement on Sunday,” Arnold stated in a statement. 

“I accept that I should have left my home as per NSW self-isolation protocols and will remain at my property until my self-isolation window concludes."

Arnold’s breach has caused another distraction for the Socceroos' preparations heading into Thursday’s must-win encounter against Samurai Blue at Stadium Australia. 

To retain the hope of qualifying for the World Cup to be held in Qatar, they must defeat Japan, something they have not achieved since 2009. Despite the breach, Arnold can guide his lads from the touchline provided that the results come negative and his self-isolation period is over. 

Football Australia stated Arnold had already returned negative results to subsequent PCR tests after his initial positive results.
