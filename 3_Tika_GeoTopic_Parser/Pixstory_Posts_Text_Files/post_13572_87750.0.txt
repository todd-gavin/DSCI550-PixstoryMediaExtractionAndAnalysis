The Taliban in Herat have taken to the streets to protest against the freezing of Afghan assets in US and European banks.

Scriptures given to children include phrases such as "Our money is on loan to America" ​​and "Americans stop oppression."

Since the fall of the Western-backed government in Afghanistan, nearly $ 10 billion in US central bank assets have been frozen in USA and European banks.

No country has yet recognized the Taliban government, and the United States and European countries have refused to hand over the frozen assets to the group's government.

US President Joe Biden recently signed a decree paving the way for the use of frozen Afghan assets to compensate for the 11 Sept attacks.

The move was met with widespread reactions inside and outside Afghanistan.
