Following the passing of William and Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle unexpectedly joined Prince William and Kate Middleton for a walkaround at Windsor Castle on Saturday. 

Will these difficult times erase the family feud? 

People reported that the foursome, who were all dressed in black, were seen smiling and visibly moved by the flowers and other memorial items left for the late monarch, who passed away on Thursday at the age of 96. 

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were asked to join William, 40, and Kate, 40, who recently received the title of Princess of Wales in addition to her husband's new title of Prince of Wales, according to Kensington Palace. 

Another source says that neither couple was anticipated by security to be at the walkabout. 

Prince William thought the walkabout to greet the crowds "was an important show of unity at an incredibly difficult time for the family," a royal source tells PEOPLE. 

A palace insider tells PEOPLE: "It's such an extraordinary historical moment and also a deeply personal one for the family that you'd hope and think that all members of the family would unite and support [the King] especially. And perhaps some of those wounds can be healed in the process."
