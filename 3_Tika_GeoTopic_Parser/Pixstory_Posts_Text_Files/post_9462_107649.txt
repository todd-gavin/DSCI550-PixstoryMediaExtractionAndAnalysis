Commons in India call them Black Cats and their common profile is escorting VIPs The men in total black dress and black gazes have more serious jobs to do for the country State of Siege web series on ZEE focuses on that landscape of NSGs My first watch in the series was State of Siege It was painful and exhausting to recollect the terrors happened in Mumbai Shuddered feel I stuck was what if I was there then It could be you or somebody else Script mostly anchored on Black Tornado The Three Sieges of Mumbai by Sandeep Unnithan More potent compared to my second watch State of Siege Temple Attack based on Akshardham Temple attack in Gandhinagar Gujarat When a plot focuses on an unforeseen terrorist attack in a temple complex and the hostages I think there isn t much a script can do even if it is well written Only actions can speak volumes here Ken Ghosh director is led by this very thought making less characters to remember Focus is fully on the NSG operation extended from night to dawn which I felt very real Heroic acts were nil There are flaws in dealing with the panic crowd inside and predictable scenes from the personal premises of the commandos Camera was handy in absorbing the stealthy NSG moves and their crucial eye language Location supported the thread with some emotional moments Akshaye Khanna is an actor who I think couldn t earn many stars in his lad roles Wasn t he chocolate enough for Bollywood or too dull for the screen If I am not wrong he had enough career breaks Sid in Dil Chahta Hai is one role comes to my mind Felt a difference from then Happy to note the guy has turned into a bankable actor and could shoulder State of Siege Temple Attack Major Hanut Singh on ground was very convincing Restrained and truly patriotic Terrorists also performed to a desired level Other characters just fill the space in this ZEE movie
