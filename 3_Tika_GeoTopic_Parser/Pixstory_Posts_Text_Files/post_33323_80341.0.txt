Veganism is surely the need of the hour. With more and more animal loving and environmentally conscious people making a move towards Veganism, it is important to understand how the culture is gaining traction and effectiveness in India. 

Plant based diet can be adopted through minimal efforts such as switching almond/soy milk instead of milk produced by cow/any other dairy animal, opting for vegan meat instead of regular meat, opting for more of salads and leafy vegetables than dairy products like curd, eggs etc for breakfast, switching to tofu instead of paneer Or cheese. 

Such shifts in the lifestyle call for a strong will power and determination towards the cause or simply willingness to make environmental friendly choices. What one needs to keep in mind that the reason why vegan food options are slightly more expensive than non vegan ones simply due to a basic demand-supply jargon. 

Vegan food supply is weaker in comparison to the number of people demanding such options. Morever, since most food options are not indegenous, the shipping costs are higher. However, as more and more people shift to vegan food items, their availability is likely to increase in order to match the demand. Thus, prices would eventually drop down making vegan food options every household friendly and also staples.
