Hey,
Do you know the relationship between a employee & company? Let me know in notes.

It’s the Exchange of Values with each other.

A company will only hire a personnel who will be contributing towards the growth of the company and his job will be the value he is giving to the company. 

Similarly, in return the company provides value to  its employees in various forms, one of them is Money/ Salary. 

That’s why it is always a transaction of values between employees and company.

You will not be hired if your skill doesn’t put any value to the company.

So please Enhance your skill before applying for a job.
Them master your skill to be competent in the market. 

It’s not like You’ll get your job first then company will train you what to do then you’ll do the job.
You’ve to be skilled for the job you’re applying.

And one thing Learning a Skill & implementing that skill is very different.

That’s all!
Keep yourself skilled in what you love to do.

Thanks
Stay Khush!
