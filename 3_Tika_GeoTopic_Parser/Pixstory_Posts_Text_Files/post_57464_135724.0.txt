Staying in an unhappy marriage would not be easy but staying in a mature relationship while keeping your personal marriage satisfaction aside is doable.
In doing so, parents think of a child which is thoughtful instead.
Keeping their issues aside for some time and just uniting for children's sake isn't such a bad idea.
It could not be as possible as it might look but exploring this idea and accepting it will make a situation less traumatising.
Co-parenting positively and keeping their personal differences at bay for the kids' sake will make the kid's future easier.
Moreover, before divorcing and enduring the "stress that divorce creates, couples need to make a good faith effort to restore the marriage bond. Whether the spouses are willing and able to make that effort to rebuild their marriage for the sake of the children is an important question."
