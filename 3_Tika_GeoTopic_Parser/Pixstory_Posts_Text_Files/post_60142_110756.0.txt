Yes, I still think these rituals are important, and each one has its own significance. Speaking of Hindu culture, all of these traditions are performed during a single wedding because I am a Hindu and so better understand it.

It is traditional to put a wedding ring on this finger because it is thought to have a vein that leads directly to the heart. In Indian traditions, the engagement ceremony is a significant pre-wedding custom during which the families of the bride and groom pledge their acceptance of one another's daughter.

Hindu weddings undoubtedly include a lengthy variety of traditions and ceremonies. But pause before rejecting these as either formalities or superstitions. 
Numerous of them are supported by science, and some of them are even beneficial to health. Here are some common wedding traditions along with their reasoning.

For instance, mehendi is applied to the hands and feet since they have a lot of body endings and it helps to keep the nerves from being tense in stressful conditions.
Haldi helps in preventing the growth of germs. Additionally, the mixture is made with oil, which helps to moisturise the skin prior to the big event.

Mangalsutra should ideally have two spherical cups in the centre, with no design on the front It's interesting that the energy of knowledge is linked to this structure.

The smoke emerging to help from the fire or havan purify the atmosphere and spread positivity. 

Blood circulation is increased by friction between the skin and bangles. Additionally, wearing bangles encourages the bride to press a number of acupressure spots, which helps her lead a healthy life.

Science says that the bindi area is where the body's main nerves converge, and massaging this region can benefit people with headache relief.
