Fruits have long been known for their health benefits, and now there is evidence that they can also benefit the skin. A study published in the journal Food Research International found that feeding fruit to rats improved the skins' barrier function and decreased inflammation. The authors believe that this suggests that fruits may be a good strategy for skin health care.
In addition, research shows that particular fruits are beneficial for specific types of skin problems. Blueberries help improve acne scars, apples minimize signs of aging such as wrinkles and age spots, bananas reduce dark circles under eyes, grapes protect against sun damage, and strawberries lessen the appearance of blemishes.
