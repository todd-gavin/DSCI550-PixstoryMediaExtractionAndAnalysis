After Arsene Wenger left the club in 2018, Arsenal have one FA Cup in 2020. It is safe to say that the transition from the Wenger area has been a bumpy ride for Arsenal and their fans. The Frenchman was criticised that he was not making the club title contenders towards the end of his reign but it seems that finishing in the top four consistently was taken for granted by Arsenal supporters as they have not finished in the top four since Wenger left.
Mikel Arteta is the current manager of Arsenal and the side lifted the FA Cup under the Spaniard. Arteta is now in his third full season at the club and after a good transfer window, Arsenal fans expect for the side to finish in the top four. Under Arteta, Arsenal have finished 8th, 8th again, and 5th. For a club as big as Arsenal this cannot continue as they are expected to finish in the top four. Arsenal have enjoyed a good start to the season with winning 5 of the first 6 games and they currently sit top of the league. Arteta has been given time from the board despite facing rough spells at the club where many of the fans called for his sacking.
One thing which is clear is that the players are now fully accustomed to the manager’s system and know exactly what he expects of them. There is a clear style of play and Arsenal have played really good football this season so far. However in order to be successful, it is not just about  playing good football. We saw this in Arsenal’s defeat to Manchester United on the weekend where Arsenal dominated possession played the prettier football however they left Old Trafford with nothing. Arteta’s tactic towards the end of the game were criticised and declared to be naïve by many. This is something the Spaniard must improve on.
