Opportunities
Multiple teams are struggling at the moment in the Premier League which has kept Fulham in the top half of the table. Fulham have an opportunity to finish in the top ten if they keep their form intact. Also, with Fulham being out of the Carabao Cup, they can focus on their Premier League and FA Cup aspirations in 2022/23. 
Threats
Fulham have often struggled to open their account in the league in the past. But they have done most of the things right in the 2022/23 season. Though this is a great sign, there is a chance of them getting complacent over the season. The new signings have not yielded the best results for their former clubs barring two players. It remains interesting to see how Fulham can cope if the new signings do not live up to the bill in 2022/23. 
Full Squad for 2022/23 season: 
Goalkeepers: Bernd Leno, Marek Rodák, George Wickens
