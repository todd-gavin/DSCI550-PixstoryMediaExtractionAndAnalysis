James has been averaging points per game over the last nine games an unbelievable feat for a player in his late s during one of the most competitive NBA seasons in recent history Frank Vogel said he s lost for words to describe the forward s recent performance I m all out I don t have anymore There s no words Vogel said after James points on from from the field in the win over the Cleveland Cavaliers Just look what he did He had points on no threes four free throws Ridiculous shooting percentage Making fadeaways Finding his way as a receiver and also the basket attacks rolls to the basket and the fadeaways were the game for him tonight He was in control An all time dunk on his old teammate which was great for the fans Great for the game and great for those two old friends
