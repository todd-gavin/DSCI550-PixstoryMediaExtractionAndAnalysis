Andrew Garfield literally told no one about his return as Spider-man in the movie Spider-man: No Way Home. He had literally made the decision to keep it a secret until the movie came out. 
He didn't even tell his ex-girlfriend, talented actress Emma Stone who played Gwen in The Amazing Spider-Man. 
Andrew Garfield in a podcast said, 
“Emma kept on texting me, and she was like, ‘Are you in this new Spider-Man film?’ And, I was like, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ She was like, ‘Shut up, just tell me.’ I’m like, ‘I honestly don’t know.’ I kept it going, even with her. It was hilarious...Then, she saw it, and she was like, ‘You’re a jerk.'”
