Odifreddi and Benedict XVI recognize the common goal of the tension to understand the search for the Truth. A goal that stimulates their conversations, making them intimate, arouses in both autobiographical memories and gives rise to an undoubted complicity PIERGIORGIO ODIFREDDI studied mathematics in Italy in the United States and in the Soviet Union and taught logic at the University of Turin and at the Cornell University of Ithaca in the State of New York In he won the Galileo Prize for scientific publication
