Here is part 6 of amazing life story of renowned criminal lawyer Ramesh Gupta….

In my childhood neighborhood of Moti Bagh, all the families had around 4 to 5 children. Even though so many families lived together, I never had the feeling of inferiority as we all had the same things. 

Nobody was extraordinarily rich or well-off. Two families had a radio and all the others used to assemble at their place during any matches or important forecasts. The houses were small with two rooms, one verandah and a kitchen. All the children were admitted into primary school. The fee was only five annas.

When I grew up, my brother was completing his higher studies. He was intelligent and he did an honours degree in physics and then cleared the CA exam. I was an average student but I was involved in a lot of extra-curricular activities. All my batchmates played volleyball. I tagged along with them but never played because I was skinny. But one day, I brought a volleyball with me to my house.

When I brought the volleyball, all the children in my neighbourhood studying in class 8th, started learning to play volleyball from me. I used to learn from my friends in college and then come back and teach those children. 

Slowly and steadily, all the children gained a grip over the sport and for the next ten years, the girls' and boys’ teams of Moti Bagh school became state champions for the sport. There were three children, Lala, Pathan, and Raj, who also benefited from the sports quota in government jobs. 

Lala alias Narinder Sharma played for nationals even in his late thirties. In 1969, when I was working as a clerk, I was elected as the secretary of the Government Employee Welfare Association. I served the post for two years and then became the president. During my tenure, I funded and encouraged sports in my area. I made one youth organization while working as a government servant.
