Djo, the solo music moniker of Stranger Things star Joe Keery, has released ‘Gloom’, a new single lifted from his upcoming sophomore album.
Decide’ is set for release on September 16, and was produced by Adam Thein, whom Keery collaborated with on Djo’s debut 2019 album, ‘Twenty Twenty’. Earlier this week, Keery shared a promotional video for ‘Gloom’ to Djo’s Instagram, inviting fans to call a hotline where they’d be played a snippet of the new song as hold music.

Prior to his solo Djo project, Keery was part of the Chicago rock band Post Animal, but parted ways with the psychedelic group in 2019 due to acting commitments. Keery released the standalone single ‘Keep Your Head Up’ in late 2020, and this year reprised his role as Steve Harrington in the latest season of the Netflix series Stranger Things. 
Speaking of adopting the Djo moniker during an interview on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last week, Keery described the wig-wearing character as an “alter ego sort of musician”.
