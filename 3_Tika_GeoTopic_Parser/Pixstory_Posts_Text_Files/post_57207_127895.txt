I think unsafe and unhealthy working conditions exist in many labour works No doubt sex workers endure more sometimes but that doesn t make their profession wrong I agree that any form of violence against anyone particularly women is simply unacceptable but that must be eradicated everywhere For doing so we can t just focus on ending the profession itself but can help women speak for their rights And most importantly there should be laws to make their work legitimate so that they are not denied basic human and living rights Secondly sex trafficking or illegally trying to force anyone to work and exploit them greatly is wrong these points need attention when discussing this industry Also some women have been part of the industry and are earning their living through this work the least they expect is not to be treated as criminals victims or vectors of disease Instead they want to be seen as workers no matter what they work for The only way to completely annihilate the presence of violence against women in this field is by giving them rights and creating awareness that could make them feel free to be vocal and decide what they want irrespective of the moral standards foisted on them in society
