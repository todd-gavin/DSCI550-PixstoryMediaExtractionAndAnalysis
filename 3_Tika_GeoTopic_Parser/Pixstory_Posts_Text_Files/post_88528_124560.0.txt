Young aspiring footballers often ask me - what is the secret to success? How does one get there? 

All I wish to tell them is, focus on what you want, and don’t let other’s opinions deflect your passion. It is quite easy to follow that condescending voice in your head telling you that you can't do it. However, you need to be strong, look at your long term goal and consistently work hard! Many people want to be successful overnight but the greed of early success only leads to disappointment since it's often short-lived.

When I was growing up, I did not have the luck of Football being very popular. With the entrance of the Indian Super League, it has gained prominence and thus, its potential should be exploited. Football is my passion. It has given me a lot to hold on to in my life and I wish to play as long as I am able, to make my country proud!
