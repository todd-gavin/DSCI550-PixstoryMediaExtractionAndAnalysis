Akshay Kumar and Kriti Sanon are quite busy these days and rightfully so. After all, their much-talked-about movie Bachchhan Paandey is set to hit the theatres on March 18 this year.
Akshay looked dapper in a light blue coloured shirt that was paired with denim and had sported black sunglasses. He completed his look with stylish glasses and a pair of black sneakers. On the other hand, Kriti Sanon looked beautiful in her pink coloured saree with floral print with a black border and stylish blouse. She had completed her look with a back bun and had red flowers overall. Kriti had her makeup game on point and completed her look with jhumkas and silver sandals.
