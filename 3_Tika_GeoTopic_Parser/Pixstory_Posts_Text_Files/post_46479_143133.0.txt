Salads are supposed to be light , bright , and full of life ! 🥙
Many pick a salad in place of a real meal in order to eat healthy . A delicious , hearty salad is proof that healthy eating doesn't have to be a joyless experience ! The good news is that you can make homemade salads very easily .😍🥙
Some people end up making a total disaster of their meal starting with the wrong dressing ! 
Avoid these salad mistakes ❌
1 Dressing the leaves ; 
I never put a large clump of dressing on my salad before tossing it ! Dress the bowl , not the leaves . Circle the perimeter and toss from the outside in , coating the leaves more evenly .
2 Experimenting with too many ingredients at once ; 
Fun part of making salad is that there are so many options . But if you experiment with too many new ingredients , you will end up messing ! Add one new ingredient to a salad to find out whether you like it or not . Continue adding new ingredients , so you can determine exactly which one is the culprit if your salad isn't tasty .
3 Chopping greens with a knife ; 
If you chop your greens with a knife , you risk bruising them ! Pull them apart instead of chopping with a knife . Using this strategy means you won't bruise the greens and they'll hold up longer .
4 Adding croutons too early ; 
When you add croutons too early , water from veggies will be absorbed by the bread and turn the crunchy croutons soft . Keep the croutons in a separate container and add them at the last minute !
5 Not seasoning your salad ; 
It's common to think that , because there's dressing , there's no need for anything else .  Put salt , pepper , and herbs in your salad . Doing so adds brightness to the flavors and will give the salad the restaurant-quality taste you're craving !
Avoid these mistakes and make your salad healthy !✅🥙
