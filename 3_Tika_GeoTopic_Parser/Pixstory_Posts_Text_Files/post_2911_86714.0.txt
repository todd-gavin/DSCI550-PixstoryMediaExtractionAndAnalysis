The LGBTQIA+ employees of the animation studio Pixar have accused Disney of censoring gay content in many of its movies. According to Pixar employees, Disney executives have demanded cuts from “nearly every moment of overtly gay affection… regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar.” ( https://variety.com/2022/film/news/disney-pixar-same-sex-affection-censorship-dont-say-gay-bill-1235200582/ ) 

A letter signed by “the LGBTQIA+ employees of Pixar & their allies” accuses that the Disney executives “barred” moments of gay affection in films. Pixar has been behind movies like Toy Story and The Incredibles. Pixar is a subsidiary of Disney. The group says that “beautiful stories, full of diverse characters” came back from Disney corporate reviews “shaved down to crumbs of what they once were.” ( https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/11/disney-pixar-employees-gay-content ) 

The accusation comes days after Disney issued an internal statement in support of the LGBTQ+ community after it was revealed that the company made campaign donations to Florida Republicans supporting the “Don’t Say Gay” legislation. Called the House Bill 1557, “Don’t Say Gay”, as it’s referred to by many, has been condemned by democrats, parents and even the White House as being hateful towards the gay community.

Disney had claimed in its statement that the biggest impact it was having was by “creating a more inclusive world” through the “inspiring content” it produced and the “welcoming culture” it had created for a diverse community of people “including those representing the LGBTQ+ community.” ( https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/disney-dont-say-gay-donations-b2028984.html ) 

The Pixar letter specifically mentions the censor of content in the“beautiful stories, full of diverse characters” as a direct counter to Disney’s statement and supporting Florida Republicans.

The internal statement by Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief executive, didn’t do much as he was accused of not addressing the issue directly. But he later said that Disney was opposed to the bill. Although the campaign donations are relatively low, it was enough to enrage many people in Hollywood, forcing Disney to respond. Disney is yet to respond to the latest letter by Pixar employees.
