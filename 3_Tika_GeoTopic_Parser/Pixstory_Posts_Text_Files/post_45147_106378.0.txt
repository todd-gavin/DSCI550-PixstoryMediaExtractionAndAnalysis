When Poland visits Rotterdam on Saturday evening, the Netherlands will be looking to make it three wins in a row in the UEFA Nations League.


In midweek, Louis van Gaal's team came from behind to win 2-1 against Wales, while the visitors were thrashed 6-1 by Belgium.




Netherlands vs Poland: Probable Playing XI


Netherlands : Jasper Cillessen; Denzel Dumfries, Stefan De Vrij, Nathan Ake, Daley Blind; Frenkie De Jong, Teun Koopmeiners, Davy Klaassen; Steven Berghuis, Memphis Depay, Steven Bergwijn


Poland : Wojciech Szczęsny; Bartosz Bereszyński, Kamil Glik, Jan Bednarek; Matty Cash, Karol Linetty, Szymon Zurkowski, Przemysław Frankowski; Piotr Zieliński; Adam Buksa, Robert Lewandowski



Netherlands vs Poland: Prediction


While a change in shape and personnel should at least see Poland's defense tighten up a tad, the visitors' defensive record away from home makes for bleak reading, and a well-rested crop of Netherlands stars should have a glint in their eyes here.


Poland always possess a goal threat going forwards, but Van Gaal has overseen a stellar period of rejuvenation at the Oranje helm and will expect to see his side move onto nine points with relative ease.


Prediction : Netherlands 3-1 Poland
