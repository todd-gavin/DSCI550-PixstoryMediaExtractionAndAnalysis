I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.I chant the chant of dilation or pride,We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,I show that size is only development.Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.Press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night!Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.Walt Whitman
