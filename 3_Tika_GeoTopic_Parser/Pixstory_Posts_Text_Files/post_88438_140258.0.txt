I feel that Marquinhos will have a big impact on our season at just 19 he looks very promising and maybe on tonightâ€™s  showing is why we didnâ€™t over pay for a â€œmystery winger â€œ Iâ€™m certain he will show his quality in the Europa league and then soon be able to deputy Bukayo Saka in the league often with no problem . Pace ,skill , awareness and physicality .he has a lot of  special qualities so young ðŸ”¥ ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
