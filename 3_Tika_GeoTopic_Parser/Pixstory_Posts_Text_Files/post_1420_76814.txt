 PPM No not parts per million plates per minute That s what Swiggy says about the most ordered food of the humble biryani This is very understandable because I ve always thought of biryani as one of the most versatile foods ever Every single region in India has different biryani specialties from Hyderabadi mutton biryani to buff biryani to fish even veg biryani which die hard meat eaters scoff at Biryani is endlessly customizable you can add aloo to your plate or even mushroom don t laugh the best biryani I ever ate was mushroom biryani Ultimately what is a biryani but a plate of rice and meat veg It s the rare food that is both celebration and comfort You can order a plate of piping hot chicken biryani on the day you get a promotion or the day you just need some TLC It never disappoints Perhaps it is the pizza of the global South Relatedly I wish Zomato would do a profile on the lady who ordered orders of ice cream in a single day
