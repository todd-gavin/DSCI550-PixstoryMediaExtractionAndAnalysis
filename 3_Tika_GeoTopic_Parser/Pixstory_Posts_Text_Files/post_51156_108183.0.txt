Asian Cucumber Salad - healthy cucumber salad with Asian spices. So refreshing and easy. A perfect appetizer for any meals. it’s so light, fresh and healthy. However, cucumber by itself doesn’t have much of a flavor.

The key to making a great Asian cucumber salad lies in the dressing. My recipe is garlicky, spicy, savory, with just a touch of sweetness and tartness. The cucumber is crunchy so every bite is bursting with flavors. Chill the cucumber in the refrigerator for the best results.
