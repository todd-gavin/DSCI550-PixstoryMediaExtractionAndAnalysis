When the pandemic had hit us, many of us were initially relaxed and eventually it led to developing new unhealthy habits and the old ones were resurfacing. 

As per the surveys conducted in 2021 from Value Penguin, almost 61 per cent of Americans looks forward to break down these unhealthy habits that they have formed during the pandemic period. 

Vanessa Kennedy, PhD, director of psychology at Driftwood Recovery, told Healthline that, “We tend to seek comfort through unhealthy habits that quickly activate our brain’s reward centers and temporarily reduce or distract us from stress. Dopamine gets released when we do these pleasurable, albeit unhealthy activities, making us crave the feeling when it’s gone." 

With intense stress, boredom and uncertainty of the pandemics lockdown and social distancing restrictions this have led people into negative coping methods like consuming more alcohol, being less active and eating junk, she said. 

However, we are people who could break down any habits if we wish to give it a try. So if we are able to reflect on our behavior and make changes, we will be able to bring it into practice. 

“We can adapt to our environment and make the conscious choice to change bad habits and resist cravings by replacing them with healthier alternatives,” she said. “We adapted to an unprecedented event and did what we had to do to make it through. Now that restrictions are easing, we can get back to focusing on our health in ways beyond preventing COVID-19.” says Kennedy.
