Pangong Tso is one of the most famous lakes in Ladakh. 150 kilometres long, extending into both India and China, and rich in natural beauty, this lake must be seen to be believed. Set against a backdrop of intense blue skies, golden plains and snow-capped peaks, Pangong Tso seems purely magical. The lake has several unique characteristics which separate it from other lakes in Ladakh. For one, Pangong Tso Lake never freezes. 

Though it is perched upon a high altitude of 4,350 metres, the lake remains in a liquid state even in the depths of winter. This is because of the saline content of the lake- a unique outlaw in a region rich in glaciers. But natureâ€™s magic does not stop here. There are various camps around Pangong lake which attract a lot of tourists.

 Pangong Tso is also famous for the ever-changing colours of its water which makes it a picturesque delight. There are many camping facilities around the Pangong Tso, so make sure you spend some time admiring it in all its moods when you are in Ladakh.
