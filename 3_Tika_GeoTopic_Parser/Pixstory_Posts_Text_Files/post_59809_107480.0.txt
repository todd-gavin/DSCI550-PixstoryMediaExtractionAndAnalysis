Soon after being transported to the district, a judge in Punjab's Mansa district awarded mobster Lawrence Bishnoi a seven-day police remand to the state police in the singer-politician Sidhu Moose Wala murder case. He is the mastermind behind the assassination.

On Wednesday morning at around 4 a.m., he was carried to the Mansa district, where Moose Wala was shot and killed on May 29. After undergoing a medical examination at the district civil hospital, Bishnoi was brought before the duty magistrate. The Punjab Police are transporting Bishnoi to Mohali, where he will be probed, after gaining his police remand.
