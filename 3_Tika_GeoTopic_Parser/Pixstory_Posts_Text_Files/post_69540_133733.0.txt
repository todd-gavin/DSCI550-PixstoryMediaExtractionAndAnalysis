Gurez is a Himalayan village located at a height of about 2400 metres. The valley, which is located 123 kilometres (km) from Shrinagar and 86 kilometres (km) from Bandipore, is encircled by snow-covered mountains and emanates a brilliant view due to the Kishanganga River's presence in the valley. This valley, one of Kashmir's most amazing tourist destinations, is home to a small population of exotic animals including snow leopards and brown bears. From November through May, Gurez is completely blocked off from the outside world due to excessive snowfall. Gurez Helicopter services are offered to tourists by Kashmir's tourism agency in an effort to boost tourism. 
Due to its close proximity to the border, trekking might be risky. However, the picturesque settings, the lush greenery of the woodlands, fishing in the Kishen Ganga River, and the fields of potatoes and maize each have their own special pleasures.
