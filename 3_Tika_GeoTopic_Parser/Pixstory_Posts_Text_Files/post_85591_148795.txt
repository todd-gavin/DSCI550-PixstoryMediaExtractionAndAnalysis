I ve always loved taking flights I think I know why I was years old when I got on my first flight it was pure bliss I recall looking out of the window in awe I am now and I m still always awestruck by the beauty of the clouds But I think there s more to it it s not just the clouds but the fact that for a brief period of time all my worldly problems seem small and minuscule For a brief period of time I get a bird eye s view to life and realise how I m just a speck on earth This really helps me get things into perspective and I always step out of a flight feeling lighter
