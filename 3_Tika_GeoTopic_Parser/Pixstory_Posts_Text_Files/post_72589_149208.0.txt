 No man is Perfect in the World...
Incompleteness makes the man perfect!
The space it creates may make the innovation more promising...
No wonders can be assembled in your life....
But life is more beautiful than Dreams...
If you know how to live your life!!!
It is us that make our life more sophisticated through our actions and words....
Passing Emotions or Permanent Relationships...?
The choice is our's .....
 Emotions resemble waves
Up and Down; Huge or Small...
But relations should be maintained
As it parallels sea shores...
Which must be ready to face any aggression from the sea...
It must be unchanged and unconditional ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ’«ðŸ’«ðŸ’«
