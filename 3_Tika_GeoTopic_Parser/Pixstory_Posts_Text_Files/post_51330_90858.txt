From the moments that Anna spent in Ukraine after Russia s invasion the toughest for Anubhav were when she traveled from Kyiv to Lviv I had my heart in my mouth throughout it Anubhav says They were sending out missiles like crazy so I was really scared that I hope she reaches there safely As Anna made her way to Lviv she kept Anubhav updated through messages while he relayed information about the unfolding situation back to her It wasn t the best time to talk on the phone Anubhav says We were just messaging each other exchanging important information mostly I was in a better state to check the news for everything because our main purpose was to get to the EU somehow With the Polish border being the closest at km away from Lviv everybody seemed to be heading towards it adding to the overwhelmingness of the situation We were hearing news that people are stuck at the border for hours on foot and it was minus degree temperature so I was trying to deliver the news to her Anubhav says Anna met a couple of her colleagues in Lviv and they managed to find a longer route through Slovakia taking a bus crossing the border on foot and then making their way to Poland Anna s confidence through the process gave Anubhav the strength to keep hope Of course you don t say it but she knew that I m scared for her life But she said you know If anything happens I ll be fine Don t worry I m not going to die I m going to reach you I m coming to India whenever I can just relax So her confidence is what kept me going because I was going crazy Anubhav recalls Up Next My plan was to propose simply but then my friends jumped in
