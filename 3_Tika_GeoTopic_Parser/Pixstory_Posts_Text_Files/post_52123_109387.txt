The NBA Draft is always a day where a ton of moves and trades can happen and this year s edition is expected to be no different as the Los Angeles Lakers have already bought themselves into the second round While much of the focus tends to be on younger prospects big names can be dealt as well and one of the biggest potentially on the move is Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving The future of Irving in Brooklyn has been in question since their season ended in the first round of the playoffs Irving missed much of this season due to not being vaccinated and has a player option on his deal worth million It is still unclear whether he will choose to opt in or hit free agency but he originally joined the Nets in tandem with his good friend Kevin Durant and it would make sense if the two wanted to remain together in Brooklyn But apparently Durant is also unsure whether he wants to remain in Brooklyn as Shams Charania of The Athletic reports that he will be monitoring what the Nets do and considering his future options which could open up the door for Irving to move on as well Irving and the Nets have reportedly been at an impasse in contract negotiations though the two sides were reportedly trying to figure out a solution But if one can not be reached ESPN s Adrian Wojnaroski reports Irving has a list of teams he would consider being dealt to and the Lakers are on that list Reports of a potential Irving deal to Los Angeles have been floating around and he has even apparently been in contact with Lakers superstar and former teammate LeBron James on a potential reunion Obviously if a talent like Irving is available there will be many teams interested but a chance to reunite with the teammate whom he had the most success with could be the best for all parties involved
