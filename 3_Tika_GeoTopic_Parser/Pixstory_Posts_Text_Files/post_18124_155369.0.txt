Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are a coordinating couple!
The newlyweds were seen holding hands while walking the carpet at the Ralph Lauren SS23 Runway Show on Thursday night (October 13) at the Huntington Library in the San Marino neighborhood of Los Angeles.
Jennifer, 53, and Ben, 50, joined a ton of other stars at the fashion event, including Sylvester Stallone, Lily Collins, Mindy Kaling, Jessica Chastain, James Marsden, and more.
This marks JLo and Ben's first official time walking a red carpet since their wedding over the summer. It's not surprising that they attended the event as Jennifer wore three Ralph Lauren wedding dresses on her big day.
