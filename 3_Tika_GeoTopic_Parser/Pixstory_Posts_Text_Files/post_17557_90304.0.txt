The Lakers are taking on the New Orleans Pelicans in a vital game for both teams’ Play-In Tournament hopes. Westbrook thinks the clash will have a playoff-like feel to it, considering the stakes.

“It’s a game that we definitely want to win,” he said.

“I think if we have our mindset in the right place and do what we’ve been doing, play the right type of basketball, it will put us in position to be able to win the game. It’s gonna be a playoffs type of atmosphere for us because it’s definitely a must-win, I believe in our group.”
