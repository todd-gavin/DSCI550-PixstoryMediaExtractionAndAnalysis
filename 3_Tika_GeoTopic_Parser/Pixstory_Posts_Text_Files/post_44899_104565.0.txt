Senegal, the reigning Africa Cup of Nations Champions, host Benin at the Diamniadio Olympic Stadium in the group stage fixture of the qualifiers for the 2023 edition on Friday.

Senegal will be looking to defend their title in the 2023 African Cup of Nations, having beaten Egypt last time out in the finals. Senegal are in flying form, unbeaten in 14 out of their last 15 matches with 11 wins and 3 draws. 

Benin are decent form themselves as well, unbeaten in 6 out of their last 8 appearances with just 4 wins for them. 

Benin will be looking to reach the African Cup of Nations this time around, after missing out on the tournament last time by finishing third in their qualifying group.
