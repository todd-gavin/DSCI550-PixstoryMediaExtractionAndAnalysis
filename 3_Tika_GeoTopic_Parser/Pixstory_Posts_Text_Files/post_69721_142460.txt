When it comes to BTS s Jin he might be one of the most handsome talented and sweetest idols ever but he s also the most relatable Since debuting ARMYs have loved watching Jin s true personality shine as the idol showcases his charm and charisma but also his comedic side Jin has once again showcased his charming personality but also just how iconic he actually is September marked leader RM s birthday but as he was on the other side of the world Jin chose to celebrate it by doing a three hour long live gaming broadcast Of course the internet quickly went into meltdown with some ARMYs crying that they d missed it In particular Jin has always been known as an avid gamer and even became an intern for MapleStory Well during the live broadcast many joked that Jin is definitely just like normal netizens when it comes to gaming During the live broadcast many netizens couldn t get over the fact that Jin seemed to be perfectly imitating the stages of grief The stages normally go in order of denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance which are normally in place when trying to process change or a new reality Well it seems like Jin perfectly showcased all of those phases and one user on Twitter perfectly showcased it The idol started with denial when he refused to believe that the game might not be going the way he wanted it to Of course it was common knowledge that Jin got very frustrated throughout the stream and his language seemed so extreme that people might have gotten the wrong idea Yet his screams and anger are truly relatable for any gamer who has ever been stuck on a certain level or things aren t going the right way Next is bargaining When things weren t going Jin s way he resorted to trying to plead with the characters and the game adding Stop that yes like that Please move The stage that came next was truly something everyone has been through and it s depression where it all just wasn t going his way and he was ready to give up
