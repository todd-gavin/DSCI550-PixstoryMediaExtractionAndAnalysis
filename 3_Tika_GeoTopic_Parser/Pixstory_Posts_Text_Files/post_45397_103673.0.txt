As a result of a new policy requiring additional due research on potential recruits, Manchester
United has "walked away from signing at least four transfer targets in the last 12 months."

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, the Old Trafford club has blown hundreds of millions of
dollars on players who didn't fit the criteria throughout nearly a decade of underachievement
and five managers.

However, with Erik ten Hag taking over as United's new manager this summer, steps have been
made to guarantee that this waste does not continue.

Murtough will be in charge of the club's higher profile or more delicate discussions in cooperation with head of recruiting operations Steve Brown, after United's transfer negotiator
Matt Judge announced his resignation from the club.

Ten Hag's primary concerns will be defensive midfield, central defense, and center forward.
They have been connected with deals for Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong, Villarreal's Pau Torres,
Wolves' Ruben Neves, and Ajax's Jurrien Timber.

Despite advising Manchester United's board that he would require as many as six new players
this summer, Erik ten Hag has been handed just £120 million to spend.

Ten Hag and United's recruiting staff are already working on signing players, with the Dutchman
eyeing a center-back, a right-back, a central midfielder, and a striker.

Ten Hag believes United's spine has to be strengthened, but the team will already be decimated
when he arrives, with Juan Mata, Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Nemanja Matic, and Jesse
Lingard all expected to go.

It was thought that Ten Hag would be granted roughly £200 million to replace those outgoings,
given the headroom on the pay bill that those departures would provide.

According to the Times, Ten Hag has been given a limited £120 million transfer budget, which
he will have to supplement with future sales.

Phil Jones, Eric Bailly, Anthony Martial, Dean Henderson, and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are among
the players that can be transferred.
