The second edition of the independent and inclusive non-profit initiative Delhi Art Week (DAW) starts on August 24 and continues until August 31. The initiative which debuted in April 2021, aims to bring together private and public art institutions to raise awareness, educate, and focus attention on modern and contemporary art in Delhi. The key goal of this collaborative initiative is to strengthen ties between art organisations and art lovers and encourage patronage.

The second edition this year is a hybrid event, which adds a new distinctive element. Not only will galleries and institutions showcase their programming physically in their own spaces, but DAW 2022 will also be online on the internationally recognised platform, Artsy—the largest global online marketplace for discovering, buying, and selling fine art by leading artists. This virtual presence will provide the global audience with a sense of the rich diversity of Indian contemporary and modern art available in the capital city. DAW exhibits will be virtually on view on Artsy till September 14.

Tariq Allana, Associate Director, Art Heritage; Sunaina Anand, Director, Art Alive Gallery and Reena Lath, Director, AkarPrakar share, “Thanks to the enthusiasm and excitement generated by the inaugural edition of Delhi Art Week (DAW), we have the unique opportunity to move forward with the second edition of DAW. This second edition builds on the momentum generated from the participating galleries and institutions and the overwhelming public response from our event last year, and we’re grateful to everyone who have supported the event in the past. This edition of DAW takes into account the accepted reality of a pandemic world and the monumental changes and shifts that have taken place in the global arts business – that physical events must be complemented by a presence online.”
