Tourism is a big cause of environmental destruction As tourists and travellers there are some things one must keep in mind Do not litter the destination choose ocean friendly sunscreen take public transport buy local and much more We need to focus more on sustainable travelling One of those thinga would be the Hands Off approach In ecotourism taking a hands off approach to animal and plant life is a crucial step The best way to do it is to keep a safe distance from everything This will aid in controlling the impulse to touch which is especially important with flora because their textures can be enticing at times Touching wildlife is not just a way to conserve the ecosystem and the animals in their natural habitat but it s also a way to protect yourself Animals react and plants can be harmful if they are touched Even taking a flower is considered an act of vandalism in many cases and is penalised by law Being a bystander and seeing nature not interacting with it but witnessing the quiet beauty of it is always a good idea Take a step back and take a lot of pictures Like they say take only pictures leave only footprint
