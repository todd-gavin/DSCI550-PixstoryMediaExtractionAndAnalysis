I think this is when the franchise started to change for the better to be honest Introducing Dwayne Johnson gave the franchise a massive boost too I think And ever since this film the franchise has just got bigger and better The story is predictable but a lot of fun It s a very enjoyable film with some really entertaining and truly likeable characters Vin Diesel is just perfect as Dom He definitely has the most badass scenes Paul Walker is also really good and he has great chemistry with Vin To be honest I think the whole of Dom s team have fantastic chemistry Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris are especially very funny and entertaining It s great to see Han back too Gal Gadot is absolutely gorgeous as Gisele Dwayne Johnson makes a great addition to the franchise too Definitely one of the best characters in the whole film to be honest The action is slick and there are a lot of really cool moments The finale is very entertaining A nice pay off ending too for all the characters The villain is ok but isn t particularly memorable This is a truly great instalment in the franchise
