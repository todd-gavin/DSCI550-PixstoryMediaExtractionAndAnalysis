Liverpool ended their season on a disappointing note, after falling short in the finals of the Champions League, last weekend. The Reds were handed a 1-0 defeat in Paris by Real Madrid, who went on to claim their record 14th title. Just a couple of weeks ago, it seemed that the Reds would have a real shot at the Quadruple. However, they have just two domestic cups to show for their incredible season.

Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool manager painted an optimistic picture despite the final loss on Saturday. He remained upbeat, and stated that Liverpool will bounce back and make it to the UCL final next year in Istanbul. Moreover, the German coach also asked the Reds fans to book their hotels for next year’s European finals. Kate Abdo, CBS Sports host asked the likes of Micah Richards and Jamie Carragher, their respective opinions on the second-finalist, apart from Real Madrid.

Jamie Carragher had a rather hilarious response, taking a jibe at Liverpool’s rivals, Manchester United and Arsenal. “Well it’s not going to be Man United or Arsenal, is it?,” Carragher said. Both these clubs failed to make it to the top four, and will instead have to settle for Europa League action next season. Peter Schmeichel, who was also among the other attendees had a blunt response to Carragher’s remark.

“You’re supporting a really, really good domestic cup team, so just tone it down a little bit – you’ve been cocky all year,” said the retired goal-keeper. Peter Schmeichel is a former Manchester United goal-keeper, who was part of the historic treble winning squad in 1998-99 season. Hence, he wasted no time in giving it back to the former Liverpool defender, given that the Reds have just two cup titles to show for their efforts. 

Liverpool claimed the FA Cup title, after defeating Chelsea on penalties just a couple of weeks ago. They defeated the same opposition in February via the same result, on penalties.
