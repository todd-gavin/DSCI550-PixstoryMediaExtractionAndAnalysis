The Milan coach Stefano Pioli received the Bulgarelli Award in Bologna On this occasion, the coach revealed an interesting background on the season that has just ended with the victory of the Scudetto When I really believed in the Scudetto From the beginning the players know it In all our clubs we had placed last year&#39;s classification with points to climb it and every time I asked Would you like to finish second Everyone said no We believed in it we proved it and we deservedly won Without the trust of Maldini and Massara not everything would have been possible the boys were fantastic but without all of them would not have been possible
