Kylian Mbappe is yet to decide about his future



Reports emerged last week stating Kylian Mbappe had signed a deal with Real Madrid. According to this, the winger would join the Spanish giants for a bumper salary next season. 

As per multiple reports, Real Madrid were ready to pay twice the amount of salary that Kylian Mbappe was receiving at PSG. Hence the winger had "signed" with the Los Merengues already. 

But as per the recent statement of Kylian Mbappe, it has been made quite clear that he is yet to finalize any deal. And the Paris Saint-Germain winger made his feelings clear after the 5-1 victory over LOSC Lille.

Kylian Mbappe said "No, no, I haven’t made my decision. I think playing against Real Madrid changes a lot of things. Even if I’m free to do what I want, I’m not going to go speak to the opponent or do that kind of thing."

The Paris Saint-Germain star had already said this a few months back. Mbappe has the utmost respect for the PSG team and the supporters. Hence he does not want to get on their bad side. 

The 2018 World Cup winner has been PSGs best player, scoring 11 goals and providing 9 assists in Ligue 1. Mbappe also has 4 goals and 4 assists in the Champions League this season. Hence he would be the Parisian club's most important player against Real Madrid. 


Paris Saint-Germain vs Real Madrid will be all about nostalgia! 


This particular UEFA Champions League tie would be very special for a lot of players including Kylian Mbappe. Former Real Madrid captain Sergio would be facing the Spanish giants for the first time since leaving in the summer. 

Also, Keylor Navas and Achraf Hakimi will be returning "Home". To add to this, this would be the first time Lionel Messi will play in Spain since leaving Barcelona at the end of last season. Hence the game between the two European giants is expected to be a huge blockbuster for the game.
