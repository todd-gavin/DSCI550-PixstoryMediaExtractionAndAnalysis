It seems like there cannot pass a minute without someone taking a dig at Bollywood and its superstars. The latest to join the ranks of lambasting the Hindi film industry and its actors for their seemingly unethical codes of conduct is none other thanfilmmaker Prakash Jha.😱It is not a very good time for the Hindi film industry as they have been receiving backlash from a certain section of people almost every other day on social media. From the ongoing boycott Bollywood trend to netizens slamming the actors for endorsing certain products, Bollywood has been going through a lot. Not only this, many insiders from the industry have also slammed certain celebrities from the Hindi film industry ❌❌👍Discussing his struggles with getting appropriate actors for his projects, Jha told “There are 5-6 actors. Look at the condition of these actors. Why will they work in my films when they get 50 crores for doing one gutkha advertisement? The actors are selling gutkha. Can you imagine? What are these top, legendary actors doing?” 😱😱He also said that producers have become “servants of the actors” and said, “Woh naukar bann gaya hai (The producer has become a servant). He has become a servant of the actors and the corporates. Where are the writers? Look at what the people who used to create content have been doing for the last 5 years.” ✅✅✅✅He went on to recall an interaction with the principal of a school they wanted to shoot at when the director was questioned by the latter as to why big Bollywood stars endorsed gutkha, “We had gone to a school for location scouting. The principal of the school asked me what are you guys doing in the Mumbai film industry? The boys in our school are caught chewing gutkha. Roam around the North through Lucknow, Prayagraj and Mugalsarai, there are big hoardings put up where all our big stars are selling all types of gutkhas and paan masalas. What will the kids follow, tell me?”😱😱
