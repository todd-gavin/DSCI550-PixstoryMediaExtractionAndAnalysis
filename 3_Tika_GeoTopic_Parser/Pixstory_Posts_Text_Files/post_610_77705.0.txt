One might dance on various Bollywood / Hollywood numbers as kids. But when do u really begun to understand music . 
Actually for me it was the teenage years-90s . During that time, we still had cassette players or tape recorders . I would put on the music and study, clean, even cook which had been my passion for ages .
It was the time of romance, the khans had hit the block , melody was back in Bollywood music. There however was one problem- the nightingale was very choosy and selective . Even as she was in her 70s , Each and every Lata mangeskar song was a hit. Whether the quirky numbers like didi tera dewar  or the passionate ones like Jiya Jale jaan jale or tu mera samne mein teray samne. 
All my favourites.
However, the real melody was the 50s and 60s songs . 
The voice so sweet, the Melody so rich that every word seemed to come to life. 
The softness and emotions of my all time favorite song - Lagja gale ki phir ye Haseen raat hona ho.
The vivacious Aaj phir jeene ki tamanah hai.
The perfection of piya tose naina lage Re. 

Duets with Mohammad Rafi and Kishore kumar- yeh dil Tim bin kahin lagta nahi hum kya karein, woh jab yaad aye bahut yaad aye, Teri bindiya Re, 

With Kishore kora kagaz tha ye man mera or Tum ko Milgaye ho to yeh lagta hain ke Jahan mil Gaya . 

Or with her own sister Asha bonsle, Aae kash kisi diwane ko muj se bhi Mohabat hogaye , Chapp Tikal sab chinni Re  mose naina ladaike . 
Our parents would talk about the rivalry between the siblings or when she and Mohammad Rafi who was considered to be her best male counterpart at one time refused to talk to each other for four years . 
But what everyone remembers is what she gave the music scene in Indja. There was no one and still is no one who can Like Lata Mangeskar. Wish u speedy recovery.
