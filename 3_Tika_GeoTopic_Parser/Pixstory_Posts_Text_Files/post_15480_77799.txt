In the end Mattarella encore After days gone empty today the election of the President of the Republic has arrived and in fact it is a second term wrested from Sergio Mattarella who had clearly announced that he did not want to do an encore and had greeted the Italians in his opening speech year Yet after the incessant pressure from the parties and after a long conversation with Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Sergio Mattarella made himself available for the good of the country and to help parliament get out of an impasse that had lasted for days. Mattarella during the day even though I had other plans An admission that makes us understand how he had to give in to the heartfelt request of politics to get back in the game to resolve the situation Good news for the country commented the commentators in a loud voice, also underlining the total incapacity of the parties to arrive ready for this appointment in several moments seemed in fact lacking in strategy disunited and without a leadership at the height In the year that separates us from the elections for the new government it will be necessary to work hard and reform the whole system starting from alliances and coalitions but in the in the meantime, the greatest good luck goes to President Sergio Mattarella
