While soccer has a long history in Australia, most fans readily admit that it has never been as popular as Rugby League or Australian Rules Football.

However, there was a time when this was not the case. From late 2005, when Australia upset Uruguay to qualify for the World Cup the following year, to early 2015, when Australia hosted (and then won) the Asian Cup, the sport managed to capture the hearts and minds of the majority of Australians.

Soccer was no longer regarded as a game for "sheilas, wogs, and poofters," as it once was.

During this golden decade, the Socceroos transitioned from the insignificant Oceania Football Confederation to the lucrative Asian Football Federation, and made three World Cup appearances in a row (2006, 2010, 2014).

But that was back in the day, and this is now. The last three years have been spent attempting to break into Australian soccer. The recent VAR error in the A-League grand final between Newcastle and Melbourne Victory is symptomatic of the sport's plethora of issues.
