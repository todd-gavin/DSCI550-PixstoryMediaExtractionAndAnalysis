Away victory for Cioffi&#39;s Udinese on the Venice field These are the words of the Friulian coach I think I have to thank the good work done previously by Luca Gotti Now let&#39;s look one day at a time again I don&#39;t know what will happen in the future I am very happy to be coaching this team We were uglier and dirtier We ran a lot the way they put themselves on the field didn&#39;t surprise us Maybe we weren&#39;t good at reading the movements of their wingers Credit must be given to their match
