All this fixture congestion isn't good for a footballer's fitness as the body isn't given enough time to rest and heal. The constant switch between playing professional games and training gives players very minimal rest days and they often have to pay the price with injuries. More players get injured during these congested game weeks than any other time of the season. The injuries don't even have to do with a foul, they can be as simple as cramps to hamstring injuries based strictly off the work the players have been putting in for so long. These injuries can see a player sidelined for several months at a time, which can be terrible for the club
going forward as well.
In addition, this season will prove to be even more challenging. This is because the Premier League season will be paused in the Winter for the Qatar World Cup. Players will leave their clubs to represent their countries in November and the tournament will go on until December
18th. This means that there are already many games that have been postponed which would have been played through that time period. With the recent line of postponements due to the Queen's passing, it's going to make it even more challenging to fit all these games in. The
fixture congestion will have a detrimental impact on clubs and more importantly the health of the players.
