A student taking the NEET medical entrance exam in Kerala on Sunday was allegedly forced to take off her bra before writing the exam as the metal hooks beeped during a security check. The shocking incident surfaced after the girl's father filed a police complaint.

At the NEET centre in the Kollam district, the girl was told by female security personnel that she must remove her bra because of the "metallic hook". When she was denied, she was told she would not be allowed to take the medical admission exam. 

"Is your future or innerwear big for you? Just remove it and don't waste our time," the girl was told, according to her father's complaint to the police.  

Like seriously It is nothing but a human rights violation.
