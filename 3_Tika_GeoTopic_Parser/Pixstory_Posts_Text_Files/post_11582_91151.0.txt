The buzz with the photo of Kareena indulging in carb rich biryani and halwa during the week day was the talk of the town for a while. 

Recently the actress have posted a story with a photo of a salad captioning it as  “I don't only eat biryani and halwa, you see" which breaks the mindset that weekends are meant to be the cheat days and week days are the healthy food days. 

The salad was fresh and looks super delicious and healthy. The list of vegetables in the salad goes on but to name a few there were Rajma or kidney beans as the main portion of the salad alon with cucumbers, nuts, capsicum, cherry tomatoes and coriander leaves. The salad was cheese free as the star was avoiding the content and it was dressed with salt and pepper.
