Ramesh Gupta life story continues So R N Mittal one of the associates in the party introduced me to Bimla Nagar I was her Chief Election Agent and she contested elections from the Delhi Cantonment and Moti Bagh came under this constituency In the entire city only one candidate was from Congress and that was her It was because of my clout in the area as people were close to me The entire period is a good trip down memory lane I was married in the year Before my marriage I was given a case of Ms Indira Bansal in Parliament street It was a murder case which got buried however I applied for the bill of the case which was around rupees Just one week before my marriage I got a letter saying that the money has been sanctioned I used the money in my marriage and everything happened with utmost ease When my eldest son was born in we had a big celebration back at our house in Moti Bagh My father said that celebration is needed as he was the first child in the family who was born after a long time I vividly remember that chat papdi and dahi bhalle were brought from Purani Delhi with each plate costing Rupees for people It was a big day and since then I never looked back In January after the emergency I met Shubhash Gupta who was also working with Mr Mittal We both started working together There was an empty hall near our office we sat there However the hall was closed after a while During this I met Bapuram Pakhade who was also a lawyer by profession He told me how one of the labourers working in the brick factory came to him because of a case and Mr Bapuram handled the legal proceedings of that case Soon after many other such labourers started coming to him and I got associated with him and his work To be continued
