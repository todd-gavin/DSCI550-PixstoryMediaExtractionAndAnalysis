Khaby Lame, a 21-year-old from Italy, has gone viral for his deadpan reaction clips and comic sketches. 

On Wednesday, Lame, 22, surpassed 18-year-old Charli D'Amelio to become the most-followed TikToker in the world. While D'Amelio currently has 142.2 million followers on the app, Lame now has a following of 142.6 million.

In one of Khabane Lame's TikTok videos from last year, he reacted to a clip of someone using scissors to open a container of milk. To show how it's done, Lame simply peeled a milk carton open and poured the liquid into a glass while smiling goofily at the camera.

Lame is famous for his comic expressions and deadpan reactions to overstylized TikToks.

On social media, users are now calling 22-year-old Lame the "king of TikTok."

It's a simple act, something most people do every day. But the video has over 8 million likes.

His following has grown rapidly over the past few years, and in July 2021, he surpassed the 22-year-old influencer Addison Rae to become the second most-followed creator in the world. 

He became famous for his comic expressions and reaction videos, and by looking at the camera, he breaks the fourth wall — almost like TikTok's version of Jim Halpert from "The Office," who served as the sitcom's straight man. 

"It's my face and my facial expressions that make people laugh," Lame acknowledges. "The funniest part of my content is the silence", he explains.
