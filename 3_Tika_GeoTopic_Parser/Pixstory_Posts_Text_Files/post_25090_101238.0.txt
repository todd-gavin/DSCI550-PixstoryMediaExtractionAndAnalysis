The 2021/22 Premier League season will draw to a close on Sunday, as Manchester United have had a season to forget. The Reds could finish as low as seventh on the points table, and must win their final fixture to guarantee a Europa League spot. The Red Devils travel to Selhurst Park for the final league outing against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Manchester United were completely outplayed by Brighton in their last fixture, losing by a score-line of 4-0.

The Red Devils will have a new permanent manager taking over the reigns next season. Former Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag has been assigned the duty to rebuild the squad, and bring back the glory days. The Dutch manager will be among the attendants for the fixture against Crystal Palace. However, it is known that he will not interfere in the team affairs, and will give full independence to Interim Manager, Ralf Rangnick. 

Manchester United have a long summer that lays ahead, and a handful of players will be making their way out of the club. Hence, reinforcements will be the key, as Erik ten Hag should be handed a handsome transfer budget for his first season in-charge at Manchester United. Recently, Ten Hag claimed the league title with Ajax, and wasted no time in catching the flight to Manchester.

As far as Manchester Unitedâ€™s form is concerned, they have managed to win just three games from their last 13 outings in all competitions. This includes three defeats in their last five encounters, with their last win coming against Brentford a couple of weeks ago. Ralf Rangnick will hope for his side to claim all three points on Sunday, and at least end the season on a high.
