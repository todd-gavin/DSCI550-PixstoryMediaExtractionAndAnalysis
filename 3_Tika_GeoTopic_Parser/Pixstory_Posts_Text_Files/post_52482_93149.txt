I don t know a lot about Buddhha but I ll try to share my thoughts on Thoughts I also believe that your thought guide you but you guide your thoughts very rarely Our thought is so Powerful Fast that we can not feet it creating itself in our brain We can somehow control our thoughts by lots of practice of Meditation Mindfulness exercise Because Mindfulness exercise train your mind to be present at the moment when you just feel you are distracted by your thoughts then you try to focus on the present again This is how you control your thoughts to a small degree Coming to becoming what your thought it means that your thought is the starting point of everything you do in your life things you do in your life leada to person you become by doing that things
