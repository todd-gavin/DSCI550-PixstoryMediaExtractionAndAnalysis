Porridge might be considered by some people to be the ultimate comfort food! Warm, soft and filling, porridge, in its most basic form, can find roots in a wide variety of human civilizations. From Asia to Europe to the Americas, porridge touches people all over the globe.

National Porridge Day is a great time to learn more about this history and celebration of this most satisfying food!

The origins of porridge can likely be traced back to when people began preparing it from crushed grains, around 12,000 years ago. This may have begun with grains that could be found by hunter-gatherers and would eventually have changed to plants that were cultivated and attended to by farmers.

Some researchers and historians believe that porridge might have been a predecessor to bread. Ancient people are believed to have thickened their porridge and then cooked it into flat versions of bread. This type of baking of dense porridge made the food more portable, which was especially helpful for nomads, travelers and soldiers.

The people of Scotland, who are famous for their oat porridge and oat cakes, probably began incorporating porridge into their culture just after oats were introduced to their lands, some time around 600 AD.

Nevertheless, itâ€™s one of my favourite dishes!
