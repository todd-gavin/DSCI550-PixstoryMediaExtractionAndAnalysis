Dear Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton In response to your letter on criminalizing pride week we have taken it upon ourselves to design this problem solving course driven by questions for your well being First you attempt to ban lifesaving healthcare for transgender youth Now you re attempting to ban the eight year tradition of a school district s Pride by conflating it with human sexuality instruction whatever that means What s really going on here Paxton Why are you bullying kids How wounded has the concept of masculinity been in your surroundings that it s created this rage against the youth in your state Where does this thirst for unattainable heteropatriarchal concepts of power come from What do you gain by passing legal opinions that increase the risk of suicide for trans youth What made you fear love When did you learn to wear hate as a shield and how far along will it go to protect you While you search for answers here s a video that can guide you in your journey to practice compassion over comprehension
