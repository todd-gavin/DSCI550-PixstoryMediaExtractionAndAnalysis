2. Organised press

Without upsetting Crisitiano Ronaldo fans, I would say Manchester United were quite successful in pressing as a unit in an organised with the Portuguese striker absence. 

There is absolutely no doubt over Cristiano's input to this United team with his stunning 28 goals last season keeping United afloat in a top-six finish. But one of the chief complaints from The Old Trafford faithful is his lack of pressing the opponent backline with the team, and not only Ronaldo but last season the team failed to show an urgency whenever the need arose to press the opponents in order to snatch the ball and potentially set up a goalscoring opportunity. 

Luckily, ETH have addressed this issue in his first game in charge with the team showing an excellent bit of organised press. It bore fruit with disarraying the inexperienced Liverpool defence who at times failed to demonstrate their prowess in beating the press.

Fred's exquisite dink over the top of Alisson goal also came as a result of the carefully assembled press. If United manage to make their pressing capabilities as consistent like today, there will be undoubtedly a change in attacking prowess and urgency in the team.
