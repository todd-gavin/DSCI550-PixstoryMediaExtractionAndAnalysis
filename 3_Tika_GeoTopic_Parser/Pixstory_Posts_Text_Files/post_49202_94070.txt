Kansas is truly an underappreciated band I remember spending nights listening to them vibing with my friends back in the day I enjoy their entire discography but the song Cheyenne Anthem sticks out in particular It s had everything you d want in an enormous prog tune plus some devastating lyrics about one of America s worst periods This song earns my vote as someone who enjoys music with historical references Carry on wayward son and Point of know return are songs I enjoy too Oh also Play the game tonight There are so many This post brought back so many memories Most of their albums had me hooked
