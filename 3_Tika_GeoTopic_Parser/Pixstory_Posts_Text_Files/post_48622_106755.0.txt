The self-help industry is a billion dollar industry that thrives on your feelings of inadequacy. They try to persuade you that you need to improve your current situation, that people ignore you, that you are unhappy, that you are not perfect, but that you can change it all, that you can prove the world wrong, and that all you have to do is read this particular book, and your life will change forever.

That's how most of us get our first self-help book and read it; everything seems nice afterward, including getting up early, working out, taking cold showers, and listening to podcasts. Then we feel compelled to buy another book, and another, and another, until it becomes a habit.

You won't even realize and you'll develop an addiction and that's what they want. They thrive on you being unhappy. They might help you but more often than not you'll develop a toxic dependency on them, which will further prompt you to buy more books.
