Again an unrelated meme but it was funny also my doctor didn t want me to share his picture so I m sharing this So Dr Ajit is a pediatrician actually and I ve been going to him since I was a kid for as long as I can remember I don t anymore as I m an adult now but whenever I m sick he s the first person I call just to get advice he means that much So when I was born I had some trouble in breathing this story has been told to me by my parents Doctors told my parents that they ll have to insert some sort of tubes in me to stabilize my breathing this is when Dr Teltia came to rescue and he really saved my life This was the first incident The second one was when my brother was this time he saved my younger brother s life he suffered from severe pancreatitis inflammation of the pancreas doctors said that we d have to operate on him my parents and me were very scared They took him to Jaipur Delhi but nothing worked at last Dr Ajit only I ll be thankful to him my whole life
