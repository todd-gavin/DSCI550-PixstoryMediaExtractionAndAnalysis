Metal elitism is the pinnacle of stupidity when it comes to the fold of being a metalhead As vast and diverse a genre of music that metal is it has got some of the most narrow minded and pathetic fans that I have ever seen particularly from the black death and thrash metal community At least the guys from the prog scene are a bit cooler even if they suffer from the same problem in a lesser scale and in a different way People in general have never been able to truly warm up to heavy metal but that is mainly because it is too extreme for them But the so called fans of metal today are even worse as they are basically insulting this beautiful art form by going Oh this is not metal oh that is emo that isn t real metal These purists who have taken to being the supposed guardians of real metal go about labeling others as posers or try hards saying moronic useless stuff like Bullet For My Valentine is pop rock Avenged Sevenfold is not metal Slipknot is fake metal metalcore is for posers and bla bla bla Hell even the idiots at the Metal Archives suffer from this disease Oh this ain t metal enough even Between The Buried And Me which is basically progressive technical death metal with metalcore and experimental rock influences is denied entry in the Archives on the ground that it isn t really metal Metal is metal get over it Even rap alternative and nu metal comes under that too bad for the elitist morons who disagree Heavy metal is my life long passion and religion but for you who are reading this and want to enter this beautiful place of sonic extremity and wonder be warned that it is a great community which has unfortunately been polluted by a lot of toxicity
