A large fire broke out by the Hollywood Bowl as concertgoers were leaving the venue following a “Sound of Music” singalong on Sept. 17.User videos on the social media app Citizen showed firefighters rushing to put out palm trees that had ignited into flames. LAFD also requested the California Highway Patrol shut down one lane of traffic.The LAFD posted a notice on its Twitter page after the blaze was under control, writing: “That somewhat stubborn fire near the @HollywoodBowl, our 1,423rd emergency of the day, thankfully involves only vegetation.” A user who had been at the Saturday night concert wrote, “Leaving the Hollywood Bowl after Sing Along Sound of Music and a small cluster of palm trees was on fire. It burned quickly and was barely embers by the time people  reached their cars in stacked parking. While this was happening, the exiting crowd sang Do Re Mi in the tunnel.”Source: Variety
