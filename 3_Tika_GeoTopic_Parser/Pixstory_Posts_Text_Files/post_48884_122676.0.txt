The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently added the Indonesian native komodo dragon to its list of "Endangered" species, designating it as having a high risk of extinction. This is brought on by habitat loss brought on by development and natural disasters, the disappearance of large prey due to extensive poaching by humans, and illegal lizard hunting. Only 3,000 dragons remain, and Indonesian legislation protects this threatened species.

The World Wildlife Fund reports that experts think these enormous lizards have endured a hostile climate for millions of years, making them extremely valuable survivors and essential to the food chain in their habitat. The local ecosystem will suffer devastatingly if this ancient species disappears because they are the apex predators of their island.

Populations of their herbivorous prey explode when a dominant species is gone. These animals exert a lot of strain on the existing vegetation that they need for sustenance and can decimate significant amounts of plant life, such as grasses and trees, if there is no top predator to control their population. Species extinction due to climate change and climate change due to species extinction is a vicious cycle. If Komodo Dragons went extinct, it will affect the the islands of Indonesia. It will violently disturb the island's ecosystem that will result in more climatic disasters, food shortage for people and a lot more which will directly affect the world gradually.
