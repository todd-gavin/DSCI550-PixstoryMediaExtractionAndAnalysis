If you're ever faced with the unfortunate reality of a dog attack, there are some basic steps that you can take to survive.
- Remain calm and stay as still as possible. Don't make sudden movements or noises that could spook the animal. If you must scream, do it softly and slowly so your voice doesn't startle it further.
- If you can, move away from anyone who can be injured (including the dog). The more distance between yourself and the animal, the better. 
- Don't try to grab or strike the dog; this will only incite violence and might even provoke an attack. Instead, use whatever object is available (a chair, an umbrella, your bag) to hit or shove the animal in order to distract it while you back away. 
- If at all possible, find someone else who can help you until emergency services arrive. Have them call 911 if necessary, and keep yourself safe by following their instructions carefully!
