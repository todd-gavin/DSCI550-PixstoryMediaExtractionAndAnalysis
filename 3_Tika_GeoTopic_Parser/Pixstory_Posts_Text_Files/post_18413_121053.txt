Today in Como was the day of Fabregas The Spanish footballer formerly of Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona was presented in grand style at the Hilton Hotel A marriage that aims to be long-term with a formal two-year contract as a footballer but with a future also corporate perhaps as a shareholder In short, today a fairy tale is born in Serie B counting on the fact that Fabregas has a bit of experience a World Cup won two European Championships a Club World Cup a Liga two Premier Leagues a Europa League a European Super Cup And they&#39;re not even all I arrive here with the same ambition that has always distinguished me I am here to play, do well and win matches When I no longer have these motivations I will hang up my boots but this is certainly not the time since I still have so much to do in football I am very ambitious and would like to bring back a club where it deserves to be in Serie A Fabregas said On why choosing Como he admitted I wasn&#39;t looking for money but I just wanted to marry a project that excited me that of Como is very interesting I see a future for this team also in the long term
