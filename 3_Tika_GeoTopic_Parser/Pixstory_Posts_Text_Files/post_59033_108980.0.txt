In this week's comics, Marvel celebrates Pride with an action-packed issue featuring fan-favourite LGBTQI+ characters like Loki, Moondragon, Hercules, and the Young Avengers — and that's not all! The anthology issue will also introduce an all-new Marvel hero called Escapade, who will swing in to save the day alongside her best friend and fellow trans mutant Morgan Red.🌈

The characters are quite cute and look strong 💪. It's great news that they have their Kind of superheroes 🦸 which will make them feel a little more powerful maybe😉☺️
