The City of Joy.
City with people with hearts of sweet rosogolla.
Yes! The city of Kolkata!!! 
A really wonderful and happy place with tons of great attraction sites. Ranging from spices to sweet, from streets to home.. everything has something special in it. 
The only thing I wish to change about the city is its "Local train" facilities. Being one of the busiest railway station the local trains are heavily loaded, without proper air and washroom facilities. 
Everything in the universe in undergoing a constant change. I wish to make the facilities more comfortable for the people to travel arround the place and enjoy its breathtaking beauty.ðŸŒ·
