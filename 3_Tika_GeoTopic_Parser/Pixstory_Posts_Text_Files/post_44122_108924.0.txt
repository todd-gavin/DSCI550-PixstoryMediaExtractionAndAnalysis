Even if the cricket is played on one end, there are always football fans watching the game. The recent AFC Asian Cup saw huge footfall at Yuvabharathi Kirangan despite the India - South Africa bilateral series being played in the other part of the country. This gives the scope for more in-person football matches which in turn can help to spread awareness about Indian national football. 


Adding to the comments of the national team gaffer, Igor Stimac, the Indian Premier League is definitely one of the biggest sporting festivals in the country. It used to be held for close to 50 days but the days have increased due to 10 teams in the IPL 2022. After the recent conclusion of the Indian Premier League media rights auction, we heard that the BCCI is planning to have a 97 days tournament in the coming years. This would form a quarter of the year and waiting to conclude will hamper the growth of the national team directly. 


Indian football is already struggling with a limited season of the Indian Super League. The league is held only for seven months which makes people wonder about taking the sport as a profession. If AIFF starts to hold back the games just because of other sporting events, the years that India would take to qualify for the FIFA World Cup will prolong.
