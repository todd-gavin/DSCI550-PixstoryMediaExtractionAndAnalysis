India is seeing return of 1 time use sub par quality vapes. While we witness so many people ‘flaunting’ it and considering it as a ‘healthy’ alternative to smoking. This readily available and easy to carry device has become a style quotient. So here comes the question is vaping legal in India? 
Vaping is completely illegal and banned in India by the Protection of E-Cigarettes Act of 2019. Violators of the Act face upto 1 year of imprisonment and a fine of 1 lakh rupees or both while repeated offences carry a jail term of 3 years and fine of rupees 5 lakhs or both. Storing of vapes is also illegal with an imprisonment of 6 months and a fine of 50,000 or both. 

Do you think the ban is a failed attempt ? 
While most of the teenagers fall into the trap of vaping should the government start from controlling it at the ‘minor’ level so that the major problem gets resolved itself?
