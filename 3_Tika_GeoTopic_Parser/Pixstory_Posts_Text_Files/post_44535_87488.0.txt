The emergence of communist China continues....

Having looked at the background to the present China-India relationship in the first two parts, the third part of the book looks at the present geo-strategic implications for India of Chinese military modernisation and selective expansion. Chinese strategic thought and operational doctrine, in so far as can be judged, are then discussed following which the options and presumed strategic priorities are outlined.

THE EMERGENCE OF MODERN CHINA

The modern ‘Communist Dynasty’ of China was a sudden creation, and its emergence in Asia is what changed the geo-strategic existence for its neighbours, which included Tibet and India, and that is what this book is about. Today’s Communist Dynasty came to power in China after a bitter and prolonged civil war (1927-1949) between the Nationalist Government of China of the Kuomintang (KMT) (a.k.a.‘Guomindang’) under General Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung). For a major part of this period the KMT was also involved in fighting Imperial Japan, which had conquered and occupied all the coastal provinces.

When the Second World War in Asia came abruptly to an end in 1945, with the American atom bombing of Japan, nobody had expected the Communists to come to power in China. The Soviet Red Army had swept into Manchuria and occupied it in August 1945, as it was an area that could pose a threat to their far eastern military port of Vladivostok. 


The Americans had been pouring arms and money into Chiang Kai￾shek's military campaign against the occupying Japanese forces, and the Communists in the form of the People’s Liberation Army had been forced to flee to the remote interior of China. The presence of the Soviet Army prevented the Nationalist Army from occupying Manchuria and from taking the surrender of the Japanese forces in Manchuria.
