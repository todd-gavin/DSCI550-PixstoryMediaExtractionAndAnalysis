I agree that Adventures of Priscilla is a great movie but you canâ€™t talk about the comedy genre and ignore The Castle!

The Castle is a famous (and the best, in my opinion) Aussie film that offers a funny perspective on working-class life. It chronicles the Kerrigan family's efforts to prevent Melbourne Airport from purchasing their home. 

Although it lacks sparkle and glory because it is a budget comedy, the movie, in no way, disappoints and is a great watch!

Did you know that as per sources, the English proverb "a man's home is his castle," which is referenced frequently in the movie, served as the inspiration for the title. 

Its humour plays on the idea of Australia as a nation, particularly the idea of working-class Australians and their position in contemporary Australia.
