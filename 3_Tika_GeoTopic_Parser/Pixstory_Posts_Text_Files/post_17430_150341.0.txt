For a few weeks, speculations of Lionel Messi's sensational return to Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have hogged the headlines worldwide. While the Argentinian talisman has indicated that his entire focus remains on the upcoming World Cup 2022 in Qatar, the latest reports suggest the iconic striker may not renew his contract at the Parisian club when it comes to an end next year. Amidst the ongoing drama surrounding the legendary footballer's transfer move, PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi has, for the second time in one week, taken a jibe at Barcelona, raising eyebrows over the timing of his attacks on the Catalan club.Nasser Al-Khelaifi has urged the UEFA to investigate Barcelona's financial activities over the summer, including selling TV rights and digital assets in multi-million-pound deals. Due to financial limitations, the Spanish team could not register any new signings at the start of the transfer window, leaving players like Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha, and Jules Kounde in limbo. However, the La Liga giants generated funds by partially offloading future TV rights revenue and Barca Studios. For 517 million euros, Barca sold 25 per cent of its future TV rights revenue to Sixth Street, while Orpheus Media purchased 24 per cent of the club's media firm. Jaume Roures, the chief executive of MediaPro, who defaulted on a 2.75 billion pounds contract with Ligue 1 barely five months into the agreement in 2020, also serves as the chairman of Orpheus Media.
