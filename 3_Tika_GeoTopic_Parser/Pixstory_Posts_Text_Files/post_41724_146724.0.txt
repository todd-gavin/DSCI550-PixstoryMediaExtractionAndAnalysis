Aaron Finch, 35, of Australia claimed that he considers Twenty20 cricket to be "fun" and that he has no immediate plans to stop playing the format before their three-match series against India begins on Monday. IE reported that following a protracted run drought in that format, Australia's white-ball captain Finch retired from one-day cricket after the home series against New Zealand earlier this month. Finch spearheaded Australia's victory in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup last year and will lead their title defence on home turf the following month.“I’m not putting an end date on anything T20 related just yet,” the opener told a news conference ahead of Tuesday’s series opener against India in Mohali.“It’s still exciting. I love touring with the Australian team.
