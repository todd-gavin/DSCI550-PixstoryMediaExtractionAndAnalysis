The Golden State Warriors are close to winning a th NBA championship Which brings Stephen Curry one step closer to surpassing The legacy of LeBron James Curry has brought rings legacies wealth a new stadium and even another all time great Kevin Durant to GSW which before him seemed like a distant dream Now only the Celtics stand in the way of him capturing as many rings as LeBron and that in itself is a mighty challenge to say the least We ve spent so much time focusing on LeBron vs Jordan that we missed the fact that there was someone not far away aiming for The King s crown The fact Steph bested LeBron in three series doesn t hurt either It is not inconceivable that we re on our way to a reality that sees Steph someday retire with more championships than LeBron Steph is the greatest shooter in the history of the sport so great in fact he changed the NBA and shifted the course of its history as much as Wilt or Bird Magic or Jordan The game s focus on point shooting and positionless play is rooted first and foremost in Curry His individual resume is astounding Two MVPs one unanimous The most three point shots ever made Career shooting percentages of from the field from and from the stripe One of only players to claim a season And so on He s also as noted turned other players into Hall of Fame candidates Jordan did that most likely but it s hard to say the same for LeBron That too matters even if it s harder to measure or prove Yet LeBron is well LeBron He will almost certainly end his career as the game s all time leading scorer LeBron is already seventh on the all time assists list He s been chasing and chasing down Jordan for a reason As we always do then the talk on Steph Curry both celebrates him and misses the larger current point Curry coming up on LeBron s legacy true and interesting though it is still probably ends with LeBron ahead when both retire As reported by sports Illustrated
