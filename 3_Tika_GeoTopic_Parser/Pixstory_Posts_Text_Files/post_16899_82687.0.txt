And the wait is finally over as the first photos of Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar as groom and bride are out. For the wedding, Shibani went for a red off-shoulder gown with a veil and kept her hair open in soft curls and Farhan chose a black tuxedo to complement her. The wedding is taking place in Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi's Khandala home and the décor is simple yet beautiful. The flower décor matches Shibani's wedding gown and makes everything look pretty!
