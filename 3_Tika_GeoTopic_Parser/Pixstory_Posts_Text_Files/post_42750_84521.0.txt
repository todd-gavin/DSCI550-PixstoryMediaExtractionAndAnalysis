If yes, this is one song you could tune in and just listen on repeat! It soothes you when you know you're not alone in this life. Artists- Selena Gomez and Coldplay bring in their emotions so well into the music and the music video, which you can check out on YouTube. 

Be it any relationship we have on earth, many are fleeting, and it hurts to let go. But what do we do? It's a process. But also, remember we are in it together, and you're not alone when it comes to moving on and opening a new chapter in life. 

If you're reading this and have gone through or are going through a similar stance in life, know that you are seen and loved- by me, at the least! 

Till then, take care of yourselves in this process, plug in those headphones, and let's vibe together!
