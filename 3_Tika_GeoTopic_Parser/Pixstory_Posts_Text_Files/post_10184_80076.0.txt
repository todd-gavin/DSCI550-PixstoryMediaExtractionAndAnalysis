Toltz is profligate with his stories: any one of Martin's anecdotes would make a decent full-length novel. And not all the same kind of novel either - there's a section about a labyrinth that you could imagine Borges writing, another about a lottery gone wrong that made me think of Vonnegut, and a strange, lovely account of childhood illness that had echoes of García Márquez. In some ways it plays like a modern Arabian Nights, with Martin as Sinbad. His bad-tempered, regretful voice gives the book a unity and immediacy that makes it feel less like a novel and more like a stand-up routine (the book it reminded me of most was Alexei Sayle's brilliant Overtaken). One of the characters, for instance, writes a kind of Do It Yourself guide for aspiring criminals that includes such chapter titles as "Motiveless Crime: Why", "Armed Robbery: Laughing all the way from the bank" and "Manslaughter: Ooops!". Or how about this - "There were no two ways about it: I was in a crisis. But recent shifts in the behaviour of different age groups made it hard to know what type - How could it be a midlife crisis when the forties were the new twenties, the fifties the new thirties . . . I had to read the lifestyle supplement to make sure I wasn't going through puberty."

Just as Jasper's life is overshadowed by his father's, so Martin's is overshadowed by that of his brother, the criminal genius Terry Dean, who uses a spell in prison to start up a kind of criminal cooperative ("the state is always going about the business of introducing dangerous criminals to each other - they plunge them right into the network"). From childhood, when Terry was a sporting hero, through adulthood when he becomes Australia's most notorious killer, Martin is only ever "Terry's brother". Even the woman he loves only comes to him in the absence of his brother. In the end, Martin is able to achieve his own identity only by committing a worse crime than his brother's.
