Intimate wear destination Zivame has announced the launch of its new brand campaign that showcases the ease, comfort and convenience of shopping for intimate wear on its website.
Through the campaign it tries to show that in a sensitive category like intimate wear, Zivame.com wants to be the buyer’s guide and confidante that not only understands them and their unique needs but also helps them navigate through the process of finding the perfect intimate wear.
The campaign has three films, each built on a consumer insight.
Film one showcases how lack of variety in the lingerie restricts the buyer’s outerwear choices and offers the simple solution of unearthing a wide range of variety on Zivame with 50k+ styles and 100+ brands.
Film two highlights the discomfort of wearing the wrong bra size and how it can lead to missed opportunities. With the Zivame Fitcode, one can find their right size and profile and get their perfect fit.
Film three showcases the embarrassment and judgement a woman faces while shopping for this category and highlights how Zivame gives them a private, comfortable and discreet shopping experience.
Lavanya, COO of Zivame, said, “The campaign not only conveys Zivame’s category expertise but also gives the assurance of being a platform that understands women like a friend, meeting her unique needs”.
Sachin Kamble, National Creative Director, Leo Burnett, said “The campaign addresses the common problems that women face while shopping for their intimate wear and how zivame.com simplifies and transforms this experience for consumers”.
