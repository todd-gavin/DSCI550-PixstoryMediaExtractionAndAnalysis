But beauty is not just a visual experience it is a characteristic that provides a perceptual experience to the eye the ear the intellect the aesthetic faculty or the moral sense It is the qualities that give pleasure meaning or satisfaction to the senses but in this talk I wish to concentrate on the eye the intellect and the moral sense It was the late CP Snow a true polymath who gave the Rede lecture in and subsequently wrote a book both under the title The Two Cultures in which he bemoaned the split that had taken place between the scientists and the literary intellectuals In education when I was at school and to a large degree it remains even today there is a division as to whether one follows a scientific or an arts direction to the detriment of the other His theory was boosted when the critic FR Leavis published his attack on the Two Cultures He wrote of Snow s complete ignorance of history literature and the history of civilization his incapacity as a novelist is total not only is he not a genius he is intellectually as undistinguished as it is possible to be For those of you who have come expecting a little gentle admonition I am afraid you are going to be either relieved or disappointed as there is no way that I could match that But it is one of history s ironies that nearly eighty years earlier Matthew Arnold in giving the same lecture had made the opposite point Written in response to an argument that literature should and inevitably would be supplanted by science he argued so long as human nature is what it is culture would continue to provide mankind with its fulcrum of moral understanding I would suggest that there is still a role for science and art in modern medicine and I wish to show that they should be interlinked in the training for and practice of medicine But beauty is not just a visual experience it is a characteristic that provides a perceptual experience to the eye
