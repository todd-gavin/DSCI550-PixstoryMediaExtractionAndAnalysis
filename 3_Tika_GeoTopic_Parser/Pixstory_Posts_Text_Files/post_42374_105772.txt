So the first episode of Marvel Studios new web series called Ms Marvel is out and after watching the first episode one thing I want to say is that the first episode was a little bit underwhelming but the mid credit scene saved the whole episode The first episodes started at the point where the director introduced the major character of the series which are Kamala Khan her father Yusuf khan her mother Muneeba khan her brother Aamir and her best friend Bruno In the first ten minutes of the episode we got to know that Kamala is a huge Marvel and she lives in her fantasy world and her mother Muneeba didn t like it at all Dialogues of Kamala s mother made her look so over dramatic on screen and as I know how to speak Hindi very well I can say that her accent is fake Coming back to the episode the conflict of the episode comes at the point when Kamala asked her parents to go to the AvengerCon event where she wants to dress as Captain Marvel but her parents said no because of some typical religious issues But anyhow Kamala sneaked out of her home with her best friend and at the event something happened to Kamala where she realised that she got cosmic powers and I am not telling you how because it will be a spoiler from my side After dealing with the chaos that happened at the event someone recorded Kamala s heroic stunts and uploaded them on social media and mid credit scenes showed glimpses of what coming next in episode number two of Ms Marvel At last I want to say that episode one of Ms Marvel seems more of a Disney product and not Marvel s I hope it will change our perspective in the upcoming episodes
