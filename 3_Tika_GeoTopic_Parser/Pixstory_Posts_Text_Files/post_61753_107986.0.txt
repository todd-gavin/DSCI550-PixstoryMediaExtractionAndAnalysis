The Golden State Warriors marchee into the historic and legendary TD Garden last night and beat the Boston Celtics 103-90, to win the 2022 NBA finals. 

Their Game 6 victory was a dominant performance in hostile territory kicked off by an early 21-0 run which effectively secured the Warriors their fourth championship in the last eight years.

The contest offered a competitive game early on. The Celtics began the game by going on a 14-2 rampant lead, and they briefly looked like they would turn the finals into a decisive Winner take all Game 7 in San Francisco. But the Warriors countered with a run of their own, eventually ending the first quarter with a five-point lead. 

The Warriors held Boston scoreless for the first two minutes of the second quarter as Golden State rained three-pointers down on their hapless opponents. By the time the blitz was over, the Warriors had put together a 21-0 streak. 

Stephen Curry three halfway through the third quarter gave them a 22-point lead that effectively ended the game and secured Curry the first finals MVP award of a career that will end with his enshrinement in the Hall of Fame. Curry secured the glory for the team and himself. 

Another title for the Warriors, another successful campaign for Curry
