Even though I, unfortunately, had never heard his music before it, Hussle was a legend before he died. He wasn't the kind of rapper you'd hear on the radio. He was an underground rapper (not mainstream, but folks who make their own music) who was by far the best underground rapper on the west coast; Nip was, say, the Kendrick Lamar of the underground rap scene. He was a lyricist with slick rhymes who talked about the violence in his community and in Los Angeles in general. 

I'm not much into rap but I have heard Nipsey Hussle a lot of times when I was out with my friends. Some of the tracks that I love are :

Blue Laces
Status symbol
Hate it or love it
Ocean Views
Killer - Bullets ainâ€™t got no name
