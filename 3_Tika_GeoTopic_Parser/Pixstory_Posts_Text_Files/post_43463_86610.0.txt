Someone once asked me, "What is beauty according to you?" 

I answered, "Look around you. Beauty is everything you see, from the asphalt on the roads to the clouds in the sky; it is everywhere. Inside you and me. You just need to remove the curtain of prejudiced notions from your mind and you'll discover a brand new world full of beauty."
