The change in appearance of Noah Centineo caused some shock and awe. He shaved off his distinctive mop of curly hair in order to make room on his dome for a brand-new tattoo.
While spending time with friends in Los Angeles on Monday, the To All the Boys actor flaunted the new look. The actor was beaming as he left a building carrying what appeared to be a cup of coffee while dressed in a black hoodie and black sweatpants. But what made him stand out was his head.
For starters, Centineo lost all of his hair. He hasn't cut his hair since 2019; this is the first time. But this time, the actor completely shaved his head down to the skin. On the left side of his head, just above his left ear, there also seems to be a new tattoo. It seems to depict a bear with two cubs. The youngster is a total naturalist!
The new look comes nearly four months after his rep confirmed that he's no longer attached to the project Masters of the Universe, in which he was supposed to play He-Man.
That being said, Centineo's still a busy man. ET reported earlier this year that he'll star in and executive produce a new untitled spy thriller series, which has been picked up by Netflix. According to a press release, the series centers around a fledgling lawyer at the CIA, presumably played by Centineo. 
He's also set to star in 2022's Marvel action flick, Black Adam, alongside Dwayne Johnson. Black Adam hits theaters Oct. 21.
