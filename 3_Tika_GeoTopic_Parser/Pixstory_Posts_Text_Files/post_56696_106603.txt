Over the past decade the rivalry between the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers has become much more fierce Even though the Lakers are still the premier franchise in the city and arguably the NBA as a whole the Clippers are no longer the doormat franchise they had been for much of their time in Los Angeles The Clippers are now a perennial playoff team and have built their own identity within the city A couple of players have found themselves on both sides of the coin and one of those is veteran guard Lou Williams The three time Sixth Man of the Year spent nearly two seasons with the Lakers and almost four with the Clippers When it comes to Williams and his personal preference between the two franchises it was an easy choice for him to take the Clippers over the Lakers and he explained why during an appearance on the Knuckleheads Podcast via Joey Linn of the Sun Herald Clippers that s easy That s easy for me Lou said I was part of a culture change over there They gave us an opportunity to kinda build that organization out to our personalities and how we wanted to feel and look And I think we had a big part in how it looks now I m a part of that In this instance it makes complete sense why Williams would choose the Clippers over the Lakers When he was with the Purple and Gold the franchise was going through arguably the worst period in franchise history But as he noted Williams was a part of building a culture with the Clippers that will always stand out more Williams had the best success of his career with the Clippers winning two of his three Sixth Man of the Year awards during his time there and helping to build the foundation of this new era of Clippers basketball The success of the two franchises is not comparable but each player has their journey and for Lou Williams his time with the Clippers was much more impactful in his career than his time with the Lakers
