St Kilda great Nick Riewoldt has made an impassioned plea to the AFL and the players union to provide more adequate support to players as they transition out of the professional game Riewoldt s call on Monday night came after former teammate Sam Fisher was charged with trafficking commercial quantities of illicit drugs Fisher played games for the Saints before retiring in A lot of his close teammates knew that he had some issues but to this extent once it was all laid bare last week I think a lot of us were surprised at just how bad the situation had become Riewoldt said on Fox Footy But it landed heavy and obviously straight away you start to think about Sam and the situation he finds himself in and his family and those close to him and then you do a little bit of inward reflecting around What more could we have done Riewoldt a long standing captain during Fisher s time at St Kilda from to conceded questions would be asked of the club s leaders and the playing group from that era There have been a lot of Sam s teammates who have done as much as they possibly could myself included and some that have gone to extraordinary levels involving conversations with family and friends and those really close to Sam Riewoldt said As a group I think we did as much as we possibly could for Sam But at a time like this you really realise how out of your depth you are as a teammate when a player is facing challenges of the kind that Sam has faced I understand those questions will come about us and our group and the leadership and all that sort of stuff but you can put your head on the pillow knowing you did das much as you could Riewoldt said he approached the AFL Players Association with his concerns about Fisher but had received a delayed and inadequate response The union has reportedly provided some support to Fisher but details are guarded by confidentiality provisions
