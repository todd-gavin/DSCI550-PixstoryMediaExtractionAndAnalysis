The Journey of an Unsung Hero...... late Bernando Lobo. 
Popularly known as (Kappod) from Igreja ward, Cavelossim, Salcete Goa, Bernardo was a much talented Evergreen Hero, a song composer, a singer, a tiatrist and a musician who used to play the Trumpet, Violin, Saxophone and Melodica with hose. 
He used to write short konkani plays and had written two Dramas which were staged infront of St. Sebastiao Chapel, Saico ward, Cavelossim.
With his heroic roles in konkani Dramas, Bernardo was a charming hero in the village... girls loved his romantic classy hairstyle while his soprano voice in the choir was glorious , giving an understanding of the extent of talent which was God's gift bestowed upon him.
Under the guardianship of late Fr. Druston  and late  Fr. Conceicao  who groomed Bernando in St. Lawrence Church, Agassim, where he grew up, Bernando Lobo exalted with technical ability and  had contributed significantly throughout his humble life.... what one can do beautifullly no matter what the circumstances are.... At this point who can forget Bernando, who risking his life while his family was asleep at that stormy midnight hour he  would respond to the Villagers' knock at his door when the power supply would fail... unmindful of the relentless rain, getting drenched.... those were the Soaking Times. But people's memory is short-lived. However,  immortal life and Unsung Heroes never  die.....
