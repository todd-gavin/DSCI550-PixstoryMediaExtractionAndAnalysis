Patrik Berger

Berger left Liverpool after seven years to join Portsmouth, where he scored one of the Premier
League's most forgotten goals, before moving on to Aston Villa and Stoke.

After retiring from his original club Sparta Prague in 2010, the Czech Republic international
continued to play for amateur side Doln Chabry for several years. He now works as an
ambassador for Liverpool, assisting in the promotion of the club in other nations.

Jamie Redknapp

During his 11 years with Liverpool, Redknapp made over 300 appearances, but injuries and the
development of Gerrard rendered him surplus to needs in 2002.

After a brief stint playing under his father at Southampton, he joined Tottenham on a free
transfer and retired at the age of 31. Since retiring from football, Redknapp has moved into the
world of television, becoming one of Sky Sports' top pundits.

Robbie Fowler

Fowler played two spells at Liverpool, scoring 183 goals in all competitions, before finishing his
career at Muangthong United in 2012. The 45-year-old left Brisbane Roar after a peculiar year
in charge and was named manager of Indian Super League team East Bengal in October 2020.

Michael Owen

At the time of Gerrard's debut, Owen was regarded as one of Europe's finest young prospects,
having recently scored *that* goal against Argentina. After a brief stay at Stoke City, the striker
won the Ballon d'Or three years later, but he peaked too soon and retired at the age of 33 in
2013.
