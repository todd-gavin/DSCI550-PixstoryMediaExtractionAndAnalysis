There will never be enough space to express the thrill I have felt in borrowing his sweaters and button down shirts while pushing the boundaries of understanding myself; the thrill in catching his reflection on my face; the thrill in buying matching olive green caps that summarize so much in so little, “All The World’s A Stage.”

I am so grateful to be navigating this world as his child and committed to creating worlds of survivability for gender nonconforming, intersex, queer and trans youth.
