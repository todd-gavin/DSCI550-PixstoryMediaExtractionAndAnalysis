I really want to share something about why some people tend to hide their pain from other people even their loved ones and it even becomes a habit There can be many reasons why people hide their pain Showing their pain would make others see them as weak and powerless They fear that others will use their pain against them They think i don t want others to risk hurting me more than they already have so I m going to put up a wall between me and them They have lived with this mask of being ohky for so long that taking it off feels weird and unfamiliar They are scared of revealing who they really are to the people around them The thing is on some level we all hide our pain especially from people we are close too But one should understand that if we hide our pain even from people we re close to then the pain will be stuck inside you Think of a piece of rot inside your body silently affecting all other organs That s unaddressed pain whether it s grief loss disappointment regret worry Whereas if we share it nbsp even in limited quantities it slowly starts to heal Everyone have valid reason for not showing their pain to others But when you don t even show it to your loved ones it helps us Your pain deserves to be treated and addressed by the right person Perhaps it s time to lower that mask and stop hiding how much pain you are really in We cannot avoid pain in our lives that s the point of life But we can learn how to deal with it better and sharing it with those we trust is one of the best ways to do that
