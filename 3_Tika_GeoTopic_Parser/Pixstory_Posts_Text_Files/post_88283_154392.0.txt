A picture is worth a thousand words, thatâ€™s my relationship with art. Being a person of few words, I express myself through art. It calms me down. I opted for art in grade nine as a potential career choice. However, contrary to my expectations, my grades in the subject were unsatisfactory. My below par performance affected my self-esteem. The experience disheartened me and affected my performance in other subjects too. However, it also made me realise that pursuing art with boundaries took away for me its most captivating quality- the freedom to express. I soon figured that getting my work judged and marked was unappealing to me. Having an introspective and analytical mind, I then shifted my focus to subjects like psychology and economics. I now view art not as a career choice but as a passion which has helped evolve my personality into one that is logical yet creative.
