Despite being built centuries ago, the Taj Mahal retains its majesty as the world's most beautiful man-made tourist attraction. The Taj Mahal honors India's Mughal ruler Shah Jahan's tremendous love for his beloved wife Arjumand Banu Begum, also known as Mumtaz Mahal or "jewel of the palace" in history. Jahan saw Mumtaz in the bazaar of Agra, where she was selling silks and beads, and the young prince fell madly in love with the Persian noble at first sight. Jahan married Mumtaz in 1612 after a five-year pursuit for her. Mumtaz gave birth to fourteen children for Jahan, however she died after her last delivery due to postpartum problems. Jahan was distraught, and he declared an unusual two-year period of mourning, during which he invited artisans from all across the Muslim world to begin designing an unrivalled monument to his eternal love for Mumtaz. The Taj Mahal, India's most famous landmark, was the outcome. Over the course of 22 years, 20,000 artisans worked alongside 1000 elephants to build the magnificent structure. Truly a wonder! You both look lovely. Have a great trip!
