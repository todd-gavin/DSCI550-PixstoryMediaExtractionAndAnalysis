KABUL: As the world mark International Women's Day this week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has underlined the need to empower women in Afghanistan, saying that they are "not passive bystanders" and should contribute to the future of their country.

Delivering a statement on Women's Rights in Afghanistan, Bachelet said women of this country are often portrayed in the international fora and media as victims. "In fact, Afghan women have - in the face of war, extreme poverty and unspeakable violence and discrimination - been working tirelessly to protect and provide for their families and communities," she said.

The UN rights chief stated how Afghan women have been attacked for speaking up, and excluded from positions of power and decision-making. "They are not passive bystanders."

For this Afghanistan to find peace and progress, Bachelet argued that Afghan women should be active agents for change and be given the space to lead peacebuilding, humanitarian, and development processes.

Girls should be able to go to school and university and be empowered to contribute robustly to the future of their country. Women should be visibly represented in the police force, in courts of law, in government and in the private sector - indeed in every sphere of civic and public life," she said.
