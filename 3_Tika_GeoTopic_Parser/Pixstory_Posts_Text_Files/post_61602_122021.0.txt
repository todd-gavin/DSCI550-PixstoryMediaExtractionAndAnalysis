There was considerable excitement among fans when Triple H was announced as the new head of creative at WWE.

The company's efforts on that front had been severely lacking over the last decade or so, with repetition and laziness taking precedence over innovation and forethought.

The first major event under the direction of The Game, SummerSlam, was met with critical praise for its booking decisions, which included surprise returns, solid pacing, loose commentary and the most chaotic main event in recent memory.

Two days later, WWE Raw gave fans even more reason to be excited about the future under Triple H, thanks to several changes that became apparent early and often:

A second chance for Ciampa on the main roster
There were matches with actual stakes, such as the two Triple Threat bouts that gave way to a No. 1 contender's contest between Ciampa and AJ Styles.
The elevation of the United States Championship by way of those bouts. That title felt infinitely more important than it has in a long time as a result of the focus on crowning a new No. 1 contender.
The tease of future character development and matches suggests there is a direction the creative team is headed rather than making things up as it goes.
Theory was nowhere to be seen after being overexposed for the last two months.
More organic promos, thanks to the loosening of scripted material.
