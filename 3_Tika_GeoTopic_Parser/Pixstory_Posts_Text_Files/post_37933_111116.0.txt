Juventus' star striker has returned to Atletico Madrid after his loan spell at the Serie A club. The Old Lady have reportedly decided not to extend the stay of the Spanish striker, hence not getting him on a permanent deal. 

The Serie A giants signed Dusan Vlahovic in the January transfer window. Hence they are now reportedly looking to build a team around their new number seven. 

The 29-year-old Morata has spent the last two seasons in Turin on loan from La Liga giants Atletico Madrid. He has hit 32 goals for the Bianconeri during a second spell on their books, having previously spent two years with them between 2014 and 2016, but is now heading back to his parent club at Wanda Metropolitano. Alvaro Morata has scored a total of 59 goals in his Juventus tenure over the years for the Italian club. There is no news yet about where Morata could be heading before the 22/23 season kicks off. 

Juventus on the other hand have reportedly focused their attention on Barcelona's Memphis Depay. The Dutch international has gone out of favour at the Spanish club and hence Barcelona are reportedly demanding â‚¬20m to let him leave in the summer. It has to be seen if Depay would end up at Juventus in this transfer window.
