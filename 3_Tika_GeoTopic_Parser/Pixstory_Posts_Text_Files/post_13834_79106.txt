Did anyone really take note of Gustavo Alfaro when he was appointed the Ecuador coach Some even had a feeling that Ecuador South America s most improved football nation in the st century could have gone to a better hand But Alfaro has proved the doubting Thomases wrong Under him Ecuador are hoping to make their fourth World Cup in the last years The bitter memory of not qualifying for Russia despite performing creditably at the start of the qualifiers is still fresh in mind but their Argentine coach is quietly confident about going to Qatar at the end of the year They would have sealed the place with a win against Peru but the draw left them waiting till March We have that feeling that we are practically qualified for the World Cup but we are not yet We have to wait for the March date said the coach with a tone of confidence in his voice In the CONMEBOL qualifiers Brazil continue to lead with points followed by Argentina with and both have already made the cut for Qatar Further behind come Ecuador Uruguay Peru Chile Colombia Bolivia Paraguay and Venezuela It is now hard to believe that till a few years ago Ecuador were considered the minnows of Latin America but once they qualified in there was no looking back In they failed to qualify and Alfaro was very much aware of the disappointment He makes to secret of the fact that he himself had struggled for many years before reaching this position In an interview he said I m years old and rightly or wrongly I ve had to struggle for things Things don t just happen overnight At I was coaching in the second division and convinced that the top flight beckoned but a year later I was down in the third tier Sometimes reality knocks you for six and puts you in your place He would certainly not allow Ecuador get back the tag of being a struggling side
