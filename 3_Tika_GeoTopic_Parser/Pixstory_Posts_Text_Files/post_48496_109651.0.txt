I am ecstatic after today's verdict. This is how the law of a country work. The law protects us, it prevents murder and that's what it did. Hundreds and thousands of babies who might have otherwise died in the womb will now live.

This is crazy that people are mad about it when they should be celebrating but then I guess we all have turned so far away from God that we just can't see light anymore. Babies will live and grow up into beautiful human beings. They deserve a chance at life. And they are getting it. 

Amen! Praise the Lord! So many prayers prayed. May we continue!
