I am glad to see that Ms. Harris is getting her due. Echoing the views of thousands, on Saturday's "Cross Connection," an MSNBC panel praised Vice President Kamala Harris' Poland press conference as a strong statement against Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

According to Fox News, Harris' European tour, during which she attempted to reassure friends about Russia's ongoing assault of Ukraine, was discussed by MSNBC contributor Errin Haines and Pepperdine University professor Nola Haynes. Despite the fact that Harris was chastised for her recent news appearance with Poland's president, both Haines and Haynes thought Harris performed admirably, and rightly so in my opinion. 

Our VP was unbelievably strong and I am glad thst finally people are seeing it! 

Haynes echoed my opinion when she said that “Going back and looking at the transcript between her and the Polish president, I think that the commitments were very clear.” 

“She was assertive. And let’s not forget. This is a woman in the Senate who had senators shook, you know? Who had Bill Barr shook. Like, this woman is very capable, and reading some of these think pieces kind of infantilize her in a way, saying, is she up for it? Can she do it? Of course, she’s up for it. Of course, she can do it."
