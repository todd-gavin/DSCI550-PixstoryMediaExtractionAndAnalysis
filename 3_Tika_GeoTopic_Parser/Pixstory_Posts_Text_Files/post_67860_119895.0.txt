Since its debut at the Commonwealth Games in 1998, hockey has been a mainstay of the event. This time the teams will play at the University of Birmingham Hockey and Squash Centre this year.

Australia has won all six previous tournaments and will look to win their 7th straight gold at the men's event. Meanwhile, New Zealand has a chance to win their second gold medal in the women's event. Hosts England won the bronze medal in both the events in 2018, this time both teams would be aiming for the final.

The two international-standard hockey pitches at the Hockey and Squash Centre were constructed in 2017 as part of a £10 million outdoor facility redevelopment project. They were re-carpeted in preparation for the Games and should provide excellent playing conditions. 

There are plenty of tickets available to watch the hockey at the Commonwealth Games, which begin with the opening ceremony on July 28. 

Prices for group matches range from £8 to £35; semi-finals and bronze medal matches range from £10 to £55; and gold medal matches range from £10 to £80.

The hockey at Birmingham 2022 is available in three price categories. The most expensive tickets, category A, will be in the best location, while categories B and C will be further away from the action. Under-16s can get lower prices in both categories B and C for both the men's and women's events. 

Those wishing to attend the crucial matches must act quickly, as there are few tickets remaining for both the semi-final and the final matches. Though there are many more available tickets for the group matches.
