As the world gears up for Koffee With Karan, everyone is wondering who will be gracing the couch of the reality show in season 7.

It was believed that Sushmita Sen and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan would appear together on the show. However, Karan Johar has now shut down the rumours about the actresses appearing on the show together.

Sushmita Sen and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan competed in the Miss India beauty pageant in 1994. While Aishwarya was a popular name already, owing to her modelling career, Sushmita wasn't as famous. But eventually, she ended up beating Aishwarya for the title of Miss India in 1994. Since then, the actresses have not been seen together on screen.
