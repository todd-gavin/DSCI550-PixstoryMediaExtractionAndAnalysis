As part of the central government's Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav initiative on the platinum jubilee celebrations of India's Independence, nearly 400 school students in Gujarat's Vadodara created a human chain in the shape of ‘75’, to mark 75 years of the country's independence. Last week, Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel led a 'Har Ghar Tiranga' march in Surat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier called upon all citizens to turn the Tiranga campaign into a mass movement by hoisting or displaying the national flag at their homes and using the Tricolour as a display picture on their social media accounts between August 2 and August 15 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India's Independence.
