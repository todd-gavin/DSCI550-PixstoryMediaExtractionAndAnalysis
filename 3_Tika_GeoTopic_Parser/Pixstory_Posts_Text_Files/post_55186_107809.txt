When it comes to self defence Australian snakes are extremely smart About species of terrestrial snakes live on our continent some of which have venom that is more poisonous than any other snake in the world However bites are uncommon in Australia and mortality have been minimal since the development of anti venom with only four to six deaths each year This is in contrast to India for example where bites may reach one million a year with over deaths says Associate Professor Bryan Fry a herpetologist and venom expert at the University of Queensland Snake bites are very very rare in Australia and often the fault of the person being bitten Most bites occur when people are trying to kill a snake or show off As per australiangeopgraphic most snakes would rather slither away from humans than fight them Snakes don t perceive humans as food and they don t aggressively bite things out of malice Their venom is used to subdue prey that would otherwise be impossible for a snake to eat says Dion Wedd curator of the Territory Wildlife Park NT If their only escape route is past a human with a shovel then they are likely to react in the only way they can Prepare for a terrifying show if you re standing between a snake and its escape route
