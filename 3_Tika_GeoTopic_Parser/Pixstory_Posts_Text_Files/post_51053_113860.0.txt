With a cool breezy weather, monsoon comes with a lot of cons as well. The chances of getting bitten by mosquitoes infected with Dengue, Chikungunya or Malaria increases, as they get plenty of places to breed in. Water-borne bacteria and viruses are at an all-time high in places where flooding is a major concern. Everything around us; air, water and food, gets contaminated during monsoons.
