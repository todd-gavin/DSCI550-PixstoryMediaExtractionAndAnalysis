House of the Dragon, the spinoff/prequel to the Game of Thrones, began streaming on HBO Max (and Disney+ Hotstar in India) on Sunday. The first episode had everything that made GoT so popular--sex, violence, and politics. But many critics and viewers felt the spinoff surpassed the original in terms of gore and violence on screen. Now, the show’s director has defended one particular scene that has the viewers talking
The scene in question shows King Viserys (Paddy Considine) and Queen Aemma Arryn (Sian Brooke). The queen is about to give birth to the new heir but the maester informs the king that there are complications. They can only save the child if they tear up queen’s womb, which would end up killing her. What follows is a rather bloody and brutal birthing scene, interspersed with visuals of violence from the celebration tourney being held at the same time. Many viewers termed the scene unpalatable.
Miguel Sapochnik, the show’s director, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter, defending the scene. “Aemma says, ‘The child bed is our battlefield.’ We felt that was an interesting way to explore the fact that for a woman in medieval times, giving birth was violence. It’s as dangerous as it gets. You have a 50/50 chance of making it. Many women didn’t. If given the choice, the father would choose the child over the mother as a cesarean would kill you. It was an extremely violent part of life,” he said.
Miguel, who also worked on Game of Thrones, added that the violence in the scene was necessary and not gratuitous. “We have a number of births in the show and basically decided to give them different themes and explore them from different perspectives the same way I did for a bunch of battles on Thrones, where each time I tried to put a different spin on each so it wasn’t just doing the same thing, as I don’t think putting a bunch of violence onscreen for the sake of violence does any good in the world,” he added.
