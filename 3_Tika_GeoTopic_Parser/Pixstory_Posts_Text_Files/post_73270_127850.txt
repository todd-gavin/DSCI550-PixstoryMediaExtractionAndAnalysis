Time is the thing that we can never compete with or catch it according to ourselves It goes by so fast that you will never notice it until It Ends In our childhood memories in school Times you think that when will the time goes by and we will pass out the school and when that time comes you think that time is so fast I hope that I was still a kid when the college is over and you start working or start planning for your future there will be always a time when you think of your past and child hood to think that time goes really fast So don t waste your time and enjoy it fully love your life
