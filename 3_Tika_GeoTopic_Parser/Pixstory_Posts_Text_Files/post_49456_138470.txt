 Trump s attorneys had contended that a special master typically an outside attorney or former judge was required to ensure an impartial assessment of the documents seized during the search on August They have said that such a review was required in order to filter out any personal information or papers that the FBI had found return them to Trump and separate any documents covered by executive privilege or the attorney client privilege from the remainder of the inquiry The Justice Department argued against the appointment claiming it was superfluous given that it had already evaluated papers that might be private and had narrowed down the number of items that might be protected by attorney client privilege Additionally it stated that because Trump is no longer the president and the records do not belong to him he is not entitled to receive any of the presidential records that were taken back Additionally the department has claimed that discovered personal items contained sensitive information making them potentially useful as evidence
