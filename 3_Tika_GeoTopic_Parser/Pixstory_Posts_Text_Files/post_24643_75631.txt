On rd January the mood at the San Siro was quite contrasting Milan hosted Juventus with only one goal in mind keeping the Scudetto dream alive Juventus on the other hand looked at this fixture as an opportunity to jump up the table into the top The match promised to be a thriller The home side started on the front foot and took the game to the visitors But the Old Lady of Turin were determined to stand firm amid an onslaught by Milanese young guns As Rafael Le o stung the palms of Bianconeri goalkeeper Wojceich Szczesny early on it set the tune which effectively continued for minutes Milan had attempts out of which were on target Juventus kept the Milan attack at bay but their own attacking struggles continued failing to test Mike Maignan in the Rosoneri goal In the end the result was a pretty anticlimactic draw with the teams canceling each other out when it mattered most The draw does not suit either team s ambitions Juventus failed to usurp Atalanta who are still a point ahead occupying the last automatic Champions League qualification spot If La Dea win their game in hand Juventus will be cut adrift in the race for UCL qualification The stalemate also means Milan s hope of a first Serie A title in eleven years suffered a major hiccup The Rosoneri are now points adrift of their city rivals Internazional at the summit having played a game more The kind of form Inter are in right now no one would bet against them winning their game in hand An Inter win would mean a gap of points with games to play a somewhat uncomfortable situation for Milan to be in And with talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovi suffering yet another injury setback the climb upto the summit of the Serie A table is looking like a steep one for the red half of Milan
