I have been a fan of Michael Jordon for decades now and everyday I discover something new about him. 

Now, as per SK, on April 22nd, Michael Jordan's Charlotte Hornets fired head coach James Borrego after four seasons. According to previous rumours, general manager Mitch Kupchak was the driving cause behind Borrego's firing. 

However, according to the newest rumours, Jordan was the one who made the final decision.

This is news to fans like me! 

Jordan was dissatisfied with the team's defence this season, according to Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report. Last season, the Hornets' defence was ranked 16th in the league, but they are now ranked 22nd this season. 

Borrego did help the team's offensive improve, and he guided them to their first winning season since the 2015-16 season. 

Fischer wrote: "League sources had been whispering about Charlotte chairman Michael Jordan's dissatisfaction with the Hornets' lackluster defense, though it's fair to wonder which bench leader could have had greater success on that end of the floor with such a young unit and a roster that is devoid of a trademark rim protector."

Since Jordan became the team's majority owner in 2010, the Hornets are on the lookout for their sixth head coach.

What do you think?
