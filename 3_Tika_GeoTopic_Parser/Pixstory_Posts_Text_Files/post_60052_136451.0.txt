Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, is expected to travel to Delhi beginning on September 5 and meet with a number of opposition members, including Rahul Gandhi of the Congress, in an effort to unite them in opposition to the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
According to Janata Dal (United) officials, Mr. Kumar is also scheduled to meet with Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the AAP and the chief minister of Delhi, as well as other Left figures.
On Saturday and Sunday in Patna, the JD(U) will host its two-day national executive and national council meeting. According to the sources, the party is expected to give Mr. Kumar permission to speak with opposition leaders in order to unite them around one platform for the Lok Sabha elections in 2024.
After breaking ties with the BJP and joining the RJD-Congress-Left alliance to create a new government in the state, this will be Mr. Kumar's first trip to the capital.
Even though he has consistently dodged questions about it, there is growing talk inside his party of giving Bihar's longest-serving Chief Minister a national role as the Opposition's prime ministerial face.
Despite not specifically mentioning the BJP leader, the party's billboards at the location of the two-day meeting pit Mr. Kumar against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their slogans.
