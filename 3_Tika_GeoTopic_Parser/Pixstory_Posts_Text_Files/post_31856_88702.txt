Lombardy is one of the most water-hungry regions with billions of cubic meters of water consumed The crops of the Po Valley, especially rice and maize, are very demanding in terms of irrigation Conflicts over access to water resources risk becoming increasingly difficult to manage if not cultural orientations will change If someone continues to delude himself that we will be able to live with a different climate without changing anything, well, let&#39;s do the math Climate change requires us to review everything starting from the cultivation orientations of the Po Valley and in particular corn which requires enormous quantities of water in the hottest season it must make room for other crops that are less demanding of water resources while efforts need to be intensified to reduce climate-altering gas emissions because the only way we have to lower the fever of the planet comments Damiano Di Simine scientific coordinator of Legambiente Lombardia According to Legambiente it is necessary to safeguard the delicate balance of the water resources of the valleys even with more rigid regulations in the transition phase from the Minimum Vital Outflow to the DE Ecological Outflow which must be established by determining a release which according to the provisions of the European Union will no longer have to be based on the concept of minimum but be suitable for pursuing river quality objectives On the topic Legambiente Lombardia invites to the webinar Ecological outflow in Lombardy on Monday April at Barbara Meggetto and Lorenzo Baio will discuss it, respectively president and deputy director of Legambiente Lombardia with Viviane Iacone former water resources of the Lombardy Region Daniele Demartini and Federica Colombo biologists, experts in monitoring the river fauna of Riverment and Giulio Conte hydrobiologist
