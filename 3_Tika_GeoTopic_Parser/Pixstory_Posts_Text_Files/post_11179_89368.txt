Although progress is being made in the field of neurodiversity the current framework for understanding autism is still mostly focused on how it manifests in boys The British Journal of Psychiatry has released a study that revealed some major abnormalities in connection patterns in the brains of autistic boys and girls functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI images were evaluated in this study and variations between sexes were discovered in the motor language and visuospatial attention systems of the brain These fundamental brain variations reveal sex inequalities among autistic youngsters which could lead to more equitable diagnosis Gender Equality Deserves Appropriate Support Autism manifests itself differently in boys and girls because the symptoms may be milder in females says educational psychologist Roseann Capanna Hodge EdD LPC BCN Autism manifests itself differently in boys and girls because the symptoms may be milder in females so providers need to assess all children for autism regardless of symptom severity According to Capanna Hodge variations in the brain regions of children with autism are associated to the severity of clinical symptoms in behaviour and functioning Boys have more dysfunction in the parts of the brain that control motor visual spatial attention and language she points out that these differences may manifest themselves in outer and more visible behaviours that males exhibit making it simpler to diagnose them with autism The purpose of early diagnosis should always be to better understand and support the needs of the individual not to change or correct neurodivergent traits The goal is happy healthy autistic people always she says The research demonstrates there are key differences in connectivity patterns in the brains of autistic children based on sex Given that marginalized genders continue to be under diagnosed in terms of autism such findings may improve treatment in the future
