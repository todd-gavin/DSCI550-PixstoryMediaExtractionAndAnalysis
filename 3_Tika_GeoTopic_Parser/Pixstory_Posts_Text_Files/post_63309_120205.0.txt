Balance is not a destination, but a constant journey.

You might feel out of balance from time to time, and that's okay. Don't approach it with a perfectionist mentality; accept the good enough.

Setting high expectations can make us lose balance. High- wire artists make progress one step at a time which is why they don't fall - they don't worry about perfect; they only focus on moving forward.

Gain a balanced mindset, prioritise giving time to all
aspects of your life, practice journaling and and spend more time doing activities that bring you joy.

"Stop aiming for it, and you'll find balance"
