Watch this space for a collection of must-read narrativies tracing queerness in climate and space:

Salvadoran born community taught visual artist Johanna Toruño was raised in  San Salvador and displaced in the US at 10. Toruño’s experience with growing up in the aftermath of El Salvador’s civil war, led her to use poster work as “a medium to self express and center a queer migrant lens.” 

“I have a lot to say… Street art is the most natural way for me to express that. It’s how I grew up seeing people share their frustration or their feelings,” Toruño told Teen Vogue.

The Unapologetic Street Series by Toruño is a multi-medium art series centering Queer people of color in public spaces that started in the streets of NYC. Using large-scale political posters with flowers, it means to take up space as a public gallery.

“From the beginning, Toruño’s work has been a deliberate act of rebellion — a challenge to the people that see it to rethink their ideas about race, about love, about identity. And every aspect of it, from the people she highlights to the placement of her posters, is completely intentional. Even her decision to use flowers is a callback to the rich jungle landscape of El Salvador,” Teen Vogue reports.
