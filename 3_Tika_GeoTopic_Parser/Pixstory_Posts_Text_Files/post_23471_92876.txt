Kargil is a regular trading town slightly ramshackle surrounded by apricot orchards It is nestled at the base of this massive mountain which looks more pronounced as we climb up the gently winding road to Humbotingla The setting of the drive is dramatic with this almost black rock feature rising up along like a Grand Canyon wall rugged wild The pass itself looks desolate with these snow covered peaks stretching out in all directions On the other side not far down is this village Still reeling under the wind chill factor which hit us full on when we hopped out of the warm confines of the vehicle freezing our grins semi permanently on our faces like everything around in the warm vehicle once again I can only wonder at the hows whys of the people living in that village The road then descends through this steep narrow ravine hurtling along a mountain stream criss crossing it a village or two clinging onto the steep sides suddenly the road swerves to a side Thank god There is the Indus far far below in a gorge nearly vertical in places So deep so silent yet relentless as it moves on out of India There in this seemingly end of the earth rugged place nestled into a craggy outcrop is this tiny oasis This little Asterix Obelix meet Lord of the Ring elf s village of the Brokpas The village of Darchik Darchik looks like its been pulled out of an Albert Uderzo comic Its a hamlet of handsome people Their origins a mystery One can t help but marvel at the human spirit Why of of all the places in this whole wide world would anyone come carve out literally it seems a life in this isolated narrow deep gorge But these people came now have this fairy tale place complete with green fields apricot trees pretty houses crystal clear little water falls streams rushing to meet the mighty river down below To be concluded
