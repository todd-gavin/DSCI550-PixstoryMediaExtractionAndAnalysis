It’s 2022 and for some reason people are still mad over the representation of same-sex relationships in the media. Pixar’s Lightyear hit theaters last weekend — and it’s bringing out the worst in some folks!

As you probably know, Disney has a long history of controversy surrounding its lack of LGBTQ+ representation. They’ve snuck in tiny glimpses here and there of same-sex couples, such as the alleged lesbian couples fans spotted in Finding Dory and Toy Story 4

Sadly, everyone’s favorite mouse has walked a fine line with gay representation for a long time! So much so, fans have often been left feeling disappointed and underrepresented with the company’s light footwork.

Shortly after the announcement of their newest Pixar flick however, the mass media entertainment company revealed Lightyear would feature a same-sex kiss a huge step in the right direction. 

In March, Florida passed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which took the state in a scary direction for LGBTQ+ rights. Home to Walt Disney World, fans and employees alike quickly took notice of the company’s lack of response to the law which forbids schools from “discussing or promoting topics surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity”. Following a major social media scandal and a HUGE staff walkout, Disney released a statement in support of the LGBTQ+ community. They also decided to reinstate the same-sex kiss scene, opting to take the financial loss. 

Unfortunately, when the kiss scene was brought back, so was the negative attention. People all over the country expressed their bitterness online and one Oklahoma theater brought their ridiculousness to the ticketbooth! The 89er Theatre posted a sign on the front door that said that they would try to fast forward the same sex kiss scene and apologized for the inconvenience. 

Well gays, you heard it here first, your existence is inconvenience for White America
