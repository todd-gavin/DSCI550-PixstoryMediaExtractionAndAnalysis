Emojis are being used more than ever among people of all generations. These make you express your feelings and emotions vividly and at the same time enhance the chatting experience without typing. 
“ 😂” this emoji is one of my favourite 
It means- Shedding tears because of laughing so hard. This emoji also helps to hide real emotions where you’re are actually laughing or not this emoji is best 😉😂

Do tell me in the notes what’s your favourite emoji?
