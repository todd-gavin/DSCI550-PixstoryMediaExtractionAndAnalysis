Jean-Luc Godard chose assisted suicide, which is legal in Switzerland under certain conditions, “as he was stricken with 'multiple invalidating illnesses’,” the family’s legal advisor Patrick Jeanneret told the French newspaper Le Monde. However, Libération, another French newspaper, quoted someone close to the family as explaining the assisted suicide, «Il n’était pas malade, il était simplement épuisé.» (He was not sick, he was simply exhausted”). Thank you GP Ramachandran for alerting me about this. One shudders to think what could happen if assisted suicide—which may well be desperately needed in some cases—were to be available in India and if it were OK to go if one is “simply exhausted.”
