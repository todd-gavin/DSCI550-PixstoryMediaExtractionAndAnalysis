Arsenal finish yet another season without having tasted Champions League football. This
year, it was Tottenham's turn to join the big three in Europe's top tier competition. The
Gunners, having competed well under Mikel Arteta fell through at the final barrier. The
second half of their season did not come without troubles of inconsistency and bouts of
panic but they made their way through to the final gameweeks with top four a serious
possibility.

The likes of Manchester United on the other hand were reeling way below in seventh,
competing even for the newly built Uefa Europa conference league. Arsenal were on a
brilliant run of four consecutive victories over Chelsea, Manchester United, West Ham and
Leeds. The two games that followed were Newcastle and Spurs away from home and in
classic Arsenal fashion, Arteta's side threw their progress away with two flat performances.

Ex-captain Pierre Emerick Aubameyang spoke of the Gunners' failed pursuit for Champions
League football.

“I think they made a lot of improvements and I’m a bit sad because I wanted to catch them in
the Champions League. I have a lot of friends over there."

Aubameyang now plies his trade with Football Club Barcelona.

“But I’m wishing them all the best for next season and obviously, I think it’s going to be a
good thing for them to get back to the Europa League as well. Hopefully, they can win it.”
Aubameyang concluded.

The Gabonese left North London on the back of a disastrous spell and several internal
problems with the club's backroom staff.

Arsenal are undoubtedly a club in transition, with
young and exciting potential paving the way through for the team to achieve more and more
in the years that follow.
