Stephen Wardell Curry, the two-way player! Curry hasn’t had the best regular-season thus far. He’s averaged 25.5 ppg in the regular season and shot 38% from beyond the arc. This isn’t his best season for sure, with the lowest 3-point percentage of his career and not having the best scoring performance, but that hasn’t stopped him from helping in a very unexpected area, DEFENSE! Man’s become a god on defense!! Okay maybe not a god-like green but time and again I’ve seen him have soo many crucial defensive stops that I can’t even mention all of them. But let’s talk about something more important than the start of the season, the end, the FINALS! Curry is averaging 31.5 in his two games, with a 3-point percentage of 46.2!!! Even with all the double and triple teams he has still put on a crazyy scoring performance and has and will help his team to end up winning the series and for sure get the FINALS MVP, WARRIORS IN 6!
