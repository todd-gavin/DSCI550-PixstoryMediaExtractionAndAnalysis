Ah who can e er forget so fair a being Who can forget her half retiring sweets God she is like a milk white lamb that bleats For man s protection Surely the All seeing Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing Will never give him pinions who intreats Such innocence to ruin who vilely cheats A dove like bosom In truth there is no freeing One s thoughts from such a beauty when I hear A lay that once I saw her hand awake Her form seems floating palpable and near Had I e er seen her from an arbour take A dewy flower oft would that hand appear And o er my eyes the trembling moisture shake John Keats
