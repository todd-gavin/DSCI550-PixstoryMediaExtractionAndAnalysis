 Waking up to a new sunrise Looking back from the other side I can see now with open eyes Darkest water and deepest pain I wouldn t trade it for anything Cause my brokenness brought me to you And these wounds are a story you ll use So I m thankful for the scars Cause without them I wouldn t know your heart And I know they ll always tell of who you are So forever I am thankful for the scars Now I m standing in confidence With the strength of your faithfulness And I m not who I was before No I don t have to fear anymore So I m thankful for the scars Cause without them I wouldn t know your heart And I know they ll always tell of who you are So forever I am thankful for the scars I am in love with this song This is so peaceful and nice and hopeful Makes you feel like all of the struggle and pain is worth it in the end Because it makes you who you are
