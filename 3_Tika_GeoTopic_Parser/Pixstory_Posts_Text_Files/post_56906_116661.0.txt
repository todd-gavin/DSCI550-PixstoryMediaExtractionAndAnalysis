Before you dive into your makeup routine, always start with skincare. A good moisturizer can help create a smooth, even canvas for makeup. A great under-eye cream may (over time) minimize how much concealer you use under your eyes and immediately help your makeup go on smoother. A purifying cleanser may help clear your skin, so you eventually feel comfortable wearing lighter foundations.

The next step is primer. The best way to ensure that your makeup stays put all day long is to use a great, skin-illuminating primer.

Try a BB cream or tinted moisturizer over foundation for the third step.

Once you're happy with your base makeup, it's time to boost your natural makeup look by building dimension. Add dimension with highlighter and blush.

Define your eyes with a nude eyeshadow palette.

Then finish off your look with a quick swipe of mascara.
