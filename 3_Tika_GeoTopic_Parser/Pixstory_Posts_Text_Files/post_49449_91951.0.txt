All breeders fuel animal overpopulation crisis. Every time someone buys a puppy or kitten instead of adopting from an animal shelter, needy animals lose their opportunity of finding a home and are euthanized. Many breeders don't require every puppy or kitten to be spayed or neutered prior to purchase, allowing the animals they sell to have litters of their own, resulting in even more animals filling homes that could have gone to animals from sheltersâ€”or who will end up in animal shelters or so-called "no-kill" animal warehouses.

Producing animals for sale is a greedy and callous business in a world where there is a critical and chronic shortage of good homes for dogs, cats, and other animals, and the only "responsible breeders" are those who spay or neuter their animals and quit the business altogether after learning how they contribute to the overpopulation crisis.

Producing more animals, whether for profit or to achieve a specific "look" or attribute, is also destructive to the animals that are bred. Dogs and cats don't care if their physical appearance meets a judge's requirements, yet they are the ones who suffer as a result of humans' manipulation. Inbreeding causes debilitating hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, heart defects, skin disorders, and epilepsy in "purebred" dogs and cats. Animals are distorted for specific physical characteristics, which leads to serious health issues. Bulldogs and pugs, for example, have short, pushed-up noses that make activity and even normal breathing difficult for them. Pugs' eyes are so popped out it hurts all the time. The lengthy spinal columns of Dachshunds frequently cause back problems, particularly disc disease.

There's nothing that is ethical about breeding pets.
