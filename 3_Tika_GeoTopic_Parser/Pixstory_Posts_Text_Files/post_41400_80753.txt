U S short track speedskater Kristen Santos was just two laps away from achieving her lifelong athletic dream standing on the podium of Olympics She almost had it all with the prize money media tour and the obvious fame that came with the lifelong tag of Olympic medalist Two measly laps However luck was not in her favour Considering short track speed skating is an inherently brutal and dangerous sport wherein the win of the fastest is not always guaranteed sometimes things may not go as one expects regardless or grit and determination of the athletes USA Today reported the happenings on Friday Italy s Arianna Fontana bumped into Santos on an attempted pass in the meter final sending them both careening into the boards At this point of time there was nothing Santos could do but accept it She had been sitting in third place The crash knocked her to fourth A judge later ruled that Fontana a time Olympic medalist was to blame for the collision The Italian was penalized and awarded fifth The Olympics are a tough feat where no one is given second chances An unfortunate accident cost Santos a huge loss Even when there is no guarantee that Santos would have managed to win a medal if the collision didn t happen one wonders what could have been the result However Santos is not the one to lose hope She said Of course the situation for lack of a better word it sucks But like I said it s part of the sport It sucks But I m not mad at anyone Just sad Image source USA Today
