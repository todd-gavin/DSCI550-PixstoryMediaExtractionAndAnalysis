On the Grasshopper and Cricket
BY JOHN KEATS
The Poetry of earth is never dead:    
  When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,    
  And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run    
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;    
That is the Grasshopper’s—he takes the lead      
  In summer luxury,—he has never done    
  With his delights; for when tired out with fun    
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.    
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:    
  On a lone winter evening, when the frost     
    Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills    
The Cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever,    
  And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,    
    The Grasshoppers among some grassy hills.

 He uses two insects the grasshopper and the cricket to bring out the beauty of nature in the poem. The poem embodies the truth that every being big or small balances our nature and adds to its beauty.
The poem has fourteen lines and it can be divided into one octet and one sestet, following the Petrarchan sonnet form. It has an ABBA rhyme scheme and it is written in iambic pentameter.  Furthermore, the main theme in ‘On the Grasshopper and Cricket’ is nature and its eternal delight and its persistent presence.
