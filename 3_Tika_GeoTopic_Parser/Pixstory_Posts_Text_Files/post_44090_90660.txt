The World Cup qualifying play offs are determined in one off matches according to Leonardo Bonucci After a surprising defeat to North Macedonia in their play off match last week Italy missed out on a ticket at the tournament in Qatar Despite remaining undefeated throughout the round Italy was relegated to the play offs after finishing second in their group behind Switzerland We played it all in a one off match it s an absurd system the defender told reporters Unfortunately that s the way it went but it s a crazy decision You have to play a single game in which anything can happen as we have seen There are teams that qualified after losing four or five games we are at home after losing only one in the nd minute It is truly madness Clearly the regulation is not an alibi or an excuse we certainly had to do better But from here we have to take inspiration to find the way back to where we were There were many reflections Certainly after Euro we got a bit lost This compromised our path to the World Cup Bonucci believes that putting the former Inter and Manchester City manager in charge is the proper decision to get the Euro winners back on track What Mancini has given us in these three years has been unique he said An empathy has been created that was rarely seen in Coverciano for us to continue with him is only a logical consequence His ideas and human value are not discussed then a game can change visions but those who live in this environment every day just want to continue this path He added The hours after the elimination were really hard we found ourselves with our mouths closed and in silence at lunch and in the changing rooms We tried to play it down with the younger players saying that they will have other opportunities then Mancini spoke and we reconnected to the present and the future We have to start again to rebuild the bases to make a great ascent are there
