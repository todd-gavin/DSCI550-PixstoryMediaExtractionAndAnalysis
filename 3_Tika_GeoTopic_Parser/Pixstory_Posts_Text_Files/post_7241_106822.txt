Statement By Neelam Krishnamoorthy continues In the most recent fire at the Mundka in Delhi on Friday th May precious lives were lost because the owner occupiers had violated every rule of the book with impunity Each man made tragedy such as the ones mentioned earlier represents man s never ending greed and intentional violation of public safety laws It would also be pertinent to analyse if any punishment at all was meted out to the perpetrators of such unpardonable crimes The answer is bound to be shameful and distressing We request the Government to look into the possibility of bringing in new legislation to deal with man made disasters and set up Fast Track Courts to expedite such cases so that the perpetrators are punished swiftly and in accordance with law This will send a strong signal to the owners and occupiers of public spaces like multiplexes malls educational institutions hospitals etc not to violate fire safety laws In the last years AVUT has fought valiantly for accountability and safety in public spaces Despite this are public spaces safe today NEELAM KRISHNAMOORTHY President
