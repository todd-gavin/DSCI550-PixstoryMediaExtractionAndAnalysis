With the Gunners partnering with Pixstory to battle online hate, I thought it would be a great time to share my top 5 supporters of the team! Just how football can bring people from all backgrounds and thought processes together is incredible to say the least!
The Queen of England: Cesc Fabregas once had a conversation with the First Lady of England and he told Spanish radio: “It seems the Queen follows football, and she told us she was an Arsenal fan. She appeared to definitely know who I was, and we exchanged a few special words.”
Prince Harry: Prince Harry is a big Arsenal Fan. Seems like it runs in the family! Along with His Highness, his grandmother, The late Queen Mother and like I told above his mother, The Queen of England, both support the North London team, continuing a family tradition of loyalty for the Gunners. Except, Prince Williams. He is said to be an Aston Villa fan.
Robert Pattinson: Pattinson openly declares his affinity for Arsenal of the Premier League. In a 2011 interview with Metro, the London native admitted that the Gunners were his favourite team, stating: "I miss reading the sport section [of English newspapers]. I miss the football... Arsenal."
Mick Jagger: The Rolling Stones frontman, a performer as well as an Arsenal supporter, nevertheless makes the trip to see the Gunners play whenever he can despite being the age he is!!
Osama Bin Laden: The al-Qaeda leader was a well-known Arsenal supporter and is even known to have been present for the Gunners' incredible run to the 1993–1994 European Cup Winners' Cup final. He was so entranced by George Graham that he bought Abdullah, his eldest son, an Ian Wright duplicate shirt.
