The idea that Curry was supposed to be picked by the New York Knicks is something that constantly makes Knicks supporters anger flare The team had promised to recruit him but instead passed him up allowing the Warriors to swoop in and grab him Needless to say the Knicks made a tremendous error Curry made things harder for Knicks fans today when he answered questions ahead of the NBA Finals When I got drafted I thought I was going to New York I didn t even have Golden State on my radar Curry said Curry reminded the world of how he was meant to be playing in the Mecca of basketball while reminiscing about his time in Golden State Sigh when I say bad decision I mean bad decision It s so hard to be a Knicks fans when they act so stupid i swear to god
