Ten years from now Paulina imagines herself moving back to Poland to mentor young athletes by guiding them through their football journey I would really want to use this experience to give them a chance to have an even bigger career than mine Although the initial transition from playing in the Polish League to the rigorous routine of playing in big games every week with PSG was a bit stressful Paulina has adapted her ability to stay calm by trusting in the process of her practice I try to relax with music sometimes talk with the girls about the game and it makes it easy now it s much easier the defender says If the athlete could travel back in time she would tell herself to take a step back from thinking about what the future could hold and to instead focus on the small things which ultimately add up to making a big player I know it s simple and it s like easy to say Paulina says But everyday you have to do small steps and just do your job have character and yeah luck The importance of prioritizing rest outside the field can have a big impact on an athlete s ability to give their percent to their training Reading books taking French lessons getting coffee from the closest caf and expanding her knowledge on sports through studies helps Paulina focus on the simple things in life The athlete s hard work backed by the support of people who believe in her has been living proof of what can be accomplished with confidence in oneself I play actually every game so it showed me if you really want to be a big player and you put your effort and you meet good people and you have a little bit of luck then you can be a main player for one of the biggest in Europe Paulina says
