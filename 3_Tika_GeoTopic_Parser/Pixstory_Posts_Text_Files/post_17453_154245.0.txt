Lionel Messi-less PSG settle for 0-0 draw against Reims as Sergio Ramos registers 28th career Red CardLionel Messi-less Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) got down to ten-man in their 0-0 draw against Reims after defender Sergio Ramos was sent-off for dissent. Ramos was shown his 28th career Red-Card in PSG's Ligue 1 clash against Reims but the defending champions managed to stay unbeaten. PSG looked disjointed and pedestrian after making five changes to the side that drew with Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday. Neymar, Vitinha and Achraf Hakimi were reserves while Lionel Messi was rested after a calf knock against Benfica. Reims created problems by pressing high up the pitch and had the better chances in the first half. Zimbabwe midfielder Marshall Munetsi forced goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma into a diving save with a shot on the turn in the 35th."I will talk with the players because a lot of games are coming up and we need the maximum number of players," PSG coach Christophe Galtier said."Missing games because of stupid suspensions and stupid bookings, we must fix that."Kosovo winger Arber Zeneli was a thorn in the side of PSG. He made a cross for Alexis Flips, whose sliding effort was blocked by Danilo in the ninth minute. Zeneli nutmegged Fabian Ruiz to fire an angled strike that Donnarumma parried in the 52nd. Despite a mediocre performance, PSG nearly won.Kylian Mbappe curled a shot that goalkeeper Yehvann Diouf saved by making himself big in the 33rd. Mbappe and Neymar lost their nerve in stoppage time when they were booked for fouls.
