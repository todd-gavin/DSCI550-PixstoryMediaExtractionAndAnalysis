Grandparents are really important in our lives They love us more than anything in this world They ll love you more than they love their own child I lost my father side grandparents when I was very young so I don t remember much about them but I m very much attached to my mother s side grandparents my Nanu and Nani I lost my Nanu in but I miss him each and everyday If something big happens in my life any day i only remember him and tell my mother Nanu hote to kitne khush hote aj But it s not in our hand to save someone because we love them But I have seen many people who just abandon their grandparents so easily like I don t understand how why They love you like no one else but some people treat them like a trash But nbsp my Nanu and Nani means the whole world to me And yes guys my Nani make world s best Mango and Radish pickle
