Well, no one has asked for it but still maybe this helps you as it helped me today.
We all are involved in making our life better either by doing something we like or something we dislike.
But here is a reminder to let yourself know that life is short and so is the lifespan of our dreams, choose what you like and love then put all your energy into it.
Don't forget to be grateful.
You'll see the change, the most needed change!!
