Unlike the Taliban who celebrated Sunday as the first day of Eid al Fitr A number of Afghan citizens from different parts of the country told Afghanistan International that they also fasted on Sunday Reacting to the Taliban declaration Mohammad Mohaqiq a religious scholar said that the basis for deciding on Eid al Fitr is the new moon and that the most accurate and reliable way to renew the moon is to use modern technology that can correctly calculate and show results According to Mr Mohaqiq today there are advanced satellites and tools related to space and cosmic observations and in these circumstances resorting to primitive methods and doing so with the naked eye is wrong The absence of Muslims on such a simple and trivial issue is a disgrace to one and a half billion people in the world today Mohammed Mohaqiq stressed The group announced Sunday as the first day of Eid al Fitr based on a decision by the Crescent Vision Committee The former head of the Ulema Council of Afghanistan has said that the moon has not been seen in countries armed with technology and astronomical observatories but in Afghanistan which is a mountainous and toolless country the Taliban say the moon has been seen With the exception of Afghanistan only two countries Mali and Niger located in West Africa have declared Eid today Saudi Arabia and many other Islamic countries have announced that Monday is Eid al Fitr This is the first time that Eid al Fitr is celebrated in Afghanistan one day earlier than in Saudi Arabia However a large number of Afghans are said to have fasted today in the face of the Taliban There have been reports of Taliban members arresting a number of fasters today and forcing them to eat in some places Responding to the group s critics the deputy Taliban spokesman said Those who attributed the Afghan jihad to the Arabs and insulted all the Arabs under this pretext are today blaming the Islamic Emirate for not following the Arabs on the issue of Eid Islam has never said to follow the Arabs in fasting and Eid
