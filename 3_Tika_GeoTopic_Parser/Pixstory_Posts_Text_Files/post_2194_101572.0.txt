Voting is on for the elections to the Press Club of India (PCI). 

This time, a keen contest is being witnessed as four panels and many independents are in the fray. 

The polls had become highly polarised with panels accusing each other of being either right-centric or left-centric. 

The counting of votes will take place tomorrow.
