Ramesh Bais, the governor of Jharkhand, received the Election Commission's opinion on the mining lease dispute on Thursday. As an outcome, CM Hemant Soren is no longer a member of the Assembly. The BJP had sought to have him removed from his position as a lawmaker because they claimed he extended a mining lease to himself. This morning, the opinion was sent in a sealed envelope to the Jharkhand Raj Bhavan. Bais will soon make the opinion public. He had brought up the issue with the election panel.
The chief minister of Jharkhand's team, however, had claimed before the election panel that the clauses of the election law, which he has been charged with breaking, do not apply in this particular instance.
BJP, the petitioner in the matter, responded after Soren's legal team wrapped up their presentation to the Election Commission on August 12. The poll panel received the two parties' written submissions on August 18.

"For almost two hours, they argued. After that, we responded, demonstrating that there is a conflict of interest and that a number of Supreme Court decisions apply to this (case), "Following the August 12 hearing before the Election Commission, BJP attorney Kumar Harsh spoke to reporters.
