What I found in Indian squad for t20 wc
●Chahar, Shreyas and Shami got no place.
●both wicketkeepers Rishabh and Kartik are kept in team.
●No chance that Virat Kohli will open.
●Harshal and Bumrah back that means Bhuvi will out of playing 11
●It's quite surprising to take 3 spinner in 15 for Australia.
