In a normal season, Devin Booker might warrant significant MVP consideration. The Phoenix guard is averaging 27 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game. He’s boosted his 3-point accuracy to 38 percent. He kept the league’s best team humming when Chris Paul was injured.

As the Suns’ Twitter account noted, the 12 previous players in league history to average at least 25-5-5 for the team with the best record all won MVP. But this is not a normal season. Booker won’t even finish in the top three.

That analysis is nothing against Booker, who is enjoying a spectacular season; instead, it’s a means of illustrating the absurdity of this MVP race. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Joel Embiid, and Nikola Jokic—presented in that order alphabetically, not by MVP worthiness—are all playing above and beyond the MVP norm, and with a week to go, every game they play seems to tilt the race in one direction or another.

Perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate their historic dominance is to look at the all-time Player Efficiency Rating leaderboard. Right now, Jokic and Antetokounmpo would each set a new single-season PER record—breaking Giannis’s mark from 2019-20—while Embiid ranks 16th. No other season in league history has more than one player in the top 20.

Their superlative performances make for a close MVP race—rendering it an anomaly in recent history. If we define a “close” MVP voting result as one in which the runner-up places first on at least half as many ballots as the winner, then we find 10 close races since 1980-81 (the first year that media voted for the award, as opposed to fellow players).
