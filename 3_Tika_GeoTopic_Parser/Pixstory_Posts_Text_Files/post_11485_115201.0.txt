Kale chips
Kale is incredibly healthy, as it’s loaded with fiber and antioxidants like beta carotene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.

It’s also a good source of minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus. It has a lower level of oxalic acid, an anti-nutrient that impairs calcium absorption, than many other leafy greens.

Pairing kale with olive oil not only makes more delicious and crispy chips but also a more balanced and filling snack.
