Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came under fire by Democrats and the media when they accused him of politicizing voter access following devastating impacts of hurricane Ian DeSantis signed an emergency executive order which allowed for expanded mail in voting in three counties that were hit hard by the hurricane Charlotte Lee and Sarasota County The reason for the criticism is that these three counties lean or are overwhelmingly Republican Thus by expanding voter access to them Republicans would have an easier time winning their elections The media noted that Orange County which had historic flooding and is overwhelmingly Democratic was not given the right to expanded mail in voting
