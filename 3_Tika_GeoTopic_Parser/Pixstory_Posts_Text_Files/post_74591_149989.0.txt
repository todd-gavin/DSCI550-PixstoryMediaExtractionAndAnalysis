Falguni Pathak has said that she is comfortable with her songs being recreated. Recently, Neha recreated Falguni's iconic song Maine Payal Hai Chhankai, following which the latter had expressed her disappointment. In a new interview, Falguni said she is fine with her songs getting adapted, but they should be done well and not spoilt. 😱😱😱😱When she was asked if she watched Neha's new version, Falguni said that she did not, but added she will watch it. She said that it will be the 'first thing' she will do. She also responded to if she was okay with her songs getting recreated, "Adapt karo lekin acchi tarike se karo. Remixes ban rahe hai aajkal aur acche bhi ban rahe hai jo humlog bhi stage pe gaate hai. Lekin usko acchi tarah se use karo na. Tum usko faltu kyu bana dete ho (Adapt but do it well. There are so many remixes being made well and even we sing it on stage. But do it well. Why do you spoil it)?” 😱😱😱😱✅Speaking on her song Maine Payal Hai Chhankai, Falguni said, "I think the song came out in 2000 and till date, it is really fresh. Even when I perform the song now, people give us the same reaction and love that they had on the first day. 💯Usko recreate karo, usme alag rhythm do, make it modern lekin achi tarike se karo na. Uski jo beauty hai, jo simplicity hai usko mat touch karo (Do recreate it, give it a different rhythm, make it modern but do it well. Don't touch the beauty and simplicity of the song)."💯💯💯💯
