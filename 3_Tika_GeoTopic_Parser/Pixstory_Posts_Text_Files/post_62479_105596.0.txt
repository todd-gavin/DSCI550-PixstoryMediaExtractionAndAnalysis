Atropa belladonna, more popularly known as deadly nightshade. The plant appears to be harmless, with green leaves and a height of up to 4 feet. The blackberries of the nightshade have a glossy sheen, and the reddish-brown, sometimes purple flowers have lovely bell forms. From the looks of them, they look like they belong in one of those barbie movies we used to watch. But like the wise men say, looks can be deceiving. And this case, they are. These gorgeous shiny sweet-looking berries are hard to resist, especially when you're hungry. But do remember what exactly they can do to you. A human child can be killed by eating merely two to four berries. An adult can be killed by eating eight to ten berries. Even one leaf chewed can result in a dirt nap. Delirium and hallucinations are milder signs of lethal nightshade poisoning that develop immediately after ingestion. If you don't have access to a hospital and have lethal nightshade poisoning, it will be a difficult battle, if not a losing one. Horses, cattle, and rabits consume them, but cats and dogs will die if they eat them so make sure you keep your pets away from these just as much as you'd keep your kids away from it.
