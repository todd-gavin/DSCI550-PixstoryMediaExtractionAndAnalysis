It is with heavy hearts that we share the peaceful passing of our sweet girl After a scare and a full vet workup they told us what we already knew her heart was just a little too big But medically speaking it was inhibiting the flow of oxygen to her lungs We did everything we could but her kidneys couldn t keep up with the medication Adopting her at age with no teeth one eye a dislocated jaw broken tail and torn ear we knew deep down that we wouldn t have long with her Maybe that s why we loved her as hard as we did I ll never forget picking her up and seeing the little grey haired dog looking up excitedly at us with one eye tongue hanging out tail wagging Mushu was the eternal optimist always running outside to lounge in the grass in any sliver of sunshine she could find She eagerly greeted us at the door every single day basked in the glory of mealtime rolled with our ever expanding family and happily pranced up and down the hallway throughout the day traveling at a bit of a diagonal as she went because of her missing eye When she lost her hearing she sniffed more If she bumped into things she brushed it off and kept going if someone bumped into her she never let it change her love for them We ll never know what Mushu s life was before she came to us with all of her sweet physical quirks and tender personality What we do know is that she always found the sunshine even on the cloudiest of days She taught us so much about unconditional love and resilience We will miss her cheery personality her sloppy kisses the sound of her barking for dinner every day starting at pm and snoring loudly in between our heads at night To anyone contemplating adopting a senior dog do it Their capacity to love teach and cuddle is unmatched We love you Mushu you were always meant to be ours and us yours
