Good morning beautiful people today I want to shed light on a recent story that touched me and also made me think of what we strive for on this platform and what a safe haven is all about Inspiring social media post motivates North Carolina man to donate kidney to a stranger In Chris Perez Steve Sanders found a kidney donor and a friend Sanders has a rare genetic disease that caused his kidneys to slowly start failing Friends and relatives were tested to see if they could donate a kidney to Sanders but no one was a match Last July Perez director of volunteer services at Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte North Carolina learned about Sanders story through a social media post I didn t know him but thought let s give this a try I would want someone to do this for me Perez said He ended up being a match for Sanders and when they spoke on the phone for the first time we hit it off right away Sanders said Soon they were regularly spending time together and with their families Their surgeries were in January and both recovered well Sanders said it means everything to me that a stranger donated his kidney to him and shows Chris commitment to being a father and allowing me the same chance
