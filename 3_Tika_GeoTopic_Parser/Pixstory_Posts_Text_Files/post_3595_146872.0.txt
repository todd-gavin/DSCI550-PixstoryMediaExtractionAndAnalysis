Like any other big day for news television, Aaj Tak has yet again proved its mettle without resorting to any external interferences including the landing pages.
On the day when the entire country was glued to their TV screens to watch the breathtaking event – the demolition of the Noida twin towers – Aaj Tak’s performance was true to one of its brand identities – Khabar Matlab Aaj Tak.
The 100-metre tall towers were razed at 2.30 PM on Sunday, August 28, 2022, amidst hundreds of cameras deployed to capture and telecast the moment live.
A communication sent by Aaj Tak on the next day claimed to garner more than twice concurrent viewers of the nearest competitors on their YouTube feeds. The channel reached a peak of 8 lakh viewers across its multiple feeds.
