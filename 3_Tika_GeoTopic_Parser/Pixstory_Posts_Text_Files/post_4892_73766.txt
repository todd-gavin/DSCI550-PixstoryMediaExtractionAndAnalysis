With the Omicron scare and third wave also having suffered from covid previously this time I was too careful I made sure to stay inside and didn t even step out a single day the maximum I went out was to the balcony but Covid still got me It started with a body ache I thought it might be normal flu but within days the symptoms felt more prominent My symptoms were shouting it s Covid Covid but I wanted to be sure Although antigen kits don t give accurate results but I still tested positive and testing positive on an Antigen means POSITIVE I got an Covid upgrade the only thing I felt relieved about was that I ll get immunity On the first day irrespective of having symptoms I made broccoli soup Personally I don t really feel inclined towards cooking but being sick motivated me to cook and not put a burden on mom because I saw her health being more fragile than mine The soup turned out to be delicious and that somehow has motivated me to cook more often This time I was more productive I tried to study and also help in chores and stay awake unlike last time when I was sleeping throughout the day What was relieving to know that my grandmother who s a heart patient and years old is asymptomatic The virus affected my mom the most she lost her sense of taste which was little worrisome I googled symptoms of Omicron and loss of taste wasn t one for them The concern was what if it s Delta and not Omicron but thanks to ToufiqRashid she asked me to keep calm and do whatever is required to do during Covid My brother who just turned two months back got his first jab last month We were a little worried about him but except for the first two days he was fine to be continued
