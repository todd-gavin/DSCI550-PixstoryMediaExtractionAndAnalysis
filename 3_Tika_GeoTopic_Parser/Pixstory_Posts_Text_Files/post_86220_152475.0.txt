Yes or yes
Sometimes, when we are presented with new opportunities, we are engaged in a dilemma. The veil of uncertainty engulfs our mind. 
We ask ourselves , "Yes or No?"
However, go for it. The outcome may not be desirable but the process is worth the try and you are learning. 
It is not a "Yes or No" situation. Rather, it is more of aÂ  "Yes or yes" situation.
