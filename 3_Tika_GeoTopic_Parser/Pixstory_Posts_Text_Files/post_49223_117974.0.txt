Producer-singer-songwriter, Benny Blanco is set to do a collaborative project with rapper Snoop Dogg and four of BTS' members â€“ Jimin, Jungkook, Jin and V. According to Big Hit Music, Blanco's third full-length album, which is scheduled to be released later this year, will include the song "Bad Decisions," which will be released on August 5.

Through a video that was uploaded to his Twitter account on Wednesday, Blanco further teased the song. He confessed wanting to be a part of the band, to which BTS members in unison said no. However, Jimin suggested they did a project together and Blanco agreed excitedly.

"The collaboration was accomplished as Blanco offered to do so," the agency said. "Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook will show a new side that has not been shown before, as well as their unique vocal skills through the special collaboration project."
