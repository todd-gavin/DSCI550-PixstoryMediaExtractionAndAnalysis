A video clip of police officers lathi-charging several people seemingly in front of a temple has gone viral with the claim that Kolkata policemen are beating up the Kanwar Yatra pilgrims at the command of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. The video has a Hindi text superimposed on it which reads “बंगाल में ममता सरकार के आदेशानुसार कावरियों (कांवरियों) पर प्रेम बरसाती पुलिस”.

The Kanwar Yatra is the pilgrimage of the devotees of the Hindu deity Shiva (also known as Kanvaria) to various places sacred to them. This pilgrimage is held annually during July and August.

The video has been shared on Twitter with the same claim. Twitter user shallakaul shared the video and garnered 40.2K views and almost 3000 likes.

This video has also been shared multiple times on Facebook with the same claim.

Fact-check
On a closer examination of the video, one can hear Bengali being spoken in the background, thus suggesting that the video clip is likely from West Bengal. Taking this as a clue, we performed a keyword search on Twitter and found several posts from August 2021, claiming that the video had been filmed outside the Bhootnath Temple in Kolkata. The official Twitter handle of BJP West Bengal (@BJP4Bengal) too had shared the clip in 2021.

Upon a subsequent search on Google using relevant keywords, we found that TV9 and various media outlets had reported on this issue. According to a report by Dainik Jagran dated August 16, 2021, all the major temples in the city had opened, however, due to certain COVID-19 restrictions at the time, the Bhootnath temple remained closed. CM Mamata Banerjee had extended the COVID-related restrictions with a few relaxations until August 30, 2021. Despite this, the devotees had gathered outside the temple and were consequently lathi-charged by the police. It is important to note that none of the news reports had described the devotees as Kanwar Yatra pilgrims.
