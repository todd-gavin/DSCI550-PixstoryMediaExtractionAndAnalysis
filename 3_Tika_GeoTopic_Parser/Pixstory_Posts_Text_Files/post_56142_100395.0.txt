‌Junk food is a slur of the 1950s and Junk food is actually food that is high in calories from sugar and/or fat, and possibly also sodium, but with little dietary fibre, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value. The definition often varies at different times some used to refer to it as oily food or non-homemade food. Why are people making a fuss about this food? We make food at home that too contains high carbs and oil content. We don't always choose to grill.
‌
‌ Banning Junk Food is never practical,! You can ban junk food from school but not in the market, rather doing so will lead to students smuggling such foods from outside.
‌
‌A crucial part of education is learning to make good choices. An across-the-board junk-food ban does not teach young people how to make healthy choices; it barely removes some of their options. It is always a choice of a person to whatever they want and how they want to be. Some people choose to be happy and food makes them happy. It is very convenient for children as they can forget their lunch and still have food once in a while and many students don't have time or people at home to make food and this is their only option. 
‌
‌Instead of putting restrictions, the school should teach a student the harmful effects of such foods and also encourage students to exercise to remain healthy.
