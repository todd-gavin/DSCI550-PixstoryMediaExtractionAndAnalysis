There is a lot of doubt among Chelsea fans after seeing that the club is reportedly going to bid Million euros for young Anthony Gordon including million in add ons Most people who haven t seen Gordon play would day that this is a lot of money for someone who doesn t even have goal contributions in the premier league They are not wrong it is a lot of money for Anthony But Why do Chelsea want to sign him But the player has a lot of potential He is a pacy winger who dribble across defenders with ease His defensive stats are even better He doesn t stop pressing the opponent players throughout the match The only problem he has is his finishing But you have to keep in mind that he is just years old The new Chelsea owner is trying to buy two types of players since he has come in Koulibaly and Sterling were to improve the team for the near future On the other hand he signed Chukewmeka Cucurella Casadei and Gabreil Slonnia for the future There was some news saying that the owner and Tuchel want to buy good young players with high potential who could develop now and could become some of the best players in the world Thats why Gordon is being chased by Chelsea and Tuchel Verdict He is a capable player with a very high potential but he is far from Rooney when he was He can most definitely grow out to be a player who is equal to Rooney in his prime The reason why Gordon is so overpriced is because Everton is in financial troubles and need to sell players to buy new ones Chelsea are bidding mil for him because he is worth that much to Everton not because he is that good It would be one excellent deal for Everton but only a good deal for Chelsea with a potential to be excellent
