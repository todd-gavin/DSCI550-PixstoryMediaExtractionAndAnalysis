Kendrick Lamar had an Instagrammable moment with his "Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers" colleague Kodak Black on his native turf in Florida.

Mr. Morale" is 2022's largest rap album, and K. Dot invited Kodak for their song "Silent Hill" off his current album, which connected with the Miami crowd.

Baby Keem, Kendrick's pgLang protégé, was in in the mix, and the two performed "Family Ties."
In terms of Kodak's look, his lawyer Bradford Cohen admits it required some effort. He tweeted about his attempts to get Kodak from jail last week so he could perform with Kenny.

The surprising collaboration capped off a weekend of rap celebrations that saw Kid Cudi storming off his Kanye West replacement gig... Only for Ye to show up with Lil Durk anyhow.

Lil Baby, Future, Saweetie, Gucci Mane, Fivio Foreign, Playboi Carti, Dreezy, Soulja Boy, and many more performed for RL, and there are still concerts left in NYC and Toronto to wrap off the year.
