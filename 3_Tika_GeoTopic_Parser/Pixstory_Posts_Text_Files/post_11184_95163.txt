A new study links infertility to an increased risk of heart failure Women who had suffered infertility had a greater risk of heart failure according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology First author Emily Lau MD MPH cardiologist and head of MGH s Menopause Hormones Cardiovascular Clinic said the study s findings are revolutionary Infertility pregnancy complications and menopause all increase a woman s risk of heart disease later in life Infertility affects in American women but its relationship to heart failure has just lately been explored Lau and colleagues evaluated postmenopausal women from the Women s Health Initiative WHI to see if infertility was linked to heart failure Heart failure with maintained ejection fraction HFpEF and heart failure with decreased ejection fraction HFrEF HFrEF Ejection fraction is the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle of the heart during each beat An ejection fraction less than is considered abnormal There is a link between infertility and heart failure notably HFpEF which is more frequent in women regardless of reproductive history percent of the postmenopausal women surveyed have experienced infertility During a year study infertility was linked to a increased risk of heart failure When they looked at heart failure subtypes infertility was linked to a greater incidence of HFpEF They looked at other infertility related disorders such thyroid illness irregular menses and early menopause but found no evidence to support that notion either Many doctors are unaware of the link since heart failure usually occurs in the s and beyond whereas infertility occurs in the s s and s If we know a woman has had infertility we can be more proactive in advising her about other modifiable risk factors including high blood pressure cholesterol and smoking The American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health funded this study
