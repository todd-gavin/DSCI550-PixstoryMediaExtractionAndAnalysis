According to BBC Africa correspondent Andrew Harding a massive slab of carbon rich peat uncovered in central Africa is under threat from unregulated development posing a serious risk for future climate change The scientists were finally ready to begin work after travelling hours by automobile another by river in a dugout boat three hours carving a route through thick tropical undergrowth with machetes and another two wading and clambering through a scorching forest swamp They built a long metal corkscrew like device and thrust it deep into a stretch of dark water logged dirt brushing away mud and mosquitos in the process Over the last decade the close knit group has spent months at a time camping in the remote swamps along the Congo River s edge keeping an eye out for crocodiles snakes and lowland gorillas and mapping the contours of a massive slab of carbon rich peat that they now believe could cover an area larger than England We want to fill in the gaps on the map as much as possible It s a lot of labour It is however always an adventure The scientists photographed the peat cores before sealing them in plastic and sending them to Leeds University for additional research using a GPS monitor to track each place
