Taiwan Blue Magpie:

This bird is a native to the island nation after which it is named, which is also the only place on earth where you will find this beauty. Named by the Ching dynasty as long-tailed mountain lass, this species was found by English naturalist Robert Swinhoe.

Famed for its nest-helper system, this pretty bird also displays the unique food hoarding technique that matches with its American relative, the raven. 

To avoid hunger, the Taiwan blue magpie often hides food in crevices, tree hollows, and in shallow holes dug in the ground and then covers it ingeniously with leaves and forest litter for future use.Â
