The 22-year-old has been signed by the second team of the 30-time Primeria league winners.

The Nigerian International was playing for Portimonense in the past season and was taken on a
loan by the Dragons’ second team for the 2022-23 season.

The Nigerian International started his career at Feirense before moving to the Nigeria Professional Football League to play for the Remo stars in 2021.

His impressive performance got him the opportunity to get into Portimonense side but he wasn’t
able to make it into Sergio’s first team.

He wasn’t able to live up to the expectations of the club in the seldom opportunities he got as he
was loaned to Radomiak Radom for the remainder of the 2021-22 season.

At the Polish side, Marcus played some great football in the eight matches out of which in six
matches he came in as a substitute.

Now, Porto’s second team has shown great faith in the Nigerian and will be expecting a cracker of a season this year. A statement from Porto B read, “Abraham Marcus is the first reinforcement of FC Porto B for the new season, The 22-year-old winger joins the blue and
white club and is on a one-year loan contract with a purchase option.”

In his first interview after joining the side Marcus showed his excitement. He said, "I am very
excited to be part of this club. FC Porto is a good place to be and I hope to do my best here, I
faced FC Porto B in the second league, so I'm very happy to be able to represent the club.

I
hope to have a good season. I'm a quality player, I intend to show it on the pitch and show why
FC Porto bet on me. I will try to score more goals this season and I will always do my best for
the team.”
