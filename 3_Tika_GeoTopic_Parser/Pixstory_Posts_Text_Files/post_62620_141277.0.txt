Retinoids are a type of medication that helps your skin avoid wrinkles and other signs of aging. They work by helping your skin to regenerate itself, which helps to reduce the appearance of aged skin.
There are a few different types of retinoids available on the market, and each one has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. The most popular retinoids currently are retinol and retinaldehyde. Retinol is the more effective form of retinoid and is usually recommended for use in the early stages of acne treatment or as part of a skin-care routine. Retinaldehyde is less effective than retinol but is still beneficial for treating wrinkles and other signs of aging. 
The long-term benefits of using retinoids depend on a few factors, including how often you apply them, how healthy your skin is to start with, and how much vitamin A you're already taking in from other sources. However, most users report seeing significant improvements in their skin's texture and appearance over time. If you're interested in trying out retinoids for yourself, be sure to discuss this with your dermatologist first to make sure they're suitable for your specific needs.
