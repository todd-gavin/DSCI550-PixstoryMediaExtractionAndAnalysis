Manchester United started the 2021/22 Premier League season brightly. At one point, the Red Devils were on top of the league table and the new summer acquisitions of Ronaldo, Sancho, and Varane even gave hopes of a potential Premier League title.

However, all these hopes crashed and burned in the midseason. And famously two penalty misses would be remembered to be the cherry on top of United's horrendous campaign. 

So which penalty misses are we talking about? Well incidentally both the penalties were taken by Bruno Fernandes. 

The first penalty miss came against Aston Villa at the Old Trafford Stadium on 25th September 2021. Manchester United were trailing 1-0 in the 90+3' minute when Bruno Fernandes stepped up to take a crucial penalty. 

Cristiano Ronaldo was on the field as well but Bruno famously insisted that he would be taking it. However, the Portuguese international ballooned his strike over the bar, hence resulting in United's first Premier League loss of the season. This was kick off a run of bad results that would eventually cost Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job. 

The second penalty miss came against Arsenal on 23rd September 2022. The Red Devils had to win against the Gunners in order to keep themselves alive in the race for the top four. Bruno Fernandes stepped up instead of Cristiano Ronaldo once again, hitting the post. United were 2-1 down at the time and would eventually lose 3-1. 

Would things have changed if these two penalties would have been slotted in?
