It's no secret that the pandemic has caused the country's collective mental health to deteriorate dramatically.There is no shortage of studies or attention on the subject, and we can see it in our daily lives.
However, according to a new study, persons who have had Covid-19 are at a considerably higher risk of developing mental health problems in the future.Researchers were able to examine the outcomes of more than 153,000 people who had survived at least 30 days after testing positive for Covid-19 using data from the Veterans Health Administration.
Individuals who survived the first 30 days of Covid-19 infection had a 60% higher risk of new mental health diagnoses or new medicine prescriptions linked to mental health than those who avoided infection, according to the study.The data point to a relationship between Covid-19 infection and an increased risk of anxiety, depressive disorders, and substance abuse problems. Individuals had an 80% increased chance of neurocognitive impairment after infection, according to the researchers.

The pandemic is a new experience for both doctors and patients, and she argues that experiencing anxiety and despair in the midst of such a traumatic event is typical. When it comes to the long-term implications of Covid-19, we still don't have all the answers.
Other research have shown that Covid-19 can impair mental health and neurological function, although it's worth noting that the participants in this study were all veterans2, a group that is already at a higher risk of mental health issues and substance abuse disorders.
