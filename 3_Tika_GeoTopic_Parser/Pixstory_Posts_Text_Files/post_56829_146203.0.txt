1. CLEANSER
When it comes to following a skincare routine, most people follow CTM, i.e. Cleansing, Toning, and Moisturising. 
2. TONER
The next step that comes after cleansing is toning. Toner is one of the skincare essentials that is a part of a comprehensive skincare regime. Toner helps remove any oil or makeup residue and prepares your cleansed skin to absorb the following skin care products you will apply. 
3. MOISTURIZER
Many people with oily skin skip moisturizer, thinking it will make their skin oily. But, everyone needs a moisturizer.
4. SUNSCREEN
Sunscreen is another on the list of ‘skincare essentials’, and applying the best sunscreen daily is very important to keep your skin healthy and radiant.
5. SERUM
The serum is another vital skin care essential as it provides an added boost to your moisturizer. Use serums at night to get most of their benefits. 
6. EXFOLIANT
It is necessary to exfoliate your skin to remove dead skin cells and keep the skin healthy. 
7. EYE CREAM
One of the must-have skincare essentials is an eye cream.
