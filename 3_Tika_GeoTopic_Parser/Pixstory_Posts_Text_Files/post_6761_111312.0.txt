A video of a man surrendering at a metro station is making the rounds on social media. Surrounding him are armed soldiers with guns. It has been claimed that army personnel thwarted a terrorist attack at a metro station in Faridabad, managing to nab a terrorist.

Tweeting the video, a user named Yamuna Shankar Pandey wrote, “Today, a huge terrorist attack at the Bata Metro station in Faridabad was foiled by our army brothers. I’m sure the arrested terrorist must be an Islamist.”

Facebook page 24 network also shared the video as a genuine incident.

Several users amplified the claim on Facebook and Twitter.

Fact-check
We noticed that a few users commented under the viral video pointing out that this was actually a mock drill. We then performed a keyword search on Twitter using this information and came across a statement posted by the official handle of the Faridabad Police. Refuting the viral claim, the police said that this was actually a video of a CISF mock drill exercise being circulated with a misleading claim. Following the statement, users who had promoted the claim began deleting their tweets.

As per the viral claim, the incident occurred at Faridabad’s ‘Bata’ Metro Station. The video also features a building in front of the station. To verify the location, we compared photos of the ‘Bata Chowk’ Station on Google Maps, but could not find any resemblance between these and scenes from the video.

Next, Alt News examined images of the stations preceding and following Bata Chowk on the Violet Line of the Delhi Metro on Google Maps. This led us to one image from 2017 of the NHPC Chowk Metro Station. This matched a frame taken from the viral video.
