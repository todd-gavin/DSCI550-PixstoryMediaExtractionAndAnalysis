No word can exagerate such beauty
No where else can it be found
The beauty that surpasses others
The black beauty
If options are given
The black beauty remains the favourite
The beauty of the Nubians
The beauty of the Bushmen
The beauty of the Egyptians
The beauty of the Ashanti
The beauty of the Igbos
I can't define how beautiful
And well endowed a Yoruba lady is
In her most respected Aso Oke
Kente brings out the beauty of
an Ashanti lady
The skin fresh like that of a young jaguar
Reminds me of an angel
No beauty can stand the African beauty
Her teeth white like snow
Her hairs black like the burnt back of cedar wood
Eyes like that of a young maned lion
Straight legs like a masqurade tree
Her beauty like her attitude
So vibrate
so lovable
Beautiful like the queen of sheba
Speechless your beauty made me
The sun confirms your beauty with a warm smile
The african beauty
