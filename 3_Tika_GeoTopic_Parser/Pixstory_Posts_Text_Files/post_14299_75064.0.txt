Whether in the modern surroundings of the Allianz Stadium or the iconic setting of San Siro, when Juventus and Milan clash, the result reverberates the length and breadth of Italy. 

The oldest rivalry in Serie A, first played in 1901, has maintained all of its nobility and importance, and this weekend’s fixture is no exception.

Until the end of October, Milan had been almost faultless. Of the opening 11 match days, Stefano Pioli’s team failed to win just one, a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Stadium. A 16-point chasm separated Calcio’s two most successful clubs.

From 10 wins in the opening 11 matches, to five wins and four defeats in the following 11. The Rossoneri’s dip in form coincided with Juventus’ gradual improvement and eight victories, two draws and just one defeat from November has reduced the arrears on second-placed Milan to seven points.

Season 2010/11 to 2018/19 brought the Bianconeri unheralded success over their inter-city rivals. Nine seasons in which Juventus collected 19 wins out of 24 meetings, losing just twice.

Underlining the club from Turin’s dominance, twice the Bianconeri strung together nine-game winning sequences. Unheard of in historically an even contest.

Since 2020, with two wins each and two draws, parity has returned, however.
