From 2011 to 2013, Aaron Ramsey enjoyed something of a second breakout for Arsenal FC. Having recovered from a broken leg, the Welshman proved his readiness by appearing 91 times for the Gunners in 2011-12 and 2012-13.
During this period, Ramsey, able to play centrally or wide, showed glimpses of goal-scoring potential and creativity that fully blossomed in the 2013-14 season as Arsenal ended a nine-year-long trophy drought. With 16 goals in all competitions – including ten in the Premier League plus eight assists – Ramsey enjoyed his most prolific campaign to date. The highlight was a player-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final against Hull City, Ramsey’s extra-time half-volley sealing a famous comeback win. He was named Arsenal’s player of the season.
An encore followed as the Gunners retained the trophy in 2015, routing Aston Villa 4-0 in the final. Beginning the season with three goals in three games, Ramsey again hit double figures, netting ten times in all. A third FA Cup followed in 2016-17, with Ramsey, now donning the #8 shirt, scoring three times in four games. This included another winner in the final, a header to clinch a record 13th crown for Arsenal.
In 2015-16, Ramsey registered five goals and four assists in Arsenal’s title challenge, ultimately helping his side to a runner-up finish – his best league placing with the Gunners.
Ramsey’s final two campaigns are stories of near misses for Arsenal, runners-up in the 2018 EFL Cup and 2019 Europa League, but great personal success. 2017-18 saw the Welshman register 11 goals, including his first career hat-trick in a 5-1 win over Everton. With eight Premier League assists, he was once again named Arsenal’s player of the season.
His final campaign saw six goals, with his last for the club coming in the Europa League quarter-finals against Napoli. An injury in the return leg prematurely ended his Arsenal career as he exited the club upon the expiry of his contract in the summer.
Ramsey was, at the time of his departure, Arsenal’s longest-serving player. In all, he crossed the white line 369 times for the Gunners, scoring 64 goals and winning three major trophies.
