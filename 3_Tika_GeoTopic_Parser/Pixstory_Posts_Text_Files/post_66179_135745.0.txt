Australia’s mandated Covid isolation period will be reduced from seven days to 5 after the national cabinet reached consensus on the changes.
The decision will not apply to “vulnerable settings” which means, for example, that aged care workers may need to stay home for 7 days.
“The National Cabinet agreed the isolation periods for COVID-19 positive cases would be reduced from seven to five following a positive test, with the following caveats,‘’ Mr Albanese said.
“This would apply to people with no symptoms. Clearly, if you have symptoms, we want people to stay home.
“We want people to act responsibly. Seven days isolation will remain for workers in high-risk settings including aged care, disability care, home care is important as well.
“I believe, and first ministers agreed, that on the evidence, this was a proportionate response at this point in the pandemic.”
The changes will come into force on September 9.
