The 2021 season for the Los Angeles Lakers saw a lot of new faces put on the purple and gold. As the team was ravaged by injuries all season long, the team made a big splash in the buyout market by bringing in big man Andre Drummond who was released by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

Drummond’s time with the Lakers was a bit of a mixed bag as he had some good showings but also struggled to fit in with the constantly changing lineups L.A. was forced to employ. The two sides ultimately parted ways in the offseason, but Drummond has no hard feelings toward the Lakers and enjoyed his time in Los Angeles.

In an interview on the Jefe Island YouTube Page, Drummond spoke about his time with the Lakers, admitting that any player who puts on the purple and gold must be built different from a mental aspect:

“The Lakers is exactly what you think it is man, you gotta be built differently to play for that organization. You gotta be mentally strong not even just on the court, but off the court too because it’s so much expectations to being a Laker and putting that purple and gold on because if you don’t meet those expectations they will let you know that you not worthy enough to wear that jersey. You gotta play to the best of your ability and play hard each and every night, regardless of win, lose, or draw you gotta just play hard that’s what gets respect. I had a lot of fun out there.”

Drummond is spot on about that as the Lakers fans are extremely passionate and vocal when they feel like players aren’t living up to expectations. On the other side, however, they will fully embrace those who come through and deliver and exceed those expectations on the way to a championship.

Drummond also noted the weird situation he was coming off after not playing in Cleveland before coming to the Lakers and wishing he had a better opportunity to show what he could do.
