Among all the monsters out there, there is none as scary or famous as Count Dracula. Over the years, there have been many iterations of Bram Stoker’s creature of the night, each with their own touch to the character, but none have had as much of an impact as the first ever cinematic depiction of Dracula created by German filmmaker F.W Murnau’s ‘Nosferatu’. Released in 1922, over a 100 years ago, this movie was the first time Dracula came out in movie form, and it holds its place well after a century. If Stoker made vampires a pop culture icon, then Nosferatu made them actual demon spawn.

For those who have not seen this classic, well first of all get going and watch it now. And second of all this is basically Bram Stoker’s novel with all its core elements, with only different names and slight changes to the story, so you need not worry about the execution. Furthermore, Count Orlok is actually far more faithful to vampire mythology compared to Dracula, as Orlok is inspired more by vampire folklore.

Over the years, Orlok and Dracula became two different creatures. While Dracula is known as the graceful, gentlemanly vampire who is underneath a savage, Orlok is the far more demonic and monstrous vampire, being far more bloodthirsty and savage.

 Compared to the others of his era, Orlok was a different kind of vampire who brought out the undead in Dracula, with little suave and grace, but with all the dark, nightmarish elements of an undead bloodsucking creature of the night.
He is a hell spawn with little care for something like morality. He does just enough to appear human-like and is always hungry. 

Apart from his constant desire to feed , he wants nothing more and for that he is willing to damn thousands to oblivion because for him, every living being is just another blood-bag and that makes him outright terrifying.
