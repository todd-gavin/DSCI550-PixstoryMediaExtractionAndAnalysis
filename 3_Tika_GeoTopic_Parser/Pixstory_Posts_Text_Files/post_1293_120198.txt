From making reels in the middle of the pandemic to featuring on Comicstaan India s biggest hunt for fresh comedic talent Season Gurleen Pannu s meteoric rise to fame has been nothing less of a fairy tale A little back story I too used to dabble in standup comedy around years ago While I didn t do too great I made enough of friends in the field who are now doing quite well I can proudly say that amongst these friends of mine I was one of the first few from outside her home turf of Chandigarh to notice this new shining talent I remember back when I used to create content on Instagram last year some creator friends and I were discussing our favourite content creators Mohd Anas winner of the Great Indian Laughter Challenge and I both landed on Gurleen Pannu s name Her work mainly consisted of semi angry rants but it was the lines she said that did the work for her Cut to a year later I saw her reaching the final of Comicstaan She was the favourite to win from the very start of the show and just lost out on the last day While she had to settle for second place the entire country believes she was the rightful winner just based on consistency I too am one of them Yesterday I took my dad to watch her live show and we had a whale of a time She s family friendly immensely clever and even today very confident in her lines Spoke with her after the show Exchanged some stories from the comic scene She is a delight to watch Make sure you go watch her too some time
