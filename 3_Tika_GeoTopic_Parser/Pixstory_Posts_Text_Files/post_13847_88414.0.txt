Juventus are not exactly on a roll, but they, it seems, still feel things are falling in place for them, even after the humiliating Champions League defeat against Villareal. At least that’s what one felt after listening to what their coach had to say. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri asked the fans to forget about the Champions League exit and said the club were on the right track. “I think we are on the right track and we have also found our way of playing. It doesn’t take much to destroy things, so you have to be very careful,” the coach said. He didn’t stop here and went on to add: "We must immediately erase the Champions League exit and close this period in the best possible way to try to stay three points behind Inter (Milan), and play the direct match at home….”I have nothing to clarify. Together with the club, we are on a journey and we have laid a good foundation,” he said.
Well, nothing can be said if the coach thinks this way. But will a common fan agree with him? Hardly. After dominating Italian football for nine straight season, Juventus lost their crown in favour to Inter Milan last time. This season, the Bianconeri once again find themselves on the outside looking in when it comes to the Scudetto race. They are currently placed fourth in the Serie A table after 29 matches and still have a chance of qualifying for next year’s Champions League. But is that enough for arguably the greatest club in Italian history? Allegri will find it hard to answer this. 
Reports say Juventus, along with Inter Milan, received huge money from Champions League campaign despite their rather early exit. It says that Inter’s total winnings amounted to €64.81m, but it was still not as big as what Juventus earned overall. The Bianconeri reportedly made €78.71m, this is partly because of their historic ranking in the competition. Good to know someone is leaving with a fat purse, but can that expunge the fact Juventus didn’t win the Champions League in two decades?
