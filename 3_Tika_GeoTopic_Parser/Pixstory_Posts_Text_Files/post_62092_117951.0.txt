Rafael Nadal and Emma Raducanu have won the 2022 ESPY award for Best Athlete Men's Tennis and Best Athlete Women's Tennis, respectively, on Thursday.

Nadal was one of four athletes - the others being Dylan Alcott, Carlos Alcaraz and Felix Auger-Aliassime - in the Best Athlete Men's Tennis category. Meanwhile, reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu beat Ashleigh Barty, Iga Swiatek and Leylah Fernandes to the Best Athlete Women's Tennis award

This is the third time Rafael Nadal has won the ESPY award, having previously won it in 2014 and 2011, while it's the first for Raducanu.

However, Nadal trails his Big Three peers - Roger Federer (9) and Novak Djokovic (5) - for most ESPY awards by a male tennis player. Meanwhile, Raducanu joins the likes of Serena Williams (10) and Naomi Osaka as the illustrious winners of the award in recent years.
