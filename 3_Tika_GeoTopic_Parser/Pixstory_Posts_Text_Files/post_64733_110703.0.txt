Verdict?
Richarlison would be a cracker of a signing for Antonio Conte since he fits his system very well.

As an Everton fan myself, it breaks my heart knowing that the fan favourite is about to leave the Club and that too an English Club where he would be playing over the likes of Kane and Son, However he could battle with Kulusevski for that right-wing spot. A lot of other Everton players left the club in hunt for Champions league football like Arteta, Lukaku, Barkley and Rooney too.

What I can say about his ability is that he is quick, good finisher, does defensive duties well and runs for the whole 90 minutes, The transfer would be good for both the clubs with one receiving a 25 year old talented player who can play in all the positions up front and the other 60 million to reinforce their squad so that they don’t end up in the same relegation battle they were last season. 

Everton will be looking at Emmanuel Dennis from Watford whom they were offered to sign a few days ago, Keane Lewis-Potter from Hull City and Steven Bergwijn from Tottenham to replace the outgoing Brazilian.
Lets just hope this talent doesn’t get wasted on the bench and reaches the heights he is destined to.
