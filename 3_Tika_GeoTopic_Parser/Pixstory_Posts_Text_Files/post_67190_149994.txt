Durga Puja is known affectionately as Pujo to many Bengalis There is something special about Pujo in Calcutta the city metamorphoses into a magical place Puja the loving offering of light flowers and water or food to the divine is the essential ritual of Hinduism For the worshipper the divine is visible in the image and the divinity sees the worshipper The interaction between human and deity between human and guru is called darshan seeing Durga pujo every year gives me hope nbsp I feel nostalgic about countless things Pujo Pujo Gondho is not a phrase but a feeling I have no qualms in admitting that Durga pujo for me and for many like me who grew up in Calcutta have connotations beyond being just a religious festival There lies the spirit and warmth which makes pujo so unique I had been away from this pomp and grandeur for more than twenty seven years So this year it s definitely special for me Pujo for us Calcuttans will always remain a celebration of life food friends adda nostalgia and planning for the next year Ashche bochchor abar hobe
