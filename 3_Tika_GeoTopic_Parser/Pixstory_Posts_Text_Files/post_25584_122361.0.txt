Following the release of the DC League of Super-Pets, there has been quite a buzz around the internet regarding the post-credits scene of the movie. The movie centers around the pets of the popular DC characters and features an ensemble cast both for the superheroes as well as their pets. Despite getting positive reviews from the critics as well as the audience, the post-credits scene has enraged some fans as even after having the same manager, Dwayne Johnson bagged several roles in the movie while the future of Henry Cavill’s Superman is still in dark.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson played the role of Superman’s dog Krypto in the brand new DC animated movie. The movie featured the various pets of the members of the Justice League trying to save their masters who were captured by Lex Luthor. Starting from Dwayne Johnson as Krypto to Kevin Hart as Bat-Hound, Batman’s Dog, Keanu Reeves as Batman, and John Krasinski as Superman, the cast is massive. But the real surprise unveils itself in the post-credits scene.

In the post-credits scene, we spot the dog Anubis, who is the pet of Black Adam and even Black Adam appears in front of Superman. In this particular scene, Anubis is also voiced by Dwayne Johnson, and even the character of Black Adam is made after Dwayne Johnson.

After he posted this, several fans questioned if this was the only face-off he was teasing for so long but most of the fans had something else in mind. They ask why is The Rock getting so many major roles while Henry Cavill’s future in DC is still in the dark even after both the actors have the same manager.
