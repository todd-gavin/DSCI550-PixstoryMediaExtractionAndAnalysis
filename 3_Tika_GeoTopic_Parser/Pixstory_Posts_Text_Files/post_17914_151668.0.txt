The new trailer for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is finally here!
The trailer seems to tease who the next Black Panther will be after the death of King T’Challa, played by the late Chadwick Boseman. Chadwick passed away in August 2020 after battling colon cancer at the young age of 43.
It appears from the trailer that Shuri will be the new Black Panther. The trailer also teases the new character Namor, who can be seen flying, as well as the Ironheart Armor. The trailer also seems to tease multiverse dimensions to Wakanda.
In the film, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and the Dora Milaje (including Florence Kasumba) fight to protect their nation from intervening world powers in the wake of King T’Challa’s death. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with the help of War Dog Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and forge a new path for the kingdom of Wakanda. Introducing Tenoch Huerta as Namor, king of Talokan, the film also stars Dominique Thorne, Michaela Coel, Mabel Cadena and Alex Livinalli.
