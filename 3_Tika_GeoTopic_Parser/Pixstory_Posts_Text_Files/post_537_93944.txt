Yes LIFE SUCKS Haven t u heard that one before time and again Sometimes the words come out of your mouth sometimes they fall on your ears as your friends complain Sometimes you don t want to get out of the bed some days you don t feel like going to work some days even your favourite shows on TV make no sense Sometimes even when others talk it is just noise Someday u feel you want to disappear from the face of the earth Life as you see it seems hate malice betrayals lies jealousy One community wants to throw out the other other thinks about its supremacy the world is full of race gender caste disparities inequality hits you across your face countries are at war friends become foes Even mundane things like your phone gets discharged when u need it most your maid doesn t turn up when u have an early morning meeting you get to know your friend has been back bitting you get to know about the lies people have been throwing at you and you have been lapping up Sometimes knowingly you are forced to ignore So again yes LIFE SUCKs But than you wake up to the fact that whatever you have is a blessing You have your family you have your children who love you The two out of ten friends who have been loyal have your back The betrayals that life has given you are actually life lessons The lies that came your way when you were down and out helped you live If at the end of the day a smile can still pass through your lips life is worth living Life will continue to suck but you always wake up to a new day with hope and count your blessings
