According to the latest Call Of Duty leaks, Black Ops 5 is due to release in 2024. Although no details about the game have been officially released, some fans now believe that it will take place during the Gulf War – a continuation of Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War .
 
Essentially, that would mean Call of Duty’s 2024 release would be Black Ops 5. The images were first posted on Twitter by Reality UK, who reportedly discovered them in a data mine during an alpha test of the mobile version of Call Of Duty: Warzone.
 
The images are currently viewable on ResetEra, and are seemingly a mix of shots from the upcoming Modern Warfare 2, and a new game in development at Black Ops developer Treyarch.
 
One of the leaked pieces of concept art labeled “Stealth” and “Pillage” give us different pieces of information. While “Pillage” gives us little apart from depicting a shootout in a building adorned with some paintings.  
 
“Stealth” however shows us the picture of an F-117 Nighthawk which lends credence to the theory that Black Ops 5 will take place during the Gulf War, the F-117 was extensively used during the war in 1991.

The next major release in the COD franchise will be Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which will be released October 28  of this fall, and with COD reportedly taking a year's break in 2023, it may very well be possible that a Black Ops sequel could be in development.
