On May 10, 2021, BLACKSWAN’s company, DR Music, announced that they would be having auditions to find a fifth and final member for them. Though it has taken some time — and the group had a comeback, “Close To Me”, between then and now — it seems that the group might finally have its final line-up!

There are reportedly two trainees who are in the running to become the group’s fifth member, and interestingly, both of them are foreigners!

On the left is Shreya Lenka, who is from India, and on the right is Gabriela Dalcin, who is from Brazil!

BLACKSWAN has already had a lot of interest in their group due to member Fatou, who is the only active black K-Pop idol currently in the industry. If one of these gorgeous girls joins the group, it will make them even more diverse!

these girls  have arrived in South Korea to begin their training and it will be exciting to see their growth in the industry!😍😌
