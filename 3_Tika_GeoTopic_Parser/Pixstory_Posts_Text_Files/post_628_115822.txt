Last week Pakistan heartthrob Fawad Khan made his Hollywood debut in Ms Marvel Hollywood first Muslim superhero There were stories all over media across the border in all major newspapers Fawad was trending on the net And netizens went crazy Why am I reacting late well I had to watch all previous episodes to get to number five With Eid and some travel delay was inevitable Well I managed to binge watch and must say six years later not much has changed in the man Same voice same eyes always a treat to watch The debut was impressive and netizens and critics were all praise for him While India and Pakistan might not agree on many things but the charm of Fawad Khan is may be the only thing both the countries agree on So watch Ms Marvel for Fawad even if you haven t been a Marvel fan and your kids have not forced you to watch each Iron man captain America hulk and Thanos movie If Robert Downey Jr is a visual treat Fawad Khan is no less Happy watching
