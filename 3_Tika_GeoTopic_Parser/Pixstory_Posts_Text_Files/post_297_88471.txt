 They ve repressed their own femininity they ve repressed their own gender nonconformity they ve repressed their ambivalence they ve repressed their own creativity And so when they see us have the audacity to live a life instead of saying Thank you for teaching me another way to live they try to disappear us because they did that to themselves first Gender Non Conforming Artist ALOK Interpretations and practices of Leviticus attempt to suggest that queer folks to be killed through a punishment that comes in name of an indeterminable sin How do you sin without the action needed for a choice You can t choose to be queer and trans just like you can t choose whether or not you ll be born Attempts to conflate our identities with sin are a misuse of fear to justify the erasure of folks for being who they are These attempts to promote hate in the name of religion feed into cisgender heteronormative insecurities that translate into fatal violence against queer and trans folks most of whom are Black and Latinx women What is the cost of centering love rather than violence I hope those who believe this can heal from the violence of hatred borrowing from the love in ALOK I hope they can choose compassion over comprehension Also sex is not binary and it most certainly isn t fixed so attempts to criminalize LGBTQI folks in the name of religion are transparently unscientific
