There have been no such cup distractions this season with exits from all three cups by March – and all at Old Trafford, too.

Erik ten Hag has been keen to start his new job early after leading Ajax to a third Eredivisie league title in four years, but the first time he’ll work with his new team is scheduled to be at the end of June for an August 6 start to the season.
