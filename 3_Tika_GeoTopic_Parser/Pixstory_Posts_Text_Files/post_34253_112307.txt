Four years after the release of the first single Rapper with gloves Pierluigi Gollini ready to release another song The Champions Dream video this is the title chosen by Gollorius and Vegas Jones released on the YouTube channel of the artist from Cinisello Balsamo on Thursday June while the song available on all streaming platforms starting from midnight on Monday June The track is a hymn that wants to be an inspiration for all those kids who have the courage to dream big Gollini and Vegas Jones tell in the song the struggle of those who choose to chasing your dreams until you see them come true Not so much for the money which is only a consequence of the commitment made but to make that child happy who played in the rain under the street lamps The video clip opens with a penalty saved by the young Gollini at the time of Manchester United as if to remember that moment when his dreams were finally coming true After that initial flashback the video develops in a continuous oscillation between the ramshackle pitches of the province and the majesty of the illuminated Tottenham Hotspur Stadium From the top of the stadium from which you can admire all of London Vegas and Gollo thank themselves and their tenacity for having chosen to never abandon the dream Next to the Spurs symbol cockerel they try to be an inspiration for all the boys like them without ever forgetting where they come from
