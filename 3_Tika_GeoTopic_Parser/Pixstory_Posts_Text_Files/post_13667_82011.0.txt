The world community seems ruthless and rude
 For two decades, he backed his slogans, claims, beliefs and values ​​about upholding and protecting the values ​​of women to Afghan women, and eventually left Afghan women in the filthy trap of the Taliban. The stigma of this shame will not be erased forever from the skirts of the international community and human rights institutions. This is a wound on the dead consciences of human rights organizations and institutions that have been advocating for the protection and preservation of women's values ​​in Afghanistan for the past two decades. Even if they expel all female athletes, journalists, civil society activists, lawyers, etc. from Afghanistan and pay the salaries of all female teachers and the Afghan health department, they will still not be able to alleviate the suffering of Afghan women and free themselves from the torment of conscience. That which comes to them in solitude and solitude, are proof.
