Lee Soo-ji, Chuu, and YENA appeared as transfer students on the new episode of JTBC’s entertainment program “Knowing Bros”, which aired on September 10th.
On the broadcast, Kim Hee-chul asked, “Do you know the reason why Ho-dong and Jae-seok don’t do programs together?”, adding “Because they lost in the ‘Kung Kung tta’ game.”

Kim Hee-chul continued, “Kang Ho-dong lost to Yoo Jae-seok in the bet of ‘getting hit with Antenna cell phone’ for the whole life’. That’s why they can’t meet in the same broadcast”.
Later, Shindong asked the transfer students, “Are you three already close to each other in real life?”.

In response, Soo-ji said, “We have many things in common. We all have blood type A and weigh 44kg”. When other friends showed suspicious looks, Soo-ji confessed, “My upper body is size 44”, drawing laughter.
