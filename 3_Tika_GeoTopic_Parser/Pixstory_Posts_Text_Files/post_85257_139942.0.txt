2 Pep Guardiola 
Pep Guardiola has made quite the legacy at Barcelona, as both a player and manager. Guardiola had to first learn his craft at Camp Nou under the tutelage of one of the best managers in football before he could orchestrate Barcelona's dominance of the world game.
After being promoted from the Barcelona junior team in 1990, Guardiola was coached by his previous manager Johan Cruyff to play center midfield, where he excelled for 11 years.
Guardiola, a seven-time league champion and European title as a player, then enjoyed an illustrious four-year stint as a club manager in which he won three Primera Division championships and two Champions Leagues. After leading La Blaugrana to their first regional triumph, Guardiola went on to revolutionize our sport with his astute and forward-thinking understanding.
3 Andreas Iniesta 
The 29-year-old playmaker has been a key component of Barcelona's most recent run of success and also provided Spain with the game-winning goal in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He can play both in the middle of the park and on the left of the attack. Andres Iniesta would be considered the greatest Barcelona player of his period if he didn't play with Messi and Xavi.
Andres Iniesta sat in the center circle after his farewell game in the red and blue, which came 16 years after his debut and took everything in. It was a time to look back on his career, his experiences, this enormous arena, and these amazing supporters. He ought to laugh about it and perhaps even cry. His life has been Barcelona, and it will undoubtedly still be as he transitions into coaching. How the experience, wisdom, and abilities he has gained over the years might aid the current batch of academy athletes.
