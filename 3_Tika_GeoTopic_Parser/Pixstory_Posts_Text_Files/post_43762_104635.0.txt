Arsenal has been offered the chance to beat North London rivals Tottenham with the signing of Barcelona defender Clement Lenglet.

Lenglet is all set to leave the Spanish giants this summer, with The Times reporting that Tottenham has already held talks to sign the French defender. 

However, Tottenham is not the only club to be offered the chance to sign Lenglet, with the report also stating that Arsenal is the latest club to be allowed to sign him on loan. 

Tottenham may be the more attractive prospect for Lenglet, due to Antonio Conte being desperate for a defender this window. Despite the improved performances of Ben Davies and Eric Dier this season, there is no doubt Conte will want to upgrade, especially with the Champions League round the corner. The left-footed Frenchman also fills a need for Antonio Conte and is capable of playing a back three. 

Spurs are believed to have turned to Lenglet after struggling to land top target Alessandro Bastoni.

Arsenal seems to have their centre-back partnership set for many years to come. Ben White and Gabriel are still both relatively young, especially for central defenders, so it could be difficult for Lenglet to break into the team and Mikel Arteta may not want to disrupt the current connection they have. 
Tottenham can also offer Lenglet Champions League football next season, so Arsenal’s efforts to sign him may be met with rejection. 

Former Sevilla man Clement Lenglet has made 160 appearances for Barcelona across all competitions, scoring seven times. However, he found starts hard to come by last season and The Times adds that he is deemed surplus to requirements at the Camp Nou.
