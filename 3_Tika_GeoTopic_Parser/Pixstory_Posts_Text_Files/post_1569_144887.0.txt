All quiet on the NBA trade front?After a flurry of trades during the off-season the trade market completely stopped when Durant demanded a trade out of Brooklyn and Mitchell was suspected to be traded from Utah. Now that the dust has settled in those two cases the NBA trade landscape is completely dead. However, with two weeks to go before trading camps open, will there be any more trade activity for the Sacramento Kings? It was rumored by NBA insiders that Harrison Barnes would be traded since the Kings are in a win now mode and Barnes is the best trade chip and is in the last year of his contract. Though many Kings fans view the off-season as a success with several trades and free agent signings experts believe they really didnâ€™t do a whole lot to upgrade the talent on the roster. Vegas still only has them winning 32 games next year. The west is still stacked and the Kings are still predicted to be on the margins of being able to make the playoffs. I believe the Kings will do everything they can to make one more big move to trade Barnes in a push to make the playoffs. One potential trade that could happen would be for Julius Randle on the New York Knicks. Randle has been an all-star but had a bad season last year and the team seemed to perform better later in the year with him on the bench. However, he is clearly a talent and could be a formidable teammate alongside Sabonis at the five and Murray at the three. This would give the Kings two rebounders who average over 10 boards a game and a much stronger rebounding SF in Murray. Huerter can also log minutes at SF. The move would be also be risky since Randall is not the veteran Barnes is and it would put a lot of pressure on Murray to be able to log major minutes at the 3. The move is risky but represents the type of risk the Kings need to take to upgrade their talent.
