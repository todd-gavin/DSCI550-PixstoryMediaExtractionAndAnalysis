 Mississippi is all set to become the final state with equal pay for equal work for men and women Republican Gov Tate Reeves signed House Bill and it will become law on July The Mississippi law declares a lawsuit must be filed within two years of when a worker knew or should have known about pay discrepancies A report by the Mississippi University Research Center showed women earned less than men for full time work in Mississippi compared to a wage gap nationwide The study said some of the gaps could be explained by the types of jobs women and men were working but the unexplained wage gap remained at about in Mississippi and about nationwide Moreover several exceptions are allowed including seniority merit quantity or quality of production and any factor other than sex including salary history and whether there was a competition to hire an employee You see the problem here if someone needs to oppress they would put forward the salary history that workers bring in as the reason This is why I would like to call this law one with many loopholes The exceptions stated in the very law would serve as loopholes for people who want to suppress women Mississippi being the last state to implement the law makes us unsure whether the state withstands in favour of women in such cases
