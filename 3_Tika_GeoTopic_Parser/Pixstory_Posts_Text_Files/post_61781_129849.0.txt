Michael Jordan is one of the greatest players of all time. The Hall of Famer was an unstoppable force in his 15 seasons in the NBA, playing for the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards.

That isn’t to say there haven’t been those who have tried to stop him. Over the years, there have been numerous foes who have tried their best. From Isiah Thomas to Charles Barkley and Karl Malone.

Unfortunately for them, they were unable to stop MJ from winning six NBA Championships with the Bulls and cementing his legacy as one of the GOATs in the NBA

A year after Michael Jordan left the NBA, the Chicago Bulls drafted a premier defender in Ron Artest, now known as Metta Sndiford-Artest. The 6’7″ small forward was an absolute menace on the court.

Known for never backing down from anything, Artest has been involved in a number of on-court incidents. This includes the infamous Malice in the Palace incident.

Despite the many controversial situations he has found himself in, none of the backlashes has left him fazed. However, he was nigh unconsolable in 2001, when he broke MJ’s ribs!

“And he called me and said, ‘Hey, you alright?’ I said, ‘No, I think I hurt Michael Jordan.’ Then it came out: Michael Jordan’s ribs broke. And Metta World Peace had a fight with Michael Jordan. And I’m like, ‘I did not have a fight with Michael Jordan.’ They said, ‘He punched Michael Jordan.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh man…'”

Luckily for Artest, the 6’6″ Bulls legend did not hold a grudge. In fact, it was a call from the Hall of Famer that finally got him out of bed after two days!
