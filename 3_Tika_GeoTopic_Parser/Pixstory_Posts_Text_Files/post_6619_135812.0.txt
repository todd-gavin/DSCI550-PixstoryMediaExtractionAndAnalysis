A text message widely shared on social media claims that seventeen influential positions in the Government of India (GOI) are held by persons from Odisha.
According to the viral message, these posts include the President of India and union ministers of the following departments — Education, Skill development, Entrepreneurship, Railway Minister, Communication, IT Ministry, Electronics, Tribal Affairs, and Jal Shakti. The text also states that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) chief, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) chief, the director at Indian Oil Corporation, (IOC) and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) chief are also from Odisha. The text ends by pointing out that the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Pramod Mishra, too, is an Odia. This is the only instance where the name of the office bearer is mentioned.
The message ends by pointing out, “They are only 3.3 % of the population & don’t have any political clout & have a non BJP govt in the state. However it seems that still merit, honesty, hard work, sincerity & efficiency etc gets rewarded in India, under Modi govt. And people say that Gujaratis are ruling the country[sic]”
Facebook page ‘PMO India: Report Card’ shared the message. It has garnered over 21,000 likes. Several pro-BJP Facebook accounts have made the same claim. On WhatsApp, the message is labelled ‘forwarded many times’.

Alt News received requests on its official WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160) to verify the claim.
Fact-check
The readers should note that the viral message doesn’t specify exactly in what sense these people are considered from Odisha — i.e. whether they are born in the eastern state or have their permanent address there. In order to verify the claims, we relied on the permanent address listed on the Government of India (GOI) website. In case the address is not listed, we relied on media reports.
