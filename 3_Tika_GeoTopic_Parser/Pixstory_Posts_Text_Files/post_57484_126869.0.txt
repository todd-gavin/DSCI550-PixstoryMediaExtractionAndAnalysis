I think you're mixing two ideas; you mean that negative emotions make someone mentally strong to deal with difficult situations because they have already gone through a lot.
But negativity bias is slightly different from this idea, and even your idea contradicts itself because eventually, it's the positive dedication that would make someone work despite all the predicaments and problems falling on them.

Moreover, negativity bias is someone's inclination towards negativity even if the positives are present equally.
It is not that they don't have a sight of hope; instead, they want to dwell in the darkness despite all the positivity and light.
It causes our emotional response to adverse events to feel amplified compared to similar positive events.

This is harmful because it could affect the brain; initially, it would seem that just a few changes have happened to affect you, but sooner or later, it would turn into more harsh consequences and coming out of it would not be easier.
