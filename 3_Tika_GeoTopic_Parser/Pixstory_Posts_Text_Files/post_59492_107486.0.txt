Pant allowed Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel three overs each in the initial half of the chase after seeing how the Indian batting stalled in the second innings and the purchase the South African spinners made despite going for a few runs. In his first over, Axar took the wicket of South African captain Temba Bavuma, then Chahal sent back Dwaine Pretorius and Rassie van der Dussen with his quick, flat, and skiddy bowling.
