One of the most interesting facts about Australia is that 90% of its indigenous species occur nowhere else. Some of these include the koala, kangaroo, dingo, echidna, wallaby, platypus, and wombat. Apart from their unique habitat, the duck-billed platypus and echidna are the world’s only egg-laying mammals. 

It’s also home to some of the world’s most dangerous animals like the box jellyfish, taipan (snake), blue-ringed octopus, redback spider, and stonefish.
