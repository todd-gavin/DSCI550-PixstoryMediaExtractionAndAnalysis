Cancer appears to be an ever growing disease and a leading cause of death worldwide It accounted for million deaths or about of all deaths worldwide in There has been a constant increase in the incidence of cancer World statistics indicate that in India alone of women presently suffer from cancer Apoptosis or programmed cell death in the tissues is a normal phenomenon which is a very important and inevitable event in the remodeling of tissues during development and aging It is a crucial process for eliminating cancer cells Most carcinogens appear to induce tumors by damaging cellular DNA that results in abnormal cells Apoptosis is one of the protective mechanism by which cells undergo self suicide in response to DNA damage Given that faulty DNA repair is associated with an increased incidence of abnormal cells the processes for repair or destruction of damaged cellular DNA are critical when it comes to defending the body against carcinogens Yoga Yoga is a mind body therapy that includes three components physical alignment poses asanas breathing techniques pranayamas and mindful exercises meditations The word yoga is derived from its Sanskrit root yuj which means to yoke or join together In this case yoga refers to joining the mind and the body Stress and its molecular consequences in cancer progression Stress caused by psychological physiological and physical factors has an adverse impact on human body homeostasis There are two kinds of stress short term and chronic Cancer patients usually live under chronic stress caused by diagnosis related strong emotional experience and depression resulting from various difficulties associated with disease progression and treatment At the molecular level stress factors induce production and secretion of stress related hormones such as catecholamines glucocorticoids and dopamine as a part of adaptational body response which influence both normal and transformed cells through their specific receptors The particular effects exerted by these molecules on cancer cells have been also observed in in vitro cultures and include changes in proliferation apoptosis susceptibility and migration invasion potential As a result it has been suggested that stress hormones may be responsible for progression of malignancy and thus accelerate the metastasis formation in cancer patients Read more
