I sit down for breakfast ready for a cup of Americano with the possibility of a French Toast when a voice behind me beams Hello young man Euphoria runs as a smile through my face with the inevitable misgendering at its footsteps in a shared moment of horror The hello young man fumbles into sorry young lady the hair i couldn t i Gender excuses itself leaving our faces with a matching outfit Of course I am afraid because the transformation of silence into language and action is an act of self revelation and that always seems fraught with danger But my daughter when I told her of our topic and my difficulty with it said Tell them about how you re never really a whole person if you remain silent because there s always that one little piece inside you that wants to be spoken out and if you keep ignoring it it gets madder and madder and hotter and hotter and if you don t speak it out one day it will just up and punch you in the mouth from the inside Your Silence Will Not Protect You Audre Lorde The person brought my perfectly crunchy French Toast with its sour berry compote with a confident enjoy madam after our awkward exchange I wouldn t have given this much thought if it wasn t for Audre Lorde s book that accompanied me through the wait I don t care much at all about clarifying my lack of gender to folks except for when they re immediate family But my silence is a routine comfort that avoids the discomfort of grappling with how gender is read through an essentialism that blatantly reduces everyone to their anatomy My indifference is a cloak of avoidance I brush over the medicalization that affects all of us to reserve my energy I m hoping to push myself out of this comfortable avoidance to resist the binaries attempting to interact with me by slipping in I m gender nonconforming every time I m misgendered as an experiment to see where it would lead
