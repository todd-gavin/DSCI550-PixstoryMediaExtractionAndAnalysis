Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid was dubbed as the battle of heavyweights in the UCL round of 16. The first leg of the exciting tie took place at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday, as PSG have earned the upper hand going into the second leg, as they defeated the Spanish side by a score-line of 1-0.

PSG go into the second leg in Madrid, with a 1 goal cushion, as a late Kylian Mbappe winner did the job for the hosts. The hosts put the Spanish giants under pressure for most of the encounter, as they were pinned in their own half. At one moment, it seemed as if the Los Blancos had done just enough to return home with a 0-0 draw, but Mbappe rose to the occasion once again.

Neymar returned from injury to start from the bench. He came on in the 73rd minute, replacing Angel Di Maria. The Brazilian looked vibrant in the final 20 minutes of the game, assisting Mbappe's goal in the dying stages of the game.

After receiving a backheel pass from Neymar, Kylian Mbappe cut in from the left wing, just gliding past the two Real Madrid men. He managed to put the ball into the back of the net with a tidy finish in between Courtouis legs.

The result would be a massive relief for Lionel Messi who missed a vital penalty in the 62nd minute. Real Madrid can be questioned for their passive style of play, as they hardly provided with any attacking threat.

Real Madrid have what it takes to produce a comeback on their home turf. However, Carlo Ancelotti will demand a bit more from his side following a poor show in Paris.
