The Supreme Court turned down a request to arrest suspended BJP spokesman Nupur Sharma on Friday due to comments she made about the Prophet during a TV discussion.
The courts should exercise caution when making decisions in these situations, according to a bench that included Chief Justice U. U. Lalit and Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and P. S. Narasimha.
The bench said, "We would urge you withdraw your plea. This may seem easy and trivial, but it has far-reaching effects. The court should be judicious while issuing orders.
Following the petitioner's withdrawal of the plea, the case was deemed to be withdrawn and dismissed.
A petition submitted by lawyer Abu Sohel asking for guidelines for a "independent, credible, and unbiased investigation" into the situation was being heard by the top court.
The top court had already given Ms Sharma respite by grouping all the FIRs filed nationwide and sending them to Delhi Police in relation to her statement on the Prophet.
The petitioner has become the target of numerous FIRs and complaints across the nation as a result of the broadcast on a news channel on May 26, 2022.
During a TV debate, Sharma made a statement about the Prophet that sparked protests across the nation and infuriated many Gulf nations. She was later expelled from the BJP.
