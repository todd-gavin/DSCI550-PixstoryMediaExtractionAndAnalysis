Aston Villa have reached an agreement with Southampton for the transfer of defender Jan Bednarek on a season-long loan. He will wear the No.25 jersey at his new home.
Villa were desperate for the defender after their summer signing Diego Carlos suffered a serious injury. The signing will provide Steven Gerrard with some relief after a disastrous start to the season.
Announcing the transfer, the Lions released a statement which read: “Aston Villa is pleased to announce the signing of Jan Bednarek on a season-long loan from Southampton.”
The Poland defender joined the Saints from Lech Poznan in 2017 and has made 153 total appearances for the club, scoring seven goals. His contract at the South Coast club will run until 2025.
Bednarek was allowed to leave St Mary's after Austrian boss Ralph Hasenhuttl made Mohammed Salisu and promising Armel Bella-Kotchap his first-choice centre-back pair. He has featured in two games this season and was benched for the past three games.
Bednarek’s welcome interview with his new club didn’t settle well with Southampton fans, as the 26-year-old centre-back called the Villains “bigger club”.
"I'm happy and excited," he said. "I'm looking forward to the new adventure. It's a great opportunity for me and another great step. That's a really important one for me, to move to a bigger club and improve as a player."
Bednarek added: “It’s a massive club in England. Coming from Poland, I wasn’t aware how big Villa is. I think the fans are amazing, the stadium’s amazing and also the training ground. I’m really happy to be joining this club.”
Aston Villa are currently ranked No.19 in the Premier League points table with just one win in five games. They will next lock horns with reigning England champions Man City on Saturday (September 3) at Villa Park.
