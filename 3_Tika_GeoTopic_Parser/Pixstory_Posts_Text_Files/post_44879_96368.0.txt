Mohamed Salah, who is now in sixth place on Liverpool FC's all-time scoring list, recently
became the first Reds player to score in ten straight competitive matches. Salah made history
by scoring a hattrick in Liverpool's 5-0 win over Manchester United, making him the first
opposition player to score a Premier League hattrick at Old Trafford.

The 29-year-old attacker is in probably his greatest form of the season, having netted 17 goals
and provided five assists in 12 games for Liverpool in all competitions. He recently broke Didier
Drogba's record as the most goals scored by an African player in Premier League history.

Salah, who has also played for Chelsea, has 167 Premier League appearances under his belt
and 107 goals, three more than Drogba. The Egyptian international joined Liverpool from Roma
in the summer of 2017 and has since established himself as one of Jurgen Klopp's most crucial
players.

Let's take a look at the players who played alongside Mohamed Salah in his Liverpool debut
and see where they are now.

Sadio Mane

Salah has built a devastating front three in European soccer alongside Mane and Roberto
Firmino. Mane, who is still with Liverpool, scored in the game, with Emre Can setting him up.

Roberto Firmino

Firmino had extended Liverpool's advantage against Watford, and his goal was assisted by
Salah, who was making his debut at the time. Firmino and Salah continue to provide some of
Liverpool's greatest goals.

Gini Wijnaldum

Wijjnaldum was one of Liverpool's starting midfielders against Watford. In the summer of 2021,
the Dutchman left the Reds and now plays for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).

Emre Can

Can, a German midfielder who spent four seasons with Liverpool, began against Watford.
Salah's first season with Liverpool, 2017-18, was also Can's last with the club. He is presently a
Dortmund player.
