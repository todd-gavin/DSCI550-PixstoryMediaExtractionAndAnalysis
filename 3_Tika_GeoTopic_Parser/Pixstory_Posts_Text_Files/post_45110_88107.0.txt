Russia will not play Poland in the 2022 World Cup play-offs after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) denied their request to have their competition ban lifted in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine.

After President Vladimir Putin gave the green light for forces to begin seizing regions of Ukraine, FIFA and UEFA announced their decision to ban Russia from all world and European championships.

The semi-final match between Russia and Poland for a place in the final of the World Cup qualification play-offs was postponed due to the ruling.

The Russian football association requested that the suspension be put on hold awaiting the outcome of their appeal against FIFA's decision, but they have now been dealt yet another big setback in their quest to qualify for the World Cup.

"The president of the appeals arbitration division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has rejected the request filed by the Football Union of Russia (FUR) to stay, for the duration of the CAS proceedings, the execution of the FIFA Council's decision to suspend all Russian teams and clubs from participating in its competitions until further notice," read a statement released by CAS on Friday (the challenged decision).

"Accordingly, the challenged decision remains in force and all Russian teams and clubs continue to be suspended from participation in FIFA competitions. The CAS arbitration proceedings continue. 

"A Panel of arbitrators is currently being constituted and the parties are exchanging written submissions. No hearing has been fixed yet."

If Russia's broader appeal is rejected, they will be barred from participating in any subsequent qualification games or the World Cup itself, which begins on November 21 in Qatar.

Poland has been handed a bye to the play-off final, while Ukraine's semi-final match against Scotland has been postponed until June.
