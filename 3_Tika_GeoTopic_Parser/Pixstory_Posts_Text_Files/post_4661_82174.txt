For all the misery that the pandemic has wrought it has also opened up a vast storehouse of knowledge about medical issues beyond COVID While it s still too early to draw conclusions evidence is emerging of links between autoimmune disorders and the virus that causes COVID As a bioinformatics researcher with medical training and expertise in immune system modeling I find this development especially exciting The immune system is the most powerful weapon against infection But on rare occasions something devastating happens The immune system turns against its own body a condition that researchers call autoimmunity This can result in any of a wide range of autoimmune disorders They include rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis and lupus an inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks multiple tissues Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of what causes these diseases in hopes of developing therapies to treat them COVID may accelerate that process by giving researchers new insight into old findings about the immune system From autoimmunity to COVID Molecules called interferons are a significant component of the body s defense against viruses These proteins are especially important in the early stages of an infection frequently getting ahead of it before symptoms appear Immune cells produce interferons which then do what their name implies literally run interference when a virus begins to multiply At least that s what they re supposed to do But reports from early in the pandemic showed that in some patients with severe COVID one interferon known as Type I showed a weak response to the virus Some patients actually developed antibodies specifically targeting Type I interferons essentially knocking out one of the body s first lines of defense against the disease Read full story at The Conversation Image Credits
