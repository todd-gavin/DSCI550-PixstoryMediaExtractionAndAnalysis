 Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says Australia should not have forced temporary visa holders out the door during the pandemic after the exodus of working migrants left the nation with a massive skills and labour shortage nbsp Speaking to the National Press Club on Monday Albanese declared Australia is a migration country that needs to enhance its reputation in a global labour market as nations compete for workers to reboot their economies It probably wasn t the wisest decision during the pandemic to tell everyone who was a temporary visa holder to leave and to provide them with no income and no support which means many of them have left with ill feeling towards Australia and that spreads around Albanese said We ve got a globalised labour market and we need to enhance our reputation Australia is a great place to live or to visit and we need to always bear that in mind and I think some of the actions that occurred then weren t wise Former prime minister Scott Morrison said after a national cabinet meeting in April that people in Australia on temporary visas who couldn t support themselves had the available alternative to return to their home countries As much as it s lovely to have visitors to Australia in good times at times like this if you re a visitor in this country it is time to make your way home he said Australia must focus on its citizens and its residents to ensure that we can maximise the economic supports that we have As opposition leader Albbanese backed that call but suggested workers on temporary visas should be eligible for JobKeeper The exclusion of temporary visa holders from the JobKeeper arrangements is also of concern I agree with the prime minister that if a temporary visa worker can go home in the midst of this crisis they should We ve had to take people from other areas so it s absurd for Australia s reputation that someone who has wanted to be here that business wants them to be here has waited or months to get into Australia he said
