There are tons of metal bands out there with immense prowess skill creativity and all around talent but if there is one which has consistently dominated in all fields it is Iron Maiden Their old school approach to their craft has been the cornerstone of their success Formed in Iron Maiden emerged as one of the biggest names of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal What makes Maiden unique from their NWOBHM colleagues is that the band was not a result of one man alone but like Rush an entire product with each member being as important as the other Throughout their career in all their years Iron Maiden has never followed musical trends nor ever attempted to sound like anyone else They are master storytellers whose compositions are riddled with various themes packed with an excellent sense of theatricality They skilfully use speed melody to create a strong emotional connect between the audience the music and the theme They have a remarkable sense of control never playing without intent every note is ever struck only ever to advance the theme of the music forward Iron Maiden is almost like the classical act of their music like Mozart or Bach making them almost like a whole genre into themselves The galloping bassline of Steve Harris the twin now three guitar attack of Dave Murray Adrian Smith with the addition of Janick Gers the brilliant drum beats and excellent timekeeping by Nicko McBrain and the soaring powerful operatic vocals of Bruce Dickinson really make the band a piece which has it all The masters of melody while they create heavy riffs their riffs are simultaneously melodic and this approach has influenced whole bands from Kreator Trivium Cradle Of Filth In Flames to entire sub genres such as power metal melodic death metal progressive metal symphonic metal etc The greatest live band of all time the energy they pack at their shows is unreal It is almost like they are the messengers from the halls of Valhalla And last but not the least Eddie There is no heavy metal mascot as iconic as Eddie
