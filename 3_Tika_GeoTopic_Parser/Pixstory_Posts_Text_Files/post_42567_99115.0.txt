Today whole world is celebrating Motherâ€™s Day, and every children trying his best to make his mother smile and make her feel special today. Every mother in this world is special in her way but if I talk the about character of mothers played by many actresses in either movies or web series, many characters were liked by audiences as well as hated by the audiences.

Right now, the Mother of the moment in the world film industry is Elizabeth Olsen who played the role of Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch in the movie called, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. 

After watching the movie, no other guy in the world want to fight with Wanda because for the love of her children she opens the portal of the multiverse as well as kills people who came in her way. Wanda Maximoff is the perfect balance between a beautiful & caring mom and a dangerous mom. Beautiful and caring for her children and dangerous mom to those, who put a finger on her children.
