Today's elections to elect India's next vice president will take place, and NDA candidate Jagdeep Dhankar is predicted to win with just BJP support. Margaret Alva of the opposition seemed to be running a very long way behind.

Today from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Parliament House will host the vice presidential elections; the results will probably be announced later in the evening.

Jagdeep Dhankhar, who is most known for serving as Bengal's former governor, can expect 527 votes, significantly more than the 372 needed to win. It may account for 70% of all votes cast, which is 2% more than M. Venkaiah Naidu received.

780 MPs make up the Electoral College: 543 in the Lok Sabha and 245 in the Rajya Sabha. 744 MPs are anticipated to cast votes, excluding the eight open Upper House seats and the 36 Trinamool Congress members who opted not to participate.

394 BJP members are among the NDA's 441 MPs. Additionally, the NDA candidate has the support of five nominated members.

Several other non-NDA groups, including the Akali Dal, the Biju Janata Dal of Naveen Patnaik, the YSR Congress of Jaganmohan Reddy, the Bahujan Samaj Party of Mayawati, the Telugu Desam Party of Chandrababu Naidu, and the Eknath Shinde faction of the Shiv Sena, also support Dhankhar. They have 81 MPs altogether.

Expect 26% of the vote for Margaret Alva (around 200). She is backed by the Left parties, the Congress, the DMK of MK Stalin, the Rashtriya Janata Dal of Lalu Yadav, the Nationalist Congress Party of Sharad Pawar, the Samajwadi Party of Akhilesh Yadav, and the Nationalist Congress Party of Sharad Pawar.

Alva is also supported by the nine MPs from the Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray group, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, the Aam Aadmi Party, and others.

Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the candidate for the opposition, received 32% of the vote in the most recent election.

A false vote was held during a meeting with BJP MPs on Friday that Mr. Dhankhar attended in Delhi.
When using a single transferable vote for proportional representation, the voter must indicate their preferences next to each candidate's name.
