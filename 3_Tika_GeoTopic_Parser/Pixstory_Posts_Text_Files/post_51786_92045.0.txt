In recent years South Korea has become better known for its technology than its food.Here is a list of South Korean foods which I like the most and y'all must try: 

1)Hoeddeok (sweet syrupy pancakes) 

2)Bulgogi (marinated beef barbecue) 

3)Samgyeopsal (pork strips) 

4)Japchae (stir-fried noodles) 

5)Kimchi (fermented vegetables)

6)Ddukbokki (spicy rice cake)

7)Sundubu-jjigae (soft tofu stew) 

8)Bibimbap (mixed rice)
