According to me the new ad by the cookie brand Oreo was totally wholesome I appreciated it and my friends from the community liked it too I don t get why exactly people have a problem with it Some people are accusing the brand of using the community to further their position in the market But I say what is wrong with it Last I checked we are still a capitalist economy so it is fair enough for corporations to use marketing tools that will expand their customer base while appealing to the ideas of the modern generation This would have been wrong if there corporations were exploiting the LGBTQ community but I see this as a symbiotic relationship wherein the community is also getting represented on a major level It can be called a political propaganda but in my eyes the movement is political too Activists have been advocating for a space in the common domains too Till date how many times we have seen a gay man in an commercial for a cookie I can t remember even a single one So say what you will but this is a major win for the community To see a major brand like Oreo normalising the concept of coming out and even cheering for it brings the community into the normative space When brands like Oreo feature the community people feel heard people feel seen So instead of criticising the ad we should celebrate the little wins and move forward with a positive attitude
