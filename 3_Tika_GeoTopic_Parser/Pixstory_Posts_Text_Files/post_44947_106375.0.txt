The Australian was appointed off the back of a bitterly disappointing campaign and the club was in a state of flux following a very long chase for Eddie Howe. 

Results in the early stages did not look promising, with Champions League hopes dashed in the qualifiers and three defeats in the first six league games. 

But things started to turn, Postecoglu had firmly implemented his preferred playing style. His new signings had started to shine and results were racking up. 


League cup success came first, then of course the title. Nobody of a Celtic persuasion could have foreseen how quickly the ex-Aussie boss would turn the fortunes of the club around. 


Exactly 12 months on, Postecoglou has been reflecting on his team in Glasgow as he sets to go again for pre-season in the coming weeks. 

He told Sky Sports, “I have had a lot of success but this is the hardest challenge and the hardest year, I have ever had,” said the former Australian manager as he reflected on 365 days in charge.

“I interviewed after the game and I couldn’t put into words exactly what was the strongest emotion.” 

“I think looking back now and the way we finished off in the last game, I think there was a part of me that said, ‘no I don’t want to be the full stop.”

“This season was about building the first foundation of a team that I hope will be competing and be successful in the Premiership for the next few years.”


“We have had a process, we have had success in the transfer market without a massive spend. That’s the club we are and that’s the area I want us to continue to grow in and that’s what we will do.”
