On Saturday, movie theatres all around the nation offered plenty of popcorn and drink as part of a one-day promotion to celebrate National Cinema Day. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the Hollywood studios didn't stand to lose much if there weren't any brand-new blockbusters playing on Labor Day. In contrast to the previous day, when only 1 million people went to the movies, more than 8 million people did so on that day, making it the most popular day of the year. 

Spider-Man: No Way Home's re-release by Sony declared success. According to projections from Sunday, the superhero movie swung to an estimated $6 million for the three days and $7.6 million for the four.

One drawback: Although it was a remarkable performance for a rerelease, especially one of a relatively recent film, that was the lowest gross for a No. 1 Labor Day film in years. 

Spider-Man: No Way Home, which earned over $1.9 billion globally after its release in December 2021, a pandemic-era best, may or may not be the Labor Day weekend winner. Estimates from competing studios predict that Top Gun: Maverick might win.
