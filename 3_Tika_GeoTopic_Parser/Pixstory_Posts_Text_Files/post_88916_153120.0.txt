The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Iranian government officials, in response to the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, on October 6. 
Amini was detained by the morality police in September, on grounds of not covering her head with a hijab. She collapsed at a police station and died three days later. 
After her death, protests aroused in various cities across the country, where women publicly chopped off their hair and burnt their hijab, challenging the Iran leadership. 
Now, U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated seven high-ranking leaders for financial penalties due to the shutdown of Iran’s internet, repression of speech and violence inflicted on protesters and civilians. Iran's interior and communications ministers and several law enforcement leaders were also targeted for sanctions. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the sanctions demonstrate the “United States stands with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.” 
The US said earlier for restoring the 2015 nuclear deal or Joint comprehensive plan of action with Iran based on mutual compliance. 
But, Amid the massive protests and human rights abuses, US would not strike the nuclear deal, to provide Tehran with billions in sanctions relief in exchange for the agreeing to roll back its nuclear program.
