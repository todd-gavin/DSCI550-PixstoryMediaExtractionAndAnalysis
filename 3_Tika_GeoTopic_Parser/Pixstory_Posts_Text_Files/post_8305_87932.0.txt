Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic continues to add his name to the NBA record books, becoming the second-fastest player in NBA history to reach the 10,000 points, 5,000 rebounds and 3,000 assists club. 

In the Nuggets' 127-109 win over the Wizards, Jokic recorded his career 10,000th point and in the process joined the exclusive club in just 516 games.

The only player to do it faster than the Serbian was Larry Bird, who did it in 515 games.

Jokic finished the night with 29 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. It was the 44th time Jokic has recorded at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a game this season. 

Had he added two more assists, it would have been his 19th triple-double of the season, a category he already leads the league in.

For more context around Jokic's achievement, only three Nuggets players have recorded at least 10,000 career points for the franchise. 

Jokic is 3,969 points behind Carmelo Anthony for third-most in franchise history.

Jokic is averaging 26 points, 13.8 rebounds and 8.1 assists on the season. He, along with the 76ers' Joel Embiid, are considered the frontrunners for this season's MVP award. 

The two played each other for the first time this season earlier this week – a game in which Jokic led his Nuggets to a win – but Embiid was full of praise for the Denver big man postgame. 

"I love playing against the best and I’m always happy that it’s another big man," he said. "What he’s able to do, he’s a monster."
