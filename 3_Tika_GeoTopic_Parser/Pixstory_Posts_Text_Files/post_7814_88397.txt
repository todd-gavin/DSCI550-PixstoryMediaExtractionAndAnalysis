Frustrated to the core Want to fall again No spirit left to trust someone How do I try Leap of faiths Have left me on crossroads It would be worth every effort Why can t I go on then It s not the past I can t just be broken again These pieces took time Time to be put together again This persona now Is really just a curtain Pull it down To see the scars I want to feel these colours now It s been too much black and white I ll let my guard down Will the other one too My chaotic dreams Took me into darkness Will one of my delusional dreams Take me to the light Along these pathways Someone tell me What to do I m not stable enough to decide Too much wait Anxiety creeping over Do I believe my heart again This journey could be beautiful These new dreams of hope But this crippling doubt I can t even trust myself Life has taught me too many lessons Trying to let go of this fear Yet I feel hollow Tears still trickle down I still go silent for days All because I overthink Overthink that it all will fall apart Like everything in my life ever has Time will tell I ll go ahead with it Fighting my demons alongside Just fate be with me It could really lead to happiness Mir
