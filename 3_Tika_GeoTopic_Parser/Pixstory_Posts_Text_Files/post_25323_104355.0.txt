So I'm watching this drama currently and this scene was so funny!! There were rumours about the CEO being gay, which was a part of marketing indirectly and also because he has not been dating for many years as he's been busy with work, his family was asking him to get married to shove the rumours away and he took his bodyguard Bong Soon to have dinner with his family only to introduce her as her girlfriend which she was not at that time and her reactions were hilarious ðŸ˜‚
