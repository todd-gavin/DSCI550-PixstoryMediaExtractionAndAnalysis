Irina Kerimova has been described as Vladmir Bondarenko’s co-worker. She is also generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is said to be from Kharkiv.

Her profile on Facebook says that she was a private guitar teacher until she became the editor-in-chief of this Russian propaganda, Ukraine Today, website in 2017. “Quite a promotion!” wrote Benn Collins, a senior reporter with NBC News, on his Twitter handle.

“Also, interesting choice of mismatched earrings.”

This new propaganda operation has links to News Front and South Front, two Russian propaganda outfits identified by the US State Department in 2020, Facebook told the NBC News.

News Front and South Front are run by Alexander Malkevich, who ran the St. Petersburg troll farm after 2016, said Collins. The St. Petersburg troll farm was charged by Robert Mueller for interfering in the 2016 election, he added.

“Malkevich took it over after that, launching a site called USA Really. I talked to him about it in front of the White House in 2018. It was very weird.”

Malkevich was listed as part of sanctions by the US Treasury last year for his role in USA Really. Both USA Really and the 2016 troll farm were funded by Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin. Collins also posted a map of how he planned to target the US.

Here's a fun one: This is how Russia's most recent propaganda operation was targeting stories in each state.
