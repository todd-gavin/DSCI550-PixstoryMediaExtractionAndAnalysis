Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan have set the box office on fire with their latest release Vikram Vedha This was followed by another jump of on Sunday with estimates indicating figures in the range of Rs to crores With this the opening weekend of Vikram Vedha stands in the range Rs crores This is a good result for a film that started at Rs crores but an underwhelming outcome for a film that stars Hrithik Roshan in lead The film should have targeted a weekend in the North of Rs crores but sadly that has not happened The film has done well in the multiplexes however the mass belts have surprisingly not come on board the film despite the action packed treatment The remake factor has acted against Vikram Vedha side by side with the below mark marketing and promotional campaign It s not a battle lost yet as Vikram Vedha needs to stay steady on the next days and close the opening week with around Rs crores This will put the film in a position of showing some bump again over the nd weekend and reach a number that might be considered to be a respectable outcome if nothing more Business in places like Gujarat has been impacted by Navratri celebrations whereas some pockets of Kolkata and Bihar are impacted by Durga Pooja These centers should show better hold from Wednesday as the festive flavor will finally kick in from then
