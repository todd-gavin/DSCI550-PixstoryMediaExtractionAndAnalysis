I ve been cycling from a very young age and I almost take the same route every time thats the one by the Dal Lake Every time its has its own different vibe as its full with tourists admiring the Dal Lake Cycling always helps me ease my mind and feel relaxed The best feeling for me while cycling is the moment I reach the end of the Dal Lake and just sit and look at the sunset After this when the sun sets on the way back I m accompanied by a fresh breeze which is perfect for the tiring ride back The views from the Boulevard Road up until the Foreshore road and all the way back never ceases to amaze me Its really one of a kind
