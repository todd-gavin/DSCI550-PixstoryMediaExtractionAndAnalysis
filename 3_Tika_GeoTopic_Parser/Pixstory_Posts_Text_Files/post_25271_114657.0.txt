IMDb: 8/10
I LOVED THIS SHOW it was absolutely amazing!!! One of the best things I have ever watched the actors were perfect and their roles fit them perfectly. At first, I thought it was gonna be not really good and the thing that pulled me in were mostly the characters because throughout the show you can see every character developing into a new person especially So Mun and Ha Na, even though I loved this show I do have a few tweaks though cause I really wanted them to focus on so mun's life outside the noddle shop and how he is with his friends while the end kinda caught me off guard because of the thing So Mun said to his friends before (I won't say what it is to prevent spoilers) the ending was still great!!! I rewatched this show a thousand to one point I had to stop myself from how amazing it is and if you don't trust my opinion I would be happy to tell you that it got renewed 1 days after the finale was released and it broke OCN recordsðŸ¤¯ right. If you're a big fan of fantasy or the actors I really recommended you watch this show plus I am like obsessed with Jo Byung Gyu (the actor who plays So Mun) now cause his acting was so great!
