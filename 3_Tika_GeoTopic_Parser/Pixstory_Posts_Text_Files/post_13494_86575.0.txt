It has been 7 months since the fall of the republic in Afghanistan, but in these seven years we have witnessed another development in Ukraine, where unfortunately thousands of innocent people were forced to leave their homes, as in Afghanistan 7 months ago, see a picture below It depicts these two crises, which are real, and the dual policy of the West in accepting immigrants from the two countries.

In the hope of universal peace 🙏
