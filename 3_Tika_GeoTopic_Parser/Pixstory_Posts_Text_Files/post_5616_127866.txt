When it comes to choosing an outfit for office it gets tough for me as i have very less formals in my closet You can look good in formals too but you should know how to carry them i love wearing crop tops but you can t wear them in office every time Sad I have started buying shirts for myself which are crop and you can style them with trousers and pants this way you can wear them to your work place without making it casual Brown alwayssssss goes with beige color the combination looks minimal and effortless and i think i have carried it well Let s see your office fit
