â€œNo-makeup makeup has many different interpretations, but for me, it's highlighting what is already there. 

No-makeup sometimes just means that you can't actually see the makeup, not that there isn't any there. 

â€¢Steps to achieve â€˜No makeupâ€™ makeup look

â€¢So i like to keep my makeup light when iâ€™m going out, or when its summers. 

â€¢Iâ€™m a skincare person, so i love taking care of my skin, 
I start with my washing my face with Good gel based cleanser and then i message my face with ice then i top my skin with good light mat moisturiser and Good SPF. ðŸ§´

â€¢When it comes to apply makeup, i like to apply primer first to give mat finish and with than some good coverage BB creme with good tint blush on my cheeks , when i comes to eyes, i add some nude eye shadow and good coverage Mascara on my lashes to make it natural. 

â€¢On my lips i usually go for nude lipshades so, ya thatâ€™s how it will look natural and effortless. 

Thatâ€™s how you achieve your â€˜No-makeupâ€™ look. ðŸ˜Œ
