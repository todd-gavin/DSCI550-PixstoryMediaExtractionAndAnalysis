Why COVID leads to a spike in the blood sugar level Coronavirus infection can affect different organs of the body leading to varied symptoms A lot of these symptoms may linger for long after the initial infection worsening the symptoms of pre existing health conditions Even in case of diabetes it has been witnessed that the contagious virus can lead to severe infection and make the road to recovery burdensome Now new research suggests that it may also cause sudden onset of insulin dependent diabetes How COVID infection can lead to new diabetes cases As per a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts high level of stress experienced during the coronavirus infection can be the reason for the rise in the cases of diabetes post COVID They clarified that the condition diagnosed after the infection can be a temporary one rather than a permanent fixture That means rather than directly causing diabetes coronavirus infection can push the individual towards the pre diabetic phase or can flare up the symptoms of pre existing undiagnosed diabetes to be noticed by the physician The high blood sugar level after the infection can be a temporary condition caused by acute stress Why is diabetes caused after COVID infection is considered temporary Based on the detailed evaluation the researchers stated that the level of blood sugar suddenly goes high in recovered COVID patients then it is back to normal after a few weeks It remains high only for a short period so the condition is being considered as temporary or transitory But even for this short period the patient may need insulin or blood sugar medication What type of diabetes is it Based on the results of several other studies and cases of high blood sugar reported after the initial coronavirus infection scientists are still trying to understand the type of diabetes caused by COVID Both adults and teens are reported to be diagnosed with relatively high blood sugar levels so it is confusing to say if it is Type or Type diabetes Source
