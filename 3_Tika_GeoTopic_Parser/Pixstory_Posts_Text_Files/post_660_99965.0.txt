 A couple in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand are suing their only son and his wife for not giving them a grandchild after six years of marriage.
Sanjeev and Sadhana Prasad, 61 and 57, say they used up their savings raising their son, paying for his pilot's training as well as a lavish wedding.
They are demanding compensation worth nearly $650,000 (Â£525,000) if no grandchild is born within a year.
Their son and his wife do not appear to have commented.
The highly unusual lawsuit was filed on grounds of "mental harassment".
