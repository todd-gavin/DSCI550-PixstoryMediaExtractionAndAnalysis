A diet containing various fruits and vegetables can provide numerous health benefits. It may, for example, reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and overall mortality while promoting a healthy complexion and hair, increased energy, and weight moderation.
But there's something unique about avocados; they can fit anywhere and everywhere.
Research has shown how avocados can help during pregnancy.
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, nutrient demands significantly increase.
For example, during pregnancy.
"Folate requirements increase from 400 μg to 600 μg.
Potassium needs jump from 2,600 mg to 2,900 mg.
Vitamin C needs to increase from 75 to 85 mg."
Folate needs to increase significantly during pregnancy. Unfortunately, many pregnant people worldwide fall short of the recommended folate intake, which may increase the risk of pregnancy complications.
One avocado delivers 27% of the recommended folate intake during pregnancy.
Eating avocados can also help you reach the recommended intake levels for nutrients that are needed in more significant amounts during pregnancy and breastfeeding, like vitamin C, potassium, and B6.
Additionally, the high fibre content of avocados may help prevent constipation, which is extremely common during pregnancy.
Try stuffing half an avocado with salmon salad or chicken salad for a satisfying pregnancy- and breastfeeding-friendly meal or snack idea.
