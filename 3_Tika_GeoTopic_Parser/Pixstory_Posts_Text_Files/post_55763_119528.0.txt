Witchetty grubs is the most authentic of bush tucker, as per CNN, the grub is a nutty-flavored bite that has been enjoyed by indigenous Australians for thousands of years. The wider Australian nation has often struggled with eating it raw, but two facts remain -- it actually tastes good and it belongs to the land.

On the other hand, we have Emu!

Emu actually has a few times the iron content of beef. It's virtually fat-free and is low in cholesterol. The Australian native animal works well when smoked and served cold or as a pizza topping. For a modern gourmet twist, have it in a pie made up of emu meat, smoked emu, feta cheese, red wine, sun-dried tomato, onion and Tasmanian black pepper -- all in a filo-pastry crust.

So which one do you prefer?
