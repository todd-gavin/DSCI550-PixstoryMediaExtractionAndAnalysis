It's all about the Stars üåü and the Sky‚õàÔ∏è.

So Hello everyone this is Gatha aka Shayera , and my journey has been simple yet extraordinary having  my support system by my side .So as a Kid it was never a thought to become a poet but destiny had some different plans . Becoming a poet and discovering  my self worth is the biggest achievement i have in this journey.
     My best friend was the one who recognised my work and that too happened in school . There was once when i decided to change my stream from Commerce to Arts and that affected me a lot ,people had a lot to say but Steffi aka my Sukoon said "Tu kar legi ,tension mat le" and actually I did it , scored well and proved myself. In this journey i became a poet , a guest poet for Khayal community and now a host too .The path was not easy , had a lot of breakdowns , was demotivated too but never gave up ,kept going on. Even in this journey i discovered my voice as a medium to express and people started loving it then open mics and what not .In Covid there was a lot to face, lot  to struggle was broken completely but my Shining Sky (Steffi) was there to lift me up and let me shine brightly in this universe. 
        This Journey continued , this friendship continued and Sifu Shayera (Sisha) became the Co-author in 3 Anthologies.

"Yaar tu kar sakti hai ,tere par mujhe bharosa hai" bas yeh hi Alfaaz ne Gatha Ko Shayera banaya.

Never give up , Because you do have a story to share and inspire.

Kavi hu mai toh meri kavita ho tum,
Dil hu mai toh usmein basi mohabaat ho tum,
Kalam hu mai toh meri Alfaaz ho tum,
Sitara hu mai toh mera Aasman ho tum.‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è

Thank you.
