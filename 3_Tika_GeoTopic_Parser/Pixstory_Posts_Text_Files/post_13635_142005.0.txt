 The United Nations Children's Fund or UNICEF has created educational classes for earthquake-affected children in Khost and Paktika provinces.
In a tweet on Sunday, UNICEF said that it has created 140 mobile educational classes for children in the earthquake-affected areas.
Based on the information of the United Nations Children's Protection Fund, 4 thousand boys and girls are engaged in education in the classrooms created.
