Because once again people in the west have decided they have the right to put labels on women fighting for their rights against their systemic oppression.
Western activists have called women in Iran burning their hijabs 'Islamophobic.' 
Basically, muslim women in Iran who are being assaulted and murdered for not wanting to wear a headscarf are being called Islamophobic for resisting. Just think for a minute and realize just how absurd that sounds.
The absolute ignorance in our attitude towards Iranian women screams white feminism. A woman's choice to wear a hijab is feminism. A woman's choice to reject a hijab is feminism. A woman resistance is absolute feminism. In this time, Iranian women need our support and we should be amplifying their voices instead of vilifying them for fighting for their human rights.
Islamophobic is not muslim women protesting against forced hijab laws, Islamophobic is privileged people asking muslim women to silently endure abuse and murder for wanting to dress how they want to.
