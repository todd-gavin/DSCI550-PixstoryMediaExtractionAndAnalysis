I belong to an indian household , and i know how the day begins -  with a piping hot and big cup of tea along with newspaper ! Well , Are you amongst those millions of people who take tea as first thing in the morning ?? While we all consider it as a healthy practice ! But the truth is this is unhealthy practice ! ❌

Today i will tell you some reasons why you must avoid starting your day with tea ; ☕

1 It disturbs your acid and alkaline balance .
2 It can also inhibit absorption of nutrients .
3 It can also lead to dehydration causing constipation .

Initially , giving up this habit which you have been following for years might be difficult , but definitely not impossible . I'm not saying you to give up this addiction of having tea completely but try making these small changes ; ☕✅

1 Begin your day with 2 glasses of water and have tea 15-20 mins later .
2 Cut down a portion of tea by having it in a small cup and not a mug .
3 Stop taking biscuit and rusks along , and replace it with 8-10 soaked almonds and 2 walnut kernels .

I'm really not a fan of tea and being honest i don't start my day with tea not even with coffee . I start my day with water and having water is much better than having tea . ✅

Remember - It's all about starting , and that's the hardest part ! ❤️

Have a nice day everyone ❤️
