MAMAMOO Hwasa revealed the reason she released "Maria" and its empowering message to women who went through the same struggles as her. In KBS2's entertainment show, "Stopping on the Road Once," which aired on March 10, MAMAMOO Hwasa appeared as a special guest and went on a trip to Seoul with Lee Geum Hee and Lee Sun Hee. During the broadcast, "National Diva" Lee Sun Hee mentioned Hwasa's solo track, "Maria," and told the singer she likes it a lot. Just then, the MAMAMOO singer revealed the deeper and painful story behind the track. While talking about their career as musicians, veteran singer-songwriter Lee Sun Hee praised Hwasa, saying:

"I listened to your song 'Maria' and I initially thought the song was meant for same-age friends but I didn't know it have a more painful and deep background. I like it so much." In particular, "Maria" was co-written by Hwasa. The song depicts people's struggles and their desire to run away.
Hwasa the revealed the special meaning of the song:
"There is something I learned from looking at the details and saying that it is a way of expressing painful stories casually like this.
Just because you're exposed (in terms of the outfit) and have different makeups, you're considered a bad person.
These people telling you, 'Yes, I'll make you cry,' makes you think, 'Do you want me to just cry?' or 'Do you want me to be sick?"
For this reason, the female idol decided to express her feelings through this song, particularly having a hard time.
"It's a song that gives me comfort."
As for why the title is "Maria," Hwasa continued it's her baptismal name.
