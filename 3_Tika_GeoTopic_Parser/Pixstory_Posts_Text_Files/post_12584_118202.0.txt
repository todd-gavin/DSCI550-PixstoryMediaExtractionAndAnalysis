It takes much of a time to learn and know about ourselves more. Especially when our defense mechanisms work to hide emotions from consciousness, it becomes a challenge to know about how one feels. The cornerstone for a sound psychological health is communication and this is a two stage process where we open up to ourself and then how we advocate about those feelings to others. 

And so in reality how often do we understand our feelings ?. We just take the emotional temperature and simply assume that what we feel is only what we're consciously aware of: I'm in a good/bad mood today; work's stressing me; I'm not angry, I just don't feel like talking. We're satisfied with the answer we get and accept it as something we just have to live with. 

But you really don't just have to limit to it, because there are tools with which you can learn to help one find what feelings are being cooked up beneath the surface that have more to do with our current state than we'd imagine.Â  First you can start by taking an emotional temperature - 

Ask yourself: 

What are the feelings that am I aware of having ? (There can be many) 

What is the most prominent one ? 

Describe more and don't be afraid to push yourself from answers like fine or okay. Continue more on it. 

When did I become aware of this feeling? 

Don't rush through the process and record the questions and answers. Describe each feelings thoroughly and be sure to include the pleasurable ones. It's important to know what enhances your life. 

These questions can take you to different places perhaps, you haven't been before. And you may he surprised with the details or the memories you get that wasn't available before.
