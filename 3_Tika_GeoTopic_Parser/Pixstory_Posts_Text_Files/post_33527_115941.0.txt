Years passed, and the significance of the place and the Bodhi tree, below which the Buddha had attained enlightenment, was realized. During the time of the Great King Asoka, in the 3rd century B.C, the place had already started attracting pilgrims from across different lands. Asoka in his zeal had started the construction of Stupas for the propagation of the Dhamma. Bodh Gaya received his immediate attention. He constructed the Vajrasana (a pedestal below the Bodhi tree), where the Buddha sat and meditated, and constructed a railing to surround the sacred site. A Stupa was constructed nearby to act as a symbol of reverence of the Buddha. 

Over the years, the importance of the site had increased, and it had started attracting pilgrims from even distant countries. In the patronage received, a new temple was constructed around the 2nd/1st century B.C. Gradually in the later Gupta age, probably around 500 A.D. the main Vajrasana temple gave way for the construction of the greater Mahabodhi temple, which was in place when the Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang visited in the 7th century A.D. The main statue was probably made of Gold and the site must have appeared grand and full of scenes from the life of the Buddha.  The temple site abounded with the statues of his different mudras, and monasteries were built around for meditation by the visiting souls. The site became very famous worldwide and every visitor was fully aware about the legend of the Buddha and his times. The same temple as seen by Hieun Tsang stands to this day.
