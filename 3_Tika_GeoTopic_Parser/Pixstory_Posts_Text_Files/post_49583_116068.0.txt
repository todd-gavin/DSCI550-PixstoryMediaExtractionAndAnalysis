The major ecosystems of the planets have already been affected in irreversible or heavily unchangeable ways.

The Arctic has entered an unprecedented state that threatens global climate stability spelling deep trouble for the entire planet.

The ecologically fragile Sundarbans region in India and Bangladesh has lost 25% of mangroves due to erosion over the past three decades. Mangrove forests are imperiled by unregulated coastal development, shrinking of deltas and abrupt climate change.

Amazon Rainforest: 'The tipping point is here, it is now,’ according to scientists. 

Mesoamerican Coral Reef are world's 2nd largest reef. It stretches 1,000 km from northern tip of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula toward Bay Islands in northern Honduras. It's critically endangered; high risk from mass bleaching. It collapses at 1.5- 2°C global warming (2020s--2030s).

According to Royal Society Publishing, 'The ecosystem is at high risk from mass bleaching in the coming decades, with compounding effects of ocean acidification, hurricanes, pollution and fishing. The overall status of the ecosystem is Critically Endangered'

In areas where the Antarctic ice disappears, the whole system on the seafloor is going to change.

Infernos in South America’s Pantanal region have burnt twice the area of California’s fires this year. Researchers fear the rare ecosystem will never recover.

Central Asia faces ecological breakdown as it fast becomes one of the hottest and driest places on the planet. Desertification now threatens half a billion people, with crops ravaged by drought.

A major biodiversity collapse in The Cerrado savannas (second in extent only to Amazonian forests amongst the South American biomes) is being engendered by rapid agribusiness, infrastructure development & ill-designed, poorly enforced environmental laws.

Lake Chad: an 'ecological catastrophe'. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warns that the lake could totally disappear within decades.

Scientists say the Great Barrier Reef is at point of irreversible damage.
