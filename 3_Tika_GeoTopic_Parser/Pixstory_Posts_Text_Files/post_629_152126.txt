My challenge is on a very different account Political May be to certain extent as I have always found a very sane very balanced leader in Shashi Tharoor Whether it s reaching out to opposition leaders being civil yet being a critical in a very effective way In an NDTV interview He started with praising Prime Minster Modi for his oratory skills but went on to call it his weakness as there is a disconnect between the oratory and implementation As always Mr Tharoor manages to find the perfect words at the right time He for sure is a word machine That is one of my reasons to support Tharoor I mean when ever someone tries to impress with language we call him Tharoor Infact once I was talking to a friend about an academic in kashmir I had no qualms calling him Tharoor of Kashmir because he sounded as eloquent as Tharoor I am not saying equally opulent Infact I am not even using that term People might get offended and use it against him in todays politics well bred educated well read well spoken is not a virtue anymore Besides I am not even saying that Congress party needs a charming president I am not even suggesting Mr Tharoor is a charmer But the fact is he doesn t come across and bitter and cynical as the rest of the Congressmen He even extends his wishes to fierce opposition leaders on their special occasions He doesn t look grumpy and he certainly hasn t given up Not to talk of Mr Tharoor being a good looking person That surely cannot be a qualification for a leader If it all comes as a package no one will mind On a serious note Tharoor is exactly what the party needs and should hope it gets Tharoor is dynamic he comes with no baggage or family and has come far with his own merit He is answer to everything the party has ever been criticised for He is ambitious intelligent succeeded to win elections Something that might pull the middle class voter back to Congress
