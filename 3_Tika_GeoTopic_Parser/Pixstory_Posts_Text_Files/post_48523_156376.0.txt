"Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." (1 Thessalonians 5:18)
The benefits of showing and practicing gratitude are nearly limitless. People who consistently practise gratitude by noticing and reflecting on the things they're grateful for feel more alive, sleeping better, expressing more compassion and generosity, and even having stronger immune systems! Everything that happens, happens with the Lord's will. And we must always be thankful. Am
