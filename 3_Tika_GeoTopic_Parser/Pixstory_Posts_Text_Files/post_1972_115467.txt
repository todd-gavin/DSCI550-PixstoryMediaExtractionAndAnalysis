As of today the January th committee has not summoned nor signaled that it would summon the Secret Service agents who contested a significant portion of Cassidy Hutchinson s statements to testify and be questioned before the committee This is unfortunate but not unexpected The objective of these investigative panels is to investigate and uncover what transpired Their goal is to discover the truth Despite this the committee seems hesitant to align with this objective Witnesses who saw the events that a former witness swore happened or who were contemporaneously aware of those events have come forward and indicated they are prepared to testify and counter Cassidy Hutchinson s assertions They should have immediately been called to speak to the committee If the committee s goal was to discover the truth untrustworthy witnesses would not be permitted to mislead them Witnesses are capable of lying misremembering misunderstanding miscommunicating and communicating false information from others In other words the absence of truthful statement does not always imply deception In light of this the evidence of Secret Service agents who worked closely with the information and who are ready to refute her testimony should be presented if doing so will facilitate the discovery of the truth We do not know Cassidy Hutchinson s credibility as a witness However we can reach this assessment much more readily if we enable additional individuals privy to the information she discussed to speak before the committee Let s not spin the truth let s uncover it
