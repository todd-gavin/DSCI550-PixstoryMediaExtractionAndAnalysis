After a disappointing kickoff to their U-17 Women’s World Cup campaign, Team India had a lot to prove in today’s match against Morocco. Although Morocco are a fairly easier opposition and they made sure not to repeat last match’s 8-0 humiliation (against USA), this match was no better for the Indian girls as far as the outcome is concerned. The Blues lost 3-0 against Morocco tonight and with this, they have now lost all chances of qualifying for the knockout stage. 
Although the Indian manager Thomas Dennerby had promised in last match’s post-match press conference that fans would see a better performance against Morocco, we barely saw any new and improved intensity. The same mistakes that the Indian players did in the last match were mostly repeated today and for the first few minutes, it seemed like they were having a hard time figuring out what exactly they had to do. 
Morocco were unlucky not to score in the first half but they broke the deadlock very early on in the second half through a penalty which was perfectly converted by Doha El Madani. They doubled their lead through Yasmine Zouhir’s goal barely 10 minutes after the penalty. In the dying minutes of the game, i.e, in the injury time, Djennah Cherif sealed the deal with Morocco’s third goal. 
The difference in intensities was easily visible in the post-match statistics as well. Morocco attempted 20 shots (10 on target) while India attempted just 3 (1 on target). Morocco dominated a 62% possession throughout the match. Even after conceding their first goal, India seemed to have no intent to redeem themselves and they let the opposition get deeper and deeper into their area. 
The competition is practically over for India now and their last match against Brazil is nothing but a mere formality.
