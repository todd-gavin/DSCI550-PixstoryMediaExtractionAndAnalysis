 The answer to this question is another question does teaching history create intolerance CRT is been slowly removed from the syllabus in schools and would slowly erase the word racism from the textbooks too Racism is not a myth it s something rooted in the minds of many people by the education they receive schools home or even by the discrimination they face CRT tends to point out the infused racism in history behaviour language and even in the legal norms For example in the s government officers drew lines marked around areas considered poor financial risks often due to the racial composition of inhabitants Banks even declined the request on mortgages to Black people in those areas Shouldn t this be known In a society we cannot deny the fact that some people enjoy the privileges Are the facilities in a hotel for a celebrity and a taxi driver the same No similarly racist privileges also exist One way to erase it is being aware of it and correcting ourselves in situations where we tend to be racist This awareness should be given from a very young age so that we could fight the conditioning more easily Even though it s not impossible it is difficult for a year old to change their conditioned stigma Moreover if I am a Jew I do need to know about what Jews have faced in the Holocaust it might cause intolerance or affect my mental health Still it s my right to know about the history I have the right to feel intolerant A similar case applies to all the people Even the White Majority should understand their history It s okay for all the people to feel proud of the promising deeds and it s okay to be ashamed of the cruelty Just that the awareness should be used to recreate the good deeds and never repeat the bad ones Even though good and bad are subjective discrimination in the end is not something to be proud of Rather than making laws to fight intolerance America prepare make environments wherein racism should not even be thought about
