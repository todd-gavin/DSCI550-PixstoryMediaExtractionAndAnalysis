The fashion world has a short attention span, but when the spotlight is on a designer (or a photographer, a stylist, or model), no light shines hotter or brighter. And perhaps because that sphere is a place of great obsession, there is only room for a few at a time. That means the same handful of brands are generally driving all conversation. Shows are rarely divisive anymore, and the designers everyone seems to be talking about at any given time are almost always working with the same key palette of ideas. It can be tough to remember that, outside of the fashion world (and even within it), there are brands who arenâ€™t dressing all the right celebrities and churning out it-bags with fans and followers.
