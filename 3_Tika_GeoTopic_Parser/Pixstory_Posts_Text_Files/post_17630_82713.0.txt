LeBron James has returned home to Cleveland for the NBA All-Star weekend. Having played brilliantly all season, the four-time NBA champion was selected for the game as a captain for the fifth time in succession.

He posted a picture on Instagram, where he looked ecstatic about being back home. The 37-year0old has a team filled with superstars like Steph Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and DeMar DeRozan.

James was certainly looking forward to the break, as he has been exhausted after playing big minutes for the LA Lakers. However, he is a bonafide winner, and will hope to keep his streak of victories as a captain. His picture on Instagram certainly proved how excited he is to be back home. James captioned it:

"The hometown kid is BAAAAACCCCCCKKKKKK!!!! Ya HEARD #ThekidfromAKRON🤴🏾 #AllStar22⭐️"

LeBron James' selection this year marked the 18th time he has made it to the All-Star game. He, along with Kobe Bryant, are the only two stars to have had as many appearances. If he continues to compete at an elite level next season, James could go level with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 19 All-Star appearances.

Keeping all the baggage from the season aside, the King will hope to have fun and enjoy his stay at home.

The 37-year-old won the city of Cleveland an NBA championship, fulfilling the promise he delivered. He is one of the most beloved players in the city, and when he makes it to the court, a loud cheer can be expected.
