Men-on-women domestic violence is one of the most frequently committed crimes on the globe.

How come women get stuck in relationships like this? I mean, it shouldn't be rocket science to know to run for the hills at the first red flag, isn't it? Apparently not. And that has a lot to do with how we are brought up. Both men and women. Most people, especially men, think patriarchy or 'gender wars' are a thing of the internet. They act like it doesn't exist in real life. However, it is far from the truth. And the stats are the biggest proof of them. One in three American women has suffered some sort of mild violence from her partner, and one in seven women has been injured by her intimate partner. And this is just physical. In countries across Asia and the Pacific, surveys indicate that between 15 and 68 percent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner. These rates are alarmingly high.

How do women fall for such men?
The romanticization of toxic and borderline abusive behaviour in the media causes women, especially young girls, to fancy it. Once again, how they're brought up adds to it too.

Why do men get violent to their partners?
There is no uniform reason for marital violence. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Domestic violence against women is caused by a complex combination of sociological/behavioral, historical, religious, and cultural causes. The difference between the upbringing of men and women is significant. While men are taught to be dominant, controlling and 'alpha', women are taught to be polite, nice and tolerant.

We have to make more safe spaces for women!!
