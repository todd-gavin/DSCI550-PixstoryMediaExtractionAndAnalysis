I see so many health influencers posting about how bad it is to cut out carbs or how you don t need to do that to see results But are these the right people to turn to for advice Let me be clear I don t think keto or low carb is a way of eating everyone needs to follow for every goal But if you are struggling with weight loss insulin resistance prediabetes or other metabolic related issues low carb is an extremely effective strategy Most cases these influencers are speaking from an inability to cut carbs out of their diet themselves Or in some cases them not needing to cut carbs because they are already metabolically healthy insulin sensitive But you might not be so that advice to you isn t all that helpful Look eating whatever you want and keeping calories low can work But it ll be hell Your hunger and cravings will be at an all time high your energy might be low micronutrient intake subpar intake of nutrients that damage gut health high and most importantly research shows that this approach is more likely to lead to weight regain after diet cessation A far better and more effective approach for most people would be to reduce carb intake to allow their blood sugar and insulin levels to normalize which will improve metabolic health increase energy allow for easier weight loss and if done correctly easier maintenance of that weight loss Health influencers are great but choose to follow the ones who have a better grasp of the science and understand where you are at on your health journey
