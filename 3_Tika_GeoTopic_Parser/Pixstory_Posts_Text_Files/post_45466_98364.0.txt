Current Real Madrid Boss Carlo Ancelotti has said that he is open to the idea of coaching a 
national side in the near future and would possibly love to coach a team during the 2026 FIFA world cup with keenness on coaching the Canadian national football team if the opportunity arises.

The Italian earlier last week after guiding Real Madrid to their 35th La Liga title became the first-ever manager of the game to win all the major top five European Leagues. Carlo Ancelotti won the Premier League with Chelsea, Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, Serie A with AC Milan and Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and now led Real Madrid to a title.

Ahead of his side’s Champions League 2nd leg clash, the manager was asked by AmazonPrime (Italy) if he’s looking and open to manage any national side in the future “Certainly not for 
this World Cup. World Cup 2026, why not? I'd love to, sure. Canada has done very well” he 
responded.

It is also to note, that his wife Mariann Barrena McClay was born in Canada, and it is understood that they own a house in Vancouver.

The Canadian football side have managed to qualify for the World Cup for the 1st time since 1986 and on the other hand, the Italian national team has failed to qualify for the mega event second time in a row.

The manager also spoke about his achievement and said "Today we have to celebrate, not talk.

I want to celebrate. It fills me with pride to win in the five major leagues. I can say that I like what I do. It means I've done pretty well."
