Satan This component of the unholy trinity is perhaps the one we know the most about Satan who used to go by the name Lucifer used to live in heaven with the other angels He became enamoured with himself and managed to enlist one third of heaven to join him in his self worship Revelation Satan and his demons were driven out of heaven by God They will spend eternity in the burning lake at the end of the book of Revelation Knowing this Satan wishes to bring as many people as possible to eternal damnation with him He began his dominion by introducing sin into the world through Adam and Eve Genesis and he will not stop until his reign is over Anti Christ We most likely haven t seen them yet or at the very least they haven t revealed themselves to be the character that causes havoc in Revelation What evidence do we have for this Someone must after all meet a particular set of requirements He She must wield significant power over the public such that they are wooed by love this figure Revelation This person requires enormous power over a one world government including control over religion currency and calendars Revelation This figure must lead a Roman renaissance and be violently anti Christian and anti God Revelation False Prophet There are many false prophets today and throughout history but this one in particular uses demonic powers to accomplish miracles Revelation The false prophet will work hand in hand with the first beast antichrist leading many people astray The false prophet will persuade many people to take the Mark of the Beast by performing signs and wonders He or she will utilise the power of the tongue to persuade many others not to believe In any god After all if someone bears the Mark of the Beast they will be denied entry to heaven Everyone will be persuaded to worship the antichrist by the false prophet
