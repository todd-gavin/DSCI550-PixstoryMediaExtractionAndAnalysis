After being nominated two times for his performances in The Pursuit of Happyness and Ali, Will Smith has finally done it. In his emotional acceptance speech, he thanked his two co-actors. He thanked Venus and Serena Williams. He talked about how he wants to become a vessel of love. He also said a thing that another legendary actor Denzel Washington said to him, "At your highest moment thats when the devil comes for you."
Will Smith said that he's not crying because of  winning the award. I personally believe that with everything going on in his life, this role was super close to him and he really felt what Richard went through so it was just his journey  as an actor that he was reminded of in this moment. Will Smith just like his acting showed his grace through out the speech.
