The Paris Saint-Germain women's team manager, Grace Geyoro and Sara Däbritz spoke about the Rouge et Bleu's elimination this Saturday 30 April at the Parc des Princes in the UEFA Women's Champions League semi-final.

"I'm proud of my team, they conceded from Lyon's first chance after a good start, we were doing what we wanted to do. I felt that the Parisian team was in good shape when they conceded first, after that it was hard to get back into the game. Then in the second half, the idea was to equalise first and then give ourselves the means to win with the support of the crowd. I remember the stadium pushing us on, which was wonderful, we felt a real chemistry between the team and the fans, despite the score. So despite the disappointment, they didn't stop for 95 minutes so I really want to thank them. For their support, for their help, and I think it's a very positive point for women's football and our Parisian team."

SARA DÄBRITZ

"We are very disappointed because we lost this game and our goal was to go to the final. It's a difficult moment, but it was also a special match in front of all our fans, I want to thank them for the crazy atmosphere. It was magical to play here today, even if we are disappointed to have lost. I am proud of the team because we played this semi-final well, we are learning. Honestly, it was a magical night in front of all these fans, it was incredible and thank you to everyone who came to the stadium today, it was a crazy atmosphere and we had fun on the pitch. If we had won, it would have been better..."

GRACE GEYORO

"It was not an easy match, we had to get a result from start to finish, and we are not necessarily used to that, but we tried to push, we managed to score a goal, we were pushed on by the crowd.
