William Hurt was blond, slim, and broodingly gorgeous, with a dark-star glimmer and the looks of a preppy in self-doubt. Nigel Andrews rightly pointed out that his peculiar drawl — slow, subtle, enunciated — was that of a stage-trained actor surprised, even amused, to find himself directing pictures in Hollywood's semi-artistic side-currents. He gave a melancholy gleam to films in the quirkier, more adventurous areas of American cinema during the 1980s, and occasionally beyond. 

Hurt, who died at the age of 71, was best known for his first leading performance as a human guinea pig in Ken Russell's 1980 alternative-reality sci-fi drama Altered States. The following year, he was even better as the womanising lawyer in Lawrence Kasdan's high-style homage to Double Indemnity, Body Heat.

Hurt had a privileged upbringing. His mother was a Time Inc executive, while his father was a US Agency for International Development diplomat in Washington. Hurt was born in the United States capital on March 20, 1950, and spent part of his childhood in Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan. He studied drama and literature in school and theology at university in the United States before enrolling as an acting student at New York City's prestigious Juilliard School.

FT reported that Hurt is survived by a daughter and three sons — children of a man who was, just for a while, rather a greater than a lesser god in Hollywood’s alternative universe of questioning, challenging cinema.
