If the victory at Assen seemed to have cleared the sky of the clouds over Pecco Bagnaia, the MotoGP vice world champion plunged back into a moment of tension and controversy On holiday in Ibiza during the summer break of the world championship, the Turin rider was involved in a car accident without consequences probably caused by the alcohol content three times above the allowed limit mg l against the mg l allowed in Spain Immediate apologies from the pilot I celebrated my victory in Assen with my friends When I left the disco and faced a roundabout I ended up with front wheels in a ditch without involving other vehicles or people The blood alcohol check carried out by the police revealed that I had drunk more than permitted by Spanish law I am very sorry for what happened I am practically a teetotaler and it was a serious frivolity that it had to happen I apologize to everyone and I can assure you that I have learned my lesson Never get behind the wheel after drinking alcohol Thank you Instagram photos sorry
