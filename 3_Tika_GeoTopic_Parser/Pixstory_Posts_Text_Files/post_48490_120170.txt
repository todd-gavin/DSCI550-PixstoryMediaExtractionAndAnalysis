This quote is very close to my heart God gives us so much without asking anything in return He s so merciful and selfless so giving and kind And in return we don t give him anything Not that he needs us to He s just all giving All he ever desires is gratitude But it makes me so much happiness to think we can do good things everyday and return a little of all the favors he s done to us We can be better Christians everyday A prayer makes him happy charity makes him happy an act of kindness makes him happy baptizing your child makes him happy From something as small as smiling to something as big as bringing a new life to this world we have so many ways to show him we love him just like he loves us This is a beautiful realization and everyday it inspires me to become a better believer To not doubt to not question to follow the path of Christ
