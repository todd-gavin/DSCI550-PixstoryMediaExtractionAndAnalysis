Why Politicians are Smarter Once a CM and his Deputy went to inspect a school and a prison School was in very poor state with no furniture dilapidated building etc The Principal requested for Rs lakhs to help to improve conditions Next they visited a prison There too the condition was pathetic but the jailer demanded Rs lakhs to improve the condition of the cells They came back and the CM wrote a cheque for Rs lakhs for the Jail Puzzled by the CM s decision his deputy asked for an explanation as to why prison and not the school The CM explained You and me are definitely not going to go to school anymore in future but we both may go to Jail Therefore the facilities in prison must be improved so that our stay will be comfortable
