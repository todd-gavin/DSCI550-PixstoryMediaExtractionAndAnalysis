So many amazing movies released this year and so many more are yet to come But one of the most awaited movie among the releases in was Uncharted If you love a good treasure hunt Uncharted is the movie for you It was the perfect mix of action and treasure hunt with a bit of mystery Nate was a fantastic main character His backstory was covered beautifully and the mystery of his missing brother will keep you hooked until the end of the movie At first Sully seems like the antagonist but you learn to trust him Chloe was a great accomplice and she added a lot to the plot Braddock played her part as the villain beautifully She added the emotions from her past events into the story amazingly Uncharted built the plot all the way up to the very end Be sure to wait for the end credits scenes The special effects of the movie were immaculate and looked real I think Uncharted is one of my favorite movies I have seen recently Uncharted is definitely worth seeing It s one of the finest movies released in the recent times
