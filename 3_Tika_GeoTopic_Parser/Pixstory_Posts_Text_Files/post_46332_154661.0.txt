Why do we see so many Indian men with pot bellies ?
That is because men genetically have a tendency to store fat first on their stomach , and only when they run out of space there does it get stored elsewhere in the body ! 
ðŸ”¹There are 2 types of fat ; 
1 Subcutaneous fat - the one that you can pinch on your tummy , lies under the skin .
2 Visceral fat - lodged deep in your stomach around the intestines , liver and kidneys .
This keeps growing to give you the pot belly !
ðŸ”¹Reasons why Men have pot bellies :
1 Eating too many simple carbohydrates 
2 Stress from a bad workplace , an unhappy relationship or a difficult academic life .
3 Lipoprotein lipase , an enzyme necessary for fat storage , men have higher concentration of this enzyme in the abdomen and hence are pot-bellied .
4 Drinking alcohol , especially whiskey and beer which are notorious for storing fat .
6 Eating the wrong food or at the wrong time or both .
7 Jobs that demands sitting for longer durations . 
At this point I have a bad news and a good news ; 
ðŸ”¹ Bad : Itâ€™s next to impossible to actually target and spot-bust fat pockets .
ðŸ”¹Good : However , the upshot is that since visceral fat is metabolically active , itâ€™s the first type to burn off if you exercise regularly ! 
But for those who canâ€™t take time out for work outs , making Dietary changes can do wonders for their body ; 
1 Donâ€™t overindulge and give the carbs a miss at night .
2 Eat small meals every two hours , six-seven times a day . 
3 Eat more veggies , fruit and probiotic curds to stay light .
4 Include beans and spinach , as they make you feel full .
5 Get a healthy diet plan from a professional .
