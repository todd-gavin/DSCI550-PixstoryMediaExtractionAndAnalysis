Humane slaughter has got to be the silliest oxymoron I ve ever heard I wonder how such a term has found its place in our dictionary When you re killing an innocent creature you re committing the most heinous crime on this earth How can that be humane Even if people meant to say it for a painless death that doesn t make any sense either First there s no such thing as a comfortable slaughter in factories The cattle are forced to breed in cramped and suffocating cages And one thing that s popular these days is cage free products which I tell you is so messed up Just because the birds aren t in cages doesn t mean they are enjoying their life on farms A thing like Humane Slaughter doesn t exist It is just one of the tricks of marketers to make you believe you are being generous by buying their humane meat Lemme burst your bubble No you re not So stop kidding yourself
