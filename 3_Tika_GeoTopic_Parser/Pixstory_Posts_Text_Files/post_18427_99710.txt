Juventus CEO Maurizio Arrivabene spoke to Sky microphones in the hours leading up to the Coppa Italia final between the black and whites and Inter He answered questions about the upcoming transfer market after a certainly not brilliant season and about the January signing that has so far disappointed the expectations of some fans Dusan Vlahovic What blows the fans can expect in the next market It will be a rather strange market for the arrival of the World Cup The winter session will probably be more important However, we will not make theatrical coups The willingness to make investments in a sustainable way to strengthen the team Among the possible names arriving in Turin is that of Angel Di Maria, PSG striker who will be released at the end of June. On Vlahovic, on the other hand, he says to wait because it is not easy to adapt immediately to a big team. And then he makes an important comparison. Vlahovic is a player that absolutely cannot be discussed I remember Ibrahimovic who was criticized in his first year at Juve and then exploded It is just a question of trusting the player and letting him grow in peace Playing in a great team takes time to show what he is worth
