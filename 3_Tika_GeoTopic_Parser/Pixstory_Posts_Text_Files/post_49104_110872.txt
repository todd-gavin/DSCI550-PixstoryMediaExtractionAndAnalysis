This is coming from a man who worked hard and did multiple jobs throughout his life Hustling is important If you want to be someone of value or even stay afloat you are going to have to work hard That s what I ve done all my life However one thing I realized a lot later is how important it was to take a break between work I used to think it s lazy and makes you lethargic but it s quite the opposite now that I have started doing it To sustain a healthy life it s crucial to take breaks of all kinds and degrees In the long term stress related anxiety or depression are likely to occur from not taking these breaks in addition to skill tiredness physical exhaustion and mental exhaustion In the end it might be detrimental to life expectancy health and general quality of life A break from work is not merely okay but it is of the utmost importance Yout mind can be exercised through work You must relax after any workout of your body or your brain If not it will deteriorate and lose effectiveness By taking regular breaks instead of working nonstop you accomplish much more than you would by pushing yourself constantly That s the lesson I have learnt and thus wanted to share
