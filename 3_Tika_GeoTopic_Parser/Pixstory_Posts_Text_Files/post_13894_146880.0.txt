As we all know, the International Day of Peace (or World Peace Day) is observed annually on September 21 and is dedicated to promoting the ideals of peace within and among all nations and people. At a time when war and violence frequently dominate our news cycles, the International Day of Peace serves as an inspiring reminder of what we can achieve when we work together. Peace. Letâ€™s strive for it together for the common good. 
Peace means freedom, peace means a feeling of comfort, and peace means freedom from war and terror. These three words are enough to explain real peace. Peace is necessary for the existence of this world. The absence of peace in any region of the world is responsible for the deaths and destruction, which results in the ruination of that region. If any area is suffering from war or terror, then life there is badly affected in many ways. All the activities like education, business, sports, etc are suspended in a war-affected area. Peace is necessary for life, for living, and for happiness.
The world has been badly affected by war and terror and is continuing to be so. We can take the example of the First and Second World Wars, these wars created the biggest disaster whose aftereffects can be felt even now. Even our own sub-continent has been the big victim of terror riots which badly affected our education, lifestyle, economic and social values. 
Let Peace be given a chance. Because the world deserves to live in peace, not rest in peace.
