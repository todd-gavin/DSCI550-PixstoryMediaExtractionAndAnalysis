The video was viral earlier in March as well. However, with a different claim. It was shared after news articles at the time reported that two men named Zafar and Noor Alam misbehaved with locals and fired a gun in the air to spread panic in Kaushambi, Prayagraj. The villagers in response thrashed Zafar to death and left Noor Alam injured. The video began circulating widely on social media with the claim that a mob of Hindus beat two Muslim youths mercilessly, with one of the victims succumbing to his injuries.

Several people amplified the video with this claim.

We noticed that Uttar Pradesh police debunked the video on March 22, 2022, clarifying that the visuals were from a two-year-old incident from Madhya Pradesh.

According to a February 2020 report by NDTV, a mob of villagers in Dhar district’s Borlai village attacked six farmers with sticks and stones on the suspicion of them being child abductors. One of the farmers died following the attack.

Alt News had verified the video back in March 2020 when it was being circulated in connection with the Delhi riots.

Speaking to BBC, Superintendent of Police (Dhar) Aditya Pratap Singh stated, “It was a case of missed payments. A group of people reached the area where agricultural labourers were working. The contractor had charged in advance, but not supplied any workers.” In a Times of India report dated February 5, 2020, one of the victims said that five labourers had charged them an advance of Rs 50,000 each, but did not come to work.
