Nowadays, pseudo feminism may be mostly seen on social media. People put up stories and post about being feminist, but some hardly know about feminism, and most of them end up being pseudo-feminist. Suppose a girl put up her side of the story about abuse or defamation caused to her by a bloke. In that case, people start believing one-sided from her part and starts bashing the guy without taking note of his part of the story, which can be where pseudo feminism starts happening. People start calling that guy rapist ad whatnot, without acknowledging his side of the story but by believing the facts given by the girl simply because she is a girl and why would she frame things about herself. A vicious quote that many people have come upon on social media that “all men are trash” might be true to some that men might have caused some traumatic experience, but why are we generalizing it to all men. These are the things spread by pseudo-feminist, and some people follow their lead. On social media, it’s hard to distinguish between what’s true and what’s not. People manipulate and exaggerate situations to induce content and focus. It’s really hard to understand what we should be supporting or fighting against.
