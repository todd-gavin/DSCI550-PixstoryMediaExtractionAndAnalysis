Choice is the word. 
Hijab controversy. I wrote about it sometime back and forgot till I saw a few posts on social media calling hijab suppressing regressive and how supporting the girls means supporting patriarchy. 
Although there were many who said this was not the moment to debate hijab and women should make their own choices. 
When we allow that choice to women. When can they really decide what is good for them. Will it be random men who decide what we should wear, who we should marry, what should we cook in our kitchens, how should we raise our children. 
I want to make my own choices and wearing or not wearing a hijab is surely one. 
I remember I was among a few girls in our Christian missionary school who covered their head. We wore a uniform and chose to cover our heads with a scarf. The school didn’t object, they never had in the past also. I had just entered my teenage years when I suddenly wanted to cover my head. My parents didn’t force me, my mom wasn’t clinging on to her dupatta like it is the only thing in her life at that point. She would cover and not cover her head at will. I never saw my father object to it. 
But something happened to me so I started to cover my self. I religiously covered my head started practicing Islam, did namaz and all. Even during my growing years I was particular about hijab, while none of my other friends were. Even after diktats by many right wing Women’s groups not many paid attention for too long. 
I hated the imposition but I was happy in my hijab. I felt it suited me . 
I did my all girls college went to university, still holding on to the hijab. Came for an internship to Delhi got a job .
