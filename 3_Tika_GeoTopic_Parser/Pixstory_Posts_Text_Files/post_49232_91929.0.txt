Jazz isn't at all bad. It's simply a different method of listening to music. People's musical tastes differ not only in terms of what they like, but also in terms of what they want music to accomplish. Some folks simply want music playing in the background as an audio backdrop. Some people desire music that causes them to yell and shout. Some people wish to be able to dance to music. Some individuals desire music to promote a particular way of life or culture. Some people want music to express a social justice message in a fun way. Some people like music to serve as a link to the past.

People who enjoy jazz want their music to be an immersive experience. They want to hear music that is well-received. They want every member of the group to be pushing themselves and each other to create music that requires the listener's entire attention and rewards concentration.

People who don't desire this from music often say Jazz is bad since it doesn't make people dance, can't blend in, and doesn't provoke strong cultural sentiments. However, it is simply music created for a different purpose.

Jazz demands more from the listener than pop, EDM or rap. I am not a fan of free jazz, but I don't think it sucks.
