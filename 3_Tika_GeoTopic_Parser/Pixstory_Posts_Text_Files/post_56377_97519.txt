Often women were deemed as witches mad and strange in the early days if they act against the norms of patriarchy Do you know the same patriarchy is responsible for the diminishing mental health of women today Sexism involves treating an individual differently because of their sex What is most damaging for an individual than taking up and following traditional stereotypes If my mom likes babies my grandmother liked babies does that mean being a woman I need to like and give birth What are these phrases used by women Look pretty or else you will not find a match like I can t live on my own act like a lady women are often tormented for their choices in every aspect A dress a school a choice of country to study and whatnot Sexual objectification is another aspect that torments us We cannot ignore it as generations of women were ignoring or tolerating this A women s body is her own and no one has the right to assert control or comment on or objectify her I have seen many people commenting that women are scared of everything Scared to drive scared to walk alone scared to swim Let me ask you who inculcated this fear in them Weren t you the ones that decided that women don t need driving Weren t you the ones who passed comments and groped women in public while they were alone weren t you the ones who injected fear in them Receiving sexist remarks especially on the streets can lead one to fear for their safety that they may be verbally or physically assaulted A person experiencing this might engage in avoidant behaviours such as avoiding certain places at certain times or ceasing to go out altogether Research suggests that women working in male dominated offices may experience loneliness or rejection often leading to depression Although casual sexism may have been intended to be can knock down one s self confidence and lead the individual to question their self worth The list goes on you might ask why are you getting upset about these things This is not a statement at one single time We hear these from we were born
