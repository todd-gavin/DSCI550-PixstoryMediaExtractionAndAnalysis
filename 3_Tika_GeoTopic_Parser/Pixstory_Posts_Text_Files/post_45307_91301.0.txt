Bruno Fernandes has signed a new contract with Manchester United that will keep him at the club until June 2026, with an option for a further year. The Portugal international has been rewarded with better terms as a result of his influential role in the side since joining from Sporting CP in January 2020, with the new contract making him one of the club's highest 
earners. 

Bruno has scored 49 goals and created 39 assists in 117 appearances across all competitions since arriving in the January transfer window of 2020. With only nine goals this season, the midfielder has not been as prolific, but it is felt that the new contract better reflects his value inside the club. 

While fans will be happy to hear of a new Fernandes contract because of his importance to the squad, the length of the contract is similar to the one he signed in 2020. His new contract will expire in 2026 rather than 2025, with options for an additional year to be added to both terms. 

This new contract, it is understood, sees his income rise considerably as a result of his 
continued impact on the squad. Bruno has been a talisman for the squad since joining under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and the new terms reflect that. 

Bruno Fernandes said: "From the moment that I joined Manchester United, I have had a special relationship with the club and our amazing fans. I grew up watching this team, dreaming of getting the chance to play here one day. 

"Even after two years, it still feels amazing to step out at Old Trafford, to hear the fans sing my song and to score in front of the Stretford End. It is a true privilege to wear this shirt and to fight for our incredible club.

"There is so much more that I want to achieve here, and I know that is the same for the rest of the squad and staff. We want to give the fans the success that they deserve. 

"We have shared some great moments over the last years, but the best is yet to come from myself and this team."
