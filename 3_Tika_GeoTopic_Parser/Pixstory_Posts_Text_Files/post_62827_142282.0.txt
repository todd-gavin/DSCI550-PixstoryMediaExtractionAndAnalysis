I need recovery time after being with people or talking to them all day. It drains me to be energised and interact with people, therefore I need to be alone myself and have some me time. I adore the night. Nyctophile, maybe?
Nights have a certain calm, certain quiet in them that I can't find at any other time of the day. It's beautiful, it's peaceful. I don't think there's anything prettier than the moon illuminating the night.
