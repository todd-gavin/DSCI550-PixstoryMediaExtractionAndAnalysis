"Need focus and consistency" - Tuchel says after Southampton defeat. 
Chelsea lost second time in the season, both  away games, 1-2 against Southampton in the latest. 
Chelsea took the lead in the midweek fixture at St. Mary's in the 23rd minute. Sterling scored his 3rd goal for Chelsea, who joined the club from Manchester City this season. But, teenager Lavia scored a debut goal for his club with a stunning strike from a corner. They took the lead in the extra time of first half, this time Armstrong was the goal scorer. 
"I absolutely dislike to lose and it's already the second time in the season very early. It does not take alot to beat us and that's what I don't like". Chelsea Manager Thomas Tuchel said after the match. 
"We are humble enough to understand that we can lose football matches and of course away matches. We try to win every match, but the way we do this is for sure something we need to understand as fast as possible and to change" he added. 
A header from a corner in the second half was cleared off the line by Brazilian defender Thiago Silva to deny a third for the Saints. Chelsea have already conceded 8 goals from 5 matches, scoring 6. 
"We started well in all the games almost but absolutely we struggled with our focus and consistency in matches. It's not enough to play 20 minutes but we did the same against Leeds. Then one thing goes against us, we struggle to find the answers and to fight our way back if the things don't go in our direction. Today, they went in our direction, and with the equaliser we started to struggle and to adapt, gave it completely out of our hands and that's the situation". Tuchel reflected on the match. 
Chelsea will be playing against West Ham(3 Sep) at Stamford Bridge and away at Fulham (10 Sep). On 6th September, they will play their first UEFA Champions league match away at Dinamo Zagreb.
