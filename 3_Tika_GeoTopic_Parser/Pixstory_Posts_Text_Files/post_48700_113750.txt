Video of Robert Crimo III arrest was released The police were heard speaking Do me a favor get on your knees get on your knees lay down flat on your stomach And here we are A white man kills six people leaves dozens injured and hundreds traumatized after firing at innocent people in an independence day parade and he s arrested not only alive but with pleading words while a black man gets fired at bullets shot times for surviving a traffic stop and if that wasn t enough his lifeless corpse was handcuffed Jayland Walker was unarmed Robert Bobby Crimo was heavily armed One of them committed mass murders and the other didn t hurt anyone but guess which one is alive and arrested with respect Correct How long are we going to ignore the disparity between the treatment of white and black people by the police It s not to say Crimo should have been killed by the police What the cops did in his case is what should be done leaving aside our personal feelings and rage they are NOT supposed to kill any person of interest yet somehow they always tend to kill black people and never the white ones despite the stark difference between their crimes Bobby Crimo was a MAGA supporter a republican who frequently attended Trump rallies made videos about white supremacy which still doesn t make sense to me how nobody ever noticed what he was upto his father lost the elections of the Mayor It s the system it s always the white supremacist white apologist system How long should this go on
