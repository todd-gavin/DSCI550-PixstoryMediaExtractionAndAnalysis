Manchester United produced a solid performance away from home as they beat Sherrif 2-0. A bounce back was required after the lacklustre showing last week at home to Real Sociedad and it is safe to say that United responded well. Of course, the next league game for United will be against Manchester City on October 2nd after the international break. Therefore, Erik Ten Hag went with a strong squad for the game in Moldova as he made five changes. The likes of Bruno Fernandes, Scott Mctominay, Christian Eriksen and Jadon Sancho all returned to the starting eleven.
United took the lead through Jadon Sancho who finished his opportunity off beautifully as he cut inside on his weaker foot. Sancho’s good form continues which is a huge positive for him and Ten Hag.  Diogo Dalot then won a penalty for United as he was fouled in the area and none other than Cristiano Ronaldo stood up to take the penalty. The Portuguese forward dispatched the penalty perfectly. Ronaldo seems to be more focused and satisfied since the transfer window closed and if he is happy to accept the plans Ten Hag has for him, then United will benefit from this massively.
Scott Mctominay and Christian Eriksen seem to be Ten Hag’s preferred pair in the midfield pivot as both of them have formed a good partnership. Mctominay’s physical presence in United’s midfield alongside Erisksen’s fantastic technical abilities is proving to be working the side. Bruno Fernandes possesses the world-class ability in creating chances from nothing and he has been good in this midfield. Fernandes is given the freedom to take up advanced positions and his terrific work-rate means he contributes significantly to the team. Antony also started and looked bright in spells but it will take time for him to adjust to the side and adapt to the way the team plays.
