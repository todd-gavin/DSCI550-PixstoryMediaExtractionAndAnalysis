After Robert Pattinson's take on the Batman, I can't say Affleck is my favourite but he's my second favourite. According to me, Ben Affleck like in most of his roles was misunderstood here. 
He wasn't the Batman that had an origin story because it had happened. Jason Todd, his adopted son had already been killed, he had no hope so when he saw Superman, he misunderstood what he stood for so he decided to kill him. What Zack Snyder did wrong according to me is, he didn't provide enough background for this Batman's story, he should've shown a past which shows how this Batman has changed after Robin's death.

This Batman was broken, he was a misunderstood representation straight from Frank Miller's comic. Many people argued that Frank Miller's take on Batman itself wasn't right, so itself neither was Snyder's. 

Ben Affleck was straight from The Dark Knight comics of Frank, he portrayed it perfectly. It reflects in Snyder's Cut of Justice League. Unfortunately he won't get his standalone film but we'll see him again in Flashpoint.
