One of the biggest game releases of the year is off to a far more rockier start than anticipated as Overwatch servers are currently undergoing mass DDOS Distributed Denial Of Services attack making the game simply impossible to play DDOS attacks are a form of cyberattack used by hackers or cybercriminals to render a particular network online service or host unusable Regarding the incident Blizzard president Mike Ybarra announced on Twitter Unfortunately we are experiencing a mass DDoS attack on our servers Teams are working hard to mitigate manage This is causing a lot of drop connection issues Overwatch director Aaron Keller has also elaborated on the incident and said We re steadily making progress on server issues and stability as well as working through a second DDoS attack We re all hands on deck and will continue to work throughout the night Thank you for your patience we ll share more info as it becomes available It s currently unclear how long it will take for the servers to be fully functioning but it is definitely ruining the launch of Overwatch which Blizzard has been planning for months now Social media is full of players sharing their failed matchmaking attempts and extended queues which are partially related to the DDoS attack According to the Overwatch official issues page players on both PC and consoles are encountering Unexpected Server Errors along with issues like certain cosmetics and items not showing up in their collection Much of this has also led to players being automatically disconnected from servers Blizzard s new free to play shooter is intended as a complete replacement for the original Overwatch which just saw its servers go offline yesterday after six years That means you can t just hop into Overwatch while you wait for the DDoS attack to be over unfortunately
