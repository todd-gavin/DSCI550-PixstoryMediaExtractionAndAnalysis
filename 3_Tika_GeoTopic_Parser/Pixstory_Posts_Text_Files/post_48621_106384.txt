Trump spread the idea that the election was rigged inflamed his supporters rage and then stood by while they stormed the Capitol His misinformation campaign provoked the violence on January th There s actually no denying that no matter how much you try You asked why anyone would dislike Trump True he has a wonderful personality Personally I find his Covid Death Dance which he performed at campaign rallies as scores of people died every day to be very adorable Or when he claimed that the soldiers injured in the Iraq retaliatory bombing had suffered little headaches My heart was warmed by his care Oh and after reading and MISPRONOUNCING the names of the victims of the Uvalde School Shooting he did a beautiful little dance Who could possibly despise him Trump is not the hero you make him to be or think he is It s funny the lengths you re willing to go for a man like him It s time you see why you shouldn t support him
