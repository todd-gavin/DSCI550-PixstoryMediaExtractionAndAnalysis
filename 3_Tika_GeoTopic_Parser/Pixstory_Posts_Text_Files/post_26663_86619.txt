Jacquemus flew to Hawaii to present his Spring Summer collection to escape the darkness of the times we live in. This is the brand&#39;s first fashion show organized outside the French borders but organized with the same see now buy now garments and accessories seen on the catwalk in fact they are already available for purchase on the brand website The bad weather tried in vain to undermine the event but in a short time thanks to the help of the inhabitants of the island the jacquemus team was able to parade anyway under a warm rising sun The colors are always the same pastel blues that fade into aquamarine bright greens and very summery white Costumes micro dresses and shirts with cuts and openings mini-duvets like life jackets and suits that appear a little forced on the sandy catwalk The aesthetics work the sensational location and probably the accessories they will become next season&#39;s must-haves but we still need fashion that flees instead of telling the present
