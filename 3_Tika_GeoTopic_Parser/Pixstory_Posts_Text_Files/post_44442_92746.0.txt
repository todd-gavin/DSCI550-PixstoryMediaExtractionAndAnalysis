History of womenâ€™s football league: 

Praful Patel, president of the AIFF, announced on April 21, 2016, that a women's football league would begin in October with six clubs to be determined, with the intention of expanding to eight teams by 2017. 

AIFF held a workshop on the India women's national team and the projected women's football league just over two months later, on July 5, 2016. 

The workshop was attended by five Indian Super League clubs (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, and Atletico de Kolkata) as well as three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl 
FC, and Mumbai FC). It was stated that the league will have eight teams, with two additional berths selected by apre-qualification round.

The preliminary rounds of the AIFF will begin on October 17th, with ten teams divided into two 
groups of five, with the winner qualifying for the national finals.
