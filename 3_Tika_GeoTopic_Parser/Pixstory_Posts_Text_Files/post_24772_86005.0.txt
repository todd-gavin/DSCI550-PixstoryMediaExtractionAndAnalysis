Chelsea to face New Castle (on 13 Mar) and Middlesbrough (on 19 Mar) out of their 6 matches in March. 

Premier League match vs New Castle

Chelsea face a rectified New Castle at Stamford Bridge. New Castle haven’t lost 8 matches since Christmas which includes wins against Leeds United (1-0), Everton (3-1), Aston Villa (1-0), Brentford (2-0) and Brighton (2-1). They have also held 6th placed West Ham for a 1-1 draw. 

44 year old manager Eddie Howe has changed the way they play. He took charge of the team when they were 19th without any win in 11 matches. The January transfer window has boosted the squad with the arrival of Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Matt Target and Brun Guimaraes. They are now playing 4-3-3 attacking football with strong defending. 


FA Cup Quarter Final

After losing the Carabao cup against Liverpool in the final and with Liverpool and Manchester City cruising for top spots, Chelsea will be hoping to claim the FA cup title as sole trophy of the season.

Middlesbrough has defeated Tottenham(1-0) in the 5th round and Manchester United(1-1, 7-8) in the 4th round to reach quarter finals. Chelsea don’t have the best memories of playing against Chris Wilder managed team. In the 19/20 season, Wilder managed Sheffield United, held Chelsea for a 2-2(31 Aug 19) and was defeated 3-0(11 July 20) in the second match. Wilder, who makes the team well organized and well planned, doesn’t allow opponents to score much. The way they played against Antonio Conte’s star studded Spurs gives warning to Tuchel. After the 90th min, Middlesbrough moved the ball more fluently and controlled the game, and created the goal in the 107th minute (Josh Coburn). 33 year old Josh Coburn is playing an excellent role in the midfield, who has played 559 matches in his career (Leeds - 185, Norwich-176, M’brough-198). Wilder has a history of bringing Sheffield United to Premier league with double promotion in just 3 years, and coming to 9th with 54 points. This was a league record for a newly promoted team, until Leeds broke it.
