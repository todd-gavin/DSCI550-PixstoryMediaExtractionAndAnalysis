The African Cup of Nations (AFCON) final was widely talked about a battle between two Liverpool stars – Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. One had to be on the losing side since it was the final, and here Mane had the last laugh. He made an impact on the game too, by slotting home a penalty in the tie-breaker that proved to be the decisive one. Senegal won their maiden AFCON title leaving seven-time champions and favourites Egypt frustrated.
Apart from scoring from a spot kick and missing one early in the match, Mane didn’t do anything heart-stopping in the final. At the other end, Salah also failed to contribute much to the Egypt cause. Yet, there was an unmistakable touch of Liverpool in the AFCON final. In the fourth minute, Egypt central defender Mohamed Abdelmonem conceded a penalty but goalkeeper Mohamed Abougabal, also known as Gabaski, had saved the spot kick by Mane. Just before Mane took the kick, Salah was spotted advising his goalkeeper which way to dive. As a Liverpool teammate, he knew which way his friend from Senegal was expected to take the shot.
In the end, Mane’s decisive penalty sparked joyous scenes of celebration among the Senegal squad and fans in the stands, but Mane had his priorities clear. He did enjoy the merriment, but not before he found time to console his Liverpool teammate Salah. It was a fine act of sportsmanship from the Senegal star. However, not everything Mane did in the final was appreciated by soccer fans across the globe. He was bitterly criticised in the social media for what looked like a blatant dive inside the area without being touched by the opponent in an attempt to earn a penalty. True, he couldn’t fool the referee, who waived on to continue play, Mane was accused of adopting to unfair means. He was indeed lucky not to receive a yellow card for this offence since it would have sent him off the ground having received a yellow card earlier. The story of the final could have been completely different then.
