Bus travel in the city has indeed become a fun activity for me. There are always youngsters sitting on the ‘senior citizen’ seats; and young, sturdy fellows sitting on seats reserved for the handicapped. Then there are hefty men occupying seats earmarked for women. The trick is to look at the notice written in bright red above the assigned seat, look the fellow occupying the wrong seat in the eye and smile. Mostly, it works.　

I meet young girls going to college, women travelling to their jobs, or with their friends, or for shopping. Sitting next to each other one often gets chatting. When it is time to get down, there is always a smile, "Bye, it was nice meeting you." 　

So bus travel has become an interesting interlude and a fun activity. If you don’t strike up a conversation, you can always lean back and relax.
