Some folks are excited, it’s a special day: 2-22-22, affectionately known as ‘Twosday’. Numerologists and astrologers find special significance in the combination of numbers. Weddings and births have been planned. Trivia enthusiasts are having a moment, but cynics know it’s just another day.

The date is palindrome – it reads the same backwards. (So are all days between 2/20/22 and 2/28/22, written it the American way.) It’s even an ambigram – reading the same upside down. ‘22022022’ written in the calculator style would read the same both ways: https://twitter.com/search?q=ambigram&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch

Morten Heedegaard, a numbers geek, even launched a website in 2016 counting down to today: https://22-2-22.com/ which also features quiz and of course merchandise.  

He admits there’s nothing more to the date than an opportunity to have little fun. “…what should make that day any different from any other date, apart from the fact that humans have invented a way of counting days, and years, and months? And by coincidence, that date is going to be a date full of twos, and we originate our timing from a day and a year at which a certain guy named Jesus was born. I’m not sure there’s any bigger meaning for it,” he says: https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/02/21/2-22-22-meaning/

But trying telling that to Aliza Kelly (http://alizakelly.com/) who will appear today on “The Drew Barrymore Show” (it’s her birthday) to tell us about the unique significance of this combination of numbers. It has something to do with metaphysics, Pluto and “transformation and metamorphosis, and really powerful epic change that really originates from the interior before revealing itself on an exterior level” if you are into that sort of thing.

Meanwhile, on this National Margarita Day (https://nationaltoday.com/national-margarita-day/#:~:text=Every%20February%2022%2C%20we%20come,official%20drink%20of%20having%20fun.), special music performances will be held, special sales with discount figures made up of twos will be offered (https://www.travelandleisure.com/hotels-resorts/atlantis-paradise-islands-bahamas-february-22-sale), special-edition NFTs (https://twitter.com/FlatsNFT) will be issued…

Tired of the pandemic, we are looking for flimsiest of reasons to celebrate. But there will surely be some number geek who’ll, notwithstanding astrologers’ rosy predictions, find a connection between this date and the number of new Covid-19 infection today: https://covid19.who.int/
