RW - Lionel Messi

When Messi made his Barcelona debut, the opposing manager asked Frank Rijkaard about
his price. He was that good in his first match, the rest is history. Lionel Messi was hailed as Maradona's successor, but he outshone and surpassed his countryman. Left Barcelona with
a behemoth 672 goals and 303 assists in 778 appearances.

He once scored 91 goals in a calendar year and set a benchmark so high that no one couldcome close to breaking it. Another highlight of his career was winning seven Ballon d'Or.

FW - Alfredo Di Stefano

The player who defined eras and spearheaded Real Madrid to unprecedented glories.Between 1956 and 1960, he was the only player in football history to score seven times infive European finals.

His 11 years at Real Madrid made him an undisputed type of Los Blancos, scoring 308 goals
for the club that lasted 44 years and being awarded two Ballon d'Or.
RW- Cristiano Ronaldo

When he joined Real Madrid, he broke numerous records that had stood for centuries.Ronaldo was already a top player before Real Madrid purchased him, making him Europe'smost expensive player. And what he accomplished with Real Madrid was phenomenal.
His arrival at Real Madrid sparked the debate between Ronaldo and Messi. He left RealMadrid as a club legend, having won four Champions Leagues and five Ballon d'Or duringhis time there. With a trophy-laden time with Real Madrid, Ronaldo also scored 450 goalsand provided 131 assists in 438 appearances.
