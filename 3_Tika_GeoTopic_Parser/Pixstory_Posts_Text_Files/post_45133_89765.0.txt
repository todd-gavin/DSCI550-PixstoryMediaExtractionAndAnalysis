Italy may be the reigning European champions, but for the first time in history, they have failed to qualify for a second consecutive World Cup.

Following their stunning defeat to North Macedonia on Thursday, the four-time champions will miss another World Cup qualifier. So, what are the biggest ever World Cup qualifying shocks?

#1 Italy (2018 and 2022)

It's incredible to think that Italy won the Euros yet failed to qualify for the World Cup either before or after that event.

It was considered inconceivable to have a second consecutive World Cup without the four-time champions.

In 2018, they missed out on automatic qualification after failing to score over two legs in the play-offs against Sweden, resulting in Italy's first absence from the tournament since 1958.

It happened again just four years later, as one too many draws saw them miss out on automatic qualification before Thursday's shock play-off semi-final defeat to North Macedonia in injury time.

#2 USA (2018)

Given their current prominence in the game, it may seem weird that the United States is on this list, but their failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup was completely unexpected.

However, Bruce Arena's team was defeated 2-1 by Trinidad and Tobago, and they were eliminated from the tournament for the first time since 1986. Given that four teams out of six advanced out of their group, which included Honduras and Panama, this has earned a spot on the list.

#3 Netherlands (2002)

Four years prior, the Dutch had reached the semi-finals, but a team captained by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Clarence Seedorf, Patrick Kluivert, Frank de Boer, and Edwin Van Der Sar failed to advance to Japan and South Korea.

The Netherlands were eliminated from qualification by four points after failing to overcome Portugal and Ireland both at home and away.
