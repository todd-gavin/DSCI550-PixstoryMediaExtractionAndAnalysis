Have you ever read something so devastating beautiful that you want to cry ,cry and cry with a pleasure of having gone through something beautiful yet heart wrecking ? The song of Achilles made me go  through such a lovely and unusual experience.
"I'm made of memories"
The song of Achilles is thought a POV of patroclus. It retells Homer's illiad. The book explores patroclus 'relationship with Achilles and as we move forward,we just succumb to the beauty of their relationship and get mesmerized by their closeness and love.
Patroclus was exiled when he was 9 year old. He was sent to Kingdom of king  peleus where he met and adored Achilles, the son of peleus. Achilles ' mother sea-nymph that is was not happy with relationship between Achilles and patroclus . She was always indending to separate them.
On one day , Helen , queen of Sparta was kidnapped and her husband requests all the Greeks to join the war against  Pairs of Troy. Achilles got ready to go against Troy. Patroclus followed him. What happens next is something that marked as the greatest moment in the greek mythology. The war witness is the love, romance,anger, violence, friendship etc.
Miller's writing is wonderful and magical. The relationship between Achilles and patroclus is just amazing.
Those who want explore greek mythology, this  is the best book . I   loved how both these characters have left the marks on my heart, especially patroclus. I got little confused with the names but yeah it's solvable . 😅
"In the darkness  ,two shadows , reaching through the hopeless , heavy dusk . Their hands meet and light spills in the flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out the sun."
Love to both Achilles and Patroclus ❤️
