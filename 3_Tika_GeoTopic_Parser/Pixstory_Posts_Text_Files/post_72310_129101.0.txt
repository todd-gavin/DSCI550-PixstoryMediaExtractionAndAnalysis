Squad Depth

The fact that the Arsenal football club has so many talented players on its roster, despite the fact that a number of them have yet to play, will offer the Gunners a significant advantage over many other premier league sides.

Matt Turner of the USMNT will cover well for Fulham's Aaron Ramsdale after Bernd Leno's probable exit, while Marquinhos, who is already expected to have a significant impact in north London under Gabriel Martinelli, might emerge as a future star. Fans are more interested in the new additions of Fabio Vieira, Gabriel Jesus, and Oleksandr Zinchenko because they will all offer the type of skill, variety, and depth that the team may have lacked last season.

In the meantime, Arsenal shouldn't be concerned about their choices in central defense because of William Saliba's return to the team following a highly successful term at Marseille, and Zinchenko's availability means that he can fill in at left-back if necessary. The hope is that Kieran Tierney can eventually overcome his injury troubles, though.

Even though they are frequently on the bench, players like Pepe, Tierney, Fabio Vieira, and Marquinhos are capable of filling in for most of the first-choice players if they are injured. But Arteta has made it obvious that he still thinks Arsenal will fall short in a few hours. Last week, he declared, "The window is not closed." The squad is still active.
