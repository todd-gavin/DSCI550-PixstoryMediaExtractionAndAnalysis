During a speech on Tuesday, Joe Biden jokingly reminisced about putting a dead dog on a Republican woman’s doorstep during his time serving in county government when he was in his 20s.

While giving remarks at the National Association of Counties 2022 Legislative Conference in Washington, he president spoke about his time representing what he described as a mixed-income district.

He said at one point he fielded a request from a wealthier Republican woman who had a dead dog on her lawn.

“I got a call one night; the woman said to me – obviously not of the same persuasion as I was politically – called me and said: ‘There’s a dead dog on my lawn,’” said Biden, telling the story.

“And I said: ‘Yes, ma’am.’ I said: ‘Have you called county?’ She said: ‘Yes, they’re not here.’ And I said: ‘Well, I’ll get them in the morning.’”

The woman was not satisfied by Biden’s answer, telling Biden that she wanted the dog off her lawn now and that she paid his salary.

So Biden responded in kind: “So I went over,” said Biden as the conference crowd laughed and applauded. “I picked it up. She said: ‘I want it out of my front yard.’ I put it on her doorstep.

“But I’ve gotten much better since then,” said Biden after wrapping up the story.

In the 1970s, Biden served as a county official in Delaware before being elected to the US Senate in 1972 at the age of 29.

“I ran for the Senate because it was too damn hard being in the council,” said Biden, jokingly, at the beginning of his conference remarks.
