The Taliban leadership today is different from the one man rule of Mullah Mohammad Omar the reclusive founder of the Taliban movement in the mid s who reigned with a heavy hand A divide is growing between some within the old guard who uphold the harsh rule of the past and a younger generation of Taliban leaders who see a future of engagement with the international community The younger generation sees rights for both men and women though still within their interpretation of Islamic law but one that allows school for girls and women in the workforce The younger Taliban need to speak up said Farhadi Still Akhundzada has modelled himself on Mullah Omar preferring to stay in remote Kandahar far from the eyes of the public rather than rule from the Afghan capital of Kabul He also adheres to Pashtun tribal mores traditions where women are hidden away and girls are married off at puberty Akhunzada ran a madrassa or a religious school in Pakistan s border regions before his rise as the new Taliban leader Those with knowledge of Akhunzada say he is unconcerned about international outrage over the latest restrictive Taliban edicts and about the growing discontent and complaints from Afghans who have become increasingly outspoken It was Akhunzada who reportedly vetoed the opening of schools to girls after the sixth grade as the Taliban had promised to do in late March at the start of the new schoolyear On Saturday dozens of girls demonstrated in Kabul demanding the right to go to school Ethnic Pashtuns elsewhere have resisted Taliban adherence to tribal laws In Pakistan where ethnic Pashtuns also dominate the border regions movements such as the Pashtun Rights Movement have emerged to challenge backward tribal traditions and disavow Taliban interpretations of Islamic law Manzoor Pashteen the movement s leader has been an outspoken opponent and has accused the Taliban of hijacking ethnic Pashtun sentiments and misrepresenting their traditions and misinterpreting them as religious edicts
