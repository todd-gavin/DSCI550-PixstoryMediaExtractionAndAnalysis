The attribution of gender has to do above all with power, in fact the concept of gender is not only a category of historical social sciences at the same time at least implicitly a political concept an instrument of a political discourse on the state of relations between men and women In this sense it presents many similarities with other categories used to analyze social relations such as class and race, for example Like these it is not limited to a neutral acknowledgment of differences and inequality Rather it indicates the mechanisms of construction starting precisely from the analysis of the asymmetry of relations of material and symbolic power that structure the relationships between classes, races, genders On the other hand, precisely because of its ability to focus on social mechanisms that were previously taken for granted and almost obvious, it has constituted a powerful heuristic tool in the fields of historical anthropological, social, economic research Source CIRS De Universit degli Studi di Torino introductory course on gender studies
