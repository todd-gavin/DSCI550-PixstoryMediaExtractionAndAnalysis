•In an Instagram post, Bhattacharya said she sat down with Khan for an hour-long meeting at 'Mannat' on Sunday. 🥰

•Sharing the photo of the note, Shrayana wrote, "They say you should never meet your heroes. Whoever wrote/thought that had clearly never encountered iamsrk After meeting him for an hour
at Mannat last night, I can only say that he is superhuman, not of this universe, yet the most humane. A million thanks to poojadadlani02 without whom this would not have happened. The book has finally reached its intended destination: his library at Mannat. Yes, we took photos. But woh kitaab ki one year anniversary par post karenge (Will post our pictures on my book's one year anniversary)
