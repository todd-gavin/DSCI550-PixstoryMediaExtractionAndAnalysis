Death by suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. The foundation estimates approximately 45,000 Americans die by suicide each year — that’s an average of 123 suicides per day. These numbers, however, are thought to be much higher.

Despite the high rate of death by suicide among Americans, roughly 40 percent of people with a mental health condition don’t receive medical attention, estimates a 2014 review. Researchers found that stigma is one of the leading reasons why people don’t seek help.

If you or someone you know is considering suicide, know you’re not alone and help is out there. Below is a resource guide that includes hotlines, online forums, and other methods of support.
