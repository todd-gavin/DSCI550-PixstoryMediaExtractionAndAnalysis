No less than four points out of five highly polluted results: this is the balance of the sampling carried out on the Lombard shore of Lake Maggiore by the team of technicians and volunteers of Goletta dei Laghi the summer campaign of Legambiente in defense of the waters of the Italian lake basins In the viewfinder, as usual, canals and mouths are the main vehicles with which the microbiological pollution caused by bad purification or illegal discharges reaches the lakes The results of the microbiological analyzes carried out on the samples taken in recent days were announced this morning during the press conference held in Varese at the Globe Caf at the presence of Valentina Minazzi vice-president of Legambiente Lombardia and Christian Alietti coordinator of the campaigns of Legambiente Lombardia The results obtained this year for the five points monitored on the Lombard shore of Lake Maggiore confirm the critical issues that Legambiente has encountered for years and denounced the points were heavily polluted precisely as in the last years of the campaign These channels pass through towns and cities and the polluting inputs they receive are known therefore we should try to transform the attention they receive on these occasions into practical acts to try to solve the problem Furthermore, the particular drought situation could determined a particularly high concentration of these pollutants found in fact by the analyzes since no other water arrives in these canals to dilute the pollutants themselves By now the critical points of the Maggiore are known to all and this year&#39;s results confirm how urgent it is to act along the watercourses that collect waste from the hinterland We hope that the works that have begun, for example, on the Luino sewer system can be completed without delay and delays in order to be able to collect improvements already in the next edition of Goletta dei Laghi The strong drought experienced this year which causes pollutants to concentrate even more it could be due to a new variable to consider that could recur in the future, so it is necessary to move the attention even further towards the streams and their ecosystem. Let us think, for example, of the Bardello which, in addition to the discharges from the villages, also receives the waters of Lake Varese and which therefore under pressure from many quarters
