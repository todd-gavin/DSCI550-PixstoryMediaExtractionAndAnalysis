Sometimes it becomes unfathomable to understand what would be the parent's intent or anyone's intent to choose tough love as a mechanism to help people improve.

I mean, as the name itself portrays a prominent picture of what it would look like, the harshness, coldness and the imperative behaviour to deal with people.
But what does tough love actually mean? 

Community activist Bill Milliken firstly used the term in 1968. Tough love is "the promotion of someone's welfare by enforcing constraints or making them take responsibility for their actions; the method of encouraging self-help by restricting the assistance of others."

As abusive and emotionally challenging as the term may seem, it is not,  if done, choosing the right pathway which does not harm someone emotionally.
Trying to use some healthy methods like parents choosing not to pay their child's bills because they want him to change his adamant behaviour and realise his responsibilities. 
This could help them learn more about their real-life struggles, eventually turning them into different versions of themselves.

Even in the old times, people used to believe that tough love could make a person better and help them make their personality strong. So tough love is fine if it doesn't harm, belittle or torture the person.
