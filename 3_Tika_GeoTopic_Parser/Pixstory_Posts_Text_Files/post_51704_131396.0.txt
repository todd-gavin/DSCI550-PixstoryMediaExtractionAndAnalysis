After Cristiano Ronaldo was benched for Manchester United's victory against Liverpool FC, Ten Hag talks about his role in the game.
Cristiano Ronaldo was dropped as Manchester United defeated Liverpool 2-1 in the Premier League on Monday night.
Erik ten Hag maintains that despite being benched for Monday's 2-1 victory against Liverpool, Cristiano Ronaldo still has a significant part to play for Manchester United.
Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho's goals on Monday night gave United their first victory of the Premier League season, moving them above Jurgen Klopp's team in the standings.
Harry Maguire, the club captain, and Ronaldo, the club's greatest earner, were both left off Ten Hag's team for the game, which was a huge risk.
The risk paid off with a significantly improved performance against one of the top teams in European football, but despite being passed over from the beginning, Ten Hag feels Ronaldo still has a part to play for the rest of the season.
It is obvious that leaving ronaldo on the bench was had given a great result in the clash with liverpool, 
But do you think that Ten hag's decision is right ? What do you think about the managers new tactics...
