Although there is still a buy option, Sevilla announced on Thursday that it has struck a deal with French club OGC Nice to take over through the loan of Danish attacker Kasper Dolberg until the end of the current season. Dolberg, 24, will come here on loan with the option to purchase from Nice.
The 25-year-old international joins Seville to bolster their assault, which also includes Ral de Tomás (Espanyol) and Argentine Lucas Boyé (Elche), and to give Julen Lopetegui, who previously managed Youssef, more alternatives. Rafa Mir and Nesiry.
The striker arrives in Seville with a wealth of international experience because he joined Dutch Ajax when he was just 17 years old and was promoted to the first squad the following year, when he scored 16 goals in the Eredivisie. Dolberg, who is under contract with the Ligue 1 team until 2024, has a market value of about €17 million, per the website Transfermarkt.
Due to his inconsistent play for the Dutch team after being acquired for €20.5 million, the Danish international has struggled. He started in Christophe Galtier's 4-4-2 formation last season, but he now apparently finds himself below Amine Gouiri and Andy Delort in the striker hierarchy. In between the Ligue 1, Champions League, and Europa League, he has scored 23 goals in his three years playing with Nice.
The striker, who joined Sevilla as the club's sixth acquisition of the summer transfer window and the second in the past 24 hours following Belgian Adnan Januzaj, has represented Denmark 35 times and scored 10 goals while participating in the World Cup Russia 2018 and Euro 2020 finals. After missing out on attackers Lucas Boyé, Ral de Tomás, and Umar Sadiq, Sevilla is hoping that the young Dane will help them improve their offense. Even though they scored three goals, Julen Lopetegui's team only earned one point in La Liga out of a potential nine.
