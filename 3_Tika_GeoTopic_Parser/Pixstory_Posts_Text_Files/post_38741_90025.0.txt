Antony is a Brazilian who plays for Ajax - one of the biggest clubs in the Netherlands, and for the Brazil National team. 
He usually plays as a right-winger, but he is equally adaptable to play as a left-winger.
He joined Ajax in 2020. Last season, he had 9 goals to his name. This season, he has 8 goals this season and 4 assists to his name and we still have 3 months more left for the season to get over. 
For the 2021/22 season, he took 79 shots, out of which he managed to convert 27 of them. He ranks 99 percentile in both of them. 
He is very strong in his passing. He ranks 90 percentile in the number of total passes he has completed. He averaged 1.6 key passes per game and he had a pass success of 82.3%.
Antony is very weak in defensive actions as he had made only 12 interceptions and he won only 12 tackles. He ranks only 1 percentile in goal-line clearances he made. 
Antony had maximum touches inside the attacking third and in the attacking penalty area. He ranks 99 and 95 percentile respectively in that respect. He is skilled enough as he has done magic with his feet down the right-wing and troubling defenders.
Antony ranks high on passes and possessions as he is a good carrier with the ball. He ranks 98 percentile in progressively carrying the ball. However, he needs to work on his defensive aspects, as he ranks very low on them. 



Antony’s impressive performances this season have warranted him a transfer battle between Liverpool and Barcelona. Xavi wants to bolster his attacking options after capturing Adama Traore, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and Ferran Torres. Klopp has identified Antony as a long-term successor for Mo Salah. 


Manchester United is also in the mix as if the Ajax manager Erik Ten Hag makes a move to Old Trafford, it's sure that he will bring players from his old club. Man Utd, who bought Jadon Sancho last summer to fill up the right-wing spot, couldn't make the spot his. So a right-winger is sorely needed.
