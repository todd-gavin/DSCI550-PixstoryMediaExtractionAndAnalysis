AC Milan and Inter met each other in the first Milan derby of the ongoing Serie A season today at the San Siro stadium and the match ended up being a jam packed thriller and fully lived up to the fans expectation. 
Before this match, Inter had 9 points in four matches while AC Milan had 8 points in 4 matches. It was thus an important match for both the sides to establish a strong footing at the beginning of the ongoing season. AC Milan were able to achieve that as they ended up winning the match by a close margin of 3-2. But it would be a shame to describe this match solely by the scoreline and let us thus analyse the match in detail. 
AC Milan dominated the match pretty much from the beginning. Although Inter had more possession by the end of the match and also had more passes, AC Milan were the more offensive side and attacked with full fervour. 
Marcelo Brozovic scored the first goal of the night and gave Inter the lead in the 21st minute. Rafael Leao, who is considered to be one of the most important players in the AC Milan side, was quick to respond and scored the equaliser for them in just 7 minutes.
It was Leao who assisted Olivier Giroud's goal (Milan's second) and then went on to score his brace in the 60th minute to give AC Milan a third goal and a solid lead of 3-1. Inter's Edin Dzeko managed to pull one more back in the 67th minute but they were not able to find the back of the net anymore. 
With this victory, AC Milan are now the table toppers of Serie A as of now while Inter are placed on the 5th spot with 9 points.
