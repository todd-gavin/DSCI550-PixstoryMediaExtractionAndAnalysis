Scientists in the UK have set a record for generating energy from nuclear fusion. It is one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs the world has ever seen, with the potential of creating artificial suns as a source for limitless clean energy in the future.

"These landmark results have taken us a huge step closer to conquering one of the biggest scientific and engineering challenges of them all," said Professor Ian Chapman, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Agency that co-funds and operates  The Joint European Torus (JET).

Basically, nuclear fusion is similar to the process that the sun uses to generate heat and experts say that it could one day help address climate change as it can produce abundant clean energy. 

For instance, in the latest experiment conducted with JET, a fusion machine in Oxfordshire generated around 11 Megawatts of energy, which is enough to power around 10,000 homes. This was just a five-second burst.

This has been the two-decade effort of tests by scientists and the latest breakthrough has been hailed as a "major milestone" and this could become a viable and sustainable energy source. Scientists say that the next step will be to build a power plant that would produce more electricity than it uses and test how it works on the grid. This is considered a serious source of energy as it is clean and 1kg of fusion fuel contains about 10m times as much energy as 1kg of coal, oil or gas.

But the world may have to wait for a long time for this to come along and to be used in the regular electricity grids. 20 years, at least some people say. And for everything to be in place to be used at a larger scale, it may take several decades. But there is no denying the significance of the breakthrough.
