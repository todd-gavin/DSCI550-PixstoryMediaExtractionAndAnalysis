In Okinawa, ikigai is a reason to enjoy life. Okinawans view ikigai as a way to describe the ‘why’ behind their daily life. They have a reason to get up in the morning, which means they have something to live for. Ikigai is the philosophy that blissfully keeps them busy until the end of their days.

Other cultures follow a path that society has created for us. We live by someone else’s standards and forget our desires. Hence, we rarely find our purpose and passions in life.

To find this reason or purpose, ask yourself these four questions:

What do I love?
What am I good at?
What does the world need from me?
What can I get paid for?

As we all know, your happiness relies on much more than just having a career and getting a paycheck. Likewise, only doing things you love or doing things you are good at is not enough to sustain you financially. Hence, your ikigai lies at the center of four interconnecting circles. Each of these elements helps contribute to your happiness; all four are crucial to your “reason for being.”

Finding and embracing your ikigai is one of the first steps to a long, happy life. Without it, you’ll wander through life, holding onto material objects, memories from the past, or other people. You’ll jump from one goal to another, from one daily task to the next.
