the Alexander Blessin era has begun in Genoa Despite the difficulties of a team now considered in disarray and the very little time to prepare for a very delicate match such as Marassi&#39;s safety clash against Udinese, the new German coach managed to make us glimpse something interesting both for that for plots and intensity Il Grifone in the end drew a goalless draw against the bianconeri coached by Cioffi but the fact that the Friulian goalkeeper Silvestri was the man of the match says a lot about the missed opportunity by the hosts The bitter result but the game it allows Genoa to raise their heads even if salvation is still far away on points with one game more than their opponents
