On the other hand, the position of Carlo Denina who seemed instead to have understood the importance for the affirmation of the author of finding ways to make himself known to an ever wider audience of readers. This is what emerges from his Bibliopea Torino Ignazio Soffietti who, dealing with the rules they serve to form an author contains numerous points of reflection on the condition of the man of letters Like Verri also Denina had intuition that the readership had increased and that many of them were part of a middle class that needed to be conquered with an accessible language Looking closely at the Bibliopoeia it was more than a manual aimed at authors since it also contained useful information for printers and publishers The transformation of a text into a book was described as a complex process resulting from the collaboration of men with different skills with whom the author had to relate. Here we are far from the exaltation of the author as a creative genius but the attention entirely placed in the art of making the book as a set of writing skills adherence to social conventions foreseen for publication for example the letter of dedication respect for the laws knowledge of the materiality of the edition with the awareness that the authors do not write books but texts that are transformed into books only when they enter the typography And here lies the modernity of this work by Denina the attention to the text and its becoming a book on a support with physical characteristics that are often extraneous to the author&#39;s intention but which are linked to the decisions of the printer publisher The choice to write a manual derives from Denina&#39;s observation of the absence of authors who have commented on the art of composing books Unlike Ortes Denina was not addressing a few select readers but a large public made up by those who wanted to test themselves with writing but also by those who wanted to have the tools to be able to judge the books they had in their hands with some foundation The treatise was divided into three parts cultural background of the author the book itself as a product whose characteristics are described morphological characteristics structure of chapters, indexes and summaries and in the third part, in addition to direct and indirect quotations, reference is also made to censorship and the book market
