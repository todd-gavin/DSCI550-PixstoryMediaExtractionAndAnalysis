Musical diplomacy is never left out without talking about the proliferation of Jazz.
Jazz diplomacy is as old as the era of the cold war. During the constant tension in the relations between America and the Soviet Union, the Us state department decided to make Jazz a medium to bring peace.

The Jazz ambassadors, the name bestowed on the jazz musicians whom the State Department sponsored to tour different places with the profound motto of cultural diplomacy. It was done to promote American values globally. 
From the 1950s to the late 1970s, legends of Jazz like Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong took American culture to the Russian/ Soviet public. They tried to create cross-cultural understanding in the middle of the treacherous situation of the Cold War.

The aims were high, and Jazz worked as a tool for it; America not only wanted to introduce audiences to their culture but also win people over as ideological allies in the Cold War. "Jazz Diplomacy argues that this musical method of winning hearts and minds often transcended economic and strategic priorities. Even so, the goal of containing communism remained paramount, and it prevailed over America's policy of redefining relations with emerging new nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America."

Jazz was more than a form of music then; it worked to bring a change in a society where all were fighting in distress; in Richard Jonhson's words, “Jazz is much more than music: it is the very essence of democracy.”
