7 Ronaldo
Ronaldo's ankle-breaking defence has ended the careers of many defenders and goalkeepers. He was a disaster for defenders, and his skills awed fans and served as the icing on the cake. His quick legs intended to allow him to get away from defenders and score goals for fun. You'll never see a player do so many step-overs to get around the keeper and into an empty net.
 
6 Arjen Robben
He used to wreak havoc on the right flank, blessed with breakneck pace and a cutting edge near the box before scoring his trademark goal in every game. Robben's dribbling was unpredictable, and he was too quick to catch up once he got past a defender. In Bayern Munich and Real Madrid shirts, he had fans on the edge of their seats. And his signature goal, in which he will use his fake shot and later curve the ball into the top bin, was on his left side.
 
5 Cristiano Ronaldo
Ronaldo was a tricky master, and he made the most dribbles in one game, making him one of the best dribblers in football. Due to his lack of speed, he now plays as a forward as he has grown old. But in his 20s, he was unrivalled; the five-time Ballon d'Or winner possessed a plethora of skills that proved too much for defenders.
His dazzling speed and ability to move into space with steady feet made it difficult for defenders to keep up with him, and he scored numerous solo goals; once he finds the space, he is unstoppable.
 
 
4 Neymar
He is a great dribbler like Messi. Neymar has been chastised for his showboating, but the player is brilliant on the ball and has the ability to beat 4-5 defenders. Once he gets going, he won't stop until the ball is in the opposition net. He uses body feints to misdirect defenders and inside out dribbling to break their ankle.
Although he does not often score goals, Neymar is a complete playmaker and an asset to the team. He creates space, and his ball controlling any area is hypnotic.
