Amidst a growing gun violence crisis the American Supreme Court has ruled that people shall have the right to carry guns and firearms for self defense Self defense Seriously Well in the first place why has there even arisen such a dire need for protection It s because of this order only You are yourself giving away free invitations to murders and mass shootings Well it s not like the countries that have made bearing arms illegal don t care for their citizens safety I wonder how the US senate couldn t foresee the disaster that would follow this order The reason for my worry is not just the mass shootings and terrorism but also the accidental crimes It had happened in the US before also that young kids ended up taking lives thinking it to be a game This order would only aggravate the safety concerns in America I hope that with outside pressure the SC would realise its blunder and revoke it before it s too late
