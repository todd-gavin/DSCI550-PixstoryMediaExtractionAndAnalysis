Africa's biennial football tournament comprises of nations from all over the second largest
continent in the world. As has always been the case, these qualifying matches for next year's
AFCON are taken very seriously, should a surprise team ever been on the cards. The draw
being held in South Africa on Tuesday evening.

 The draw was headed by Confederation of
African Football director of competitions Samson Adamu while South African legend Lucas
Radebe and Ex-Ivory Coastinternational Salomon Kalou took part.

The tournament features 32 teams, and the 48 nations were split into 12 groups of four from
A-L. Ivory Coast will of course host the tournament, cited to be held in early 2023 (after the
World cup in Qatar). Some of the hottest groups included Groups F, C, K and L. World Cup
missing Nigeria feature in a straight forward group with Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone.

Egypt were the other surprise shock from Qatar's draw and will compete alongside Ethiopia
in Group D.

Riyadh Mahrez's Algeria will hope to regain their former AFCON glory against the likes of
Niger and Uganda. Hosts Cote d'Ivore face a fairly simple task of beating Zambia and
Comoros. 

Group K is by far the most buzzing, with Morocco, Zimbabwe and Libya joining
South Africa who missed out on the previous edition. The Lions of Teranga (Senegal) were
placed in Group L, hoping to overcome Benin, Mozambique and Rwanda.

It is important, however to note that FIFA-imposed bans over Zimbabwe and Kenya will force
the African FA to consider the two countries disqualified. That is, if the bans aren't lifted two
weeks prior to the first matchday. The tournament will begin in the month of June later this
year, with a number of stars from the European game hoping to represent their nations at
AFCON. Bring it on!
