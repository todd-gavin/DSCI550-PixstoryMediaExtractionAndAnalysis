I see so much hatred towards Westminister College This is because people still get tormented by the words sex and porn We all know porn isn t going anywhere We shut down numerous sites and they find some way back in or else they feed on private video on hacking or installing cameras on our privacy Some people make living in the porn industry While considering that we know cutting out the root of the porn industry seems impractical and hence I would suggest some ethics in it Pornography mainly has criticism that it represents unrealistic notions along with sexist depiction While teaching it fairly we could not only regulate the content of the porn industry but also A rated movies Directors do get an idea of the impending racist classist sexist themes in pornography Moreover this will help the students to determine if they wish to engage in a serious investigation of controversial subjects This course will enable students to understand critically the impact of digital media culture Students would engage in active conversations and will discuss the history of the representation of pornography on film as this is considered a taboo topic and not much discussed We know porn should be out of reach of children hence introducing it to adults becomes not an issue Moreover content regulation and study of pornography are necessary as many get the idea of sex through porn and usually give the wrong idea of sex through some pornography This should change we don t have any other sources for sex education and yes many rely on it The unregulated cheap porn is not what adults should watch but a non offensive educative and practical one which discusses many issues related to sex that have to be discussed
