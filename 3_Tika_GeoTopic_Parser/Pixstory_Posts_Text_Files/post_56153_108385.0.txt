The government intends to change the Northern Ireland Protocol to make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. 

Miche√°l Martin said they would devastate Northern Ireland's economy. But DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mr. Martin was "focused on Dublin's interests".

Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning program, the taoiseach said that the legislation was unacceptable and represented "unilateralism of the worst kind".

"We accept fully that there are legitimate issues around the operation of the protocol and we believe that with serious sustained negotiations between the EU and the UK government those issues could be resolved," he said.

Mr. Martin said other parts of the bill that is dual regulatory criteria, could be severely damaging to the Northern Ireland economy. "It is deeply concerning to industry and businesses in Northern Ireland... in effect, it represents a form of economic vandalism on Northern Ireland," he said.

Mr. Martin said data indicated the Northern Ireland economy was "doing very well" under the protocol and contended that this was not being communicated enough by the UK government. But the DUP's MP for East Antrim, Sammy Wilson, indicted the taoiseach for failing to recognize "the flaws of the protocol".

"From day one Dublin has done what's in Dublin's interests and never once prioritized consensus in Northern Ireland," he said. "Not one unionist MP or MLA supports the protocol but instead of Dublin trying to understand or recognize our objections, they frequently lecture us, talk down to us and demand we change our mind. He added: "It's time for Dublin to step back and recognize that the reason we find ourselves without a fully operating devolved institution is that they are determined to steamroller over unionist objections."
