Love-locks or love padlocks are padlocks that couples lock to public fixtures, usually bridges, and throw the key away. The sweethearts write their names or initials on it. These locks are meant to display the permanence of their love and the everlasting nature of it. 
The above photos are from the love locks on the Langkawi skycab stop in Malaysia, where they are cherished and promoted as part of the tourist attraction.
Many places and authorities have started considering these locks as vandalism. The most popular of these love locks would be on the footbridge Pont des Arts on River Seine in Paris. Unfortunately they got taken down as safety hazards. 
If you remove the problem of these locks often being a safety hazard or being an overload on bridges, then the sentiment behind them is quite an endearing one. What do you think?
