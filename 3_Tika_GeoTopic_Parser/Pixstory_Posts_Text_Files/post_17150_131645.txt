Here are some moments from various Bollywood award functions that ended up being embarassing Nepotism Rocks Karan Johar Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan made a joke out of it while hosting IIFA When Dhawan came to collect his award for Dishoom Khan said You are here because of your Papa to which Varun Dhawan responded And you re here because of your mummy Karan Johar added I am here because of my Papa Nepotism rocks They proceeded to make fun of Kangana with Johar saying Kangana naa hi bole toh achha hai Kangana bahut bolti hai While the three seemed quite amused their jokes were rather embarassing and badly backfired Alia Bhatt singing mid performance This one is just sad There was a time in when every Bollywood actress took up singing as a side hobby Shraddha Kapoor Alia Bhatt Sonakshi Sinha However Alia took it one step further at the IIFA awards Watch this video Shah Rukh Khan and Ranbir Kapoor s ooh la la This is probably one of the moments that the duo wants you to forget Although Shah Rukh Khan is known for his wit improv skills and comedic timing this is one performance for him that did not land Salman Khan dancing with fidget spinners Salman Khan is known for his acting action and muscles What he is not known for are dance performances was filled with Salman doing the hook step of Jugg Ghoomeya from Sultan at every given opportunity Neil Nitin Mukesh vs Shah Rukh and Saif The Filmfare Awards hosted by Shah Rukh Khan and Said Ali Khan was the best and funniest They poked fun at the length of Neil Nitin Mukesh s name His name is a mixture of his father and grandfather s first names and holds immense sentimental value Hence the joke did not sit well with the actor and even told the legendary duo to shut up
