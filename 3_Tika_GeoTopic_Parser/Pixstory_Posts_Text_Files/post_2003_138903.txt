Eric Greitens was the subject of a political prosecution during his term as Governor The charges laid against him by far left Prosecutor Kim Gardner were made in a desperate attempt to bolster her career prospects and personal image Just this past week the Missouri Supreme Court reprimanded Kim Gardner for her conduct during her prosecution of then Governor Eric Greitens Gardner admitted in a stipulation with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel that she had failed to disclose evidence and other key documents in a criminal case that ultimately caused Greitens to resign Unfortunately despite her actions she was not disbarred nor severely reprimanded Instead she was simply admonished by the court and fined a paltry sum considering the effect of her actions Ironically despite the clear weaponization that she made of the criminal process she said in a statement about her not being disbarred I m pleased that our state s highest court and disciplinary counsel has recognized that the ethics disciplinary process should not be weaponized for political gain Absolutely disgusting behavior Where does Eric Greitens get his good name back Will anybody ever truly be made to answer for the damage that they had caused to his reputation Unfortunately the answer seems to be no The case was ultimately dropped in yet the damage was already done Prosecutors should be held to very stringent standards particularly when prosecuting government officials Our Constitution is based on the fact that we have a government that has separate and independent branches yet it seems that the executive branch has absolutely no problem with using the judicial branch to their gain
