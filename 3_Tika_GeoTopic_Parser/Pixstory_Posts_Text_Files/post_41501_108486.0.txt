England's Matt Fitzpatrick has won again at The Country Club, this time with the most prestigious of golf trophies. 

In 2013, he won the US Amateur Championship. The winner of the US Open on Sunday. 

US News reported that Fitzpatrick gained control of a three-way duel at Brookline that came down to the wire with a superb break and an even better shot on the 15th hole for a two-shot swing. From a fairway bunker on the 18th, he was just as clutch, setting up par for a 2-under 68. 

Will Zalatoris, who had shown incredible resilience in the face of adversity, went to his knees when his 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th just slid by the left side of the cup. Zalatoris, who finished with a 69, was a runner-up in the second straight major.

Fitzpatrick had the gold Jack Nicklaus medal draped around his neck in addition to the $3.15 million in prize money, which was only right. 

Fitzpatrick joins Nicklaus as the second man to win both the US Amateur and the US Open on the same course, which he did at Pebble Beach. At Prairie Dunes, Juli Inkster won the US Women's Amateur and US Women's Open.
