With the passing of Queen Elizabeth II an era comes to an end. The longest reigning British monarch who was served by 15 UK Prime Ministers, was not just known for her efforts to modernise the institution of monarchy but also for her fine tastes and frugal eating habits.
Having lived a long and healthy life, the Queen knew the art of striking the perfect balance when it came to eating healthy. From the Silver Tips Imperial Tea from Assam to Chocolate Cakes that she could not resist, the queen had adorable and imitable tastes. Have a look at some special facts about Late Her Majesty's diet and food habits.
Queen Elizabeth loved light teas and her favourite time of having them was in the afternoons. She is said to have enjoyed the quintessential Earl Grey Tea and also the Silver Tips Imperial Tea from Assam. She had her tea without milk or sugar and paired it with sandwiches and light tea cakes.
The Queen could not resist chocolates and usually polished off even the last bits of chocolate cake served to her by the royal chefs. She even carried the leftover ones with her on journeys. This probably was her only secret indulgence.
On days the Queen was not entertaining guests on her breakfast table, she would contend with a simple warm toast with some marmalade or jam. Her lunch and dinner usually included lots of vegetables and a little meat. She loved poached salmon, but did not particularly like too many garlic and onions in her food.
The Queen never directly remarked on whether she liked or disliked food and always communicated with the chefs through a red leather book. She would put down her notes about what she liked about a dish or what she wanted to eat. Usually the chefs would prepare her requested food at a notice of three days, said Chef Darren McGrady in one of his interviews.
