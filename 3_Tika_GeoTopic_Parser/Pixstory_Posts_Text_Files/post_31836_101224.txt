The particular intensity of the flooding event in November which affected Venice and the North Adriatic coasts was due to the superimposition of various tidal and storm surge phenomena, an anomalous level of the Adriatic Sea and the passage of a fast moving cyclone which, working together, contributed to what for few centimeters was not the worst historical flood in Venice, locally called Acqua Granda This unexpected and peculiar combination of factors has highlighted the need to further investigate the causes that determine coastal flooding A study published in Scientific Reports conducted by the Institute of Marine Sciences of the National Council of the researches Cnr Ismar in collaboration with the University of Salento and the University of Zagreb notes that the flooding events are not to be attributed exclusively to strong storm surges but are also attributable to other processes that act on different time scales from a few hours to several years and spatial from a few to thousands of km and compound events may occur simultaneously Due to the relative mean sea level rise resulting from subsidence of the city surface and from mean sea level rise, the tide and long-term meteorological components they play an increasingly dominant role in causing recurrent, even if not exceptional, floods, explains Christian Ferrarin of the Institute of Marine Sciences of the National Research Council of the National Research Council Ismar. frequency of flooding events in recent decades This evolution seems to be mainly due to long-term seasonal, interannual and interdecadal processes, the combination of which determines the precursor of flooding in Venice. Venice lends itself particularly to study as from the time the sea level is monitored and the city is frequently exposed to flooding events whose frequency has increased over time The city also boasts a flood protection system that came into operation in October MoSE and a case study of international significance as a site protected by UNESCO adds Cnr researcher Ismar
