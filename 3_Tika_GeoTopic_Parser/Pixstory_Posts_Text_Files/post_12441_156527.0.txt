Maybe we might not know what to do and might have an awkwardness, but they really do need a support system during this time of struggling. And they might just want it through the simplest ways. 
So here are few ways you could support your friend, family or loved ones while they are struggling with their mental illness. 
It's really important to listen out to anyone who is struggling, validate their feelings and remain non judgemental.
