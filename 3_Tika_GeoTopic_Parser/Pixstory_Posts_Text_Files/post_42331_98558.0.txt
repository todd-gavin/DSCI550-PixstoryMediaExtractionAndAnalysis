Tomorrow is the day when Marvel Studios’ new movie “Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness” will release and fans will watch the final product. Some fans will appreciate the movie and some anti-Marvel fans will spread hate about this movie unnecessarily.

But if you are not a Marvel fan and you know nothing about Marvel Cinematic Universe then don’t worry because two more movies will be released on OTT platforms and you can binge those movies.

The first movie that will be released on Netflix is “Thar” and this movie will be interesting to watch because Harshvardhan Kapoor is making a comeback on Netflix after his last movie “Ray” and Thar have many legendary actors like Anil Kapoor and Satish Kaushik.

The second movie that will be released on Zee5 is “Jhund” and after doing good in theatres and movie got good reviews too, now Jhund is all set to release on the OTT platform and with the help of it, more people will watch the movie.

At last, I want to say that, One day, three movies and choices are all yours then what are you waiting for, either book your tickets or get subscriptions to any of the OTT platforms that were mentioned above.
