Charles Oakley was a ten-year NBA veteran for the New York Knicks, where he was regarded as one of the team's greatest defenders. In 2017, Oakley was captured on tape in one of the most contentious episodes at MSG.

During a game against the LA Clippers at MSG, the Knicks veteran got into an ugly altercation with some security officials. As a result of this, he was ejected from the arena after being arrested by the NYPD.

He was charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault and criminal trespassing. In a statement, the Knicks stated that Oakley "came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. He was ejected and was then arrested by the New York City Police Department."

In an official statement shortly after Oakley's arrest, the Knicks said he "behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner" and closed by saying "he was a great Knick, and we hope he gets some help soon."


What Oakley had to say:

"What happened is me and four friends went to the game tonight to watch the Knicks and Clippers," Oakley said, per Begley. "We did sit down, trying to have a good time. Next thing I know, I was asked to leave the building. "I asked, 'Why?' and they said, 'You have to leave because someone ordered you to leave.' And I'm like, 'I've been here four-and-a-half minutes.'"
