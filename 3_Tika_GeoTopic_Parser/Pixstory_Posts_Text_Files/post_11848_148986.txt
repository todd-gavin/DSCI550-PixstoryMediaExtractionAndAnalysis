What scary exercise stories or myths did you hear during pregnancy These are just a few of the most common myths I hear and I just wanted to let you know they are bull so let s break them down Despite having zero evidence to support the first myth it is still deeply engrained in many people But let me be clear exercise does not cause miscarriage Suggesting women to stop training is absolutely crazy and can be bad for mental health as well as physical health No it won t Not unless they are inside with a barbell trying to do a rep max back squat or you drop a weight on their head after they are born Squats don t start labour or cause contractions Squats aid fetal positioning and can encourage contractions to continue or increase when labour has already started Again this is totally wrong Some classic core exercises I e crunches are not advised as they can exacerabate diastasis recti but there are so many core exercises you can be doing that are not only safe but recommended This is definitely something that has been taken out of context and now prenatal women everywhere are missing out on great exercises for fear of being flat If you want to bench press or anything else that requires lying down then go for it Lying flat is ok whilst exercising as it is short term We lay on our side or sit up between reps Doing reps on a bench isn t going to stop placental flow It just may be uncomfortable in which case elevate the back slightly What stupid things have you heard about exercising in pregnancy
