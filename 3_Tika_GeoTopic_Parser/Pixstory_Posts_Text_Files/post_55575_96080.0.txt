AGC Television's Australian crime drama Troppo has been picked up by Leonine Studios in Germany. 

Deadline reported that the eight-part series, which debuted on the ABC in Australia lately, is based on Candice Fox's Crimson Lake novel series. It will premiere on Amazon's IMDb TV in the United States (soon to be Amazon Freevee) 

It follows down-and-out detective Ted Conkaffey (Thomas Jane), who is hired by eccentric small town investigator Amnda Pharell (Nicole Chamoun) to investigate the death of a brilliant computer pioneer amid a backdrop of crocodile-infested seas and strange people.

The show was written and directed by Yolanda Ramke (The Haunting of Bly Manor, Cargo), with Jocelyn Moorhouse (Wakefield), Catherine Millar (Twisted), Ben Howling (Cargo), and Grant Brown (Rush). 

The show was co-produced by EQ Media Group and Beyond Entertainment in collaboration with Renegade Entertainment. The ABC, along with AGC Television and Aperture Media Partners, and Screen Australia, were major backers. 

AGC Television, Stuart Ford's Hollywood-based AGC Studios' television arm, optioned a trio of novels by American author Jayne Allen last week.
