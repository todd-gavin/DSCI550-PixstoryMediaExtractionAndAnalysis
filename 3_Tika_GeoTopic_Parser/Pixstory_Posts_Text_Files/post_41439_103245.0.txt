As security grappled with impatient crowds at the Stade de France on Saturday, riot police sprayed tear gas and pepper spray at Liverpool fans who had to endure long lines to get into the Champions League final, which was delayed for 37 minutes. 

US News reported that UEFA blamed thousands of fans who acquired bogus tickets for the jammed turnstiles after Liverpool lost the showpiece game of the European season 1-0 to Real Madrid. The competition's organisers did not say where they were from, but Liverpool claimed it was "hugely unhappy" by the security difficulties that its fans had to deal with. 

Angry Liverpool fans in the lines were seen clinging to railings and yelling, "Let us in!" We've purchased tickets.

Despite the fact that supporters were still trying to get through ticket checks, the final began. New rounds of tear gas were shot at people beyond the security zone by riot police from within the boundary. The eye-irritating compounds caused officers and stewards to tumble to the ground.
