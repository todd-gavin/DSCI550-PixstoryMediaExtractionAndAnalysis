The Academy finally take the action on what happened between Will Smith and Chris Rock at The Oscars ceremony back on 28th March 2022.

If you still don’t know the incident, so, let me tell you that, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock during the Oscars ceremony because Chris Rock made a joke about Will’s wife.

After that, Will and Rock apologized for the incident and Will Smith himself resigned from The Academy of Motion Picture Arre and Science.

But now, The Academy has finally taken the action against Will Smith and banned him from all Academy events including the Oscars for the next 10 years.

The statement released by The Academy is as follows:- 

The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year; however, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr. Smith exhibit on stage.

During our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room. For this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers, and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short — unprepared for the unprecedented.

Today, the Board of Governors convened a meeting to discuss how best to respond to Will Smith’s actions at the Oscars, in addition to accepting his resignation. The Board has decided, for 10 years from April 8, 2022, that Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards.

After that Will Smith also accepts the action taken by the Academy and said, 

“I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.”

So, it took 13 days but The Academy take the action against Will Smith and set an example to the whole world that violence is not an option in any circumstances.
