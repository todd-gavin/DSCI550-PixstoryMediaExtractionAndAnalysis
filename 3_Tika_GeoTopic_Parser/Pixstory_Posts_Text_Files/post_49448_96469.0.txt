Will Smith has been trending all day in US and India.

Will Smith made his first appearance post the Oscars controversy where he slapped Chris Rock in India. He was spotted at Kalina Airport in Mumbai.

Smith can be seen alighting from a car and making his way to the terminal in the photos, where he talks with a man who is most likely his host in the city. The cause for Smith's visit is unknown at this time. Some fans are expecting him to be in a Bollywood (Indian Film Industry) project. However, judging by a spiritual monk by his side and a spiritual necklace he was wearing, it could be said that he's in India for spiritual healing. He apparently stayed for three days at a very famous temple of India called 'ISKCON's Sri Sri Radha Vrindabanbehari' temple.

It isn't Smith's first spiritual visit to India. Will Smith and his family visited India in 2018 for a spiritual retreat in Haridwar. Will Smith is expected to receive an international award in 2022, according to an Indian guru.
