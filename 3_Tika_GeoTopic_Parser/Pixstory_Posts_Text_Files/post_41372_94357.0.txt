Whatever happens with Elon Musk's aggressive bid for Twitter, the political megaphone is up for grabs like never before. 

But what difference does it make? There is no single corporation that contributes more to the current state of political discourse. Twitter is politicians' first stop for breaking news and shaping views, despite its toxicity and prejudices. 

Axios reported that even though Congress was in recess, Musk's surprise decision sent shockwaves through Washington, as well as state and global capitals. Several Republicans hailed Musk as a hero and Twitter as the problem. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tweeted "Twitter's censors are freaking out about Elon Musk because they can't buy his silence."

It's not only about power or money in the discussion over whether Musk would be good or bad for Twitter. It's about the most American of principles — free speech — and the rights and responsibilities of private corporations to distinguish between falsehood and repression. 

It's also about where to draw the line when it comes to consolidating power in the hands of a single individual. And, given the current antitrust frenzy against big tech, a rival bid may be less likely.
