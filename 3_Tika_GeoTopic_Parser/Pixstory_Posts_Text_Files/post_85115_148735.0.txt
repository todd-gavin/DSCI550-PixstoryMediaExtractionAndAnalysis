If you are a technically gifted player, you can thrive anywhere in the midfield. Being a midfielder player means that you will set the pace of the game and cover the entire field, supporting defenders and strikers. A midfielder's job is difficult because he must make space for his teammates and feed goals to strikers.
Many top-level midfielders have played for Inter, and the players have led the club to new heights and established them as the best club in Europe. Inter and AC Milan have shared many world-class midfielders, and the players listed below are not among the best.
10 Nicol√≤ Barella
Barella is a small-framed playmaker with the authority to play freely and provide vision to his teammates. He synchronizes the pace of the game and is an industrious midfielder who likes to run across the pitch. He is unyielding and presses high until the opponent loses possession.
Barela joined Inter in 2020 and has been the club's best midfielder ever since, appearing in 143 games.
9 Emre Belozoglu
Inter was enticed by the Turkish player's technical ability and tactical sense, and Intersplurge money on the Turkish player to bring him to the club. He did not disappoint, being named Inter player of the year in the 2002-03 season and restoring the club's winning mentality.
He also helped the club reach the Champions League semi-finals and was named the club's 
 midfielder. However, he fell out of favor due to frequent injuries, and he only made 119 appearances for the club.
8 Borja Valero
The midfielder, who made only 100 appearances for the club, was dubbed the best player on the field. Valero was named Serie A player of the year after a dominant two-year run at Inter. His influence was so great that he was granted more gaming time.
He was an offensive-minded player known as a "mezzala" in Italian football jargon. He was a great playmaker who was as good as Modric and Iniesta.
