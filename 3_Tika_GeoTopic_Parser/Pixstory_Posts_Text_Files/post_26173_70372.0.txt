Rangoli i s not just a art for me . It is my emotions which i made on the floors . I usually made rangoli on the festival of dewali only, for me it is not a festival of crackers and all ,it is just a day of enjoyment for me when I can made rangoli as much as i can and nobody stops me that day . I not only made rangoli on the floor but also on Pooja plate and entrance door also.
I have never learn how to make  rangoli i just observe my friends and started making this.
