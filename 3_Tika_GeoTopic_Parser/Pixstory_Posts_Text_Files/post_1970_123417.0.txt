Depending on who you ask, Texas Governor Greg Abbott's decision to send two migrant-filled buses to New York City was either a commendable or abominable act. Each bus included around 40 migrants, with the second bus disembarking approximately 14 people in New York City. Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City, criticized the move by noting that Greg Abbott “used innocent people as political pawns to manufacture a crisis.”

I suppose it is easy to look at this situation and conclude that the governor is utilizing individuals as political pawns. Even though Texas likely devotes  fewer resources to aiding migrants than states like New York and cities like New York City, it seems evident that Greg Abbott was trying to make a statement by sending migrants to New York City.

In fact, Abbott said in a statement, ""I hope [Mayor Eric Adams] follows through on his promise of welcoming all migrants with open arms so that our overrun and overwhelmed border towns can find relief."  In addition, since April, Abbott has been sending illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C.

Whether or not this was a strictly political statement, it is hypocritical for Democrats to criticize Governor Abbott for using individuals as political pawns since Democrats do the same thing on a regular basis - and to a far further extent. This is no defense of his actions, of course, but sadly, this is the nature of politics, and whether we like it or not, those in power will always exploit the innocent to further their objectives.
