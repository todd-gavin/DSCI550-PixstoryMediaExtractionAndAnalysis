Human Rights Watch: Taliban work to protect Hazaras and other religious minorities
Human Rights Watch has said that Daesh has repeatedly attacked Hazaras and other religious minorities in their mosques, schools and workplaces, but the Taliban have done nothing to protect these communities. Since August 2021, ISIS has claimed responsibility for 13 attacks against Hazaras and has been involved in at least 3 other attacks.
These attacks have killed and wounded at least 700 people.
The Taliban's growing crackdown on the media, particularly in the provinces, means there are likely many more attacks that go unreported.
According to the report of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), recent ISIS attacks on Shiite gatherings in Kabul have left more than 120 dead and wounded.
Human Rights Watch wrote that the Hazaras are a predominantly Shiite ethnic group that has faced discrimination and abuse by successive Afghan governments for more than a century.
During the 1990s, Taliban forces targeted and massacred Shiites.
With the Taliban returning to power, Hazaras are increasingly concerned about their safety. Whether the Taliban authorities will protect them or not.
A member of the Hazara community in Bamyan province says: "Taliban never likes Hazaras. "The last time they were in power, they killed many of us."
