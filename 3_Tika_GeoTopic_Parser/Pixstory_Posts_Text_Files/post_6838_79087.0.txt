A 2:20-minute long video is being circulated on social media with the claim that a Muslim woman in Maharashtra prevented people from hoisting the Indian national flag and snatched the photo of Bharat Mata (Mother India) on Republic Day.

In the video, the woman can be seen arguing with people gathered around her and holding a photo of Bharat Mata. Security guards present in the crowd tell her multiple times to let go of the photo and engage in a conversation but the woman refuses, stating that “Mata Rani’s” photo does not belong in the hands of a man. The altercation soon turned violent with the woman slapping a few people and breaking the mobile phones of those recording her.

The video is viral on both Twitter and Facebook.

Alt News has also received multiple requests to verify the claim on its official mobile application (Android, iOS).

A YouTube channel also shared the video with an identical claim and received over 1000 views.

False anti-Muslim spin
According to a report by Navbharat Times, the incident took place on January 26, Republic Day, in the Lodha Amara residential complex in Thane, Maharashtra. A complaint was filed at Kapurbawdi police station against the woman by locals.

However, as per a video report by journalist Ronak Kotecha, the woman allegedly has a history of mental illness. Kotecha also stated that the police has filed an NC (complaint registered for non-cognizable offences) against the woman.

We also came across a tweet by Thane city police that confirms that an NC has been filed against the woman.

Furthermore, in a reply to one of the tweets which shared the viral video, an alleged resident from the woman’s housing society wrote that the woman is undergoing “psychological treatment”. The user deleted their tweet when Alt News reached out for comment and did not wish to speak for reasons unknown. Below is a screenshot of their tweet where the username and display picture have been blurred to protect the individual’s identity.
