An NBA source verified that Rick Brunson, the father of point guard Jalen Brunson, will join Tom Thibodeau's coaching staff to fill the opening left when Kenny Payne resigned to take the head coaching job at Louisville.

Thibodeau, who joined the Knicks nearly two years ago, wanted Brunson on his staff from the start, according to a source, but some in senior management were concerned about his tumultuous exit from the Timberwolves, after being accused of inappropriate behaviour against women while working for the group, Brunson resigned. Brunson's lawyer claimed that his client had committed no wrongdoing.

Brunson reportedly turned down a job with the Knicks two years ago because he wanted to wait until his son, Jalen, signed his second NBA deal after being paid the minimum as a Mavericks second-round pick in 2018.
