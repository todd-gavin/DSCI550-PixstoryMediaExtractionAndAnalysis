Paris Saint Germain are set to appoint Christophe Galtier as their new head coach as per Marca. The Nice boss is reportedly set to join the Parisians on a two-year deal as Mauricio Pochettino is being shown the door by the PSG chiefs.

As per Marca, "Christophe Galtier, who won Ligue 1 with Lille in 2020/21 and then coached Nice last year, visited the PSG facilities on Thursday before returning south to carry on with the move."

The report states that Paris Saint Germain could announce the hiring of their new manager this week itself. It is expected that Galtier would take over the reins and manage the training sessions immediately as a few players have returned to the club for the preseason. 

According to the same report, "Galtier's official presentation and introductory press conference should take place on Tuesday or Wednesday, according to L'Equipe. This, though, will soon be confirmed by the club."

Mauricio Pochettino is being removed from his role as the PSG owners were not happy with the team's performance in the 21/22 season. Paris Saint Germain only managed to win the Ligue 1 title in a disappointing campaign as they got knocked out of the Coupe de France and the UEFA Champions League early. 

It has to be seen if Christophe Galtier can manage the egos of the world-class players in his kitty at PSG this season!
