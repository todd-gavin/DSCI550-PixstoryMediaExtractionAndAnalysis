A Conservative MP has sent a letter interpreting children s gender identity doubts as nothing more than a phase to every school in his constituency What an outrageous act This is demeaning to the whole transsexual community Nick Fletcher MP for Don Valley South Yorkshire said he needed to clearly set out his position on the problem and asked head teachers to do the same His letter states that boys are boys and girls are girls and the media overemphasizes a transgender lifestyle It was also criticized by the former boss of an LGBTQ youth charity who said the statements deny the existence of transgender teens and could hurt their mental health According to BBC he mentions describes the trans question as an issue that seems to be taking over much public discourse these days The MP goes on to suggest that when it comes to feelings of being a boy or a girl books and media have made trans ideology acceptable to embrace But he writes it is his view that these depictions affirm something that is nothing more than a phase Mr Fletcher acknowledges that some may disagree with him but indicates that children who would previously have been dubbed Tomboys or similar may now wrongly be led to believe they are transgender This is what happens when proper sex education is not given to people This kind of statement hurt millions of trans people and makes their life miserable An MP should not be the one who makes such a statement This is not at all acceptable Source BBC
