The extreme weather that has battered much of the U S in doesn t just affect humans Heat waves wildfires droughts and storms also threaten many wild species including some that already face other stresses I ve been researching bee health for over years with a focus on honey bees In I began hearing for the first time from beekeepers about how extreme drought and rainfall were affecting bee colony health Drought conditions in the western U S in dried up bee forage the floral nectar and pollen that bees need to produce honey and stay healthy And extreme rain in the Northeast limited the hours that bees could fly for forage In both cases managed colonies hives that humans keep for honey production or commercial pollination were starving Beekeepers had to feed their bees more supplements of sugar water and pollen than they usually would to keep their colonies alive Some beekeepers who had been in business for decades shared that they lost to of their colonies over the winter of These weather conditions likely also affected wild and native bees And unlike managed colonies these important species did not receive supplements to buffer them through harsh conditions Each year the U S Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency host federal pollinator experts to share the latest scientific findings on bee and pollinator health and assess the status of these important insects birds bats and other species One clear takeaway from this year s meeting was that climate change has become a new and formidable stressor for bees potentially amplifying previously known issues in ways that scientists can t yet predict but need to prepare for The scourge of Varroa mitesPollinators contribute an estimated US billion to billion yearly to global agriculture based on the value of the crops they pollinate Understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change on pollinators is key for supporting healthy ecosystems and sustainable agriculture Read more
