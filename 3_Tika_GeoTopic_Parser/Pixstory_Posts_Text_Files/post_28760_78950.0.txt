The winter transfer window has often been considered a window where rarely a good signing happens, even though signings like Luis Suaraz to Liverpool and even Phil Coutinho to Liverpool have happened over the years. 

This year’s transfer window had some signings that can change the course of some team’s fate. The one team that seemed to have gained the most from this window is Everton. They got a new manager in Frank Lampard, got the Tottenham sensation Dele Ali and Manchester United’s star midfielder Donny VanDe Beek. They now seem to have a real balance in their team if Lampard finds a way to dig the team out of their misery. 

Arsenal had possibly the worst window as not only did they not sign anyone but also lost their star striker, Aubameyang, who made his move to Barcelona. 

Tottenham made two major signings in Juventus’s players making a move with Kulveski and Bentencaur finding their chance to work with Antonio Conte. 

The underdogs of this transfer window were FC Barcelona, who made several signings in form of Manchester City’s Ferran Torres, Dani Alves, Adama Traore and Arsenal’s Aubameyang. Their squad seems to have real depth and choices of players with their manager Xavi trying to make do of the crumbling situation of the club. 

With the window now officially over, we’ll get to see how things get spiced up in the Premier League and in the La Liga.
