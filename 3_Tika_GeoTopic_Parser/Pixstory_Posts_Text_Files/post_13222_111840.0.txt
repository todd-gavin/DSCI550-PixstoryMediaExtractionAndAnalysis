Bakhtar, the Taliban-controlled news agency, says that on the second day of the group's ulama meeting in Kabul, all participants raised their hands and pledged allegiance to Taliban leader Hebatullah Akhundzada.

Until now, no photos or videos of the meeting of Taliban scholars and the presence of the leader of this group have been published in this ceremony.

Moments ago, Sirajuddin Haqqani, the Taliban's interior minister, announced the presence of Hebatullah Akhundzadeh in the meeting of Taliban scholars.

Although the Taliban officials announced the presence of the Taliban leader and the allegiance of the ulama to Hebatullah Akhundzadeh, but so far no photos or videos of the meeting of the Taliban ulama and the presence of the leader of this group have been published.

On the other hand, the Taliban did not allow journalists to cover this meeting.

Ten months have passed since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, so far no photos or videos of the Taliban leader have been published.

In recent days, Rahmatullah Nabil, the former head of Afghanistan's national security, republished a video of the Taliban, saying that the group wants to replace Hebatullah Akhundzada with a man named Mullah Hamdullah. Mr. Nabil, based on his sources, claimed that Mullah Hamdullah is the same person who gave a speech to the people during Eid al-Fitr, and who appeared as the leader of the Taliban in Kandahar's Hakimiya school last year.

The former head of Afghanistan's national security said that the same person named Mullah Hebatullah may appear in the Taliban Ulema Assembly.
