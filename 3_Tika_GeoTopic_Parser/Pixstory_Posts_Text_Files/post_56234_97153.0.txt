Worried about the misuse of your private information? Online privacy is an important issue to be addressed. It is important to feel secure while you work or enjoy social media platforms. Here Pixstory is an excellent example of how your info remains protected and how a platform can prevent negative content from spreading and provides a platform to challenge peacefully. However many platforms online pose a threat to your personal information. Here are some tips to boost your online privacy. 

The main aspect is the public accounts created. You can choose to limit the access of your followers and unfollow unwanted users. Providing too much information on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram could make it easier for cybercriminals to obtain specified information, which could allow them to steal your identity or access your financial information. You can leave out about sections for your safety and set very strong passwords. 

You can always browse in incognito mode or the private mode if you don’t want your computer to save your browsing history, temporary internet files, or cookies. In Chrome, it’s called Incognito Mode. Firefox calls its setting Private Browsing, and Internet Explorer uses the name InPrivate Browsing for its privacy feature. When you search with these modes turned on, others won’t be able to trace your browsing history from your computer. It gives you maximum safety. 

There is no compulsion to adhere to one search engine. Privacy is one reason people prefer to use anonymous search engines.

This type of search engine doesn’t collect or share your search history or clicks. Anonymous search engines can also block ad trackers on the websites you visit.

Secure your mobile devices too. This is very important. Don't attend to all the spam emails or random messages.
