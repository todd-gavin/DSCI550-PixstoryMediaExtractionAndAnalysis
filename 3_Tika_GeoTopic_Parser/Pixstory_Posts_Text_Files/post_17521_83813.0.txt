Anthony Davis has not been dependable for the LA Lakers this season due to injuries and playing below his abilities. As a result, the Lakers have not performed at the level many expected and are ninth in the Western Conference.

Several injuries have kept the big man sidelined, but he was never at his best either when healthy. His shooting has been woeful, and he has not gelled with Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in the offseason.

Fans have been livid with his performances this season, heaping the bulk of the blame on his lackluster approach. Nonetheless, everyone is aware of how lethal he can be on both ends of the floor.

The Lakers' next challenge will be against the LA Clippers, a familiar foe who has been the better team this season, on Friday. Fans are eager to hear good news regarding Davis, which is why many are interested in his status ahead of tipoff.

According to the most recent injury report released by the NBA, Davis is listed as "out" against the Clippers. The 2012 draft's first overall pick sprained his foot in the Lakers' last outing against the Utah Jazz before the All-Star weekend.

Seeing him limp off was frustrating for Lakers fans as he was starting to get into rhythm. He had an incredible run following his return from a knee injury but will be unavailable for an extended period.

Word from the organization reveals that Davis will be reevaluated in four weeks. Keeping that in mind, the earliest date for his return will be March 18 against the Toronto Raptors.

The Lakers will have to figure out a way to play without Davis for that period. Perhaps LeBron James will start at center moving forward, a role in which he was fairly successful earlier this season.
