An Italian adjudged as someone who is at the wrong end of his career when he chose Everton to manage last season in the Premier League. A move which came as a surprise for many for someone of his calibre coming to the blue side of Merseyside which isn't seen as ambitious as their city rivals Liverpool. 
We today, are talking about none other than Carlo Ancelotti. A man who has always been at this peak ever since his early AC Milan days to this date where he won his fourth Champions League title when Spanish giants Real Madrid defeated Liverpool just two days ago.
The media being the media, did their part when they deemed Carlo to be at the end of his career only for him to go on to win the league and a European cup later next season. The giants from Madrid came calling for Carlo when Zinedine Zidane decided to part ways and the Italian said yes without any hesitation, which was quite obvious and for someone who was at Everton and then going on to win a double the next season, it indeed doesn't mean that the guy is at the wrong end of his career.
Don Carlo with his talismen in Karim Benzema and Vini Jr. steem rolled the league, certainly maybe because other clubs weren't at their best but one cannot disregard what Ancelotti and Real Madrid have managed to do, especially in Europe considering who all they beat in their way to glory and the comebacks they made on their way to the promised land could be put into football history for what we witnessed was nothing short of miraculous.
A special season coming to an end the most deservedly way for Don Carlo and his men, no doubt whatsoever.
