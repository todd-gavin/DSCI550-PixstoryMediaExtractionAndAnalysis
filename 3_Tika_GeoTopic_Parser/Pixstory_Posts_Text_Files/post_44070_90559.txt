Neville Southall a former Wales captain has challenged Wayne Hennessey to aim for a record breaking caps for his country In Tuesday s friendly against the Czech Republic at the Cardiff City Stadium Burnley goalkeeper Hennessey will become Wales third male centurion With caps Southall held the record for Wales for many years Former Everton goalkeeper Southall in a message to Hennessey said Well done mate there is another in the bank if you want to try Speaking to BBC Sport Wales Southall added There is no point sitting here and saying I have and finishing You have to push on and get as many as you can because I know you can sit at home and have loads of memories So you may as well just crack on Hennessey will become the sixth player from Wales to reach the century mark Gareth Bale scored his st goal in last Thursday s historic World Cup play off semi final triumph against Austria which he shared with fellow squad member Chris Gunter who leads the way for men with Jess Fishlock Loren Dykes and Sophie Ingle all from Wales have also reached the century milestone Danny Ward has been favoured to Hennessey in previous years but the Leicester goalkeeper is presently out with a knee injury So Hennessey who was born in Bangor returned to the starting lineup against Austria marking his first competitive start for Wales since being injured against Bulgaria in October People don t understand how much incredible mental strength it takes to come from a situation like that said Southall If you are playing regularly from Championship down to League Two then it s a massive step for you anyway mentally and physically because it is played a lot differently Wayne is used to training with great players every day so that is a bonus for him so his level will not drop in that sense what you do miss is the sharpness of match stuff
