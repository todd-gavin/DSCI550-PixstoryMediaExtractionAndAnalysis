Manchester United has complained to the Premier League about the top four races credibility after delayed dates have left them with three major matches in nine days United will play Liverpool on Tuesday and Arsenal on Saturday giving them only four days to prepare for their match against Chelsea which has been moved to April due to the Blues progress to the FA Cup final With the fight for the top four so tight United are three points behind Tottenham and level with Arsenal The Guardian reports that the Red Devils are annoyed by having so many big games so close together especially because their last two games are still days off The Premier League has been approached by club officials who are questioning the legitimacy of pushing the Chelsea match forward at this time implying that the other teams vying for a place in the top four would not face anything as difficult I didn t anticipate the Chelsea game would be rearranged from the original fixture interim manager Ralf Rangnick said of the decision to MUTV In Germany the final two games of the season must normally be played on the same day and at the same time Obviously things aren t the same here For us it s not ideal since we have a number of injured players so it would have been better if the Chelsea game had been scheduled two weeks later But in any case we ll have to contend with it and perhaps two or three of those injured players will indeed be back by then Rangnick is already missing Fred Scott McTominay Raphael Varane Edinson Cavani and Luke Shaw for Tuesday s match against Liverpool and Cristiano Ronaldo s attendance is in doubt after his kid died on Monday evening
