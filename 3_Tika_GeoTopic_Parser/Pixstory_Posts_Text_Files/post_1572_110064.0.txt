Now that the Kings have drafted Keegan Murray it seems the starting roster is set barring any drastic free agent signings. They will clearly be active in free agency but an upgrade at most positions seems unlikely. The starting C, PG, PF and SF are clear and the chance of signing a better positional talent than Barnes at SF is low considering the best free agent signing Sac has ever had is Vlade Divac. 

That leaves us with the position of SG as the clear position Sac needs to fill. Free Agents Bradley Beal and Zach Levine are two big names Sac could go after to upgrade the position but that isn’t happening. After thoroughly scanning the available free agents or trade prospects the answer seems clear…. 

The Kings need to start Davion Mitchell in the back court alongside Fox. 

I believe Davion is actually a big reason the Kings didn’t draft Jaden Ivey. Davion clearly showed he is a tremendous talent last year who can play either the 1 or the 2 and can change the game defensively. He doesn’t fit the traditional mold of a 2 but sharing the back court with a 6’4 shoot-first PG in Fox who has the tools to play defense but is less focused on that side of the ball makes Davion a very good fit. Fox and Ivey both don’t have good focus defensively, need to have the ball in their hands to thrive due to extreme athleticism and aren’t known for their shooting. We saw some of this duplication last year with Fox and Halliburton last year which led to the trade. Their impact skyrocketed when the other was off the floor. 

Mitchell, on the other hand, seems to be able to thrive in other ways without the ball in his hands as a defensive stopper, spot up shooter and second fiddle facilitator. A nice duo comparison is Joe Dumars and Isaiah Thomas in the 80’s. 

The Yin to Fox’s Yang. 

Outside of landing Bradley Beal or Zach Levine Mitchell may be the smartest option to pair with Fox.
