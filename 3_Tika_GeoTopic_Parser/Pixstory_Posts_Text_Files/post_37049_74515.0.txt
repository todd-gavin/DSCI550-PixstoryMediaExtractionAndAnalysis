When choosing to adopt a pet, the lifestyle of the owner and the pet should be compatible. Once a pet is chosen, the owner should ensure the pet has been spayed or neutered and properly identified. The responsibility to the animal should be a commitment for the lifetime of the pet. If a situation arises that the owner can no longer provide a suitable household for the animal, it should be the owners first priority to re-home the pet.Â
