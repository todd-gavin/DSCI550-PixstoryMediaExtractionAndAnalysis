Just sharing two of my favourite paragraphs from the book I just completed reading a pretty popular book I know but definitely worth reading Its a mix of different emotions and this is my first time writing a book review so I m not the best at it as visible but I d rate it a and I read this one in bits and pieces but can be completed in two sittings if you re committed enough
