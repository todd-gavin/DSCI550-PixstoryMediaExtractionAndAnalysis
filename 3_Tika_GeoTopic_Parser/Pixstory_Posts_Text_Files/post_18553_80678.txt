No third medal for Arianna Fontana who fell on the last lap today in the meters of the short track when she was in third place. right she commented at the end of the race I had seen the American behind The judges interpreted her in a different way but I can&#39;t help but accept their decision I was happy and full of energy I felt good the disqualification leaves a bitter taste in my mouth The race was won by the Dutch Suzanne Schulting gold silver medal to the South Korean Min Jeong Choi bronze to the Belgian Hanne Desmet
