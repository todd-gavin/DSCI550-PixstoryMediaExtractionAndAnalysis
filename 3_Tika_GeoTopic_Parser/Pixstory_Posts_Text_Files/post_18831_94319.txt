The season that has just begun is likely to be a particularly complicated season for Hamilton. After the first three grands prix, the Mercedes driver collected just one podium, the lowest step on his debut. In Australia, he finished fourth before him, only teammate Russell one who was put under contract after doing well at Williams and certainly not satisfied with a backup role A former Mercedes spoke of Hamilton two-times world champion Mika Hakkinen Lewis Hamilton may think about changing teams he said I bet he&#39;s in a bad mood I can imagine complaints after complaints In these situations, the pilots naturally think about whether they should go elsewhere He has been with Mercedes for many years and he has won many world championships now that things are not going well he will start thinking about changing teams For the ex World champion in and certainly not the season for Hamilton who, as mentioned, will also have to be careful of his teammate Russell comes from Williams where he had only achieved good results in qualifying He is achieving good results while for Hamilton it is a disaster
