“I drafted the heartbeat law, and it was a tough pill to swallow when we had to make that compromise to create the exceptions for rape and incest,” said Blaine Conzatti, the president of the Idaho Family Policy Center. “And so that’s something that I would like to fix in the future.”
The chairman of the Idaho House committee managing abortion legislation, Republican state Rep. Brent Crane, said he has no plans to introduce proposals that would further restrict abortion during the upcoming session because he thinks the state should proceed "slowly and deliberately." He declared that he was satisfied with the law's existing exemptions and expected that his panel would reject any proposal to eliminate the exception for rape and incest.
Once again, why are men in authoritative positions to decide for women? 1 in every 3 women have already lost most abortion access. Little girls who have been victims to rape are having to go through life threatening pregnancies because of the current state of the law and they want to further legalize forced birth due to rape and incest? Thiss is scary, revolting and misogynist. Men need to get off the throne and leave women alone.
