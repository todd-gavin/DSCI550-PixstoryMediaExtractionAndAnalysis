Pope Francis' recent colon surgery, mobility concerns, and a string of events that appear to be bolstering his legacy have the world wondering if he is set to step down.
In late August, the Pope will visit L'Aquila in central Italy. The travel to L'Aquila on August 28 will kick off the "Feast of Forgiveness," a seven-century-old celebration started by Pope Celestine V, who resigned in 1294 after only four months in the pontificate.

Most popes die leading the Catholic Church, but in 2013, Pope Benedict XVI, the first pope to step down in nearly 600 years, since Pope Gregory XII in 1415, did so. Resignation is permitted by Roman Catholic Church Canon Law, which states that popes are free to renounce their duties at any time.
