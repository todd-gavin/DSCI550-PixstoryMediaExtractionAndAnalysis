As per Caught Offside, the Blues are looking at Wesley Fofana to replace Antonio Rudiger. The Leicester City defender has been impressive with the club since he joined. Hence the Foxes' defender has drawn the attention of multiple Premier League clubs.

The Blues will not just be losing Rudiger in the summer. As per reports, Andreas Christensen is also on his way out of the club. The Danish center-back is reportedly moving to Barcelona on a free transfer in the summer.

Having joined Leicester City in 2020, Wesley Fofana had an impressive first season with the Foxes. The French center-back played a key part in helping his side finish fifth in the 2020/21 Premier League season. 

But the defender sadly broke his leg in the preseason and has hence missed the majority of the 2021/22 season. Following the injury layoff, Fofana made his return against Rennes in March 2022. 

Since returning, the 21-year-old Wesley Fofana has significantly improved the Foxes' defence in the six games that he has played. Out of these, three have been in the Premier League and three have been in the UEFA Conference League. 

Wesley Fofana signed a new five-year deal with Leicester City in March 2022. His new contract would keep him at the club until 2027. Hence Chelsea would have to fork out anything around £80-100 million if they are to sign the Frenchman.
