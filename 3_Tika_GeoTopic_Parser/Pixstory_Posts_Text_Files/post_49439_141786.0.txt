Elizabeth II never expressed regret for the colonial legacy of the Crown's plundering of the Global South. Not even with the gems on her crown that were stolen from Africa and India.
Everything that the Crown possesses has been taken. It was not earned in any way. The Great Star of Africa, the largest clear-cut diamond in the world, and India's renowned Koh-i-noor, or the Kohinoor diamond are among the royal jewels.
The 530-carat Star of Africa is thought to be worth $400 million and was discovered in South Africa in 1905. It is also estimated that the 109-carat Kohinoor, dubbed the world's most renowned diamond, is worth $400 million. It was discovered in the southern Indian Golconda mines and was taken away by the royalty using force.
Both of the times, the British claimed the gems were gifted to them by the natives of India and Africa but the same natives have something else to say. With the Queen's death, calls from India ans Africa have been strong about wanting their jewels back. And can we blame them? They want what's theirs.
As funny as it sounds, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth - II was even sued by some Indians for stealing the Kohinoor diamond. That's how much it matters to whom it belongs.
