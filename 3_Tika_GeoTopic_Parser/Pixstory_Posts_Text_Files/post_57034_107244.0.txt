Tennis star Serena Williams announced through an Instagram post that she would be making a comeback at Wimbledon 2022. She shared a post on her Instagram handle wearing her Nike with the caption "SW and SW19. It's a date. 2022, see you there."

Williams also tagged Eastbourne in her post, hinting that she could play in next week's grasscourt tournament on England's south coast.
Serena Jameka Williams is an American professional tennis player. She has been ranked singles world No. 1 by the Women's Tennis Association for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. In addition, she has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era and the second-most of all time. 

She would be playing after a year-long break. Williams suffered from an injury during her first-round match at the All England Club 12 months ago, which halted her playing in the games. 

Wimbledon will begin on June 27.
