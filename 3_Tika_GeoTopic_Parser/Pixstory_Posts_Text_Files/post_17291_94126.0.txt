PSG will take on Olympique Marseille in the 102nd edition of Le Classique on Sunday. Mauricio Pochettino's side have a 12-point lead at the top with seven games remaining in the season. If they can take all three points on Sunday, they will have more or less dumped second-placed Marseille out of the Ligue 1 title race.

Paris Saint-Germain have showcased sensational form in the league in recent weeks. They've sprung to action following their early exit from the Champions League and have produced a few utterly dominant performances.

PSG have won their last two games by a combined scoreline of 11-2. Pochettino will want more of the same from his players as they take on their rivals this Sunday.

Without further ado, let's take a look at PSG's possible lineup for their Ligue 1 encounter against Marseille.
