Okay honestly, I'm going crazy over here!! Can't wait for October 21. It was such a pleasant surprise from her. Swifties around the world are going insane and can we blame them? 
Like one fan said, "The way we went from praising her VMA look to adoring her moves to joking about drunk taylor to being struck by her teasing TS10 announcement to waiting midnight for the announcement to praising the after party looks well it was the craziest night for swifties."
