Reiss Nelson has been a player that has been on the fringes of Arsenal for some time now Loans to teams like Hoffenheim and Feyenoord over the years have shown there s a player with real promise there but can he reach his potential In the final year of his deal this is his last shot at Arsenal in my opinion A player with real talent in combination play especially So intelligent in his ability to roam into the left half space and combine with players around him he creates space for those who can make runs off the ball to be found However he needs to be more aggressive So many times you see Reiss vs and he is static over thinking the action He has the ability to run past players but he gets stuck in his own way often being to timid and trying to make the right pass instead of being brave It s a really pivotal season for him This Europa league run gives him a real opportunity at some tangible minutes Mikel has highlighted him today in the press conference and Arsenal themselves have tweeted about him We need a creative LW and he needs to secure his future Let s see how he does tomorrow
