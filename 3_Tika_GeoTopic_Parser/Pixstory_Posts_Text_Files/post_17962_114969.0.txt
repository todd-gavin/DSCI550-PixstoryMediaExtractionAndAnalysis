Nothing says British summertime quite like a day at Wimbledon—or Kate Middleton in a polka dot dress. The Duchess of Cambridge made her first appearance at the 2022 tournament on Tuesday July 5 wearing one of her favorite Alessandra Rich tea dresses in her signature print. 

The famously sporty royal, who is a patron of the All England Tennis Club as well as a keen player herself, arrived as Britain’s breakout star Cameron Norrie was set to face Belgium’s David Goffin in the men’s quarter-final. Britain’s hopes now rest on Norrie’s shoulders, after Emma Raducanu and Andy Murray were both knocked out in the second round. 
Kate styled her cornflower-blue belted dress—which the increasingly conscious dresser previously wore to make a surprise appearance at a street party over the Platinum Jubilee weekend—with pearl earrings, classic tortoiseshell sunglasses and a neat white handbag. The addition of slingback stiletto heels was an unexpected choice from the avowed fan of a simple suede pump.
