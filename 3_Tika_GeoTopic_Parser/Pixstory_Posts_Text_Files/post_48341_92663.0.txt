In a historic first, the Senate Thursday narrowly confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to become the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. Three Republican senators joined all 50 Democrats in voting for Jackson.

This moment was centuries in making and to say that it was a tough road would be an understatement. As NY Times reported, even her nomination also highlighted the relative rarity of Black women in the legal profession. Only 4.7 percent of lawyers are Black and just 70 Black women have ever served as a federal judge, representing fewer than 2 percent of all such judges.

Especially for me, as a black women, this is a powerful movement. With this, Ketanji Brown Jackson has proved that black women deserve to be seen, heard and represented. This is a deeply personal moment for all of us black women and this opens the doors for us which were closed in the 233 year court history. 

Even after so called progression, black women are not deemed capable of holding positions of power especially in the academic fields like law. But, Jackson is a lone wolf fighting against all these discriminatory ideas single handedly. 

For years, it was instilled in black women that in order to be successful, we will have to imitate white people. From their hairstyle to their dialect, we were told to learn from the “best.” The hostile questioning she faced was coloured with the prejudice of racism. However, Jackson unashamedly embracing her black identity and walking tall has inspired black women all over the country, especially black women in law who were always told that they will never be “good enough.”

This is merely the start of a revolution and it’s time for blank women to assert their identity and proudly claim that they belong in the highest of offices of the country.
