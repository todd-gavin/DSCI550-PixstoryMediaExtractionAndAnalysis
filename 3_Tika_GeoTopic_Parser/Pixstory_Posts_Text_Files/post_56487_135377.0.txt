Rafael Nadal has been pushed to breaking point by Australian wildcard Rinky Hijikata in an epic US Open first round match
The 22-time grand slam champion dropped the first set to leave the New York crowd stunned before he dug deep to fight back and win the match 4-6 6-2 6-3 6-3.
It was only at the end of a marathon 15-minute service game — that brought the crowd to its feet — that Nadal finally won the match with his fifth match point.
Hijikata was given a standing ovation as he left the court and Nadal also stood and applauded as his opponent walked off after their three-hour battle.
Nadal called Hijikata a “tough” opponent in his brief post-match on-court interview.
The 21-year-old ambushed the Spanish superstar with some spectacular groundstrokes on Wednesday morning AEST, taking the opening set of their round one encounter 6-4 in front of a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows.
