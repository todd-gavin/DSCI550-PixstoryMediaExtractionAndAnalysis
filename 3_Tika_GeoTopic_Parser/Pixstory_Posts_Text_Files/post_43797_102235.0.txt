Uncertainty has surrounded the club in recent months, but ideally a fresh start will be announced shortly, allowing the club's complete focus to return to matters on the field.

Even
though injuries prevented him from playing as much as he, his management, or the fans would
have liked during the 2021/22 season, James once again shone in that area.

Despite the chaos, Chelsea still managed to win two silverwares, and came close to winning
two more. James is confident that next season will be no different because of his competitive instinct.

‘We are a massive club in the world, and our aim is still going to be to win every trophy we can.

The players at this club are ambitious. You’re playing at this club for a reason. The quality is so
high.

‘No matter the owner, we are the ones who go out and perform on the pitch. Next season we
are going to have many competitions to play and hopefully get some more trophies under our
belt. We’ve got enough quality so there’s no reason why we can’t do it.’

James had 39 appearances this season, scoring six goals and assisting on ten occasions. He
played approximately 3000 minutes of football, starring at right wing-back, on the right side of
the defence three, and sliding inside to help out in midfield.

However, the 22-year-old finds no solace in Thomas Tuchel's praise when he was sidelined for
nearly two months due to a hamstring injury.

‘I don’t want to be out for people to say he’s missed. I want to play every game I can. That’s
something I need to work on going into the new season. There are a few things I can adapt or
change to make sure I don’t reoccur the same injury.’

Finally, as a tumultuous season came to a close, James had a message for Chelsea fans.

During the lap of thanks on Sunday, his name was shouted loudly and proudly.
