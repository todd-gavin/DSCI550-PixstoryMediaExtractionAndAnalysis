Humane slaughter is based on the assumption that animals have no desire to live. Animals aren't thought to be sentient or intelligent enough to appreciate the value of their own existence. As a result, proponents of humane killing argue that our moral commitment to animals is to reduce the pain and suffering connected with their deaths. However, the finest empirical study as well as plain observation, on the other hand, clearly shows that the contrary is true. Animals do battle vociferously for their own lives, the lives of their young ones, and even the lives of members of their wider social group, as we would for our own.
'Humane slaughter' suggests that animals exist just to serve as a resource, implying a firm belief in dominionism. Animals have a complicated range of interests which does not include a desire to be a human commodity, according to the best science we have. Humane slaughter disregards the animal's point of view, instead relying on anthropomorphic claims to draw conclusions about how animals suffer or do not suffer under various circumstances, which are then asserted as "facts." Humane slaughter is frequently predicated on a pseudo-scientific understanding of pain and suffering psychology and physiology in animals.
Slaughter, whether 'ethical' or not, has ramifications that go beyond animal misery. Several studies of slaughterhouse workers have found clear connections between animal and human violence. Many slaughterhouse workers work in appalling conditions and frequently experience PTSD, depression, and higher levels of violence in their daily lives.
