Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is the latest Ubisoft title headed to the Xbox Game Pass and is now available on the platform.
 While Assassin's Creed Odyssey is coming to the Game Pass service for PC and Xbox consoles, players should not look forward to getting the DLC for free, as it’s common for the Xbox Game Pass to only feature the base game, while the DLC has to be purchased.
Released back in 2018, Odyssey was the sequel to Assassin's Creed Origins and took the franchise to Greece for the first time. While Origins ended up rebooting the Assassin's Creed franchise in a major way, it was Odyssey that went on to find even larger success with the new formula for the series.
In Assassin's Creed Odyssey, players take on the role of a legendary Spartan hero, forging their own destiny in a war-torn world. 
Allowing exploration on foot, horseback, and through the oceans surrounding Greece, players take on the role of either Cassandra or Alexios and embark on an epic adventure. 
Featuring a choice based system, the player’s decisions matter significantly, as their actions help shape the world around them.
Marking the second game in the Assassin’s Creed franchise to hit the Xbox Games Pass library, Assassin's Creed Odyssey also marks the second in Ubisoft's trilogy of Assassin's Creed games that took on more of an RPG focus. Rather than being specifically about stealth and assassinations, players have to build their own character in order to meet the challenges of the world around them. 
Given both Odyssey and Origins are now on the platform, it’s likely that Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla will eventually join them. 
However it is unlikely that the Viking based Witcher 3 type RPG will be available on Game Pass anytime soon given that Valhalla has only just received a new rogue-like expansion, and its final free update is planned to release later this year.
