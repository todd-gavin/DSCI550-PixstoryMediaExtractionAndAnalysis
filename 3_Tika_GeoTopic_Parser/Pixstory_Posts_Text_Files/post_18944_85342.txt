When the UCI gave the possibility to change nationality after the blockade of Russia and Belarus, the cyclist Pavel Sivakov did not think twice and applied to become French. A nation that he has always felt as his own, having been born in Italy in San Don del Piave but raised in France in Haute Garonne He has always competed for Russia but now years with the blockade of Russian sports due to the conflict ready to change sides I wanted to become French for a long time Sivakov wrote on social media I asked the question to UCI but considering what is happening in Ukraine I wanted to speed things up I would like to thank my team the Ineos Grenadiers and the UCI for supporting me in this process and helping to make this a reality Now having the chance to race as a Frenchman in the international trials makes me proud It would be a dream for me to do the Paris Olympics in and compete for France About war As I said I am totally against the war and all my thoughts go out to the people of Ukraine Like most people in the world in I want peace right now and hope for a quick end to the suffering in Ukraine
