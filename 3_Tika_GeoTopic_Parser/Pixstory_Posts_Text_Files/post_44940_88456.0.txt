In honour of those who died in the Hillsborough catastrophe, Nottingham Forest has announced that 97 seats would be left empty for Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final match against Liverpool.

In 1989, what should have been a magnificent day out for both clubs' supporters turned into Britain's biggest sporting disaster and one of football's darkest hours, with 97 people killed unlawfully and over 700 injured after a series of police failures resulted in excessive congestion.

In the 2022 edition of the competition, the two clubs will meet again, with Forest hoping to add Liverpool to the list of Premier League clubs they have eliminated this season; Arsenal and Leicester have already been eliminated at the City Ground.

Although a place in the Wembley semi-finals is on the line, the game is special because it is the first time Forest and Liverpool have met in the FA Cup since that April day in 1989 - indeed, it is the first time the two sides have faced in any competition in the twenty-first century.

Representatives from the Nottingham Forest Supporters' Trust visited Anfield earlier this week to place floral wreaths at the memorial in memory of the 97, as well as meet Margaret Aspinall, who has led the struggle for justice for decades, and the Reds fan organisation Spirit of Shankly.

In what is sure to be an emotional event for both sets of supporters, Forest revealed on social media that 97 seats will be left vacant to honour those who have lost their lives.

The game will begin at 6 p.m. on Sunday and will be the penultimate tie of the quarter-final round.
