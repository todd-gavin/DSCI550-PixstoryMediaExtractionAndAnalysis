Hey I am Born and brought up in Delhi I never feel like leaving Delhi for once the facilities we all are getting here the high level of education transportation and whatnot In Delhi most things are changed or developed However The only thing that still not has changed is the safety of women There are still incidents of rape domestic violence and eve teasing Even on the crime front the rate of crime against children has drastically increased As a woman I don t feel safe while going out in any new or isolated place It is not just the wish it s the need of this time Many women like me can enjoy their life the fullest if we can get a safe environment As a human being can I not even ask for a safe environment
