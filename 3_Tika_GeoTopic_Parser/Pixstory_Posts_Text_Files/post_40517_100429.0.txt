Today our hearts are broken and we grieve for the victims of the horrific act of gun violence in Buffalo and for their families and friends.  The Second Gentleman and I are praying for all those who knew and lost love ones. 
 
Law enforcement is proceeding with its investigation, but what is clear is that we are seeing an epidemic of hate across our country that has been evidenced by acts of violence and intolerance.  We must call it out and condemn it. Racially-motivated hate crimes or acts of violent extremism are harms against all of us, and we must do everything we can to ensure that our communities are safe from such acts.
