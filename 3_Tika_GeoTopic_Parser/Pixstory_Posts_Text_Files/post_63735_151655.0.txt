The developers at Swedish studio Systematic Reaction have just released a 16 minute gameplay video for their upcoming fantasy open world roguelite action game Ravenbound offering an extended look at the game’s mechanics. Inspired by Swedish folklore, Ravenbound can essentially be considered what would happen to Skyrim if it went roguelite and was first revealed earlier this year during Gamescom.
The official Ravenbound info states “You are the Vessel. Carried within you is a powerful weapon forged by ancient gods to defeat the Betrayer. They called it Raven, and its sacred duty is to rid Ávalt of the dark forces. Knowing this mission would take many lifetimes to complete, they enshrined the Raven in the body of warriors, conduits for the Raven’s quest.
Prepare for death, Vessel, but fight knowing that with every enemy you defeat, you serve those who’ll come after you. They inherit the wisdom you gain traveling across Ávalt, gathering resources, overcoming perilous challenges, and battling ferocious enemies. The loop closes when a Vessel arises powerful enough to see the Raven fulfill its purpose.”
The new gameplay trailer is outlined by Ravenbound‘s creative director and lead designer and showcases the unique combat skills of the player character known as the Vessel. 
In a similar vibe to that of the Dragonborn, the Vessel carries an ancient power within them but must use all their skills with steel and blade to survive and carry out their heroic mission. Furthermore, much like Skyrim, Avalt is an open world free to explore world that can be explored via foot or on wings in the form of a raven. 
Ravenbound is due for PC via Steam soon though no specific date is currently specified. Nonetheless, the release of some of the gameplay footage may mean that news of a launch date is just around the corner, but we’ll have to wait and see
