Well, I am not joking, coffee has been a villain according to many studies yet there is a silver lining for coffee lovers. according to research published in Annals of Internal Medicine, people who drink a reasonable amount of coffee — up to 3½ cups a day — might have a better chance at a longer life span, even if their coffee is lightly added by sugar.

The researchers tracked the coffee consumption and health of 171,616 participants for 7 years, the participants were an average of nearly 56 years old and were free of cancer and cardiovascular disease when the study started.

 They found that those who regularly drank 1½ to 3½ cups of coffee a day, whether plain or sweetened with about a teaspoon of sugar, were up to 30 percent less likely to die in that time frame from any cause, including cancer and cardiovascular disease, than were those who did not drink coffee.

The type of coffee or lightly sweetened with sugar doesn’t matter with the results. However, the result didn’t prove that coffee alone was responsible for the increased mortality rates. 

 Still, over the years, research has revealed a variety of health benefits for coffee, linking its consumption to a reduced risk for Type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and more. Caffeine however is not recommended for people with anxiety or during pregnancy.
