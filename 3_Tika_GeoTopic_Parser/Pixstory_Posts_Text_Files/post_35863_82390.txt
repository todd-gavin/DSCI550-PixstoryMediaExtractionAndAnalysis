Musso could have done more on the occasion of Soares&#39; goal Toloi commits some small distractions in defense but good at spurring his team with his usual ball and chain outings Demiral the undisputed leader of the defense He fields a warrior&#39;s grit and good at making up for it in the event of a mistake by his teammates Djimsiti in the second half, he overturns Olympiacos by himself with a masterful brace First he scores with a perfect header and then as a true raptor from the area he scores the Maehle tries to make himself useful with some good bucking on the right in support of the attacking department st Hateboer sv de Roon the Dutchman seems to be a fish out of water in the middle of the field Freuler&#39;s orphan is unable to leave his mark on the match st Freuler plays a piece of the match in an orderly manner Pessina evanescent He swaps position with Pasalic during the match but not even in a more advanced part of the pitch St Koopmeiners manages to affect the team with his introduction he gives quality to the team He takes over the reins of the midfield and sorts many balls left and right Pezzella great performance by the Nerazzurri winger He proves again once all his will to do well Pasalic would have done better to ask for paternity leave He blatantly misses simple phrases and seems disoriented on the pitch Malinovskyi tries some of his inventions embroidering on the edge of the area st Mihaila good at exploiting his speed He moves well and helps the team keep up the ball Muriel unrecognizable The Luis Muriel we were used to even just last year seems like a distant memory The Colombian is in fact unable to adequately support the team&#39;s offensive department and is always closed by the opposing defense st Boga he gives his team a different look with his introduction, good at aiming for a man and putting the opposing defense in difficulty Mattia Maraglio
