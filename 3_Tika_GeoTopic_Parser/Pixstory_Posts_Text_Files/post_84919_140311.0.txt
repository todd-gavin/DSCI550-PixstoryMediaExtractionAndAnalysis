#3. Fred
Frederico Rodrigues Santons joined Manchester United in the summer of 2018 from Shakhtar Donetsk. It is fair to say that it took Fred a little while to adapt to the physical demands of the Premier League. Former Manchester United manager Ole Gunner Solskjaer placed great trust in the Brazilian and once he adapted to the league, he emerged as one of the mainstays in Solsjkaerâ€™s side. Fred was awarded a call-up to the national side and has also cemented his place in the team.
#2. Cassemiro
Casemiro moved to Manchester United this summer from Real Madrid for a fee in the region of 60 million euros. The 30-year-old enjoyed massive success in Spain winning 5 champions league titles along the way. There is no doubt that Casemiro is one of the best defensive midfielders in the world and he will add something to Manchester United that they have missed for years. It will be interesting to see how he copes with the high-intensity and physical demands of the league but it is expected that given the experience and quality he possesses, this should not be a difficult task.
#1. Ederson
Ederson is one of the best goalkeepers in world football as of now and when it comes to what is required of a goalkeeper in the modern era, the Brazilian ticks all the boxes. He possesses brilliant technical qualities which means his ball-playing abilities is off the charts and he is also an excellent shot-stopper. The 29-year-old plays a crucial role in how Manchester City play as Pep Guardiola demands his side to play a possession-based game, which starts out from the back. Ederson will have competition in Alisson Becker for the number 1 spot in the national side and will be intriguing to see who wins that battle.
