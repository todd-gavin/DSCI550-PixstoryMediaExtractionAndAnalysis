Giacomo Raspadori will probably be a new Napoli player by the end of the week but the lengthening of the negotiation is making Sassuolo annoyed and through its managing director Giovanni Carnevali has expressed disappointment The negotiation is not stalled but we are sorry to do without it on the day of a match like this important said the neroverde manager at the end of the match lost against Juventus in which Raspadori, being already close to leaving Sassuolo, did not play from the first minute and his performance was affected by it The market doesn&#39;t work like this it doesn&#39;t work it doesn&#39;t work continued Carnevali yes they upset the squads and we are feeling the effects a lot We planned to focus on Raspadori but negotiations were carried out without him taking into account what we were offering There is no deadline but I hope it closes well before next week
