A video of a man dressed in a burqa caught by the police is being circulated on social media. The video has been shared with various captions by Naveen Kumar Jindal, media head of BJP Delhi, Prashant Umrao, spokesperson of BJP Uttar Pradesh, Suchitra Pathak Kakkar, state social media chief of BJP Mahila Morcha UP, among others. Kakkar claimed that the man was one of the protestors of the hijab ban caught in Karnataka.

The video is viral amidst the Hijab ban controversy that started at a PU college in Karanataka and has spread across the nation with various Hindu outfits demanding a ban on hijab within the campuses of educational institutions.

On WhatsApp, the video is viral with a caption that suggests that those protesting against the hijab ban in Karnataka are mostly men. Alt News has received multiple requests on its official WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160) and on its official mobile application (Android, iOS) to verify the authenticity of the video.

Journalist Rakesh Krishnan Simha tweeted the video with the same claim as the one viral on WhatsApp.

The video has also been shared on WhatsApp with another claim that says that male “terror groups” wearing burqa have been arrested in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for throwing stones at the police. It is also viral on Facebook with the same caption as the one shared by Prashant Umrao.

Old video from Andhra Pradesh
We took the captions/claims on WhatsApp as a clue and performed a keyword search on Google. We found that the viral video is from 2020 when Andhra Pradesh police had arrested a few people including this burqa-clad man for smuggling alcohol.
