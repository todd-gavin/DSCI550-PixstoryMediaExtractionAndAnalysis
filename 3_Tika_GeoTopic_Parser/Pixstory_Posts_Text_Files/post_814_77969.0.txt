5 HOURS NOW!Â We are now into the 6th hour of the match.

This is already the longest match of Medvedev's career. 

Nadal a game away from title

Nadal 2-6 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-4 5-3 Medvedev*

It's game point to Nadal as he draws the error out of Medvedev's backhand at the net.

Now Medvedev goes wide and Rafael Nadal, improbably, is one game away from his 21st Grand Slam title.

WHAT a fighter.
