In Australia, as CNN points out, many a wandering son or daughter returns home for Sunday lunch when mum's cooking a lamb roast. It's the garlic, rosemary and olive oil that make this piece of meat delicious and tender. It's then served with enough baked potatoes to end any family feud. Though its origins may be beyond Australian borders, Aussies will proudly say only they know how to put on a good one.

Also, letâ€™s not forget salt and pepper calamari! It is quick and easy to make. The squid or calamari is covered in salt-and-pepper batter, then deep-fried. This pub staple is often served as a snack with a side salad and dipped in sweet chilli sauce.
