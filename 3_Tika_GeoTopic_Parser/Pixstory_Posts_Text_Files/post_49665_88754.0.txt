Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation hearing has begun and there have been clues indicating the hearing would be tough. 

For instance, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) during his opening speech guaranteed to ask hard questions of Judge Jackson. He said he had questions about why Judge Jackson had been supported by progressives. He indicated that liberal pressure groups conspired to torpedo his favourite (Judge Michelle Childs), and had radical ideological reasons for pushing Judge Jackson in front of President Biden. 

‌Yet he added that the role she played as a public defender is significant. He said: "Everybody deserves a lawyer, you're doing your country a great service when you defend the most unpopular people," which is truly a motivating statement for her.
‌
‌Meanwhile, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse pointed out her achievements and experience he said: "You have more experience trying cases in your courtroom than any other member of the court". 
‌
‌In her opening remark,s Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California accentuated the Abortion and Environmental issues. She underscored Judge Jackson is qualified and emphasized her background as a public defender.
‌
‌Up next we had Sen. John Cornyn came right into the point he had to fire. ( Guantanamo Bay Representation of the Judge). He said without any context: "I’m a bit troubled by some of the positions you’ve taken and arguments that you’ve made representing people who have committed terrorist acts against the United States and other dangerous criminals,” Mr Cornyn said, without providing any context.
‌
‌Echoing the reports on her confirmation last week Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri in his opening remarks criticised Judge Jackson for being lenient at Child Pornography cases. He even pointed out seven cases and her sentencing on them.
