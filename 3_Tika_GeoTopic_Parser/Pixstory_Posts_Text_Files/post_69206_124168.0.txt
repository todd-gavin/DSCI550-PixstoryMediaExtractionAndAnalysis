One of the major problems that I faced as a player came was when players from other states used to get picked by our state even though we came to practice every day. During one of the seasons, a senior player got injured and started to train with us and by talking to her I cleared my doubts about football that I had. After training with her I was selected for the state side. I played for U-14 India sub-juniors in Bhutan but I eventually dropped out of football as I wasn't comfortable with the environment surrounding the team around those times one couldn't even complain about such things as their weren't thr proper channels for that. So thatâ€™s when I took a break from football.

After having to go through many personal problems I decided to start playing football again to divert my mind for some time. At that time my son was a year old. My parents supported me at that time. Playing football was a way I could relieve my stress and frustration. That when I thought that why should Men only coach. Even during my playing days I saw that women were not comfortable with men coaching them. That is why I decided to become a coach and I started coaching my school's football team first.
