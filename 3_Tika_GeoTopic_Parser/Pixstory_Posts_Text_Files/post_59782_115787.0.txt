They allegedly admitted to smuggling 25 guns from Turkey for Rs 12.5 lakhs as they were leaving for Vietnam. 
An Indian couple returning from Vietnam was detained by the customs division at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport after they were discovered to be in possession of 45 pistols worth Rs 22.5 lakh. 
Jaswinder Kaur and Jagjeet Singh were named as the defendants. According to the officials, the couple allegedly admitted to earlier importing 25 weapons from Turkey for Rs 12.5 lakhs. Their young daughter, who was travelling with them, was turned over to her grandma by the officials.

Zubair Kamili, a customs commissioner, reported that the family landed from Vietnam on July 11. He claimed that the accused Jagjeet was in possession of two trolley bags that his older brother Manjit Singh, who had come from Paris about the same time that day and left the airport, had reportedly given to him. 
According to reports, Jaswinder assisted Jagjeet in removing the tags from the bags that held the weapons. As they made their way to the exit gate, the customs authorities stopped them and discovered the weapons.
