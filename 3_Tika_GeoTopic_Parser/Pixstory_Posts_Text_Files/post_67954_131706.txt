If you ve read all the three books of The Divergent Series you ll know what I m talking about The Series is amazing but oh well so traumatic as well I don t think the movies were able to do justice to the kind of impression reading the books had on me And I have not mentioned any spoilers in here on purpose so if you havent READ The Divergent Series as yet this post is a call to action I enjoy quite a lot of genres to read but It s one of the books that actually got me into the teen fiction genre You should definitely give this one a read
