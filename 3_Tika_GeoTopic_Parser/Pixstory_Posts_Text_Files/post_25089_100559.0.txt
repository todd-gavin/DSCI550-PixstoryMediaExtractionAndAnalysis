Erik ten Hag arrives at Old Trafford this summer, as he takes over the managerial reigns. The Dutch manager claimed the league title with Ajax, and has already set his sight on the challenge that lies ahead. Manchester United are in the midst of a torrid season, as they could finish as low as seventh on the points tally. A 4-0 loss against Brighton a couple of weeks ago just summed up their dismal campaign.

As such, Erik ten Hag has a huge task on his hand, given that he must rebuild the club from scratch. A handful of players will find their way out of Old Trafford this season. Arguably, one of Manchester United’s best players this season, Cristiano Ronaldo also finds his future at Red Devils hanging in the balance. The Portuguese striker made a grand return to Old Trafford last summer on a two-year deal. However, Ten Hag’s appointment and lack of Champions League football means the 37-year-old’s future is in doubt.

The incoming manager did give us a hint as to what he thinks about the Portuguese star. Ten Hag described Cristiano Ronaldo as a ‘giant’ and in fact, he looks forward to working with him. 

"I look forward to working with him," Ten Hag said, as quoted by the Goal. "Ronaldo is a giant. Because of what he's already shown and I think he's still very ambitious. Of course I'd like to keep him. He has been very important for Man Utd this year [and he] can produce great statistics,” he added.

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 18 league goals this campaign, and most of those have come at vital points in the games. He scored six goals in the Champions League group stages, which shows his contribution to the team. Erik ten Hag will certainly shake up a few things at Old Trafford, and he should be handed a handsome transfer budget. But, it seems likely that Ronaldo will see out his current contract at Manchester United, given there have been encouraging signs from both parties.
