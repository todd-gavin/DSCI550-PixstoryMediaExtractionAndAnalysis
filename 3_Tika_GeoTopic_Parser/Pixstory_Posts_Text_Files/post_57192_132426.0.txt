Well, the exact cause does not necessarily limit itself to specific situations, but mostly impostor syndrome is the result of multiple factors; it could even include personality traits such as perfectionism and family background as well.
A theory suggests that impostor syndrome is rooted in families that value achievement above everything else. 
Moreover, upbringing and family dynamics play an essential role in this syndrome. 
It is not always that you belong to a family with highly valued achievements; it could be possible even if there is a presence of high levels of conflict, which can eventually affect the person.
But more than this, personality traits contribute to the impostor syndrome. Like those who experience the problems of low self-efficacy, perfectionism ( the constant desire to be perfect and have your own high standards) and neuroticism( having anxiety, insecurity, tension and guilt.)
Even symptoms of social anxiety can fuel imposter syndrome; although this doesn't justify that everyone with social anxiety would experience impostor syndrome, it can more likely affect the situation.
Apart from this, there is no actual cause of the syndrome, and it can develop in different situations and circumstances.
