Is Kendrick Lamar dropping a new album?

In August 2021, Lamar tweeted out a link to a site called Oklama which included a message to his fans. He announced he was in the process of producing his final album under the Top Dawg Entertainment label.
Lamar's full post:

I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence. I go months without a phone. Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family. While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next. As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my life's calling. There's beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown. Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I've prayed for you all. See you soon enough.

Top Dawg Entertainment CEO Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith addressed Lamar's message with his own social media post, saying his last album under TDE will be "a victory lap."
"I know [Lamar] will be successful in whatever it is he decides to do and will have our full support," Tiffith said. "As for Top Dawg Entertainment, we will continue to grow, develop and give artists the platform to expand into whatever way they choose."
While he hasn't revealed an official release date for his next album, several music publications have taken Lamar's announcement as an indication it will drop at some point in 2022
