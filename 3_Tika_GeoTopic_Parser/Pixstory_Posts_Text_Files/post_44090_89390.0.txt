Just like the Australian GP, this race is all set to feature again in the F1 race calendar after being canceled owing to the ongoing pandemic. Located in the heart of Notre Dame Island, the circuit is a sight to behold. As far as racing is concerned, there’s plenty to be excited about with a mix of fast sections and braking zones. The last F1 race that was held here in 2019 was mired in controversy after Vettel was asked to serve a five-second penalty, handing Hamilton a crucial win.

With its first race dating back to 1950, Silverstone holds the distinction of being the oldest race track on the grid.

The Red Bull Ring returned to the race calendar in 2014 after getting scrapped in 2004 and has remained a regular feature then. Despite having a shorter layout, the circuit has been home to some of the most iconic moments in the history of motorsport racing, like when Schumacher asked his teammate Eddie Irvine to join him on the podium after he handed him an important win. The Red Bull Ring held two races back-to-back in the previous edition. Max Verstappen stamped his authority dominating the racing weekends and will look to do the same this year around too.
