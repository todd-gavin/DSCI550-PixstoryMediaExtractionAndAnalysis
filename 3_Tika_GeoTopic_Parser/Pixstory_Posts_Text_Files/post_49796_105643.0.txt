‌Buffalo shooting has terrified Newyork and the new laws have possibly closed all the loopholes for guns. 
‌
‌Raising the Age to Purchase-The law includes one that Bars the Purchase of Semiautomatic Rifles by Anyone Under Age 21 by Requiring a License. 
‌
‌Banning Body Armor-Another law Prohibits Purchase of Body Armor with Exception of Those in Specified Professions.
‌
‌Strengthening the Red Flag Law-Next law Expands List of People Who Can File Extreme Risk Protection Orders and Requires Law Enforcement to File ERPOs Under Specified Set of Circumstances.
‌
‌Microstamping-Package Also Strengthens Crime Reporting; Closes "Other Gun" Loophole; Requires Microstamping of New Semiautomatic Pistols; Eliminates Grandfathering of High-Capacity Feeding Devices; Requires Social Media Companies to Improve Response to and Reporting of Hateful Content. 
‌
‌Governor Kathy Hochul today ratified a landmark legislative package to immediately tighten the state's gun laws.
‌
‌"Gun violence is an epidemic that is tearing our country apart. Thoughts and prayers won't fix this, but taking strong action will," Governor Hochul said. 
‌
‌New York already had some of the most powerful gun-control laws in the nation, which were passed in January 2013 in the wake Of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 26 children and staff.
‌
‌But the new laws will reinforce existing ones and close what state leaders perceived as loopholes that included allowing the Buffalo shooter to slip through the state’s Red Flag statute that should have observed his racist social media rants and led to the removal of his weapons.
