Camila Cabello has called out fans on Twitter for their actions during her performance following the Champions League final. The fans chose to sing their team anthems, ending up drowning out her performance with their chanting. 

The musical star was unhappy with the fans singing over her during the opening ceremony at the Champions League final when she took to the stage at the Stade de France. Calling them ‘rude’ she had to say, “Playing back our performance and I can’t believe people were singing their teams’ anthems so loud during our performance.
Like, my team and I worked tireless for so long to bring right vibes and give a good show.
Very rude but whatever. I’M GLAD U GUYS LOVED IT!!!!!"

She has now deleted the tweets. This however, was overshadowed with the events outside the stadium - with fans being denied entry into the system despite having valid tickets. Many supporters tried to climb the barricades and were facing the ire of the police. 

Eventually, everything was sorted and Real Madrid went on to win the match 1-0 against Liverpool.
