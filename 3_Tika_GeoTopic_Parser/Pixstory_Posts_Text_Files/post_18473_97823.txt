The defeat against Verona terribly complicates the race for salvation for Cagliari Since yesterday evening, the coach Walter Mazzarri in the dock and his bench in these hours could miss the only points away from the third last place occupied by Salernitana which has two games less they cause anxiety to the Sardinian team who have lost four in the last five games The environment needs a shock after the withdrawal attempt also failed What the top management wonders if it might be useful to change coach three games from the end of the season if this could be the best thing to do or whether to finish the year with Mazzarri In reality there would be a solution that would not completely upset the team Leonardo Semplici still under contract after the exemption after just three league games so it could be a card to evaluate Alternatively there would also be the Primavera coach Alessandro Agostini but at the moment he is busy with his team in the category playoffs and Cagliari Primavera had never gone so far
