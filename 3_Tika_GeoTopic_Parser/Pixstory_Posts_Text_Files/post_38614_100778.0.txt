Inacio has made 26 interceptions by intercepting the ball and blocking deadly passes or shots. He ranks 0.9 interceptions per game. The defender helped his team keep 14 clean sheets. He has made 2.4 important goal line clearances per game. When opposition players usually run to the penalty box, he sticks his foot and clears out dangerous chances created by the opponent.
