After a 30-year hiatus, WWE’s return to the United Kingdom was a resounding success as the fans poured in to witness the undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns fight off homeboy Drew McIntyre to successfully defend the title he has held on to for more than two years now.
The biggest fight of the night was a brutal one as McIntyre, backed by his loud home crowd support got on the nerves of Roman who was miffed with the reception for the challenger. He levelled the Brit to lay him on the canvas and progressed to demand 
acknowledgement from the crowd before he finished things off. But, McIntyre came back to throw Reigns around the ring as the Scot sent his opponent crashing into every piece of hard material available around.
The wrestlers traded blow for blow hitting each other with spear after spear nd when both fighters seemed to be running out of fuel, in came Austin Theory in an attempt to cash in his money in the bank title, but he was stopped by none other then Tyson Fury himself.
The two slugged it out before Reigns picked up the win thanks to an interference from Solo Sikoa, The Uso’s younger brother, to retain his title.
