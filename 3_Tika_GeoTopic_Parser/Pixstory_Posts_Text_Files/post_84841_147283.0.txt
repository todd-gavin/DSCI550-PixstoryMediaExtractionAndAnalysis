Real Madrid has been producing the best midfielders since their inception, and the club has formed the greatest ever playmaker. However, the team still has many great midfielders, and Madrid will be remembered for their best players.
Their dominant midfield has been the key to success and has aided the club in many ways; even with a weak team, they have been able to defeat many big teams, as evidenced by last year's Champions League and how Real Madrid midfield had the best features to get away with high pressing teams.
10 Claude Makélélé
Many Real Madrid players were disappointed when Makelele was allowed to leave after giving his heart and soul to the club in midfield. Makelele was a gift for Real Madrid because he could break down plays, mark and anticipate opponents, and time his challenges. He wasa true warrior and played with grace and poise as a holding midfielder and provided an extra-hand during counter-attacks.
His time at Real Madrid was brief, but he made his mark by winning the Champions Leagueand appearing in 14 games.
9 Isco Alarcón
Isco's performance at Malaga piqued the interest of several La Liga heavy weights, with Real Madrid being the first to cash in and sign the player. Isco adapted quickly and became a vital player for Real Madrid under Zidane and Ancelotti; he was a midfield maestro who could turnthings around and feed goals to the striker; at one point, he was more important than Kroosfor Real Madrid, and his goals against Atletico Madrid helped the club reach the final.
Isco was an attacking midfielder who could also play as a second striker. He was a skilled and creative player who dribbled with ease. But things fell apart in 2020 when he was demoted to the bench and joined Sevilla, where he made 353 appearances.
