Sergio Aguero has backed down from his plans to join Argentina's coaching staff for the 2022 World Cup, stating that he will be in Qatar "as a fan."

The 33-year-old, who was forced to retire due to a heart issue in December 2021, revealed in February that he would be part of Lionel Scaloni's backroom crew when his countrymen compete for world glory later this year. Following negotiations with Scaloni and national captain Lionel Messi, those ideas have been scrapped, with Aguero slated to play a cheerleader role rather than a tactical one.

Explaining his thought process, Aguero told ESPN: “The invitation to be part of Argentina's staff was on the table.

“I spoke with Chiqui [Tapia, Argentina Football Association president] and I was clear with him about my goal to enjoy my time.

“I'm going to Qatar, but as a fan.

“I have a great relationship with everyone from the national team but I don't see myself in the coaching staff and with the players on a day-to-day basis. They are asking for a role that isn't for me right now.

“I had a talk with [Messi], he and Scaloni gave me an idea of what they wanted from me. I asked them for some time to think about it and then told Chiqui that I wasn't ready for that.

“I will be available for any event related to the Argentina national team, as an ambassador but I don't want a day-to-day responsibility with the team.”

As he recovers from a serious health crisis that prompted him to put up his boots shortly after leaving Manchester for Barcelona as a free agent, Aguero could do without the pressures of coaching at a World Cup final right now
