One-time English League Cup winner Michael Dawson has torn into Ralf Ragnick’s following the end of the German’s tenure as Manchester United’s interim boss. 

Ragnick was severely overwhelmed in his role after taking over at Old Trafford in December 2021. The club won just 11 of its 28 matches in charge while suffering eight defeats. They also exited both the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League during his reign. 

Ragnick will now move into a consultancy role at Old Trafford with Erik Ten Hag over the first team this summer. However, Dawson can’t believe the German tactician is still employed by Manchester United. 

He told Sky Sports after the Red Devils’ 1-0 defeat against Crystal Palace on the final day of the Premier League season. 

“He has made Ole Gunnar look good. I look at him and think,” wow! How is he still employed by the club? It has been an absolute disaster since day one.” 

Dawson was a part of the last Tottenham Hotspur team to win a major trophy, added “This is Manchester United and I think Ten Hag will have his own philosophy and strategy. You see the dressing room there and that has to start with the manager. If things aren’t happening you make them happen. It is as simple as that. 

The former England CB went on to refer to the 4-0 hammering that United suffered against Brighton & Hove Albion in the league on May 7.

Manchester United ended a forgettable season on an overwhelming note, suffering a 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park on Sunday. Wilfried Zaha scored the only goal of the game in the 37th minute, converting with a low effect. 

Despite losing the game, the Red Devils spotted a place in UEFA Europa League for the next season as West Ham suffered a 3-1 defeat against Brighton.
