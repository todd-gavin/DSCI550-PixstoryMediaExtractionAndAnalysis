Despite cancelling their three-match ODI series in January, the Proteas are still visiting Australia. It's not all bad news, though, since Australia's top athletes will play in the BBL. 

Fox News reported that three matches between Hobart (Jan. 12), Sydney (Jan. 14), and Perth (Jan. 17) were scheduled for South Africa in mid-January, but they requested that Cricket Australia find alternate dates because it would conflict with their new T20 competition. 

The Boxing Day Test and the New Year's Test are two of the three Tests they will still play against Australia. 

However, CA was unable to locate suitable dates in the crammed schedule and the series was cancelled.

In its place, CA have made efforts to ensure the entire nation sees its stars live in the flesh.

The T20I match between Australia and the West Indies will now be played at the Gabba on October 7, while the opening T20I match of the series versus England will now be played at Perth Stadium on October 9. 

In order to guarantee that Hobart would host an Australian team this summer, Australia women's second T20I match against Pakistan, originally scheduled for January 27 at Manuka Oval, has also been moved forward a day and transferred to Blundstone Arena. 

Due to the Proteas' choice to skip the ODI matches, South Africa has lost both the series and the necessary points to qualify for the World Cup in 2018.
