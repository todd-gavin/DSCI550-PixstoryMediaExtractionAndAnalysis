During a long interview lvaro Odriozola retraced what was his first season in Italy Florence the cradle of the Renaissance and I had a football renaissance It couldn&#39;t have gone better In Italy you learn a lot tactically like a master I played a lot Fiorentina came back in Europe everything went perfectly The Spanish full-back&#39;s future seems to be far from Florence In my head and in my heart I feel ready to return to Real Madrid This is what I told my agent and my goal There is also room for a dig to Kylian Mbapp who preferred to renew with PSG rather than accept the court of the Blancos If I were him I would come running away from Paris without thinking about it I believe that there are things that cannot be bought The dream of Madrid cannot be bought like his history Photo credits Twitter Fiorentina
