Prime Minister Scott Morrison is running out of time to improve his electoral standing ahead of the May 21 election, with new polling showing his center-right Liberal National Coalition trailing the opposition Labor Party by a wide margin. 

Bloomberg reported that Morrison has made little progress against Labor in the past week, according to a Newspoll poll released by The Australian newspaper on Monday night, with the opposition still leading the government 53 percent to 47 percent. In a separate poll published in the Australian Financial Review, Ipsos found Morrison's party to be in a worse situation, with Labor leading by 55 percent to 45 percent.

According to polling, neither Morrison nor the opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese are popular with voters. In the new opinion polls, both Morrison and Albanese have a negative approval rating, with Newspoll giving both leaders a net approval rating of -12. In the meantime, according to Ipsos, Morrison is the least trusted prime minister in 27 years, with only 31% believing Albanese has a "strong grasp on economic policy." 

On the strength of a robust economy and record-low unemployment, Morrison's government is campaigning for a fourth term on May 21. However, Labor has slammed them for lagging wage growth, rising living costs, and the recent revelation of a security deal between China and the Solomon Islands, which was inked under Morrison's watch.
