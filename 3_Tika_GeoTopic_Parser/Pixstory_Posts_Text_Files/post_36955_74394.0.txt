Love - whats is love ? Care , respect, trust, friendship, faith, intimacy ...everything . It consists of everything . When a lion bows down his head in front of her lioness , that is love , when a bird struggles and find a piece of food for their children resting in the nest , that is love , when a poor father comes home and brings a small present for her daughter's birthday , that is love , when a big elephant protects his whole family , that is love .
