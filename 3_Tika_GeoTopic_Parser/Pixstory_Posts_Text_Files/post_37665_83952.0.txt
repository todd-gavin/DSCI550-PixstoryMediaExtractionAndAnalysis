India won the second T20 and seal the T20 series against Sri Lanka.
Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first in the second T20 against Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan openers were not doing good before this match and it was their middle order taking care of the runs. This time The Sri Lankan openers laid a solid foundation with Pathum Nissanka	 scoring 75 off 53 balls but it was the middle order that failed to score big after that impressive start. Even though the middle order failed the Sri Lankan captain Shanaka hit a quick 47 off just 19 balls scoring 5 sixes and 2 boundaries which helped Sri Lanka put 183 on the board. All five of the Indian bowlers managed to pick up a wicket each but it was Harshal Patel who was the most expensive conceding a whopping 52 runs in his 4 over spell. 

India's batting started in a scary fashion as Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan got out early. It was yet another mammoth performance from Shreyas Iyer as he steadied the ship along with Sanju Samson.
Iyer stayed not out at 74 (44) and Sir Ravindra Jadeja sealed the victory in his usual style as he hit a beautiful boundary straight down the pitch.

Lahiru Kumar was impressive with the ball he picked up Ishan Kishan early on and was brought on to break the partnership brewing between Iyer and Samson and succeeded in doing so. He was the quickest bowler today bowling at an average speed of 146 kmph but his efforts were just not enough since he did not have any support on the other end. 

With this victory India goes 2-0 in the 3 match series, winning the series already. The last match may see a few changes since both teams are using these matches to try out strategies before the upcoming T20 World Cup.
