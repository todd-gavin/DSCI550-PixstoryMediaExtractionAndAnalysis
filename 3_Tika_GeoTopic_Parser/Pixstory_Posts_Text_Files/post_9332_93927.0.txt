It's not true.Baba Sahab Bhim Rao Ambedkar is always respected by Indian national Congress. He established Labour Party and later it became Republican Party of India. In spite of that he was not belonging to Indian national congress Pt. Jawaharlal lal Nehru appointed him first law minister of independent India .He was made chairman of the draft committee.
Contribution of Jawaharlal Nehru is not less than Baba Saheb but he has always given credit by Congress party as the chief architect of indian constitution. Potrait of Baba sahab Ambedkar can be found in offices of all level of Indian national Congress. Party organises Ambedkar  jayanti at every level and always respects. Fake propganda by right wingers and self centred activists is unfortunate and should not be given extra ordinary attention by media.
