Lollapalooza is a four-day music festival which takes place annually at Grant Park in Chicago.

The lineup for Lollapalooza India - their first event in Asia following international editions in Berlin, Stockholm and Brazil, among other countries in Europe and South America - is yet to be unveiled, but it will feature a mix of Indian and global artists. It's being reported that we can expect the lineup announcement by the end of August as Lollapalooza India will be "a full two days of music across four stages as well as innovative culinary selections, art, fashion and more." Lollapalooza founder Perry Farrell shared in an announcement, via Variety, "The music of India is transcendental, it draws our spirits East. Lollapalooza is an instrument for unity, peace, and education utilizing the universal languages of music and art to find common ground."
