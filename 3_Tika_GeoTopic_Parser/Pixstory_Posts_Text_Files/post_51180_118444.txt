SO I HAVE AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU TO DO THIS WEEK Day Over the course of the entire day be more aware of the things you are saying to yourself Jot a few of them down And then before you go to sleep that night apologize to yourself because we don t need that negativity in your life But do take note on how often those thoughts come And how unfair they actually are Day Time for the good stuff Apologies have been accepted now time for a little change Write down everything yes EVERYTHING you love about yourself Day Put that list somewhere you can come back to Tape it to the mirror Tuck it in your sock drawer Write it on the wall Hide it in your journal Day Once you start recognizing those pesky negative thoughts repeat to yourself I am worthy and I am enough One of the most powerful sentences I think there ever was Use it like a mantra to combat the negative thoughts and feelings that come creeping in Continue repeating these words until you believe them I know it s hard And it s kind of weird okay a lot weird especially the first few times And maybe it feels even a little bit selfish I just think that somewhere along the way we ve forgotten what it really means to take care of ourselves
