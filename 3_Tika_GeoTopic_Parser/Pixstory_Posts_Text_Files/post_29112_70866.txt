Bhagwati Suryavanshi is a year old woman of Kokodi village of Kondagaon district Chhattisgarh She is a grandmother of children Since last year Bhagwati was involved with Pratham through Dai ke Goth activity of Hamara Gaon program in which she used to tell stories to a group of children in regular interval But ever since the spread of covid this activity has stopped as the movement of people got restricted Over this period of one year telling stories to the children had become an integral part of Bhagwati s life and this whole pandemic situation resulting in her helplessness of not being able to tell stories to other children of the village was making her really upset A few days ago she got an idea that if the children could not come to her in a group she could visit the children to tell them the stories She immediately implemented the idea and started visiting children s houses to tell them stories all over again maintaining all social distancing and COVID precautionary measures The children were also very happy getting their Dadi back and now they also tell Bhagwati a lot of interesting things which they are learning from the remote learning initiative Karona Thodi Masti Thodi Padhai
