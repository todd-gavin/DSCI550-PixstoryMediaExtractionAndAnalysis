I love monsoons! When we were kids, my friends and I planned ahead how to spend rainy days. We had fun playing outside in the rain and then went out to eat bhajia that were sold at the food stalls. Then we enjoyed warm tea served in kulhad. We used to make paper boats and float it on the flowing downstream water. We also watched movies while enjoying the crisp popcorn served at home and enjoyed the weather. I love how everything is cleaned up when it rains. I love the earthy smell when the first raindrop touches the ground. #MonsoonFood
