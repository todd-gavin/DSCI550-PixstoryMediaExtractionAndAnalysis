Controversy has surrounded the Inflation Reduction Act which will increase funding for the IRS to employ more IRS agents among other provisions This fact has been used by Republicans to demonstrate that Democrats do not actually care about protecting the middle class and people who cannot afford to defend themselves against an audit as the affluent can In light of this Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated in a letter to the IRS Commissiner I direct that any additional resources including any new personnel or auditors that are hired shall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the threshold that are audited relative to historical level Obviously the most crucial question has not been asked where on earth would they get individuals who want to be IRS auditors or audit support staff First the Inflation Reduction act does not indicate that IRS auditing agents would be hired rather it authorizes billion to the IRS to sustain its workforce and new hiring which the Treasury Department estimates will allow them to add employees by Treasury Department officials however indicated that these people would not just be auditors but also IT technicians and taxpayer support staff In reality the IRS has a very high attrition rate with its employment decreasing from around to over the next several years so the addition of new employees within the next years may not cause a substantial increase in the IRS s workforce if there is any increase at all
