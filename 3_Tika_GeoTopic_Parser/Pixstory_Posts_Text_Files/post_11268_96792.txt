Dr Dilek Colak assistant professor of neuroscience at Weill Cornell Medicine s Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute and her colleagues produced astrocytes from stem cells from autistic patients and implanted them into healthy newborn mice for the study ASD like repetitive behaviours but not social difficulties appeared in the animals following the transplant Memory problems which are frequent in ASD but not a key feature of the condition also emerged in the mice Asteroid anomalies may contribute to the beginning and progression of autism spectrum disorders according to Dr Colak an assistant professor of paediatric neuroscience at the Drukier Institute for Children s Health Astrocyte abnormalities may cause repetitive behaviour or memory problems but not social issues Most research on autism spectrum diseases has focused on neurons a kind of brain cell that transmits information However astrocytes assist govern the functioning of neurons and their connections Dr Colak believes that genetic alterations connected to autism spectrum illnesses damage distinct types of brain cells Postmortem investigations found astrocyte abnormalities in autistic persons brains We didn t know if these astrocyte abnormalities caused the illness or contributed to its development Dr Colak added A chimaera of human and mouse was created to see if astrocytes are implicated early in the condition The scientists took stem cells from autistic individuals coaxed them into turning into astrocytes in the lab and implanted them into the brains of newborn mice Using two photon imaging the researchers discovered increased calcium signalling in human astrocytes transplanted into mice s brains Human astrocytes reacting to behavioural changes in active mice was astounding Dr Huang remarked We think we are the first to record human astrocyte activity in this way To see if the mice s behavioural abnormalities were caused by enhanced calcium signalling the researchers infected astrocytes generated from ASD patient stem cells with a virus containing an RNA fragment engineered to suppress calcium signalling The mice did not have memory issues after receiving these astrocytes Weill Cornell Medicine s Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute co lead author Megan Allen said future treatments for autism might leverage this result by employing genetic techniques to reduce excessive calcium changes inside astrocytes
