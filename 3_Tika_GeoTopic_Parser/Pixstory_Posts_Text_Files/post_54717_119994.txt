The world s climate is changing All of us will ultimately be affected by climatic shifts but some will be hit harder than others On the African continent for instance small businesses are on the front lines of climate change Over of the African labour force works in agriculture which is both very exposed to and dependent on climatic variability and change But even businesses in urban centres are increasingly dealing with climate induced challenges These include unstable water and power supplies extreme heat and flooding These hazards interrupt processing and manufacturing activities They also limit transportation of goods and make it harder to provide services to customers And they increase the risk of unsafe working conditions This is true for any business owner regardless of gender But our research published in WIRES Climate Change suggests that women entrepreneurs in Africa are more vulnerable to climate change than their male counterparts There are at least three key reasons for this First women entrepreneurs are often more exposed to climate risk because of the sectors activities and types of businesses that they tend to be concentrated in Second women s businesses also face additional barriers to adapting to climate change in the business environment And third women are also often on the front line of managing climate risk at household levels As a result climate shocks when they occur are likely to disproportionately erode women entrepreneurs ability to cope with climate change in the future Increased vulnerability Cultural norms and gendered discrimination in entrepreneurship influence the sectors and businesses women tend to work in These vary by region and across rural and urban settings But women s businesses are often particularly dependent on natural resources and concentrated in agriculture livestock fishing trading and processing These are sensitive to climate There is also some evidence to suggest that women and their business activities are more likely to be confined to more marginal and degraded agricultural land This land is less resilient to climate shock Read more
