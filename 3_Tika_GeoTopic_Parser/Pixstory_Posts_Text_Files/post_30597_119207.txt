First press conference as a Roma player for Paulo Dybala, a top signing for the Giallorossi in this summer transfer market session. The Argentine curbs his enthusiasm about the possible conquest of the Scudetto but assures that he is happy with his new team. I know there is a great desire but too soon to talk about it Roma have ambitions for the future we all like to win and our goal There are teams ahead of us but we have to think about each game and work with serenity But I like to win Both Mou and the club have shown me seriousness enthusiasm awareness Knowing how Rome is being built I didn&#39;t have many doubts about choosing Dybala he also dwelled on his farewell to Juventus giving his version of the facts and adding that he doesn&#39;t seek personal revenge In the last year I have done well in terms of goals assists and not just seeing the numbers and considering how injured I was Arrivabene was very clear we had an agreement in October they asked us to wait and in March they said I wasn&#39;t part of the project It wasn&#39;t a financial problem the club and the coach decided and I said If this is your choice for me it&#39;s ok. If I score against them obviously I won&#39;t cheer
