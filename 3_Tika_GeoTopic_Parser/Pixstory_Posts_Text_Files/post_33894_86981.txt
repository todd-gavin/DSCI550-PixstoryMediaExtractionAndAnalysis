Interviewed by Corriere dello Sport Gianluigi Buffon returns to talk about his heir Donnarumma after the mistake that conditioned PSG&#39;s match against Real Madrid Gigione doesn&#39;t need biased lawyers I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t have any negative repercussions any problem and then he already has shown to possess the necessary strength to be able to overcome equally delicate moments Gigio one of the best in the world Among the top three together with Courtois and Neuer The inevitable attacks Gigio exposed himself by making a clearly unpopular choice which in any case must be respected He wanted to feed his ambition what that many of them didn&#39;t like, the same ones who were waiting for nothing else to give it dry in their teeth The trouble, let me tell you, is not the French who enjoy it but the many Italians who were waiting for him at the gate Photo credits Twitter PSG
