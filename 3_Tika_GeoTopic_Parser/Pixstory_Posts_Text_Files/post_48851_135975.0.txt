Taking away gadgets from your kids is not a good idea. In fact, it can actually have the opposite effect and cause trust problems between parents and their children.
Kids who rely heavily on technology may feel abandoned and unsupported when their devices are taken away. This can lead to a lack of trust between the two parties, which can ultimately impede the development of healthy relationships. In addition, restricting access to technology can also prevent kids from exploring their creativity and potential. Restricting gadget use can also lead to them becoming bored and frustrated with life. Especially in today's times when almost everything is run by technology.
Instead, it's important to build a trusting relationship with your kids by allowing them access to technology in moderation. This means providing them with appropriate devices that allow them to live a fulfilling and productive life outside of technology. Being a parent, it's your responsibility to ensure your children are using those devices responsibly and their usage is limited WITHOUT making them feel threatened and intruded. It's important to build trust between yourself and your child. Instead of making them feel they're restricted from doing something they want to do, give them a reason that would make them understand why they should not do it.
