One Direction star Louis Tomlinson has admitted he would rather strip nude on OnlyFans than join TikTok.
The star has long resisted joining the popular social media platform, with millions of fans begging him to create an account and share more insight into his life.
But Louis has yet again dashed fans' hopes after admitting he’d rather get his kit off on the X-rated site than create an account.
Appearing on Australian podcast The Night Show With Mitch Churi, he admitted: “I’m not gonna lie I find it a load of rubbish. I’m sure there’s some good stuff on there.
“Do you know what it is that irritates me about TikTok, coz people are always nagging me to get on it and I’m like yeah its TikTok now but what’s it gonna be in three years?
“We’ve already got that BeReal, I’ve got no time for that either. In another year it’ll be another one before you know it artists are gonna have a long list of all these social medias they have to have a presence on and it’s intense.”
The host then brought up OnlyFans and how maybe one day he would strip naked on there, to which Louis replied: “Sooner that than TikTok.”
Excited fans took to Twitter to react.
“Give me that only fans link louis!” said one excited fan.
“Cc how much he would charge id buy that sh*t” admitted another.
While a third penned: “I would subscribe the hell out of that OnlyFans plsss!!!!”
