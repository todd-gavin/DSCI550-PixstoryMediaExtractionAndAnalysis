Germany U Women s team salvaged a hard earned victory against the team from Nigeria as they kick started their group fixtures at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi The Germans had to script a second half comeback to register a victory over the African side in a pretty decent head to head game The first real chance of the game fell to Nigeria thanks to a mistake in midfield by German Pauline Platner The short ball fell to Opeyemi Ajakaye who tried to curl the ball in from the edge of the box but it was tiptoed onto the crossbar by shotstopper Eve Boettcher Germany took the ascendancy next as Mara Alber had two attempts on goal No Mathilde Janzen s finesse shot was then saved in the rd minute However at the half hour mark the women in green went ahead with a goal from a freekick Miracle Usani drove a low shot straight past the keeper Their opponents were able to respond eventually in the second half with the equaliser coming from No Svea Stoldt She slotted in from a long cross that came from the left hand side by Alara Sehitler The Nigerians seemed to have completely switched off defending the corner And they had to pay for their mistakes further as a fast counter by the Germans opened the defence up A through ball from Laura Gloning was finished effectively by Alber who got the goal she deserved There was more pressure applied by the Germans as they looked to increase their lead again Alber taking a shot in the th minute But the European prowess was clearly on display in the fourth quarter as the Germans managed the game well and took home the result They would look to go deep in the tournament as they seem to have a strong team
