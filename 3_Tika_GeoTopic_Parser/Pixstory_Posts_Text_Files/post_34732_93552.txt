An incredible match in which Real Madrid emerged victorious despite their defeat on the pitch And Ancelotti&#39;s team went through and conquered the Champions League semi-final despite Chelsea performing more than half a miracle after their first leg defeat I Blues start strong as if they believed in what seemed to be impossible And so the first goal signed by Mount arrives in the quarter of an hour Until the end of the first half of the game the match remains fairly balanced perhaps with a more determined Chelsea but not able to double But the goal arrives at the beginning of the second half when Rudiger takes the highest lead from a corner and scores the result that would lead to extra time. However, it is not enough for Chelsea and the offensive plots thicken until the third goal arrives with a solitary action by Werner who first seats two players in the area and then beats Courtois A few seconds go by and Tuchel&#39;s men score again through Marcos Alonso but the referee disallows the goal that would have put Real Madrid out of the game due to hand ball Carlo Ancelotti starts to make changes and get it right Ten minutes from time the hosts score with the newcomer Rodrygo primed in the box by a ball with Modric&#39;s rev counter Dell&#39;s goal takes the match to extra time Although not in his best night Benzema results once again decisive It was him in the sixth of the first extra time to score the goal of the round by beating Mendy from a few steps away with a header Real Madrid Chelsea dts Reti Mount Rudiger Werner Rodrygo Benzema Real Madrid Courtois Carvajal Nacho Lucas Vasquez Alaba Mendy Marcelo Modric Casemiro Rodrygo Kroos Camavinga Valverde Benzema Vinicius Ceballos Chelsea Mendy James Silva Rudiger Alonso Loftus Cheek Saul Kant Ziyech Kovacic Jorginho Mount Havertz Werner Pulisic
