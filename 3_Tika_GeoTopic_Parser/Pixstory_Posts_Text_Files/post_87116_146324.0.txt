Opportunities
West Ham is expected to improve their results going forward in the season and given the quality of their side they should improve after the international break. They will still look to compete aggressively and try to break into the top six as this has been the case for the last two seasons under Moyes. They are also competing in the UEFA Conference League and they have a chance to achieve some success in this competition as they are one of the best sides in it.
Threats
While they have a chance to achieve some silverware via the Conference League, this can hurt their League success. The lack of strong squad depth on the side means injuries is a big threat and this can hurt the team's performance. The other big threat is that the teams in around the top six are extremely competitive this season. Manchester United and Arsenal have shown big improvements this season and will aim to break into the top four which means the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool could be in around the fifth and sixth positions. This can then dent West Ham’s chances of a top-six finish.
