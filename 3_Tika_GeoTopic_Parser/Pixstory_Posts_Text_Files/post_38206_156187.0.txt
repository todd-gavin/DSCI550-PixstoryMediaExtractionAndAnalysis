The Indian Super League 2022/23 season has brought forth with it a couple of interesting match weeks. At the end of Gameweek 2, Four clubs remain unbeaten, out of which, three are from the Southern half of India. 
Hyderabad FC, Mumbai City FC, Chennaiyin FC, and Bengaluru FC have all been impressive in their initial games. All four clubs have won the ISL title before and hence were favourites going into the 22/23 season. What's more, HFC drew against MCFC in GW1 and CFC drew against BFC in GW2.
Elsewhere, ATK Mohun Bagan pulled off an impressive 5-2 win against Kerala Blasters to get their first points on the board against Kochi on Sunday. Goa as well opened their campaign with a last-minute winner against East Bengal. 
Northeast United and East Bengal are yet to register their first points on the board, but the two clubs will face off on Thursday, giving at least one of the clubs to take off. Shield winners Jamshedpur are also yet to open their account and they get a chance to do so next Saturday.
