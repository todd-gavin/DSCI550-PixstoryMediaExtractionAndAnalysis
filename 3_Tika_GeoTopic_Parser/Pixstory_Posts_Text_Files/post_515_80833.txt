The hijab controversy doesn t seem to be ending Karnataka high court out a ban to all hijabs and saffron shawls in an interim order the Supreme Court felt there was no role of Apex court in discussing cases like this What happens now The way judiciary has functioned in the last few years leaves a room for debate but I feel the civil society has to come out with a solution According to law a citizen of India has right to exercise his her religion It can mean our Prime minister can wear vermilion Tilaks do Aarti participate in Havans inaugurate Ram Mandir in Ayodhya or sit in meditation talk about his identity refuse a skull cap and do anything that is religious as a citizen of this country Similarly a Muslim woman has the right to practice her religion which includes the way of life A fundamental part of practising Islam is hijab So when u can wear symbols of religion to parliament in a secular country like India Can t u wear them to school People say don t compare turban to a hijab or get hijab recognised as part of uniform in court I agree uniforms are to give a sense of oneness to people uniformity Agreed but if a turban doesn t irk or instigate people how can a hijab do that or make them feel different Uniformity is beautiful when u accept it with diversity We have to teach our children acceptance and diversity We have to tell them not everyone believes eats lives like us but the beauty is to accept people inspite of those differences That is the beauty of uniform It means that no one should feel less than the other How does a hijab make anyone feel inferior or superior Like a tilak or a turban doesn t so shouldn t the hijab It isn t symbol of any economic disparity doesn t interfere in anyone else s right to study So let the girls decide So leave abaya burqa just a headscarf over a uniform won t harm anyone
