In today s time where we are continuously growing and learning new aspects of life we mortals still don t know how to differentiate between living and existing To live is the rarest thing in the world most people only exist and that s all Scientists have always said to look for the things that make you happy to look for someone to love and someone who loves who you are People don t realize how they have already stopped living how everyone wants a never ending life but they are barely alive Recently when the whole world was in quarantine and there was nothing to do except wake up every day and realise we are still stuck in the same loop of our monotonous routine everyone started to realise the importance of the first ray of sunlight hitting their face when they used to go out to work the touch of those falling leaves due to wild wind eating food in the streets after a clumsy day with friends and family the joy and chaos of life and at night going to bed knowing we are tired but also excited for the upcoming day We have ignored these little things that soothe and pacify us and we were never grateful for these small events So take this piece of writing as your sign to get up and start living do what you love eat what you want choose a life purpose and work for your goal learn that language own that puppy or cat remove the pretending to be happy mask start giving some time to yourself talk to yourself understand that no matter what you are going through it will be okay you are enough share your thoughts sing that song have that dance start that workout routine invest in that business and take that big risk travel around the world read that book and do all the things that you ever dream and desired about Life is too short to be waiting for that one moment to happen Remember that anyone can exist be the one who is living
