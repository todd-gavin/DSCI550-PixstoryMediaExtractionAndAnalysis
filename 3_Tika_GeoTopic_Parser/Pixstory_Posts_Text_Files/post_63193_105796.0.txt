A home can be made of sticks and mud
Or great big blocks of snow
A home can be twenty stories tall
Or in the ground below.
A home can be way up on a hill
Or next to the ocean wide.
A home can have a mill above
Or a chimney on its side.
A home can be where you're safe and sound
Or with family, friends and more.
A home can be where you have your heart
And all that you adore.
