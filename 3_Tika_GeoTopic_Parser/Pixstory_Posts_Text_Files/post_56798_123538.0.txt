Apply sunscreen daily to your face and neck. It would help fight UV damage daily, protecting your skin and making you look fresh and younger.

Stay hydrated. Drinking much water is advised by many people. Keeping oneself hydrated is essential to avoid dull, dehydrated skin that can make you look tired.

Up your Omega 3s
Omega 3s have been shown to help prevent UV damage in your skin, seal in moisture and keep out irritants. In addition, Omega 3s may boost hair growth and reduce hair loss for those with thinning hair. Thicker, fuller hair is another factor for a more youthful, vibrant appearance. 


Get regular, vigorous exercise. Working out and exercising daily makes your body active which eventually helps in making you and your skin look fresh. 

Sit up straight. Improving your posture can instantly make you appear younger (and more confident!). 


Exfoliate carefully. Removing the dry, dead skin and then moisturizing will make the skin look fresh.

Get enough sleep. Get enough sleep every night! For most people, this is anywhere from seven to nine hours. If you are sleep-deprived, your eyes and skin will look aged. The ageing effect gets worse if you get less sleep than you need for multiple days in a row.
