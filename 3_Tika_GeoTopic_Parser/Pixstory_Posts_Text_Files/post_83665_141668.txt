How do you know you were raised right Here s a great rule from Anton Chekov the Russian writer He says that a sign of a good upbringing is not that you never spill on the tablecloth but that when others do you don t point it out to them And you know how much I genuinely love that Because being a perfect gentleman isn t about having perfect manners or making others uncomfortable when they can t live up to your expectations Instead a sign of good upbringing is having compassion and kindness and not putting people on the spot in order to give them a grace period to make them feel comfortable and welcome and not using your own manners as a political tool to assert your own superiority So a sign of a good upbringing isn t that you re perfect but that you act gracefully in the face of other people s imperfections
