Today I visited the most important ecommerce forum in the country in Milan Needless to say, online shopping is going very well that during the pandemic there was a real boom in online purchases which are holding up even now that the lockdowns are over in Italy yes speaks of new millions of online buyers and that new techniques are being developed for safety in purchases experientiality the exploitation of artificial intelligence to create virtual sales assistants I am very interested in the discussion of sustainability on the one hand we have those who tell us that we must prefer the purchase of neighborhood the little shop in our town grocery shopping from the farmer at zero km and on the other hand we have this whole army of large retailers and technologies that push us to buy everything by moving around in a virtual world that is also very amusing at times which however risks being unsustainable We think to packaging mountains of rubbish to returns that travel twice to door-to-door transport all on rubber yet industry insiders give very encouraging data they explain that in environmental terms it is better to choose a product online instead of going by car to look for it especially if I can&#39;t find it and I have to make several journeys, it is less impactful to place orders online if I have to travel more than km to buy the same thing, it is better to understand online if a product is actually present in the shop before going there In short, apparently ecommerce would not be as polluting as previously thought and companies are working to reduce packaging and make it environmentally friendly use electric vehicles for deliveries Even Amazon in America is asking its customers to schedule deliveries only in one day What do you think Buy online Do you have studies regarding this phenomenon in your country Write me
