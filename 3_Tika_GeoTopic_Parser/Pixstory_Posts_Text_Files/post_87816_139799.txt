This is my village in Tamil nadu I have to change a lot of things in my village but now I m going to tell about the main issues that my village has faced But I get a wonderful people and get a awesome place My life has been in this village till now But If we want to study schooling means we should go a little far from our village There is not a sufficient school in my village my village has a primary only If we camparing our village system with city means our village system is too low So the city students are performing very well than village students in English and extra curricular activities etc our village student don t have that much advantage or chances to improve their skills and other activities So I really would like to change the education system of my village
