Next Edu was asked if missing out on the Champions League spot last season forced in Arsenal signing all those players and whether did they manage to bring in all the players they wanted Edu replied Yes almost percent of them I understand sometimes players want to play Champions League football but I think we can offer something very special for the players as well It s not only Champions League but you can be part of a group of players which can achieve something very special for this football club And then always I ask them if they want to be part of the project we ve been building as we re doing I m sure we will do something very special for this football club and then when I explain to the players they really understand it and that s why they re here HAVE YOU MET THE PLAYERS THAT ARE NOT RIGHT FOR ARSENAL Yes for sure The reason to meet the players to meet the families and to talk to the agents is of course they have to understand us but I also have to understand them If they fit the model in all senses then okay we carry on But when I see something which I m not really comfortable with I move on Please find PART of this interview in the support section
