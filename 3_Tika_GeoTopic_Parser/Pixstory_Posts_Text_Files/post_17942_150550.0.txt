Turns out, Khloe Kardashian is very good at keeping secrets, even from her own family. On Thursday's episode of The Kardashians, the family explains that they are flashing back in time six months prior to the premiere episode. The Hulu reality series decided to share Khloe's baby news up front in the show's premiere, noting that Khloe did not discuss her son in the episodes leading up to the birth of her child. 
Now we are seeing the aftermath of Khloe's split from Tristan Thompson amid his paternity scandal without the mention that they are having a second child together. 
In the second episode of season 2, Khloe and her sister, Kim Kardashian, reveal that Tristan proposed to Khloe in December 2020, and no one in her family even found out until February 2021 when Kim asked Tristan about it. 
"He was going to propose to her on Valentine's Day, which was a year since they had drama, so this is last Valentine's Day, and then I called him the day after and I was like, 'Hey, I never heard anything from Khloe, oh my god, did you propose?'" Kim recalls in an aside interview. "And he was like, 'Yeah, I did in December.'"
The reality star says she didn't want to give him "false hope" Khloe does not confirm if the giant diamond sparkler she was wearing was the ring Tristan proposed with.
The Kardashians streams Thursdays on Hulu.
