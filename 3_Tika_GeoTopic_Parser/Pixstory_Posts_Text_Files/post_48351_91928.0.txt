‌As the much-awaited meeting began today; Senate Jury Dick Durbin talked about her impeccable qualifications and experience of Jackson. He also said her confirmation would bring a missing perspective to the Supreme Court. He also lamented at the attacks Republicans made on Jackson during the Confirmation Hearings. He didn't forget to mention the broad support she received.
‌
‌Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said that he will not support the confirmation of Jackson. He stated differing views on the role of judges in both of their opinions as to the reason. He was one among the republicans who grilled Jackson during confirmation. She also lost the cote on Sen.Lindsey Graham. He pointed out she was an activist judge and disagreed with her approach to sentencing child porn offenders. 
‌
‌ Democrat Patrick Leahy added to Durbin's point that some members of the committee badgered Jackson to a point where they threw away all the basic rules and quorum of the committee; underlining her temperament. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that if confirmed, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will "walk into that court with her head held high" because she is "opening up that court to make every little girl and boy in America to realize that anything and everything is possible."

What's going to happen if Republicans doesn't support Jackson? Let's see!
