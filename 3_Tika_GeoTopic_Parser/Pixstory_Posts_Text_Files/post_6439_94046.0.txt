Children are pure beings who soak up light from those who are around them. Children are pure and are full of love, no matter what little obstacles they face. I’m a heavy believer that Children are their environment and if we can unlearn and relearn with them their pureness will allow us to see what it is we’re missing. 

I remember a long long time ago….

My children have stuck by my side through the ups and downs and when the downs hit hard I had a tendency to push them away, for the simple fact of old traditions…growing up we were always told “children need to stay out of grown folks business.” Or “children have no say!” 

But as I begin to heal from all trauma from past experiences…. I saw pushing them away would only create trauma in their future and will then become a repeated cycle. Then realized they’ll grow up to become broken, dark beings who will live a life of toxicity. 

I was determined to change that very negative narrative and allow their pureness to be embraced. 
Children teaches us A LOT, we just have to be open to receiving them for who they are. I love my big babies and as I look at this picture, I’m proud to be they’re mommy and thankful they choose me and ALL of me.

Love on your children! They are pure and full of love and silliness. They make you feel youthful as you grow wiser. They change every week lol and as my oldest hits High School her mind is changing every second lol embrace it ALL. It’s a beautiful journey to watch and being able to guide them through those adversity they’ll soon face. Let them be pure and love on them a little harder. 

This is for my parents out there! I stand with you and I’m here if need be✨

I love you
