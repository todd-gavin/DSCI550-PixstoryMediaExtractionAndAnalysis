The English Premier League is the most competitive league in the world, with all the big names there. There are many quality keepers like Allison, Shmeichel, Pope, Ederson, De Gea, Hugo Lloris. . Defense is a collective effort including Defenders. Even though, keepers play a vital role in a team's performance and wins. 


29 year old Edouard Mendy played an important role in Senegal's success in AFCON. In 7 matches, he has conceded just 2 goals, keeping 5 of them clean, including the final. He made an important penalty save in the final against Egypt. After losing the final in the 2019 AFCON, it was a great achievement by Senegal. He was selected as best keeper of the tournament also. 

Even though Manchester City's Ederson got the Golden Glove for the season 20-21, many believe Edourd Mendy was great in his first season with Chelsea. 

Mendy has played only 2700 minutes in league, conceding just 24 goals, least in league by any keeper. If you compare to other keepers with similar time spent on the field, Allison has conceded 32 in 2790 minutes of keeping. He has saved 70% of the shots to the target. He was phenomenal in Chelsea's champions league performance by keeping 8 of their 11 matches clean, conceding only 4 goals. 

Mendy reached Chelsea from the French club Rennes, with a strong recommendation by Petre Czec, former Chelsea legend. He kept that belief with three consecutive clean sheets, first time after Petre Czec himself. He made it 5 consecutive, a historical first in a decade. If we check, Ederson or Allison are not in the top 10 list of shot stopped keepers, currently De Gea is at top with 86 saves. 

Mendy is awaiting a special birthday on March 1, after winning the Champions League, African Cup of Nations and now competing in the FIFA club World cup. His cousin Ferdinand Mendy plays for Real Madrid.
