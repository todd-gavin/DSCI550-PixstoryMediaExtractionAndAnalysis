Some places trigger your anxiety it might be because of something that happened there or something you left there Some memories hurt but they don t need to stand hurt you can always kill those memories with some happy memories To get over any fear is to face it There is no other easy solution So if you want to make amendments and heal yourself start from the places that hurt you Laugh in the places you cried take selfies in the places you felt ugly sing wherever you felt voiceless dream where they made you doubt expand where old you to shrink dance in the place where you broke Heal for yourself not for the world Happy day
