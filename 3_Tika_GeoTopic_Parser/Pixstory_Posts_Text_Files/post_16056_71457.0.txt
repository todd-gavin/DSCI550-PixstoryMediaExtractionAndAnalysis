This video is from Morni Hills. Morni Hills is near Chandigarh and is an off-beat hill station of Haryana in the Panchkula district. 
An adventure camp has been covered in the video. In the camp, poor and some differently-abled children of government schools are trying to give a very serious message by doing adventure activities. Instead of looking at them with pity, these people want society to provide them opportunities so that they can prove that they are not less than anyone.
