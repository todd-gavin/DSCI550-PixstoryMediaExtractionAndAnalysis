Many lock fear in the room of darkness 
Only one brings the key of  light 
Don't be afraid if you're fighting against wrong 
This would make you more strong 
The taunting heads enjoying their huge pieces of steak 
Don't ever let them think you are weak
Every tear weighs a million reasons
Dont just sit and count the different seasons 
Many tides are yet to come 
You are the most special unique one 
Sometimes you never know strength acts as a hand 
A gift from God that help us to stand 
Be the mountains stopping the strong winds 
Nobody can break your invisible wings 
You can climb the highest tower
It's time to show your hidden power
Ladies and gentlemen man fasten your seatbelts tight 
Get ready for the flight  
Let the fear fade away
And let the bravery always stay 
A thousand chances , a thousand tries , a thousand miles waiting for you 
When it comes to " I am scared ", courage acts as a glue
After the movie Annabelle was released
There was not a single doll to be seen 
Hold onto God never stop believing him 
Fear is an enemy that's damaging me 
Darkness is behind , light is in front 
Every step removes the dust 
My wings are open , spreading wide apart 
Heart says " Come start"
Get ready for the combat 
Some made me weak , I cried 
Now it's time to make a move my tears have dried .
