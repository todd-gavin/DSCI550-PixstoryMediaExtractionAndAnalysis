The 2021 NBA Draft was always shaping up to be special. Big man Evan Mobley and scoring guard Jalen Green had established themselves at the top of their high school class from early in their prep careers, while Cade Cunningham enjoyed a breakout rising senior year on the grassroots circuit to put himself in contention for the No. 1 player in the country.

Jalen Suggs joined the party during an incredible freshman year at Gonzaga where he helped lead the team to an undefeated record entering the national championship game (the Zags would lose to Baylor). The class got even stronger when Jonathan Kuminga reclassified to skip his senior year of high school and play for the G League Ignite, and Josh Giddey emerged as a lottery-caliber prospect out of Australia.

This year’s rookie class had a big impact around the league. What rookies were the most impressive? These were the best first-year NBA players in the 2021-2022 season.

13. Jonathan Kuminga, F/C, Golden State Warriors

As one of the youngest players in the 2021 draft class, Kuminga was supposed to need a few years to develop after being selected by the Warriors with the No. 7 overall pick. Instead, Kuminga worked his way into the rotation by the time the calendar flipped to January and immediately provided a necessary injection of athleticism and energy to the Golden State front court. 

12. Davion Mitchell, G, Sacramento Kings

Mitchell skyrocketed up draft boards with a tremendous run in March Madness where he powered Baylor to a national championship.
The Kings selected him with the No. 9 overall pick, and he proved himself as one of the best defenders and most durable players in the rookie class. At 6-foot, Mitchell is a ferocious on-ball defender who can hound opposing point guards with strength, quickness, and toughness.

11. Nah’Shon ‘Bones’ Hyland, G, Denver Nuggets

Hyland blossomed into an offensive dynamo late in the season to provide the immediate scoring punch the Nuggets hoped for when they selected him at No. 26 overall out of VCU.
