Edge is reportedly set to return to WWE on next Monday's episode of RAW.

The former WWE Champion was the leader of The Judgment Day faction alongside Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley. The eleven-time world champion wanted Rhea and Damian to reach their full potential and often mocked the WWE Universe during his promos.


He referred to the group as a "movement" that was looking for more members. On the June 6th edition of WWE RAW, Finn Balor joined The Judgment Day and the group immediately betrayed their leader. They brutally beat him down and the 48-year-old has not been seen on WWE television since.

On today's episode of Wrestling Observer Live, Bryan Alvarez said that the WWE Hall of Famer will be returning with his Rated-R Superstar gimmick. He noted that WWE has already made merchandise for the old gimmick.
