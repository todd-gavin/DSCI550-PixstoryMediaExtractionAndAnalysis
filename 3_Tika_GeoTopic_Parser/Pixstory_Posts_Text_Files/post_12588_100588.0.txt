In our day to day lives we might have had those low days when we might be too sad that we cry it out but when we have a friend who we would call immediately to take their help this is when emotional support plays its part. 

Emotional support is the care and compassion that you have for another person. This could be expressed verbally or non verbally and it can include actions like helping the person to call a therapist or giving them a hug. 

This support will help a person to cope with their emotions and experiences and let them know through your actions that they are not alone. This could bring a difference to a person's health and wellbeing. 

What are the qualities of emotional support?  

Depending on the situation it can be different, the people involved in it, the culture or social norms are some factors that contribute to the kind of support given. 

Here is how effective emotional support can be given to someone you know. 

• Respecting the other person and helping them with what they need with consideration. 

• Being non judgemental 

• Compassionate 

• It is unconditional, emotional support just doesn't happen only while we are low but it's something that's constantly there. Good or bad emotional support from someone keeps us going. 

• It focuses on a person's wants and needs that's seeking support. 

Through active listening, empathising and validating and giving love, care and encouragement are some ways you can extend your emotional support to your dear one.
