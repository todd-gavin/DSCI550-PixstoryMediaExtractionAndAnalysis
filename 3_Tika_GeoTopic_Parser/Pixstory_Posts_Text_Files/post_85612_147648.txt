My Favourite Holiday Destination London for me is the best place to enjoy vacations whether you are traveling alone with friends family or kids Right from the very start as it has one of the busiest and beautiful airports in the world It is a place for all kinds of people and people of all ages very cosmopolitan It has something for everyone right from fashion to food You can find all sorts of cuisines there from Nigerian Indian Mexican to continental It has that vibe of happiness and welcoming smiles from people making you feel like a part of their city I also respect the fact that it has managed to keep its rich culture and heritage intact along with its tremendous growth as a powerful city London is certainly the hub for retail fashion technology films and theatre finance etc
