Walking is an enjoyable and a great form of exercise and new studies shows that people who are in their 80s can increase their lives by walking for 10 minutes a day. 
The researchers wrote that, “Our study indicates that walking even just one hour every week is advantageous to those aged 85 years and older compared to being completely inactive. The take-home message is to keep walking throughout life". 
The researchers examined the association between walking and the risks that are the all cause cardiovascular mortality among adults in the age of 85 and older. They were reported that walking for little as for 10 minuted per day can increase the longevity. 
The participants had filled out a questionnaire on leisure time activities, which included the length of time spent per week: 
• Walking at a slow pace 
• Engaging in moderate-intensity activities, such as cycling or brisk walking 
• Engaging in vigorous exercises, such as running 
When compared to the inactive individuals, those who had walked for at least one hour per week had caused only 40 percent of risk for cardiovascular mortality. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that adults who got 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity along with two days of muscle strengthening training. As one grow older, doing a daily or weekly activity could be more challenging. 
“In general, there is a standard exercise recommendation for everyone over age 60,” Dr. Deena Goldwater, the vice president of care delivery for Los Angeles-based Welcome Health Inc., told Healthline.
