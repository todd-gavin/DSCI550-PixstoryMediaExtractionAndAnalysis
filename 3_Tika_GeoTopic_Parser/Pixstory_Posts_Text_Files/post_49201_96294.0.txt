I am surprised to see a feminist account talk on favour of pornography! Isn't it the feminist movement's position that nearly all sex, particularly pornography, is a form of patriarchal oppression and vilification of women? I'm even more amazed that parents have been paying tuition for their children to participate in such terrible and shameful conduct of human degeneration. Do you want your children to attend a university where pornography is taught as a credible subject?

Liberal education has gone too far, to the point that there is no such thing as right or wrong, good or bad taste, or the distinction between commendable and repulsive human behavior.

It's funny when these spoiled, inexperienced, immature and arrogant students use freedom as an excuse to indulge in vulgarity and immorality. Future generations have twisted freedom from tyranny to include freedom to position degenerate behaviour as higher education and to protect their right to course credit for studying such disgusting sadomasochism. Our Founding Fathers would probably be shocked to learn that their freedom from tyranny has been twisted to include freedom to position degenerate behaviour as higher education and to protect their right to course credit for studying immorality like pornography.

Before allowing their children to enroll in any college, parents should check their credit courses. They should not be able to finance their efforts that aim to damage our nation's moral fiber by weakening our children's sense of decency.
