Every single person has a story to tell about food -- likely countless. Lots of vegetarians can write about the first time they ate bacon again, lots of people can talk about their grandmaâ€™s cooking, but few can tell these stories in a way that makes them simultaneously singular and relatable. Whether the subject is animal agriculture or getting dinner on the table or a croissant in Paris, these food narratives make us laugh, think, and/or head to the kitchen.
