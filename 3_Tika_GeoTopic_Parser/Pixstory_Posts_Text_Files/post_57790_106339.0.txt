Baby ducks are one of the most cutest things on the planet. 
I mean you can't get offeneded by a glaring baby duckğŸ˜‚
Now, there's variations of tempers that we experience and we express them differently too.
I like the phrase "ducking mad" because its not only a less of a curse but also indicates that you're not really that mad since you've used "ducking"ğŸ˜‚ 
You're most probably saying this to friends that annoy you regularly ğŸ˜‚
And the pics explain that perfectlyğŸ˜‚
