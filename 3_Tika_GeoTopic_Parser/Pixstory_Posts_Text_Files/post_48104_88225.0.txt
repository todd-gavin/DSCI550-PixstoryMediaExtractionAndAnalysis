The emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka, a statue that was used as an emblem on Ashoka Pillars which were commissioned by Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire, who reigned from 269-232 BCE. These pillars were mostly installed in the premises of Ancient Buddhist Monasteries, Stupas and on Significant Ancient Trade Routes. The statue is a dimensional emblem showing four lions, facing four directions respectively. It became the emblem of the Dominion of India in December 1947,and later the emblem of the Republic of India.
