Travesing through your love,
Spring has called you away,
I'm trapped in the fall,
From where do I find your way?

Two roads diverged,
Never have I taken yours,
The other always felt safe,
I only had myself to blame.

One day the winds changed,
Where I had lived in decay,
Now onto your path I strayed,
My heart finally lured me your way.

In your garden of spring,
I'm an outsider to your beauty,
My hands bound by thorns,
Am I really not welcome here?

Your arms won't wrap around me,
I'll be shoved onto the ground,
Crumpling the leaves of hope,
My reality is a fabrication.

I heard the daffodils were near,
Should I just head there?
They've again called you away,
The summer awaited you I hear.

The brook took her away,
I'm a tad bit too late,
Would've pleaded you to stay,
Now there lies no way.

The flowers whisper your name,
They wither without you,
Your presence their remedy,
Am I worthy to help?

Just as I step away,
A purple hue catches my eye,
As I glance towards it,
Your glimpse radiates my existence.

Your essence lingers here,
It calls out to me,
Your voice softly echoes,
My name you remember.

Nowhere to be seen,
Yet everywhere I mean,
A Little Swan Daisy I see,
Reminds me of thee. 

As the darkness surrounds,
The moonlight around the daisy revolves,
A withered Aster by its side cries,
My future the poor soul signifies.
