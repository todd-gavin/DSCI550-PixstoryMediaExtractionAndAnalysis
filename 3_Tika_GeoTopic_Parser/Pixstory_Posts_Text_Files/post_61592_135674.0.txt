The WWE Clash at the Castle premium live event in Cardiff, Wales this Saturday will see Seth Rollins and Matt Riddle go toe to toe. And things have become seriously personal between the two.
They took part in a tense split screen interview on last night’s WWE Raw show, exchanging final barbs before their encounter at the show in Cardiff.
A comment from Riddle, where he told Rollins that he would show that there is only one man in their marriage, and that was Becky Lynch, provoked a furious response from his opponent.
Seth fired back at Riddle, telling him that if he wants to talk about Seth’s family, then they’ll talk about Riddle’s, before noting that they can’t as he doesn’t have a family because his wife divorced him and took the kids because they “don’t want to see your bitch ass anymore.”
Riddle was clearly incensed by this and reacted furiously. He questioned Rollins, who replied, “You heard me, bitch.” Riddle then went to town, saying: “I’m not gonna beat you up, I’m gonna fuck you up. Where the fuck are you?”
While trash talking is a vital part of any sport, Rollins has opened the floodgates for Riddle's rage and he is sure to be on the receiving end of an ass kicking of a life time
