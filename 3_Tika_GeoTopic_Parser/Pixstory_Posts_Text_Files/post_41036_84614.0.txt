On Monday, Benedict Cumberbatch was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and he paid tribute to his sister Tracy Peacock, who died of cancer last year. On the occasion, Cumberbatch, one of the most well-known actors today, expressed his solidarity for the people of the war-torn Ukraine. 

His filmography includes "The Imitation Game," "12 Years a Slave," and "1917," as well as TV programmes such as "Sherlock," "Patrick Melrose," and feature films such as "The Imitation Game," "12 Years a Slave," and "1917." In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he also plays the superhero sorcerer Doctor Strange.

In his address, the 45-year-old actor said his sister would have loved to be a part of this ceremony. "I want to mention my sister who we lost last year. She would have loved this. She was unbelievably loyal, supportive, and she would have loved the glitz and the oddness and the glamour. She would have just been laughing nonstop all the way through, and probably crying," Cumberbatch said, as reported by Variety.

The actor, who is up for an Academy Award and a BAFTA also used the platform to promote Ukraine. "I can't speak today, on this extraordinary platform, without acknowledging the obvious of what's happening in Ukraine and showing my support for the people of Ukraine, my support for the people of Russia who are opposing the Kleptocracy and the idiocy of their rulers in order to try to stop the progression of this atrocity."
