There are times when after being exhausted and drained through a long mundane day, you come back home and, with a satisfactory impression, say my comfort zone finally.
After that, your home is the comfort zone of all-day chaos, a place of peace and ease.
We often build such comfort zones in different people, things or places, but staying there feels a lot better.
But what's a comfort zone?
A Comfort zone is actually your psychological state where you feel safe and secure, with no one to bother you in that space.
It fulfils the need for certainty that is lost when you step out of it.
But does always staying in your comfort zone help?
No, it doesn't.
Yes, it gives you the solace and calms you need to stay happy and motivated, but comfort zones hinder your growth.
It stops us from thinking about it because lingering there is the most beautiful thing and favourite pastime.
But always lying in your comfort zone can make you lazy and the biggest procrastinator.
It can make you avoid your work and instead creates a destructive imbalance.
So there should be an understanding of when and how to come out of it.
