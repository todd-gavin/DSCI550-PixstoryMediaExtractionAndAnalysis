We worked really hard amidst the chaos for the recently held All Assam Major Ranking Table Tennis Championship  in Golaghat. Aditya Aryan Bora of Nagaon, who is playing under us has turned the tables around by clinching U-19 Boys Title and Silver Medal in U-17 boys event. Devika Barman of our academy clinched the Silver Medal in U-13 Girls Event and bagged the 3rd position in the U-15 Girls Event. To the rest of the players who played the Semi Finals, Quarter Finals & Pre Quarter finals respectively, we all are proud of you. And to the ones, who couldn't make a mark by an inch, keep your head high because you are no less than champions. Keep working hard as always, the sky is the limit.
