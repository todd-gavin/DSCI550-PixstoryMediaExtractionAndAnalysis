A rise in global temperatures results in an increased likelihood of hurricanes, storms and floods. The reason for this is simple â€“ as the Earth's temperature rises, the water vapor content in the atmosphere increases. This Increases the amount of rain that falls from the sky, as well as the intensity and duration of rainfall.
In addition, warmer climates also lead to more extreme weather events, such as tornadoes and hurricanes. These types of weather events can cause great damage not only to property but also to human lives. In fact, climate change is now considered a primary factor behind several recent disasters around the world, including the current flooding in Pakistan that has caused one third of the country to be underwater and has caused more than 1,500 deaths, and now the Hurricane Ian in the United States.
And it's nothing that happened suddenly. Hurricanes have recently increased around the world, including US and are extremely powerful, and so have flooding due to heavy rains. And this is us not talking about all other disasters.
Once again, it's the umpteenth warning from the nature. We need to start caring about climate change, NOW.
