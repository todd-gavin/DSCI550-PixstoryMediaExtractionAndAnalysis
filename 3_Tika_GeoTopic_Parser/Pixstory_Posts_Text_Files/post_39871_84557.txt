In occasion of Maha Shivratri today celebrated in honour Lord Shiva I thought about talking about his posture and dance in Indian culture In classical Indian culture dance is a demanding physical discipline Dance prepares the mind for spiritual leaps the dancer enters a trance the dancer and the dance become one reenacting the union of the individual soul with the transcendent divine The origins of Nataraja and of the Hindu god Shiva himself lie thousands of years ago However the form we recognise best today may have reached its apex around the th or th century in southern India The Ananda Tandava or blissful dance In it Shiva is in the Bhujangatrasita karana pose literally frightened by a snake with his left leg held across his body at hip level and every element contains a deep meaning Roughly Shiva is here at once seen creating and destroying existence offering the escape hatch from this constant chaos and finally revealing the clue to that escape hatch which is to subdue ignorance The cosmic dance of Shiva is called Anandatandava meaning the Dance of Bliss and symbolizes the cosmic cycles of creation and destruction as well as the daily rhythm of birth and death The dance is a pictorial allegory of the five principle manifestations of eternal energy creation destruction preservation salvation and illusion According to Coomaraswamy the dance of Shiva also represents his five activities Shrishti creation evolution Sthiti preservation support Samhara destruction evolution Tirobhava illusion and Anugraha release emancipation grace
