As stated by the Liga Portugal team on social media, playmaker Julian Draxler has transferred from Paris Saint-Germain to Benfica on loan. He will sign a loan agreement with the French powerhouses, who have agreed to cover the majority of the €7 million annual wage throughout the loan period.
The German midfielder has been a peripheral player for Paris for a certain time and was put on a list of players the club's new management team considered unnecessary earlier this summer. Newcastle was one of the clubs who spoke to the player's support group about a transfer last month, but those conversations were unsuccessful. The 28-year-old offensive midfielder, however, had to be flown to Lisbon to finalize the transfer and have a club physical. 
Draxler has completed 198 games for PSG since joining them from Wolfsburg in 2017 for an estimated €35 million. During that time, he has scored 26 goals and provided 41 assists throughout all tournaments. Draxler has been told he may leave Paris and has been excluded from the team thus far this season.
Draxler is a player that can play many positions, but other people like to refer to him as versatile. He is capable of playing all positions except defense, but he alone knows what that is. However, Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz's arrival means that playing appearances in the center of the park will be scarce, particularly given that Galtier prefers a double six in his 3-4-3 formation.
Draxler now has an opportunity for a new beginning in Portugal with the prolific trident of Mbappe, Messi, and the in-form Neymar ahead of him in the pecking order in attack. Draxler hopes to use the opportunity to launch his career at Benfica to make the German national team for the World Cup in November.
