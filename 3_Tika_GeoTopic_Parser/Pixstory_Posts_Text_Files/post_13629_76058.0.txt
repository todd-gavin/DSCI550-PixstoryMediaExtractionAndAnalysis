Osama is the first Afghan film to be made since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. A film that was able to portray some of the medieval rule of this government over Afghanistan. This spectacular film was directed by Siddique Barmak in 2003.
When the Taliban government was overthrown in Afghanistan, there was only room for cinema in the country. Well-known Afghan filmmaker Siddiq Barmak, along with his Iranian friends and colleagues, made the first post-Taliban feature film in Afghanistan after six years of stagnation in Afghan cinema, trying to recreate parts of the dark years of the Taliban rule in Afghanistan. Slowly
The film begins with Ali Shariati saying, "God, make me one of those who sell their world for their religion, not one who sells their religion for their world." In the international version, the phrase "I can not forget but I can forgive" by Nelson Mandela is shown instead. After that, we see pictures of demonstrations of women in burqas in Kabul, which are being filmed by a foreign journalist. There are placards in the hands of women that read: "We are not Masyasi", "We are hungry", "We are widows", "We want work" and ... Taliban forces attack women and disperse them.
The film revolves around a poor family living in Afghanistan during the black Taliban era. In the same way, it depicts in the margins the situation of the people in the city and what approach the Taliban had taken towards the people.
The girl's mother works at a hospital in Kabul. But after a while, the hospital was closed by the Taliban. Because no woman is allowed to leave home or work, their family is left without food. The mother decides to send her daughter to work as a boy by cutting her hair short. When the Taliban send all the boys of the city to a school to learn their religious duties and military principles.
