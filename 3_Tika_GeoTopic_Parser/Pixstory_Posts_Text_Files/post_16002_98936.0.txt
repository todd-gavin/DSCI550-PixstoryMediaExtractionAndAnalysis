Abstract 

Purpose 

Eating out of boredom, the changes in daily routine, physical inactivity and longer exposure to screens have made glycemic control difficult at home during the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Adolescents with diabetes are at higher risk of developing eating problems than are their healthy peers. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of leisure time boredom and A1C level on eating problems in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. 

Design and methods 

A descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional design was used in this study. The study was conducted in Turkey, with the participation of 173 adolescents diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Convenience sampling was used to recruit patients from pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinics of hospitals. 

Results 

It was determined that the diabetes eating problems of adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes were mostly affected by the level of leisure time and A1C, respectively. In the overall model, 58% (F = 4119.701, p < .001) of the factors affecting diabetes eating problems could be explained by the level of leisure boredom and A1C level. 

Conclusion 

It has been found that the adolescents with diabetes with high A1C levels and who cannot use their leisure time and have boredom are more at risk in terms of diabetes eating problems. 

Practice implications 

It should be determined how the adolescents with diabetes spend their lesiure time by diabetes health care team, which should be supported to develop leisure time skills. Effective use of leisure time and strategies to cope with boredom should also be included in diabetes education.
