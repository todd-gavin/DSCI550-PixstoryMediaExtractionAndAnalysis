I didn’t need more reasons for Michael Jordon to be my favourite but he keeps giving me more. True fans of Jordon very well known how big his heart is and how dearly he loves his teammates. This man is the definition of magnanimity of heart and he has once again lived up to it.

Michael Jordan was a member of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels from 1981 to 1984 before joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls as a superstar. Jordan sent a pile of Tar Heel gear to a former Bulls colleague, Scott Williams, as UNC prepares to face Duke Blue Devils in this year's NCAA Final Four. 

According to sportskeeda, Between 1990 and 1993, Williams and Jordan won three NBA championships together. Williams also played for the University of North Carolina from 1986 to 1990. Williams stated on Twitter that he texted "His Airness" about the possibilities of receiving any UNC clothing while the Tar Heels were in the Final Four.

Jordan delivered yet again, giving Williams a package of UNC goods, including shirts and shoes. Williams was overjoyed with the gifts he and his staff had received.

On Saturday, North Carolina will face Duke at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. If the Tar Heels overcome their opponents, Mike Krzyzewski's legendary coaching career will come to an end. 

Despite having a 28-9 overall record this season, the Tar Heels were only seeded eighth. After defeating the Saint Peter's Peacocks 69-49 in the Elite Eight, they advanced to the Final Four.

Let’s see what happens!
