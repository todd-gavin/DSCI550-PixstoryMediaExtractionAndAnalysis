In response to broader sanctions against Russia, Russia declared on Tuesday that the wife and daughter of US President Joe Biden would not be permitted to enter the country. 25 names, including those of Biden's wife Jill and daughter Ashley, were reportedly being placed to the nation's "stop list," according to the foreign ministry.

Four senators were also denied access after being named "responsible for the formulation of the (US) Russophobic course," according to the statement. Democratic Kirsten Gillibrand, Ben Sasse, Susan Collins, and Mitch McConnell are Republicans.


Prominent scholars are also included on the list, including Francis Fukuyama, whose book "The End of History and the Last Man" made the argument that the growth of liberal democracies might be the tipping point in the evolution of society.
