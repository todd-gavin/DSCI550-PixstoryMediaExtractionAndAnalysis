The one thing that I really like about COVID, is the flexible model of "Work From Home".

COVID has helped me in using the Technology upto its full potential, by allowing me to Work from Home.

And, I really want it be the same Post COVID. It has definitely increased my productivity and has schooled me about multi-tasking.

P.S.- I personally do not like COVID
