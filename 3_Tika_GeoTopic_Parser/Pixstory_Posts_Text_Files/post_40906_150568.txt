I hear the violoncello tis the young man s heart s complaint I hear the key d cornet it glides quickly in through my ears It shakes mad sweet pangs through my belly and breast I hear the chorus it is a grand opera Ah this indeed is music this suits me A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full I hear the train d soprano what work with hers is this The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess d them It sails me I dab with bare feet they are lick d by the indolent waves I am cut by bitter and angry hail I lose my breath Steep d amid honey d morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles And that we call Being Walt Whitman
