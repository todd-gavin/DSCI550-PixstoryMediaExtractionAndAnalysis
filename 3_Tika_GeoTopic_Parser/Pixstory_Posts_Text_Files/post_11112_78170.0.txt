Sex Education in India, is more difficult than it sounds!

“Sex” is a word that goes through a lot of censorship In India, using the term in public would have serious repercussions in many instances(if not all). So instead of calling it sex education, there are several terms like health and wellness curriculum, adolescent education, etc. 

Even though the aim of these sex-ed sessions is to help students understand that these bodily changes are normal, teachers and parents do not want their sons or daughters to see eye-to-eye during these sessions.Irony! 


keep pouring your thoughts :)
