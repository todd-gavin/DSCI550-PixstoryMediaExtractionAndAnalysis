‌As the questions by Senators ended; today we are about to witness proceedings starring multiple panels of external witnesses to testify about the judge, beginning with a slate of American Bar Association officials who served on the ABA committee that rated Jackson "well qualified" to the Supreme Court post.
‌
‌Sen. Durbin said he was saddened by certain approaches made towards Ketanji Brown Jackson. He said according to CNN: "Some of the attacks on this judge were unfair, unrelenting and beneath the dignity of the United States Senate," Durbin said. "You can disagree with the senator's vote. You can disagree with a judge's ruling. But to draw conclusions that really reflect on them personally and their values and take it to the extreme is unfair whether the nominee is Democrat or Republican.
‌
‌Further, American Bar Council explained how they came to the conclusion that Jackson was 'well-qualified' for Supreme Court. According to Ret. Judge Ann Claire Williams, the chair of the ABA standing committee on the federal judiciary; from reviewing the testimonies the ABA received from over 250 judges, attorneys, and academics, the committee heard "uniform praise" like "brilliant, beyond reproach, first-rate patient, insightful, impeccable" to describe Jackson. 
‌
‌ABA panel also rejects that Judge Jackson was biased in the Child pornography case. ABA committee member Joseph Drayton said that the standing committee talked to various prosecutors and defence attorneys who appeared in front of Jackson, including in some of the child pornography cases she heard and none of them felt a bias in her ruling.
