Cristiano Ronaldo was an unused sub as Manchester City hammered Manchester United 6-3 on Sunday. Former footballer turned pundit Roy Keene was disappointed with how Ten Hag has utilized CR7 following the game and the former United captain let his feelings known on air. 
Speaking on Sky Sports, Roy Keene said, "United are showing disrespect to Ronaldo. I think he should have been let go this summer during the transfer window. I donâ€™t think the manager should have held onto him just for him to sit on the bench. He is one of the greatest players ever and he had the option to leave this summer. The idea that he had no options is rubbish. He had four or five very good options."
Manchester City were clearly the better side in the derby as they went into the break with a 4-0 lead. Many Manchester United fans left the Etihad Stadium even before the halftime whistle after seeing United's shambolic performance. 
Though Roy Keene did not mention the "four or five" clubs that Cristiano Ronaldo had offers for. It is a well-known fact that CR7 wanted to leave in the summer. The Portuguese striker has just started 1 Premier League game under Erik Ten Hag this season. It has to be seen if the loss in the Manchester derby forces the manager to include Ronaldo in the starting XI for the next game.
