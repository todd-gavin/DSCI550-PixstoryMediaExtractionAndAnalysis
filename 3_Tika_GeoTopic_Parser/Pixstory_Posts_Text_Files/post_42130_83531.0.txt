India might be the only place where students go through a long lasting rite of applying for internships, numerous interviews and screening process only to get an unpaid internship.
I know that getting experience in your preferred domain is important but to do devote hours of your time and effort only to get exposure seems like a bit if a stretch to me. Organizations should provide some kind or incentive, in cash or kind, however small it may be for the services they require. Only then will an intern get the 'True working experience' as well as the drive to work even harder.
