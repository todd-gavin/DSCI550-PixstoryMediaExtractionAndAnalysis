Always cleanse your hands, feet, neck, and face before bed. It's important to adequately clean up all the dirt. The nighttime skin renewal process begins as we sleep, making this the ideal time to use essential oils, creams, and gels.

So no dates after the bedtime routine. Better luck next time, darling!
