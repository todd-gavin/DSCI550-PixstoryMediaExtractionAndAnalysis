Money is the greatest invention of mankind but what does the future hold for it Will we be able to see the money as we know it in the future Money had a fascinating journey from barter to coins cash digital currency and now cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency the new buzzword in the financial markets is undoubtedly a global phenomenon known by many but understood by few Cryptocurrency is a currency that exists virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions These are decentralized i e regulated by their own community However this also implies that cryptos can be transacted even for criminal activities like money laundering That s why cryptos are facing backlash from governments of various countries including India And amidst these backlashes cryptocurrencies don t seem to be replacing money anytime soon Decentralization also means that there are no regulations on their creation There are around cryptocurrencies in the world the most popular ones include Bitcoin Dogecoin Ethereum etc The reason for this exponential number is that the software to create cryptocurrencies is open source So if you are broke fret not Just create your own crypto And you know what the crazy thing is People might invest in it because that s what the hype is about In fact one of the hottest cryptos at present Dogecoin emerged similarly It was created by two engineers as a meme to mock how people would invest in anything And these people did exactly the same They invested heavily in dogecoin making it one of the most lucrative cryptocurrencies This frenzy behavior of investors brings us to the next point of limitation volatility Data reveals that one in every three investors is oblivious to this blockchain system And when the markets are driven by sentiments rather than rationality can they be trusted These things make us wonder Are cryptos only a bubble And if yes when is it going to burst These are questions to which there are no definite answers yet But they at least confirm one thing there is a long way for cryptos to go before they can be accepted as a legal tender and maybe as a future of money
