The strange-looking mushrooms that NFL players are sporting on their helmets at training camp are really a part of an ongoing safety study that the league is conducting in the hopes of lowering the number of head injuries. 

US News reported that through the second preseason game, when the NFL claims head injuries are most common, all 32 NFL teams are now required to wear Guardian Caps.

“There’s a density of exposure, and a density of injury, at the beginning of training camp and the competition committee has been looking for ways to change that,” said Jeff Miller, executive vice president for NFL player health and safety.

The league said laboratory research indicates the 12-ounce Guardian Caps result in at least a 10% reduction in severity of impact to a player's brain. It says that number climbs to at least 20% if both players involved in a collision are wearing them.

Let’s see whether this experiment will work or not
