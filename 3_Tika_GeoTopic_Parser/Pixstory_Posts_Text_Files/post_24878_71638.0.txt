Dr. NK Arora, Chairman of the COVID-19 working group NTAGI, said today that India will likely begin inoculating children in the 12-14 age groups against Covid in March, as the 15-18 population will be mostly fully vaccinated by then.
Over 3.45 crore youngsters in the 15-18 age group have already received their first dosage of Covaxin, with their second dose expected in 28 days, according to him.


"Adolescents in this age group have been actively participating in the inoculation process, and based on this rate of vaccination, the remaining beneficiaries in the 15-18 age group are likely to be covered with the first dose by the end of January, and their second dose is expected to be administered by the end of February."
