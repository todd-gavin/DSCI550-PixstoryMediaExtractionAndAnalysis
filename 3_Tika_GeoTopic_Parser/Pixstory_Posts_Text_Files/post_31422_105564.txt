From today Tuesday June the video of SPAM UFFA is online, the new song by PSIKER the alter ego of the Milanese Finance Manager Massimo Curcio already available on streaming platforms and in digital download In the video of the song visible at the link Psiker together with directors Maria Bryzhko and Stefano Perego have wanted to tell the degeneration of a situation in which the protagonist the spam sung by Psiker the concentration is put to the test between post-it notes attached everywhere even on the protagonist and papers contained in a basket then thrown on the head passing through a coffee spilled on the shirt and many other elements that cause distraction For some years now I have been fighting a personal battle against spam understood as any useless and therefore unwanted contact received by e-mail call or message says Psiker The multiple interruptions to which we are subject every day and to see clearly in any area they do not allow you to concentrate for more than five minutes in a row and generate a waste of energy which at the end of the day leads to nothing but a greater load of stress In practice, the speed favored by technological development is absorbed by Spam And therefore I say Ugh enough Spam The song distributed by ADA Music Italy was written by Psiker himself co-produced at the Vault Studio together with the young producer and Dj J Adore LaDoor and mastered at the Dharma Recording Studio in Saviano NA by the Neapolitan producer Daniele Franzese who also collaborated among the many artists with Clementine
