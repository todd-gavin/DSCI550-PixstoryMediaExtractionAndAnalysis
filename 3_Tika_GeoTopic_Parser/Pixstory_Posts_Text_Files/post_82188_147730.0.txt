As I started my college few weeks prior, I got to indulge daily in one of my favourite hobbies, that is watching clouds. My college is quite a few hours away and journey offers me impeccable views.
Watching the beautiful sky is a therapeutic experience at the end of the day. The beautiful soft fluffy clouds with golden lining of sun is a heavenly sight to behold. You can let your imagination run wild and see different shapes in these clouds. A swan or a dragon. 
Also, did you know clouds appear white because they reflect the sunlight ? The grayÂ  clouds appear so as they contain too much water and don't reflect the light. Clouds are actually really heavy and a normal white fluffy cloud can weigh 500,000 kg. 
Clouds are such a interesting gift of nature - a happy gift on a sunny day and a terror on a rainy one.
