In death we want to remember only good about the person passed away but in case of legends it just hampers to define their legacy Lata Mangeshkar was great No doubt about it But she was not without flaws That just not take away anything from her greatness but makes her only a human a great human being She was not only known for her songing prowess but also for her tight grip on female playback singing in Bollywood Music directors were scared to invite her displeasure She was known to punish music directors by not singing for them And one can easily imagine the plight of such a music directors For decades she had no real competition as no umcoming singer maganged to get good songs Only her little sister Asha could survive but she too had to pay a price Her iconic song A Mere Watan ke Logon was supposed to be sung by her little sister Asha but somehow the singer changed miraculously and it was Lata who sang it to the utter surprise of Asha It only RD Burman who could bring Asha to the league of her sister in later decades by creating a new style of Bollywood music But all this as I said earlier make Lata only a human that she was No one can take away her achievements from her Her struggle for her family after early demise of father She helped all her siblings to establish their careers after started working in her teen years She was brave no doubt about it as Bollywood is not a easy to place to work in for a young girl that too without a father She had a very special friendship with cricekt administrator Raj Singh Dungerpur but due to family pressure Raj Singh could not marry her and both he and Lata Mangeshkar remained unmarried all their lives Raj went early in but now they will be together again
