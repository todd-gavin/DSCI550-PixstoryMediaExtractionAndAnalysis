In the centre of Hollywood, two private equity investors are increasing their stake in stage real estate. Hollywood Reporter said that BARDAS Investment Group and Bain Capital Real Estate announced on Thursday a $600 million redevelopment of the former Television Center, at 6311 Romaine St., that will turn the facility into a 620,000-square-foot studio campus with four stages, betting on the continued demand for soundstages amid a global crunch. The name will now be Echelon Television Center.The announcement comes a year after the duo in a joint venture acquired the neighboring site of a shuttered Sears to redevelop into Hollywoodâ€™s first purpose-built studio campus to be built in more than 20 years. The $450 million complex called Echelon Studios will span a full city block, including four 19,000 square foot soundstages, and is expected to break ground in 2023.
