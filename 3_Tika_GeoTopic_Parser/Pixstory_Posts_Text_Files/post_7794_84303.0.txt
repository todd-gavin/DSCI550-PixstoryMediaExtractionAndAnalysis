The man has been through the ringer. He rose to fame by his first role in Harry Potter and then came another major breakthrough through the Twilight Series, critics demolished his acting skills but that didn't let him take it to his heart. He has completely reinvented himself . Acting as "freaks" as he himself has said, he even considers Batman a freak. 

He's bringing Matt Reeves version of Batman to life in The Batman. This casting was met with a lot of criticism but as soon as the teaser released Battinson was all that was trending. Now it has become the most anticipated movie of this year. From from early reactions we got to see that Robert Pattinson is being halied for his performance as Bruce Wayne and The Batman. He's almost in every scene of the movie. This detective  noir movie is going completely into the comics and divulging in the most important aspect of Batman, those are his detective skills.

Robert's Batman hasn't distinctively divided the two personas as of now, his true mask Bruce Wayne hasn't occured to him as we can see in the trailers and from the interviews of the cast. Robert Pattinson's potrayal of Bruce Wayne has been described by him as quite Kurt Cobain-esque. The trailers look brilliant many have compared it to the NOIR, Se7en! A critic has said its quite Fincher-esque. All in all, don't miss out on this gem, Batman releasing on 4th March. Robert Pattinson is coming as the VENGEANCE, as the NIGHT, as THH BATMAN, its his vengeance against everyone who still doubt him.
