In one year with Mourinho at the helm of the team, Roma have completely changed their objectives After the victory in the Conference League which brought back a European trophy after more than thirty years, the Giallorossi are ready to do even more The addition of Dybala and the big presentation style exalted the environment and the players and the Argentinian&#39;s attacking partner that Tammy Abraham who did very well last season is now talking about the Scudetto Roma fans dream of the right Scudetto said the English striker As for me if I said I don&#39;t aim to win I would tell a lie about the Scudetto I want it, the team wants it But to do that we all need to put our maximum potential on the field Then we&#39;ll do the math I won last year as I hoped and I want to keep winning On Dybala, the whole Giallorossi environment has only words of praise Same thing Abraham a privilege for us to have a player of this level in the team It means a lot to the fans and means a lot to us who are building a high profile technical project If I&#39;m jealous But no There can be two kings right We talked a lot of a possible return to the Premier League for Abraham It is not known when and he answers without hesitation when asked The first day I arrived at Roma I felt at home I am in no hurry to return to the Premier League because here I can express my playing In Italy I feel happy in every respect If I regret leaving Chelsea Never for a second Choosing Roma was one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made in my life
