Lucas Torreira

Emery signed Lucas Torreira from Sampdoria in 2018/19. The player had an instant impact at Emirates with him playing 34 games of the EPL in his first-ever season. He had four G/A to his name. However, the form dipped as he had only 2 G/A to his name in 29 games for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta loaned him out to Atletico Madrid where Lucas Torreira went on to win the La Liga title.

In the 2021/22 season, the player went on a loan to the Italian top-flight side, Fiorentina. He had a fruitful season with six G/A from 31 games. With Fiorentina not budging for the amount quoted by Arsenal, Torreira is set to return to Emirates. 

Kieran Tierney

Not every signing of Unai Emery is a waste. Arsenal found the gem in Kieran Tierney and also a captain material. The player joined Arsenal from Celtic in 2019 and played a big role in winning the FA Cup finals for Arsenal. However, fitness has been a concern for the player. The Scottish international missed most of the season due to injury but was able to feature in 22 games in the Premier League for Arsenal. In 22 games, the player had three assists and a goal.
