Respective jury and my fellow mates and all my near and dear ones, A very good morning. My name is Rahul Ghosh. I take this opportunity to present my view in favour the quality of Bollywood movies is dwindling in comparison to International cinema. I am mentioning some points below.
1) Plot, Story telling needs lot of home work. A good gripping plot is the spine of the movie. Most international cinema's scripts are well researched and well written. There is a lack of good story script writers in Bollywood. Hollywood directors have cutting edge technologies at their affordability which makes them achieve feat of story telling.
2) Majority of Indian audience look for entertainment. It's not wrong to expect entertainment after all singing and dancing are in our culture. But the problem is most of film makers fail to realise is that there is no need to compromise on the quality of the movies in order to entertain their audience.
3) Now a days Bollywood is remaking movies from South,Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam industries. This is not bad to make remake. But the film makers ruins all the movies. They can't portray the same emotions or suspense. In this way Bollywood lost originality. Whereas most of the International cinemas are fresh and engaging so people love them.
4) Technology:- If we compare the special effects in International cinema to Bollywood cinema, International cinema's quality is clearly better. In any Sci-Fi, Adventure, Fantasy like Spiderman no way home, the special effects are mastered with a great deal of time and planning. It is a visual delight for audience. The quality of technology in same Bollywood movies is sacrificed at the cost of production speed.
5) You! -> Yes. Watch more movies develope a good taste. Expecting more from a cinema. You start dismissing bad movies. Bad film makers will then have to stop making movies.
With all the points I have given I believe I have been able to convince you about. My heartfelt thanks to everyone.
