Another story worth reading from that time is of Hiroo Onoda.

His commanding superior, Taniguchi, issued the young lieutenant his fatal order as American Military forces arrived on Lubang, a small strategic island 93 miles southwest of Manila Bay, Onoda recounted in his memoir.

“It may take three years, it may take five, but whatever happens we’ll come back for you,” Major Yoshimi Taniguchi promised a young Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda on February 28, 1945.

Onoda was officially declared dead in 1959, but Norio Suzuki, a Japanese student, tracked him down in February 1974. Onoda continued to refuse to surrender, telling Suzuki that he would not return home until official orders were received. Onoda emerged from the Philippine forest on March 9, 1974, his Imperial Japanese outfit ragged but somehow in surprisingly good condition after the 29 years of depravation.

Onoda, like so many other Imperial soldiers, refused to believe it when Japan finally surrendered in September of that year. Onoda and three other soldiers continued to assume they were at war, battling with locals and soldiers they mistook for enemy guerrillas on occasion. These marauding Japanese soldiers slaughtered 30 island residents over the course of several years. 

Onoda was left alone by 1974. One of the enlisted men surrendered to Filipino forces in 1950, and two others were shot dead by island police officials looking for the renegades, one in 1954 and the other in 1972.

He was, in 1974, commanded by his commanding officer – who was now a teacher – to lay his weapons and that's when he did it.
