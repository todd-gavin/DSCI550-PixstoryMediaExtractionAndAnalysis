After being booed as Real Madrid stunned Chelsea, Courtois frustrates his former club with a
remarkable save.

The Belgium international made an amazing save to prevent Cesar Azpilicueta from narrowing
the Blues' deficit.

Karim Benzema may have received all of the attention during Real Madrid's 3-1 Champions
League victory over Chelsea on Wednesday, but goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois also performed
admirably to keep his former club at bay.

Courtois came into prominence with a superb stop to deny Cesar Azpilicueta and protect
Madrid's significant lead.

Chelsea fans booed Courtois after his controversial departure to Real Madrid, with Courtois
refusing to train for the Blues near the conclusion of his time there, but he responded with a
fantastic save.

"It's a nice victory at a difficult place to play," Belgium's No. 1 told reporters after the game.
"We got off to a good start against a tough team." 

We created opportunities, hit the crossbar,
scored two goals, and then missed two more." [Chelsea's] goal was unfortunate.

 I managed to
get a touch but not well enough to stop it, but we then kicked off the second half with a goal.

"We can't comprehend it's finished. In football, an early goal from them might put them back in
the game. We need to play our game with our supporters cheering us on, much like we did
against Paris, and play as if we were level and need to win the game.
