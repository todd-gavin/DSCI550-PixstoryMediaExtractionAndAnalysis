Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, announced that he will be buying the football team Manchester United Football Club.

Musk tweeted, "I'm buying Manchester United ur welcome.

It was uncertain right away that Musk wanted to negotiate a transaction because of his habit of posting irreverent tweets.

The American Glazer family, who own Manchester United, didn't immediately answer to a request for comment.

As of Tuesday's end, the football team's market valuation was $2.08 billion.

Due to the team's struggles on the field, Manchester United supporter have lately protested against the Current owners, who purchased the club for 790 million pounds ($955.51 million) in 2005.

After United joined in an unsuccessful attempt to create a breakaway European Super League last year, the anti-Glazer campaign raised interest.
