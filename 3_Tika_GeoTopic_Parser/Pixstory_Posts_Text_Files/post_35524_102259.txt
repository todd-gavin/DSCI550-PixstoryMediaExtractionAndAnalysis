We won two titles so we did something positive We went ahead in the Champions League unfortunately we lost the Scudetto which was our goal The rankings don&#39;t lie the others were better than us we left something out along the way We have to look ahead and think about the future We We are proud of the fans and we thank them not only for today but for the whole season. They have always stimulated and supported us in the most difficult moments. We are sorry today that we cannot return their support. We must continue to grow. We lost something between the matches against Liverpool. Something that month took away from us physically and emotionally I&#39;d say that that month the decisive state we didn&#39;t lose in a game but in that bad month it normally happens to all teams When you win the fatigue weighs less but when you lose those games you certainly lose something too from a mental point of view As a team we have grown I think we have shown good football We have done ours we have played matches that are not few I am proud of these boys and we keep going like this These are the statements of Samir Handanovic at the end of the season which he seeing Inter finish second in the standings A disappointing result given the circumstances but which nonetheless has value for the Nerazzurri goalkeeper
