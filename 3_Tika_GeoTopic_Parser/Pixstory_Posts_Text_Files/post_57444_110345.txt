Bodily autonomy has become a point of discussion since the talk hovers around Roe v Wade and abortion rights Autonomy has always been the part of debates and rhetoric where people have seen speaking about liberty and the yearning to be that autonomous human being We try to seek autonomy in mostly all ways in our life However prior to all the independence we discuss it is bodily autonomy that is considered the fundamental right of all human beings But even the right of bodily autonomy has been confined to women For years they are tormented oppressed and denied their bodily rights Women have been the victims of rape virginity testing forced sterilization and what not The constant urge to confine and restrict their bodily freedom has continued Even countries like America which were supposed to build and concoct the liberty and freedom rules for women that no one else did in the world are lagging in protecting women s rights particularly their bodily rights The enchantment of a physically adorable women s body is considered useful when it tends to satiate the desires of men Leaving this it is nothing just a futile living being The problem is that the idea of limiting women s bodily rights throws fear and unavoidable injustices on them Eradicating abortion rights is another way to do it not being able to decide for their own bodies what else would they feel than an enslaved person It s her body so the choice to make decisions should not be hindered by anyone else s opinion
