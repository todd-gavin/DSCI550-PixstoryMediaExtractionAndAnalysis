A skincare routine is essential for everybody who wants to have healthy skin. Maintaining a consistent skincare regime will protect your skin from harm, address minor flaws,, and ultimately make your skin gleam.

Your skincare routine, on one hand, is mostly concerned with exterior application; nevertheless, for complete effectiveness, you must also consider your other habitsâ€”the foods you consume.

Some things to keep in mind while addressing the everyday problems for your skin are simple.

1) Wash and cleanse your face: The dirt and grime from the day needs some cleansing. Remember to choose and a cleanser that suits your skin type. Because oil and swear build up when you sleep, you need to wash your face in the morning too. With a mild cleanser or just water if your skin is not oily.

Exfoliate: Once or twice a week, exfoliate! Your skin is always shedding cells, exfoliation is important.

Toner and serum: Choosing a good toner and a serum is an essential part of skincare. It takes only a little bit of research to know what products to choose for you skin.

Moisturize: During the day and the night. There's no excuse against moisturizing. Your skin needs it, even if you have an oily skin. Choose a lightweight moisturizer for your face that addresses your concern.

Finally, diet. What you consume directly impacts your skin. I did a post on what food isn't good for your skin just yesterday. Avoid that! Dark chocolate is your skin's best friend! And yogurt and miso. And those greens, do not miss on those greens! Also, fruits maybe the best thing you can give your skin.

Keeping your skin happy is not hard if you just fall into a healthy routine. Good amount of sleep, water and nutrients will take your skin very far.
