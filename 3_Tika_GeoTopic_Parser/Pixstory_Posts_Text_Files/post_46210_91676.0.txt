I was so excited for First Iftaar today✨
After Performing All the prayers on time , Reciting The holy Quran and Helping In arrangements of Iftaar !  

Finally the moment arrived when the Magrib Azaan started and we could open the fast❤️

Dont forget to open the fast by eating Dates firstly and then have some water !

First Iftaar Mubarak🤍💫🌙
