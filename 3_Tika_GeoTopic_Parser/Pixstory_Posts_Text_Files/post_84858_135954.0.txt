As per various reports, Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin is joining FC Barcelona. The right back is supposed to have his contract terminated from the London club as he looks to join Barca on a free transfer. The contract will run upto June 2023 with no option of extending beyond a year.  It will be a sort of a homecoming for the 27-year old who had joined Arsenal after graduating from Barcelona’s La Masia Academy.
It was under Arsene Wenger that Bellerin made his debut. He became a regular in the Starting XI under the French manager as he went on to make 239 appearances for them. He regained his place under Mikel Arteta too but after a bad run of form he fell down the pecking order in North London. 
Bellerin was part of a loan deal to Real Betis last season and was heavily influential. The Spanish national helped the side to an emotional Copa Del Rey winners’ campaign. Betis had hoped to re-sign Bellerin on a permanent deal but owing to financial restrictions they had to let go of the defender.
Bellerin will now sign with his youth side fulfilling his dream to make a senior debut for the club. The Catalans were on the lookout to sign a replacement for American national, Sergino Dest as he was loaned out to AC Milan. Dest’s move is supposed to be for a solitary season. Earlier the Spanish giants had looked to sign Chelsea captain Cesar Azplicueta but that move fell through. 
Bellerin’s transfer is part of a busy window for Barcelona as they look to change their fortunes with a solid squad. Jules Kounde was preferred to play in the right back position in the recent La Liga game against Real Valladolid. With another option in Sergi Roberto, Hector Bellerin’s role is supposed to be that of a rotating player.
