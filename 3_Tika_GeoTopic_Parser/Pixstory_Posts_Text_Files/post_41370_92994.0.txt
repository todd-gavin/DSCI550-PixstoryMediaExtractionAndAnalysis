CNN reported Friday that Donald Trump Jr. texted White House top of staff Mark Meadows two days after the 2020 presidential election with plans to alter the outcome if Trump's father loses. 

According to CNN, the SMS was sent two days before Joe Biden was proclaimed the winner. It allegedly outlined techniques that then-President Donald Trump's team pursued in the months afterward as they spread false information about election fraud and encouraged state and federal officials to help.

US News reported that the cable news network reported that Trump Jr.'s text made “specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results.” It also suggested that if those measures didn't work, lawmakers in Congress could dismiss the electoral results and vote to keep President Trump in office.

Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas, in a statement Friday to CNN, said: “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”

CNN said the Trump Jr. text had been obtained by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. In the last week, the committee has interviewed former President Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Their virtual testimonies are the closest lawmakers have gotten to the former president.
