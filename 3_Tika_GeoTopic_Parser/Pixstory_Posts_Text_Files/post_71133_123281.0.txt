The Tash-t-nari, which has been used historically to wash hands before meals, consists of a sizable flask resembling a kettle that holds heated water and a basin that collects the water after washing hands. It is basically a transportable washstand.

In groups of four, guest are seated for a wazwan feast and share their meals from a huge copper platter known as the traem or trami. Each attendee receives a Tash-t-nari before the ceremony begins so they may perform the customary hand washing. Traditionally, hosts, close family members, and friends carried and handed the Tash-t-nari; today, attendants do so. Along with the attendants, the Waza or close family members serve the wazwan.

Traditionally, copper and handiwork are used to create tash-t-nari. It has beautiful hand engraving on it.
