Forgiveness involves " willfully putting aside feelings of resentment toward someone who has committed a wrong, been unfair or hurtful, or otherwise harmed you in some way. Forgiveness is not merely accepting what happened or ceasing to be angry."Instead, it involves a voluntary transformation of your feelings, attitudes, and behaviour so that you are no longer dominated by resentment and can express compassion, generosity, or the like toward the person who wronged you.
The act that hurt or offended you might always be with you, but forgiveness can lessen its grip on you and help free you from the control of the person who harmed you. Forgiveness can lead to feelings of understanding, empathy and compassion for the one who hurt you.
Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting or excusing the harm done to you or making up with the person who caused the damage. Forgiveness brings a kind of peace that helps you go on with life.
