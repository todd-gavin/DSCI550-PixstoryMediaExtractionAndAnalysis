Arsenal ground out a win today at Elland Road to remain top of the table This was a really tough game for the Gunners as Leeds high press caused problems which they dealt with well in the st half Passing through the press was going well and the Gunners capitalised after going ahead through Bukayo Saka Rodrygo s mistake led to Martin degaard putting it onto a plate for Saka to launch into the roof of the net off his weak foot Things looked good at half time Jesse Marsch then shifted Roca wider to help on the right side that was being used to good effect by Arsenal and the intensity went through the roof from Leeds Arsenal s back line was hounded and were forced into mistakes In the next couple of pieces on pixstory I ll review the pen decisions and discuss what my thoughts are Congrats to Leeds proper team out of points for Arsenal PSV next
