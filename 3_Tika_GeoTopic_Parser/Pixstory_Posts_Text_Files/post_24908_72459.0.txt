Carbon footprints, in layman's terms, means the amount of greenhouse gases released by a person in the environment. In the above example, a person is responsible for increasing the carbon content from the fuel used by him to reach the supermarket and the process undergone by the products which he buys from the market. Naturally, any material item requires manufacturing and is produced after a series of steps. This procedure causes release of several GHGs like methane, nitrous oxide in the surrounding. So, in the end, the person is accountable for being a reason to contribute to carbon creation, deviating from the path of aiding the planet and saving it from the perils of human interference. Thus, the term Carbon suffixed by the word, Footprints indicates the impact of a person's contribution in GHG formation in the world. This terminology gained a lot of traction when the movement of Save the Planet Earth took off. It became an important measure to quantify each individual's effect on the place which we inhabit.
