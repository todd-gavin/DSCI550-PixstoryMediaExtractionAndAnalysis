Abstract
Type 1 diabetes most commonly presents in adulthood, contrary to the widely held view that it is a disease of childhood. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes does not require insulin therapy at clinical onset. Recent studies have emphasised the evidence that adult-onset type 1 diabetes is prevalent but often misclassified initially as type 2 diabetes (1, 2). In this review, we discuss that recent literature, highlighting the similarities and differences between adult-onset and childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, exploring recent debates surrounding its epidemiology and genetics, as well as expanding on important issues of diagnostic criteria for individuals presenting with adult-onset diabetes and the subsequent management once identified as having an autoimmune basis. In addition, this review looks at the psychosocial challenges faced by T1D patients and their possible management.
