Joe Biden has ensured his full support to an exception to the senate filibuster to protect access to abortion Filibuster means the seat super majority needed for most legislation to pass the Senate without being blocked by any senator This is supposed to protect the rights of the minority According to Biden If the filibuster gets in the way it s like voting rights adding that there should be an exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the supreme court decision But many on the left charge Republicans and some centrist Democrats with using the rule more in the archaic Spanish derived sense of the word filibuster as pirates or raiders ransacking the political process for their purpose With the Senate split and controlled by the vote of the vice president Kamala Harris Democrats legislative options are hampered Biden is therefore under pressure to take executive action to protect abortion rights Although his options are few in Madrid he said he would meet governors on Friday to talk about the issue and would have announcements to make then Biden also repeated severe criticism of the decision to overturn Roe v Wade the ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion and reiterated his warning that other constitutional protections could be in danger from a supreme court leaned right by three justices appointed by Donald Trump One thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the supreme court of the United States in overruling not only Roe v Wade but essentially challenging the right to privacy Source The Guardian
