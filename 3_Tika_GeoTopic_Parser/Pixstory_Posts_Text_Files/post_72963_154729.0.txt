The Karate Kid is a classic because of Pat Morita's performance as Mr. Miyagi. The movie is a coming-of-age story hidden amidst the karate/fighting. Ralph Macchio's portrayal of a somewhat awkward teenager standing up to bullies is done well. Chances are you will relate to several problems Daniel faces over the course of the film.  The plotline which drives the movie is Daniel's conflict as a young teenager with Johnny and the local school bullies.
The movie is smart to gradually reveal information about Mr. Miyagi. This makes the movie shine instead of the fight sequences or other element you might expect from a film of this nature. Fight sequences are not great, but they are good enough. Also, there are occasional moments of poor acting, but nothing pervasive. That being said, The Karate Kid isn't perfect.  The friendship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi is absolutely the best thing in the film. 
That being said, The Karate Kid isn’t perfect. Even 9 or 10 year old me could recognize that some of the fight sequences look staged. You can tell that certain blows were not landing. But ultimately this doesn’t pull the film down. The fight sequences are not great, but they are good enough. And while the fights are important to the film The Karate Kid remains relevant today because of everything else. Also, there are occasional moments of poor acting, but nothing pervasive.
The Karate Kid is a movie that is still worth watching today even if you don’t feel any nostalgia for the film. the movie will capture the attention of boys today the same as it did earlier when it firstly released. That is an impressive feat. But the movie does so much so well that anyone can and should enjoy it regardless of age/gender.
