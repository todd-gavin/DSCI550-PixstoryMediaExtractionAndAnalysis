In a new interview with Vogue released on Tuesday, July 26, Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska provided her own passionate story of Ukraine's struggle against Russia. As her husband, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, continues to battle and lead the country, she spoke about the toll his absence has on the family. "He's having a considerably more difficult time in this area. He is in pain. "And then my kids do because they can't see each other," she said to Vogue.
While the first family has clearly faced difficulties throughout Ukraine's battle with Russia, Zelenskyy spoke about how his family attempts to lead. "My wife's presence here offers a good example for women and children." "I feel she performs a very important role for Ukraine, our families, and our women," he told the newspaper. "Like any average man, I've been worried sick about [my family's] safety." I didn't want to put them in risk... I've been dying to hug them. I've always longed to be able to reach out and touch them."
Zelenska's initial hesitation to emerge into the spotlight was also mentioned in the profile. As Ukraine's conflict with Russia continues, she has been an outspoken supporter of other nations giving help. She sent a statement at the start of the conflict documenting the many horrors taking place in her own country, including children sheltering in bomb shelters. She has urged people all across the world to speak out against Russia. "Don't be silent! Tell them that Putin is threatening to ignite a nuclear war, and that if he does, there would be no safe haven in the world," she said on social media.
More recently, Zelenska addressed the United States Congress to request that firearms be sent to , Ukraine so that Ukrainians may defend themselves, months after her husband did the same. She made an impassioned plea, saying that parents only want their children to be safe in the midst of the battle.
