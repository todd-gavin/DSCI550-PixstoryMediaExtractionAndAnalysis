The annual CFDA Fashion Awards, which take place on Nov. 7, will have a new presenting sponsor this year: Amazon Fashion. The awards ceremony will be held at Cipriani South Street at Casa Cipriani in Manhattan.
“We are particularly excited to be partnering with Amazon Fashion, a global retailer and innovative brand builder with a continuous focus on reinventing the shopping experience,” said Steven Kolb, chief executive of The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), in a statement.
This marks Amazon’s latest foray into the fashion industry after the retailer opened its first brick-and-mortar clothing store — Amazon Style — in Los Angeles in May.
