Inspite of having remarkable industrial and economic growth and while India produces enough food to feed its population, it is unable to provide access to food to a large number of people, disproportionately affecting women and children. India ranks 101st out of 116 countries in the 2021 Global Hunger Index. India has a score of 27.5, indicating a level of hunger that is serious as it has the largest population of undernourished people. Food wastage occurs as foods produced are lost due to inefficient supply chain management, at harvest and during post-harvest handling, during the distribution and consumption stages, due to excess production, the introduction of new products, labelling errors or due to shorter remaining shelf life.
