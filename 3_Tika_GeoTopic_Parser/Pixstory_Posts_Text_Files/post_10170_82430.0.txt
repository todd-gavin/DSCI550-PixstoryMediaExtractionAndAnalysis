Believe in yourself more than ever
 When you are at the peak of problems
 The easiest way is to give up and be sad
 But you are not here until financial poverty, the failure of love
 Illness, hot hot, deprive you of the joy of living.
 You are here to live with love
 You are here to learn
 You are here to fulfill your mission
 You're here to move forward
 So you have no right to surrender ...
 Make money if you live in poverty
 If you feel a lack of love, make love
 If the disease is bothering your body, make healthy cells
 If you have worries and stress, calm down and
 Do not forget that you are a creator, so create
 Look what powers you have
 If you follow the right path, you will achieve everything.
