Poetry… Every time the phrase is used, we all write something. None of us avoided writing in our younger years. There was a portfolio of our work ready to disgrace or edify us, whether that poetry was written at the direction of our teachers in school or motivated by hormone-fueled teenage angst. Poems are celebrated on Poetry Day. 

Poetry Day is all about celebrating the sublime craft of poetry. It's about accepting, appreciating, and even making poetry. It doesn't matter if you like to be the creative one or like to read poetry from well-known authors. This literary form is being honoured in every way. After all, you don't necessarily require a degree to be a poet!

So, this Poet’s day, awaken the poet in you!
