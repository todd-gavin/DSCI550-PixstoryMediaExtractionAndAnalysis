At its core, Stateless is a critique of Australia's tumultuous past with immigrants attempting to enter the country without permits. 

As per Collider, this limited series, co-created by Cate Blanchett, Tony Ayres, and Elise McCredle, is based on the experiences of Cornelia Rau, a former flight attendant whose 10-month confinement in an immigration detention centre prompted an investigation into Australia's mandatory detention regime. 

The plot follows Ameer , an Afghani asylum seeker, and three Australians: Clare , the immigration center's director; Cam, a centre guard; and the disturbed Sofie.

Blanchett plays Pat Masters, a singing-and-dancing con artist who is married to the equally shady Gordon, in the Sofie plot. The story isn't original, and it depends on tried-and-true prison movie tropes, but it's expertly delivered. 

Stateless is worth watching if you want to see a top-notch cast examine the human, real-life ramifications of a country's flawed immigration policy. It swings between satire and the occasional burst of humour in its depictions of bureaucracy at work.

I am sure you will love it!
