Didier Ollé-Nicolle's side won 2-1 at Bayern Munich in the first leg of the UEFA Women's Champions League quarter-finals. The Red and Blue go into the second leg next Wednesday in the lead.

A great show in a great theatre. For the first time in its history, Bayern Munich's stadium hosted a UEFA Women's Champions League match, and the Parisians lived up to expectations with a victory before returning to the Parc des Princes next week for the second leg of this European tie.

The first half saw the Parisians maintain a tight grip on their opponents, managing to thwart their attacks with Amanda Ilestedt defending flawlessly. At the other end of the pitch, a scramble in the German box from a corner allowed Marie Antoinette Katoto to pop up and put the ball under Leitzig's bar with her left foot (0-1, 21'). The club's all-time leading scorer scored her fourth goal of the season in European competition to put her side on track for the rest of the match.

There was bad news too in the first half, with Däbritz leaving the field prematurely after suffering a head injury before being replaced by Diallo.

In the second half, Munich bounced back but did not manage to equalise, thanks in particular to Votikova, who made a good save from a powerful left-footed shot from Bühl. The Parisian goalkeeper got down low and saved on her line with a strong left hand (67'). 

In the end, it was the Parisians who added to their lead, with Katoto heading in a corner in the middle of three German players and their goalkeeper (0-2, 71e).

Eventually, Bühl did find the net from a free-kick and reduced the deficit, despite another intervention from Votikova (1-2, 83'). 

The scoreline stayed the same, with Paris putting in an impressive performance to bring back a precious victory from Munich. The return match next week on Parisian soil promises to be a real spectacle in front of a big Red and Blue crowd.
