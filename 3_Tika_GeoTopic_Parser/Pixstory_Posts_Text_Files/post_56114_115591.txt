Sonnet by William Shakespeare Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were fill d with your most high deserts Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life and shows not half your parts If I could write the beauty of your eyes And in fresh numbers number all your graces The age to come would say This poet lies Such heavenly touches ne er touch d earthly faces So should my papers yellowed with their age Be scorn d like old men of less truth than tongue And your true rights be termed a poet s rage And stretched metre of an antique song But were some child of yours alive that time You should live twice in it and in my rhyme The poet asks who would understand his verse in the future in time to come if the youth s true excellence most high deserts were to fill his verse The poet s verse is insufficient heaven knows is either an exclamation or part of the sentence heaven knows that his verse is but a tomb with a hint of tome Shakespeare even goes as far as to say that the tomb hides half the youth s beauty Shakespeare argues that his descriptions are not strong enough and do not do justice to the man s beauty If I could write the beauty of your eyes Again if the poet could number all the youth s graces in fresh numbers then future times would accuse him of falsehood Future ages would say This poet lies Such heavenly touches ne er touched earthly faces Such heavenly touches were the divine touches traditionally bestowed by the Muses on the poet or they are the strokes of the brush or chisel of a divinely inspired hand which having touched an earthly face makes it perfect
