The matchday 10 of this season's premier league kicked off with Chelsea achieving a statement win over Wolves to register their 5th victory of this season in the PL so far. The wolves meanwhile slipped into greater troubles after today's loss as they now sit at the 18th position well inside the relegation zone with just 1 wins in 9 matches so far this season. The azpilicueta lead side with this commanding win currently sit at the fourth position with 16 points in 8 games. Graham Potter's men have now won three premier league games in a row. Several events that took place which happened in their recent game with wolves however will not properly be depicted merely by the scorecard.
The forwards of the blues were regularly creating chances one after the other only for each of them to be squandered by some player or the other. Despite attacking the Wolves' goal with crosses and good through balls on a number of occasions, the players couldn't just find the back of the net. However the regular attempts finally saw Chelsea draw first blood at the dying minutes of the first half when Kai Havertz headed in a fine cross from Mason Mount over the head of the keeper to put Chelsea ahead.
 It didn't take Chelsea much time to double there lead when Christian Pulisic found the goal after being wonderfully assisted by Mason Mount once again from a tough angle. Chelsea continued to dominate with the ball in the opposition's half of the play and created chances regularly. Although it seemed that Chelsea would now go for the kill with 2 goals in their bag already, it took them another 35 minutes to find their third goal of the match. 
Armando Broja smashed in his first goal for Chelsea after finding the far post with beautiful shot from fairly close range to make it 3-0 for Chelsea. The game ended in Chelsea's favour not to anyone's surprise. The Blues proved to be the superior side with more ball possession and shots attempted.
