Without best friends, life would be incomplete. They're the friends who can always be counted on to show up when you need them. In both good and bad times, those who love, laugh, support, and cherish you. 

Friendships are an unbreakable link that brings a diverse group of people together in beautiful ways. Best Friends Day is just one of the many ways you can show your appreciation for your amazing sidekick and show them how much you care. 
Take a moment right now to think about that one special person who is always there for you. 

As per DOY, Friendship may be celebrated at any time of year, but what better day to commemorate it than National Best Friends Day? Way back in 1935, the US congress decided to devote one day to pay tribute to close-knit friendships. Itâ€™s lighthearted, super fun, and down-right awesome day that should continue to be recognized and celebrated.

This day is the perfect opportunity to get together with your best friend, enjoy your favorite activity and appreciate them even more than you normally would.
