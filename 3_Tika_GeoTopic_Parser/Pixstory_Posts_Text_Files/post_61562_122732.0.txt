"Trust me I'm terrified of falling in love. I'd rather trust you with my heart and risk breaking it than live another day without you in my life.
I would be more than happy to protect your heart from the world because you make me want to be a little bit selfish."

Honestly one of the best books I've read in 2022! So good from the first page to the very last one. could not put it down until I was done and needed to know the ending. Rowan and Zahra are sooooooo cute! Definitely one of my favorite book couplesðŸ¤Œ
