Democrats in northern Arizona are up to something big. They are working to build the largest-ever Native Voting Rights Rally which is expected to be held on the Arizona portion of the Navajo Nation on Friday, May 27. Petitions for three progressive voter initiatives will be available for signing at all 66 Chapter Houses on May 27 at the Navajo Power Day of Action.

Arizona voters can expect three progressive issues on the November ballot — abolishing voter suppression, safeguarding people from predatory debt collection practices and ensuring that political contributions are published to their source. All three initiatives are on track to gather the 237,000 valid signatures they need to turn in by the July 7 deadline. But each is pushing hard to gain a significant margin of extra signatures. To avoid legal challenges, it is essential to show up with an overwhelming number of valid signatures.

The three ballot measures are:
The Arizona Fair Elections Act establishes automatic voter registration, enables stations up through election day, protects mail voting and makes sure that the election winner gets the state’s electoral votes. It also allows people to vote in any polling place in their county, counting ballots addressed by election day and providing many options to disabled voters and ensuring their participation.

The Predatory Debt Collection Protection Act protects more assets from being sold to pay off debt collectors, ensures hard-working Arizonans keep more of their bank accounts and wages and limits the horrible interest rates that trap families in an endless cycle of medical debt.

The Stop Dark Money initiative employs that political committees disclose the names of the individuals or corporations that earned the money the committee is spending.
