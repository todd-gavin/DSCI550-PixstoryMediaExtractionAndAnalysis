Scotland is to become the first country in the world to introduce a law to protect the right to free period products.

On Monday 15th of August, when the Period Products Act came into force, councils and education providers in Scotland will be legally required to ensure free sanitary products 
available to anyone who needs them!

This is a great step towards empowering health of all women and others who menstruate as well.
