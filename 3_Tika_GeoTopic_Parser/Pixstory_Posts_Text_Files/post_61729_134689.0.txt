Spirituality can stand alone but religion should be supported by Holy texts, customs, rituals, beliefs, etc, on the foundation of Spirituality.
When a person becomes spiritually inclined, it means that he has slowly started to detach himself from worldly things and trying to understand the real meaning of his life in the line of God.
While trying to understand the real meaning of his life in the line of God, that person may or may not be engaged in earning for his/his family's livelihood.
As he progresses in the spiritual line, he will be mentally detached from worldly things though he is discharging his duties as householder and is engaged in earning for his/his family's livelihood .
