Unfortunately FIFA has decided to suspend India from hosting any FIFA games until further notice This comes in light of the AIFF All India Football Federation being influenced by third party activities which is a serious violation of FIFA statutes The suspension includes hosting the FIFA U Women s World Cup in India which was supposed to be held from October However there s a glimmer of hope because the FIFA will lift the suspension once AIFF regains full control of its daily affairs However the U Women s World Cup cannot be held as currently planned
