You d think coming off the back of convincing wins Arsenal fans confidence would be at an all time high but this is United and even worse this is Old Trafford It might shock you to find out that Arsenal have actually only lost of their last games against them but on the flip side aside from a victory in with no fans in the stadium it s been a whole years since our last away victory On paper we have the better quality on the pitch and if we play our game we should really win this From an injury perspective only Partey and Elneny will be missing the game for us with Martial the main notable absence for United Zinchenko Odegaard and Ramsdale will go through late fitness tests it seems With the latter of those being our least replaceable in this team it is of huge importance that they are able to play today As for our lineup I would remain unchanged with our strongest team after Lokonga put up such an impressive display vs Villa There s only so much analysis that you can do for these sort of games as a fan but an area I feel that could define this game is the midfield it s important we don t let them overrun us without Partey in the lineup Another area in which United have thrived this season is on the counter attack however our defenders are well equipped to deal with any pace and power coming at them so as long as we remain compact in the midfield we should be okay As optimistic as I can be for a game like this I m going to predict a draw today which I think would be a good result for us in the circumstances We would remain points top with City and Spurs facing each other next week A win on the other hand would be massive today is a day that we can make a real statement to this league PixstoryArsenal Arsenal
