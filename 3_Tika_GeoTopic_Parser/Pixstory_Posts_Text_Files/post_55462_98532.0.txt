Year long trial finds volunteers who were told to eat only during the day lost about as much as weight as people dieting without time restrictions over 12 months span.

A popular dieting trend, intermittent fasting, may not offer much over traditional dieting for losing weight, according to a randomized trial published this week. The study found that people living in China were told to fast during the day lost as much as weight as people who were dieting over a year‘s time, but not significantly more than those were told to diet as usual. 

Intermittent fasting has emerged as a prominent style of dieting  in recent years, there are various methods of fasting but popular ones include eating very little food for two days a week then normally the rest of the week or only eating during the daytime hours.

 This new trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine ,The study involves 139 volunteers with a body mass index between 28 and 45 (BMI over 25 is considered overweight and a BMI over 30 is obese) they were randomized into two groups and were told to stick to fixed calories for the next year with 1500 to 1800 cal a day recommended for men and 1200 to 1500 cal a day for women but one group was instructed to only eat between 8 AM and 4 PM.

118 volunteers completed the trial fasting and lost an average of 8 kg from baseline compared to 6.3 kg loss by the controlled dieting group- a difference that was statistically significant.

 Indeed the results of a year-long clinical trial haven’t surprised many researchers who have argued for yours that limiting time instead of calories isn’t the magic formula for weight loss. Eating a balance and healthy diet especially with nourishing and  satisfying plant foods combined with animal proteins and exercise is a safest,  most effective way to lose weight.
