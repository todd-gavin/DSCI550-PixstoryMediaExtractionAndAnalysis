Bengaluru is close behind Beijing as one of the top tech hubs across the Asia-Pacific, followed by Chennai, Hyderabad, and Delhi is driven by talent and sustained demand for quality office spaces from domestic and multinational companies said a report by Cushman and Wakefield.
The country has added more than 500,000 jobs in IT over the past financial year, the study said.
Globally, 46 top tech markets were identified from more than 115 tech cities in total and six of the 14 cities in the Asia Pacific region were in India.
Bangalore also saw the tech sector accounting for an average 38%-40% share in annual leasing, higher than the national average of 35%, said the report. 
“The IT and tech-driven sectors remain the key driving force for the Indian economy,” said Anshul Jain, MD, India & South East Asia. “The strong market fundamentals coupled with key policy changes have not only made India a favourable investment hub for global IT players but also made it the most sought-after destination to find global tech talents and set footprints for further expansion.”
Hyderabad, home to Microsoft and Facebook, has more than 44 million square feet of office projects under construction nationally.
Another southern city, Chennai is the second largest software exporter and one of the largest data centre markets in India.
Experts say that the growth in tech leasing would continue.
“The demand has been stable so far. We expect to reach the 2019 commercial absorption level if the demand momentum is not hit by global financial turmoil,” said Mahesh Khaitan, Director of Sattva Group.
The international property consultant shows the Asia Pacific is home to 14 tech cities globally, based on the key evaluation metrics of talent, office real estate and business environment.
Large scale Grade A office projects in these locations along with a huge talent pool and affordable office rentals have attracted both national and global tech companies in these cities.’
