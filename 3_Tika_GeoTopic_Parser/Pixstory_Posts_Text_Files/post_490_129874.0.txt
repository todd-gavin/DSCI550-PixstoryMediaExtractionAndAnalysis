The traditional and famous kehwa can sometimes lit up your morning . 
Here is the recipe 

Kehwa for Two

Ingredients:

Water – 2 cups

Sugar- 2 to 3 tsp

1/2 tsp churned Kashmiri green tea leaves

Cinnamon powder or 2 inch cinnamon stick

Green Cardamom whole – 3

Almonds – 8 crushed.

Saffron – Few strands

Method 

Heat water in a pan.
Pound cardamom and cinnamon with the help of mortar pestle.
Once water starts boiling put sugar and pounded mixture and let it boil for a while.
Churn the tea leaves with the palm of your hands and throw in the pot. At this stage you may add few strands of saffron too.
Stir and let it brew for a while.
Crush the almonds and divide between two cups. Pour Kehwa into cups. Straining tea is optional.  I like to see boiled/crushed cardamom floating.
Your Kehwa is ready.
