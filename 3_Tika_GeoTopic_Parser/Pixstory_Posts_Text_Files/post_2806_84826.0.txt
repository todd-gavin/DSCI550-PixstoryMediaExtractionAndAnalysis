There is a mass exodus of multinational corporations from Russia. While some are pulling out totally others are suspending their business operations. According to Investment Monitor, around 760 leading MNCs have 2,225 subsidiaries in Russia. Over 220 are US-based companies, with 417 subsidiaries.

Many companies in Ukraine have been forced to close their operations. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/business/multinationals-halt-operations-in-ukraine-and-move-employees-to-safety.html)

Even the lucrative oil operations by multinationals have been affected. For instance, Shell has announced that it will exit all its Russian operations, including a major liquefied natural gas plant. British Petroleum has also announced that it will stop its operations and tie-up with Russian energy giants. The stalling may result in billions of dollars for both companies.

Some of the multinationals, like Toyota and Honda, have announced suspending export of vehicles. General Motors and Harley Davidson have announce similar measures. Apple has said that it will pause all product sales in Russia. A long list of companies have revealed action on similar lines.

The multinationals had few options with the U.S. and Europe blocking several Russian banks from the SWIFT payment network and sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia. With financial transactions stopped, it was next to impossible for Western banks and companies like MasterCard and Visa to operate in Russia. Experts say that various sanctions will start biting the Russian economy in a few months. But others also say that the Russian economy may not tank as it is relatively self-reliant in multiple areas.

Whether during Russiaâ€™s hostilities with Georgia or with Ukraine over Crimea, the multinational companies were not under pressure to leave Russia or stop dealing with it. For many years, Russia has been an attractive destination for multinationals because its population is the tenth-largest globally and 70% of its population lives in urban areas with a sizeable middle class.
