A video of a child dancing to a Rajasthani folk song is being circulated on social media with the claim it is of Inder Meghwal, a minor Dalit student who had allegedly succumbed to injuries inflicted upon him by his teacher for drinking water from a pot allegedly reserved for teachers from higher castes in Jalore, Rajasthan. It is also being claimed that the viral clip was recorded days before his death.

Twitter account Dalit Times tweeted the clip and wrote, “An old video of Indra Meghwal, a 9-year-old boy from Jalore, Rajasthan, dancing in the classroom is going viral.”

Users NeerajM95532018, AsianDigest, NagmaniEr, and HimanshuKadela were among many who tweeted the clip.

The viral clip has also been shared multiple times on Facebook.

Fact-Check
Several comments under the viral tweets suggested that the video was unrelated and that it did not feature Inder Meghwal. Some comments also suggested that the video in question was filmed in a government school in Taratara and not Jalore.

Upon a keyword search on Facebook, we found a post clarifying that the child seen in the video is a student of GUPS Gomrakh Dham, Taratara Math. The post also contained a screenshot of the video that was uploaded by a user named Tr Chela Ram Raika on July 30. The original upload had a caption in Hindi that read, “At the cultural program arranged on the occasion of No Bag Day on Saturday, Harish, a student of class two, confidently presented his dance recital.

The original uploader also re-shared the video in the context of the viral claims and clarified that the video was filmed at his school GUPS Gomrakh Dham. He requested users to not link this video with the Jalore incident.
