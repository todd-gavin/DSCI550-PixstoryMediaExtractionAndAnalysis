The Associated Press got details of the memorandum of understanding reached by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association on Thursday. 

In the absence of an agreement on an international amateur draught, the MLB and MLBPA have agreed to discontinue direct amateur draft-pick compensation, which has been in place for qualified free agents since 2012. 

U.S News reported that a team that loses a free agent will be compensated with a draught pick based on revenue-sharing status and if the team was above the luxury tax level. There would be four pay tiers for a free agent who had spent the complete season with one team:

- Guaranteed salary of $25 million or average annual value (AAV) of $18 million (third round pick for revenue sharing payee) 

— AAV of $55 million or $23 million (Comp B pick for revenue sharing payee, third round for non-payee or team that did not pay luxury tax) 

— AAV of $100 million or $30 million (Comp A pick for revenue sharing payee, Comp B pick for non-payee or team that did not pay luxury tax, third round pick for team paying revenue sharing) 

— AAV of $150 million or $40 million (Comp A pick and third round pick for revenue sharing payee, Comp A pick for non-payee or team that did not pay luxury tax, Comp B pick for team paying revenue sharing)
