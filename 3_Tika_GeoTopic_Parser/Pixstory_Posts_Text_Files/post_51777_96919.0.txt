Emily Dickinson is one of America’s greatest and most original poets of all time, but what I guess y'all won't know js how she used to express her all emotions in words and believed her words as her weapon to fight the external troubles.

I love how she created in her writing a distinctively elliptical language for expressing what was possible but not yet realized.

 “If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can warm me I know that is poetry. If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry. These are the only way I know it. Is there any other way?”
