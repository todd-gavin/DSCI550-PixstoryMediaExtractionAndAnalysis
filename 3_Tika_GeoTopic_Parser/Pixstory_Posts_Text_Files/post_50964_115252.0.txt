Often times, we catch ourselves trying to please our partner more than loving them. We tend to forget that a relationship is supposed to help us become a better person and not overshadow our personality. We agree that making compromises is essential to make a relationship work, but your relationship itself shouldn’t be a compromise.

Let’s take a look at the signature things that you should never sacrifice for your partner or your relationship.

1. Your Other Relationships
Just the two of you can complete a relationship for sure, but you two alone aren’t enough for a happy social life. Your other relationships matter too. 

2. Your Dreams And Your Career Goals
Never stop yourself from dreaming. Chasing a dream is what keeps you on your toes in life; it makes your life worth living.

3. Your Personality
changing your personality is like changing the core part of your soul. Never budge when your partner asks you to become someone else. 

4.Your Fun Together
Every relationship has its share of ups and downs. There are times of distress, but there are times of fun too. The trick is to discover common interests with your partner and engage in activities that seem to be fun for both of you . Don’t compromise on the fun part in a relationship.

5. Your Beliefs
Beliefs and ideologies are something that makes a man what he is. What you could do is refrain from having a discussion about it with your partner. This will ensure peace in both of your heads.

6. Your happiness
Never jeopardize your happiness for another. Also, never ask your partner to do things that make them unhappy. Find a middle road that leads to a happy place you both can dwell in.
