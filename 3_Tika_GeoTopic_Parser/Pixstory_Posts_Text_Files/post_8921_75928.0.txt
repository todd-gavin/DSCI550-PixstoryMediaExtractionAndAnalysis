If love was a mystery 
How can you be just a memory?
While I'm living my life in misery 
And all I have you is in my history.

I lay here naked and cold,
Unaware of time-place and covered in mold,
While I hope not to trespass yet i trod,
And you from my past call out my name and nodd! 

"Clare and Henry," I trace the names on the stone wall,
Hemming and hawing, fiddling my memories from the last fall,
A frozen glare mocks my heart 
I wonder," was that you or just an art?"

The ebony lobby of the libraries,
Laden with books about million fairies,
Now that I know not, if you are a memory or a dream,
I pledge to ride the tides of love with enchanted heroic gleam.

Now that I have you in my history, 
I live all my life in misery,
I know you can't be just a memory!
I know it when love is no mystery!
