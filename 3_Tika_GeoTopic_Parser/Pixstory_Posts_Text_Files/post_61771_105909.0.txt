After being decimated by the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of the NBA Finals, the Boston Celtics will look to bounce back in Game 3 on Wednesday night.

1. Limit turnovers
When they take care of the ball, they win. When they don't take care of the ball, they don't win. They're 12-2 (including seven straight wins) when they turn the ball over fewer than 15 times. For example, they only had 12 turnovers in Game 1 against Golden State, and were able to walk away with a win.
  

2. Perform better in the third quarter 

The third quarter has not been kind to the Celtics so far this series. In Game 1, they were outscored 38-24 in the third, even though they were ultimately able to pull out a win behind an incredible fourth-quarter performance. In Game 2, they were outscored 35-14 in the third quarter. In total, they've been outscored by 35 points (73-38) in the two third quarters combined.

The Warriors are a notoriously dangerous third-quarter team, but Boston simply needs to be better in that frame. This issue isn't limited to just this series, after all. The Celtics have been outscored by at least 14 points four times in the third quarter in these playoffs, including in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat. They were outscored by 25 points in the third quarter of that game.
