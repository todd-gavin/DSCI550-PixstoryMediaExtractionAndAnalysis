Imagine from the beginning of human civilization, if we never had mountains or valleys (where the earliest humans existed) as a shelter, the fresh air to breathe, serene water to quench our thirst, fire to warm us through chilling winters, how we would've sustained and made it to the 21st century??

Environment me live in is truly a blessing❤️❤️
