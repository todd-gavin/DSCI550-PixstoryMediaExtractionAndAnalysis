Divock Origi

After the departures of Lallana and Lovren in 2020, Origi is the lone survivor of the nine players
that joined Liverpool in 2014.

The striker arrived to Anfield as a promising youngster, but his time there was cut short after
catastrophic loan experiences at Lille and Wolfsburg. Since then, he's become a cult hero in
Liverpool, scoring spectacular goals against Everton, Barcelona, and then Tottenham in the
2019 Champions League final.

Alberto Moreno

Moreno was signed for £12 million from Sevilla and was regarded as one of Spain's most
promising left-backs. He scored his first goal for Liverpool against Tottenham with a fantastic
solo effort.

Despite his striking abilities, he struggled defensively and made a number of high-profile
mistakes throughout his five years with the club.

After falling behind Andy Robertson in the pecking order, the 28-year-old joined Villarreal when
his Liverpool contract expired in 2019. In the 2021 Europa League final, he played for the Yellow
Submarine, who defeated Liverpool's arch-rivals Manchester United.

Mario Balotelli

After missing out on Alexis Sanchez, Liverpool took a chance and paid £16 million to get
Balotelli from AC Milan. Before joining Nice on a free transfer, he scored four goals in 28
appearances in all competitions, therefore it wasn't a gamble worth taking.

He returned to Italy with hometown club Brescia after three years in France, enjoyed a brief
period in Serie B alongside Kevin-Prince Boateng for Silvio Berlusconi's Monza, and is presently
playing in the Turkish Super Lig for Adana Demirspor.

Javier Manquillo

Manquillo joined Liverpool on a two-year loan from Atletico Madrid, but his contract was
cancelled in 2015 after only 10 Premier League games.

He was then loaned out to Marseille and Sunderland before joining Newcastle United on a
permanent basis in 2017. The right-back, now in his fifth season with the Magpies, has battled
to find a regular place in the starting lineup.
