This is a poem I wrote in Malayalam two years ago in Malayalam Attempted a translation in English But I swear the original is much better probably one of my best This is the first time Iam trying my hands on translation Please forgive any mistakes The poem is about how a person gets attached to memories through material aspects Here the protagonist remembers his her their lost love which is somehow associated with rain Rain at some points merge in to the lover To all the Pluviophiles out there Lullaby of rain Locking eyes drowning in to sleep near my window I opened my eyes in to rhythm of your drops your petrichor makes my senses go wild when your cadence fire my desire are your finger tips a reminder of a long lost song of an erratic night I remember Standing with a drenched body and heart on the rain savoring the sweetness of your lips Our laughter echoing in the clouds Tried broken my mourn melted in to the rain pondering now You are in me as a whimper a lullaby But still why did you caressed away my seasons By Varsha MA
