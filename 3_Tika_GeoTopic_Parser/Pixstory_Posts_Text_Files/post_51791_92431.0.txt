Is it okay for me to feel an empty space for not being able to attend online classes anymore?ðŸ¥² 
 
Well- I do enjoy being able to attend offline classes and it has been fun but at the end i do miss online classes 

Like how i used to attend classes from the comfort of my house 
How i used to enter sometimes late in class 
How i used to have convience

But now it's all changed

But ig change is the only constant, right?ðŸ¥²
