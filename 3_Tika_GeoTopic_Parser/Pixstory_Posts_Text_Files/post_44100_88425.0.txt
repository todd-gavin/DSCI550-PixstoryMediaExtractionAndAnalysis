For the El Clasico, Barcelona will be without Sergino Dest, Ansu Fati, Sergi Roberto, Samuel Umtiti, and Alejandro Balde.

Karim Benzema, Real Madrid's ace striker, will miss Sunday's crucial El Clasico match against Barcelona.

The 34-year-old Frenchman has been ruled out after suffering a calf injury during the 3-0 win over Mallorca in the second half.

The injury, according to Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, comes at a favourable time for the squad because Benzema will be able to recover during the international break and be fit for the remainder of the season.

"I think this injury [for Benzema] comes at a good moment, since we now have the two weeks of the international break for him to recover," Ancelotti said. "He'll be back stronger for the rest of the campaign."

"Bale is an alternative to Benzema, as is Mariano, Jovic, Isco and Rodrygo," Ancelotti said ahead of the game, "There are a lot of options but I will choose the one I think is best for this match."
