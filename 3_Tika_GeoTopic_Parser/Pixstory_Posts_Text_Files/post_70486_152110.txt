Kharge has grown up into national level not as a nominee of anyone He started his association with Congress in his student days became student leader then as a labour union leader and then into mainstream politics in different capacities with various responsibilities of organisation and as legislator and minister He is known for various initiatives such as land reforms as minister in the state He led KPCC during turbulent times of party in the state where there were so many senior leaders and fighting each other for power He doesn t need nomination of any family but organisation trusted his capabilities and he delivered He is the natural choice as the candidate considering his rich political experience and strong relationships with various leaders And the same family has taken initiative for the election and decision is well appreciated since people like you are also commenting on congress election but can t utter a word in the affairs of RSS and BJP You can t ask why RSS shouldn t have a non vaishanavite Brahmin as sarsangchalak And how jp nadda became BJP president Congress is a family and all leaders are well connected Tharoor was given a go ahead for his candidature much same to Kharge In any election there should be more than one candidate and here we have two politicians representing two different generations and background It is nice to see public like you is also sharing feedback
