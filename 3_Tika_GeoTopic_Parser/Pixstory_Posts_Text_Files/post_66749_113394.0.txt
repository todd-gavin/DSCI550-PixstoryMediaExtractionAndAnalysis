A new study has found that rocket launches into space by commercial companies like Space X, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin can negatively impact the climate and ozone layer. It also pointed out that routine launches “may undermine progress made by the Montreal Protocol in reversing ozone depletion.”

The study was published by researchers from University College London (UCL), the University of Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the journal ‘Earth’s Future’ on June 9, 2022. It pointed out that soot emissions that come from the rocket launches are more capable of warming the atmosphere than other sources.

This comes off on the heels of billionaires trying to one up each other by travelling to space in their blood money contest. 

While it hurts everyone else in the world, with little to no care for the common folk.
