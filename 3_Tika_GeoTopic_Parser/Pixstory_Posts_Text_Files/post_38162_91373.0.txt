As per the Mirror, Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted that he is "partly responsible" for their biggest rivals' recent success. Hence this would certainly not be an easy pill to swallow for the United fans.  

Sir Alex Ferguson was and even is a villain in the eyes of most Liverpool fans even now. But as per a recent interview with a news agency, the former United manager talked about how he indirectly may have asked Jurgen Klopp to pick Liverpool. 

The former Manchester United manager said, "Klopp met me in Switzerland and asked me for advice on a move to England. I said 'pick your best team, pick a team with expectation'."

The former Borussia Dortmund manager did just that. Jurgen Klopp signed for Liverpool in 2015. Since then he has brought the struggling Merseyside club back to the pinnacle of English football. 

Liverpool were certainly having "expectations" from Jurgen Klopp after failing to win a major trophy for years. But the German manager certainly seems to have fulfilled the expectations of the Kop. 

Sir Alex Ferguson also stated in the interview that he believed Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp are the best managers in the world currently. His statement is backed by Liverpool and Manchester City's performances in recent seasons. 





Jurgen Klopp's legacy with Liverpool…

Since joining the Reds, Jurgen Klopp has raised the level of the club by making proper signings and having a superior game plan. Owing to this, his spell at Liverpool has been very fruitful. 

"The Normal One" as he referred to himself on day 1, has won the Champions League, Premier League, Club World Cup, and other trophies during his Liverpool tenure. To add to this, the Reds could go on to possibly win a quadruple if they hold their nerves in the 2021/22 season.
