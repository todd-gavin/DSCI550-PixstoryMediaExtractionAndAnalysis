The Supreme court has proven that they would rather protect the intentions of the corporates than the environment and people on the earth.

In remarks to the first Earth Day gathering in 1970, Maine senator Edmund Muskie made the case for the Clean Air Act – a bill he helped draft – in stark terms. “There is no space command center, ready to give us precise instruction and alternate solutions for survival on our spaceship Earth,” he told the crowd.

“Our nation – and our world – hang together by tenuous bonds which are strained as they have never been strained before – and as they must never be strained again. We cannot survive an undeclared war on our future.”

In its Thursday ruling on West Virginia v EPA – the US supreme court all but proclaimed that war, reducing the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to govern power plants under a requirement of the Clean Air Act – striking a blow to the government’s ability to do its job! 

West Virginia v EPA itself was brought with the help of the Republican Attorneys General Association, a network of state attorneys general whose own funders encompass of country’s biggest fossil fuel companies! 

They also spent $150,000 sponsoring Trump’s rally on 6 January. More than people living on the earth the Supreme Court priorities on the wealthy majority and their selfish needs-proving this day by day!
