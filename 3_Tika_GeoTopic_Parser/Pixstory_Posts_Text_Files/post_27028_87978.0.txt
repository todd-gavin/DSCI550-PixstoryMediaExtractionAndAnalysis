What makes Holi… Holi. 

Holi is the festival of colours, our life is full of colours. While as a literature student I have understood about massive terms of existentialism and realism but the reality of life is in its colours, colours that set you free. 

Coming clean with you, I do not personally like Holi. This festival over the past few years has become a means for misbehaviour of people, and with certain bad experiences, I stopped playing and celebrating this festival. This year was different though, I finally got the nerve to agree for a Holi party. A party which i was terrified to go to. 

But, the experience will stay with me forever as one of the best days ever. In the company of right people, who respect each other and each other’s privacy and rights, this festival is nothing but fun. If someone said no to colours, it was heard and complied… they were handled with water. 

Holi, for me is not about getting high and dancing to Balam Pichkari for the “Nth” time. It is about coming together, putting all our love in that one pinch of Gulaal we caress the face of our loved ones with. 

My hope for Holi is to be nothing but respectful and in it’s boundaries, anything is bad in this world if it crosses its boundaries, but within its restraints, Holi is one of the most auspicious festival that makes us unite.
