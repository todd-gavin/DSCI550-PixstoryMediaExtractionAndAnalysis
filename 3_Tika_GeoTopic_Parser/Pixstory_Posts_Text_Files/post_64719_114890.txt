The film s title A clockwork orange refers to the absence of free will something organic made to work mechanically This is a metaphor for Alex a human being who is psychologically conditioned until he becomes an automaton Alex is robbed of choice every time he s turned into a tool for someone else s agenda The Lenscrafters technique reduces him to a political asset by shady government bigwigs The writer and his dissident friends seek to use him as a pawn to promote their criticism of said large wigs Then the government turns around and bribes him in an attempt to undo all the damage they caused in the first place What a tool The cyclical nature of clockwork is woven into the narrative itself by some sort of celluloid spider The film is essentially split in half everyone Alex harms in the beginning the drunk his old gang the writer returns to exact revenge after his so called rehabilitation But despite all these coincidences Alex doesn t learn from his misdeeds There is no real progress made by the end of the film Humans were stuck in a constant cycle between good evil freedom oppression like clockwork Throughout the film classical music plays during violent acts almost as if it doesn t care Furthermore several works of art are perverted by graphic imagery Perhaps this high low switcheroo serves as an indication that culture is no guarantee of moral elevation Or perhaps it s something much more sinister that violence can be an act of creation Indeed Alex sees himself as something of an artist or performer Thanks to his showmanship he is the only character that approaches relatability in the entire film despite his horrendous acts The fast motion of Alex s menage suggests that the sexual act is not erotic but more of a snooty performance art piece Alex s violence toward his lackeys unfurls in slow motion giving it a kind of balletic quality The final shot of Alex in the snow once again utilizes slow motion indicating a return to his previous violent snow angel making self Was his entire journey all for naught
