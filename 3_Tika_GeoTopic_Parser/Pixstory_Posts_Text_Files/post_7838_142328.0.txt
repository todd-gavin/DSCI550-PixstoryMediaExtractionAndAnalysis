Succession won the Emmy for The Best Drama Series. The third season was just phenomenal and left us in awe, in terms of the writing, the direction and of course the acting. Everyone was up for the job and delivered peak television. Some people though are surprised that Better Call Saul didn't win the award for its last season.
