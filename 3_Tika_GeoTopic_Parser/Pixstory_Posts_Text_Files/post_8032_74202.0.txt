Head of the Chamber of Mines and Industries of Afghanistan Sherbaz Kaminzada said that factories in the country which are on the brink of collapse will completely close if the assets of Afghanistan do not get unfrozen.

He warned that lack of cash and the restrictions on the banking system that has made complex procurement of raw material will leave 1.5 million people out of jobs, over 500,000 of them women.

Sherbaz Kaminzada expressed the remarks in his meeting with the UN Secretary-General’s special representative to Afghanistan Deborah Lyons on the sideline of the Economic Conference in Kabul on Wednesday, January 19, 2022.

Kaminzada said that Afghanistan had an unreal and fragile economy during the past twenty years and asked the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and the International Community to cooperate with Afghan industrialists to grow the economy.

“Hundreds of factories in Afghanistan do not have the raw material that has directly affected the workers, investors, and common people.” Said Kaminzada.
The particular representative assured Afghan industrialists to raise their voice and return from the UN headquarter with positive outcomes.
