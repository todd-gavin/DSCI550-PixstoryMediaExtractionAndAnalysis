Arsenal vs Tottenham, the predicted lineup!GK: Aaron Ramsdale- This is the easiest choice of all. RB: Ben White- Tomiyasu is fully fit & has been for while. But the fact he’s not started a single league just shows good Ben White has been. RCB: William Saliba- Another no brainer. Ball playing excellence & so important to our buildup. A battle vs Harry Kane should be a good one. LCB: Gabriel Magalhães- He’s had a few shaky moments but his left foot gives Arsenal a different passing angle building up. He’s also stepped up before in a NLD. LB: Kieran Tierney- The hardest call of all. Arsenal truly have 2 top left backs. But with the attacking threat of Spurs & Tierney being the better defender, he gets the edge over Zinchenko. CDM: Thomas Partey- Looks like he’ll be available & his impact in our last game vs Brentford was massive. Arsenal’s ability to control transitions was showcased & that will be even more important vs Spurs. LCM: Granit Xhaka- He’s making this spot his own & evolving game by game. Xhaka alongside Partey gives Arsenal the perfect balance in midfield. RCM: Martin Ødegaard- Fabio Vieira was good against Brentford. But this is a game where you need leaders. With Ødegaard being our club captain, Arteta will through him back in. LW: Gabriel Martinelli- 3 goals already & should have a few assists too. His selection on left side is very easy. RW: Bukayo Saka- 2nd most assist in the league this season & he knows how to score in a NLD. Another no brainer. ST: Gabriel Jesus- 7 goals & assists in 7 appearances. He’s been a revelation. He’ll be up against a top CB in Romero though. Big battle for a big player.
