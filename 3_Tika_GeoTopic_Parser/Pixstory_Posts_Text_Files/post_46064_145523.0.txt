Tomorrow there will be no school, McDonald's, or cinemas since Britain will be closed for Queen Elizabeth's burial. As Mint reported, the funeral has been designated a public holiday by the government, and it is expected to draw more people than other significant occasions in recent British history, such as the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, the London Olympics in 2012, or royal weddings. The decision to shut down a large portion of the economy on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral has prompted criticism, internet mocking, and, in some cases, widespread bewilderment despite the mournful atmosphere in Britain following her passing. Although businesses were "encouraged to respond respectfully" to requests from their personnel to have the time off, employers were still given the choice of whether or not to stay open while schools were closed.
