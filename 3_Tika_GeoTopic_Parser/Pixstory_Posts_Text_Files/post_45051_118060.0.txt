Mostafa Mohamed, a player for Egypt, has finalised his transfer from Galatasaray to FC Nantes
for an unknown sum. In January 2020, Mohamed transferred from Cairo powerhouse Zamalek
to Galatasaray on an 18-month loan contract.

The 24-year-contract old's also had a provision that gave the Turkish team the option to purchase him for $4 million when it expired.

Mohamed's contract's buy option was exercised by Galatasaray last December after the forward
scored nine goals in 17 appearances across all competitions during his rookie season. The forward then signed a three-year contract that lasts until the summer of 2025.

But Mostafa struggled in his second season in Turkey, scoring just eight goals in 41 games as
Galatasaray stumbled to a 13th-place league finish.

Even though he had a bad season, Mostafa still managed to draw interest from all across Europe and came extremely close to signing with Girondins de Bordeaux last summer and
Saint-Etienne in January 2021.

Ligue 1 newcomers Toulouse and Olympique Lyonnais were also interested parties in signing
Mohamed, with Spanish club Cadiz being the most recent to be mentioned in connection with
the former Zamalek forward.

However, FC Nantes was able to secure his signature for €250,000 for a summer loan with the
option for the French club to make the deal permanent for €5 million. The athlete flew to France
on Tuesday, had his physical exams on Wednesday, and then signed contracts with his new
team.

Nantes won the Coupe de France by defeating Nice in the championship match, which earned
them a spot in the UEFA Europa League.

Mostafa will now play with players like Ludovic Blas,
Moses Simon, Moussa Sissoko, Pedro Chirivella, and goalkeeper Alban Lafont and train with
French manager Antoine Kombouaré.
