Clare Daly: Representative of Ireland to the European Parliament
Statement by Clare Daly, Ireland's representative to the European Parliament, on the situation of Afghan refugees

Since our last summit, tens of thousands of Afghan citizens have been forced to flee their country in search of food and security. 5 million children were at risk of famine. We saw a 500 percent increase in child marriage rates and children were sold in the hope that they would survive, and neither here nor anywhere else would anyone talk about them or report on them. TV coverage is all-encompassing, and there is no news of immediate humanitarian aid, no special meeting for them, not even a mention of them. There is no delegation from Afghanistan here, not even a statement, my God.
They must be wondering how their human crisis becomes so insignificant, is it related to the color of their skin? Or are they not white and European? Or did their problem stem from American weapons and the US invasion of the country, or was the decision to plunder their assets made by an authoritarian American president? Not by a Russian president,
Because, my God, there are all wars of calamity and all the victims need support, and as long as we do not reach such a point, we have no credit.
