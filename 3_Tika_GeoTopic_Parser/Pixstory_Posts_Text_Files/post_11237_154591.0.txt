Since childhood, girls and boys have been taught about how they should behave in public settings and how their body language should be. While, on the one hand, boys are often told that they should not cry, girls are often conceived to be sensitive, emotional and weak.
Moreover, in Asian countries, girls and women in the families are not allowed to express their opinions and voice for change.
