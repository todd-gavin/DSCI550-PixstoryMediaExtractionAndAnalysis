This is the meal equally set this the meat for natural hunger It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous I make appointments with all I will not have a single person slighted or left away The kept woman sponger thief are hereby invited The heavy lipp d slave is invited the venerealee is invited There shall be no difference between them and the rest This is the press of a bashful hand this the float and odor of hair This the touch of my lips to yours this the murmur of yearning This the far off depth and height reflecting my own face This the thoughtful merge of myself and the outlet again Do you guess I have some intricate purpose Well I have for the Fourth month showers have and the mica on the side of a rock has Do you take it I would astonish Does the daylight astonish does the early redstart twittering through the woods Do I astonish more than they This hour I tell things in confidence I might not tell everybody but I will tell you Walt Whitman
