Harry Styles has canceled his concert stop in Copenhagen on Sunday night following a shooting at a busy mall near the venue. Styles was set to perform at the Royal Arena at 8 p.m. local time as part of the European leg of his Love On Tour.

Danish police confirm three people are dead and three others were critically injured, according to the Associated Press.

“I’m heartbroken along with the people of Copenhagen. I adore this city. The people are so warm and full of love. I’m devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting,” Styles posted on Twitter following the tragic events. “I’m sorry we couldn’t be together. Please look after each other. H” said a tweet made by Harry Styles

According to the AP, a 22-year-old Danish man, who is suspected to be the shooter, was arrested approximately 11 minutes after the shooting and is believed to have worked alone. An investigation continues into the tragic incident; police inspector Søren Thomassen says it’s too early to speculate on a motive.
