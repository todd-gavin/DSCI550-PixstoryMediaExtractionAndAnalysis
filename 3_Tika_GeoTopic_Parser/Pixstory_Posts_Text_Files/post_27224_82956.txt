What you see in the photo is an image of the Alpe di Siusi at sunset It&#39;s not even thought of much because it was taken from a moving chairlift But you don&#39;t need too many precautions because the beauty of this place is magical It is a Dolomite plateau within the territory of the municipality of Castelrotto practically above Ortisei km of slopes km of sunny cross-country trails km of perfectly groomed winter hiking trails km of marked snowshoe trails and a breathtaking view of the spectacular panorama of the Dolomites UNESCO World Heritage with Sciliar Sassolungo Sassopiatto and Catinaccio E then cross-country skiing but also horse-drawn carriage rides, sledging or relaxing in one of the wonderful huts that offer South Tyrolean culinary delights I have also been there in the summer and I have toured both on foot around the Sassolungo and by e-bike There let&#39;s meet again if you want in a few posts for some good ideas on the next holidays
