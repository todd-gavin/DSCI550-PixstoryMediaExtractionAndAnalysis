UEFA has abandoned its contentious leapfrogging proposal for Champions League qualification but will still award one or two spots based on a co efficient ranking The governing body of European football is finalising reforms to the Champions League which will grow from to clubs for the season A controversial leapfrogging concept in which teams that had performed well in previous European seasons were given a berth if they failed to qualify through their domestic result was one of the proposals If in possession of a stronger co efficient estimated by performances in Europe over the previous five seasons the team placing sixth or seventh in the Premier League for example might have qualified for the Champions League at the expense of the fifth placed team According to the Times UEFA has abandoned those measures which sparked outrage from numerous quarters in the notion that the proposals would protect Europe s wealthiest clubs In terms of co efficient UEFA is still proposing two slots in the competition for highly placed sides but teams will not be able to jump ahead of domestic rivals The remaining two spots are anticipated to go to Ligue which currently has two automatic qualifiers and the league winner with the highest ranking from a country that does not have an automatic qualifier In May the final decision on the adjustments will be made
