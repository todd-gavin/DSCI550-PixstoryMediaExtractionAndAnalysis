Just watched the draw of the UEFA Champions League and now the path to the final is clear for all the teams. Now, all the teams know who they will face in the quarterfinals and if they win,  which team they will face in the semifinals and final respectively. 

So let’s talk about the quarterfinal matches that the fans are vouching for:- 

1. Real Madrid vs Chelsea 

It’s a revenge time?? Both teams met in last year's UCL semifinals where Chelsea thrashed Real Madrid in both legs. Real Madrid’s form is on the top level right now and on the other hand, Chelsea’s manager Thomas Tuchel know how to beat Real Madrid. So let’s see who will win the match. 

2 Liverpool vs Benfica 

Easy tie for Liverpool? I don’t think so because in the knockout rounds even small teams shows courage to churn out the results from nowhere. I think we will see either a very one-sided match from Liverpool or Benfica will upset Liverpool. 

3. Manchester City vs Atletico Madrid 

This match will be the most cagey game because Manchester City believes in attack and on the other Atletico Madrid is a defensive team. One team loves to have a ball and the other one don’t want to have a possession in a game. Let’s hope for another crackerjack performance. 

4. Villarreal vs Bayern Munich 

This match will be the fight of mentalities of the two managers of the teams. On one side we have Unai Emery (manager of Villarreal)  who believes in counter-attack and on the other hand, Julian Nagelsmann (manager of Bayern Munich) believes in possession-based football and wants to score a goal as soon as possible. 

So let’s hope for some firecrackers from these matches and hope the best team wins the match as well as the tournament.
