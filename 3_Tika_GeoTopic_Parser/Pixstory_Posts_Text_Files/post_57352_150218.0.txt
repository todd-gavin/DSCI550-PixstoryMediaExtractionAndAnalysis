Life is so unfair for the ones who eat little and gain too much of weight but lucky are the ones who really remain the same!!
I mean why and how?
Though these people say they have fast metabolism but that's not all, there are genetic, nutritional and even behavioral factors involved.
But whatever it is life is easier for these people!
