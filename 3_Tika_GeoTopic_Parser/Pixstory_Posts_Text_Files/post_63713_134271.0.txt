This week at Gamespot Opening Night Live, Lies of P stole the show with its gameplay. This unusual but much welcomed merge of gothic horror and Pinocchio sees yet another Souls influenced game where Pinocchio meets Bloodborne in every single way, though with just enough twists to give the game its own identity. IGN recently posted a 12 minute gameplay video of ‘Lies of P’ and the more you look at it, the Souls influence is undeniable, it even borders on replication.
The animation and UI(User Interface) are very Bloodborne-esque with distinct bars for health and stamina, and a weapon and item menu in the lower left corner. Even the damage numbers, status effect meters, lantern-like checkpoints and general look are all very much Bloodborne-inspired.
Another mechanic the game shares with Bloodborne is that it allows players to regain lost health immediately after getting hit, though they have to immediately appear to block or parry the attack. Bloodborne had a similar system that allowed players to get back some of their lost health if they managed to land a hit on an enemy quickly after getting hit themselves.
The off-hand tools are the more interesting aspect seen in the video. These attach to the character's left arm, and range from grappling hook-style ropes to a cannon that sends out an electric shock. There looks to be a decent enemy variety in the demo, and the player even runs into a boss and a mini-boss along the way.
The game also includes a Victorian era gothic design similar to Yahrnam with scenes, strategic dialogue choices, and a varied arsenal of weapons for Pinocchio, which includes melee items, an arm cannon, and some cool elemental/magical powers. Though the game was being showcased as part of Xbox’s lineup, Lies of P will not be an Xbox exclusive and as such Lies of P is set to release in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.
