Looking all the information available on the abortion laws, their history and the overturning of Roe Vs Wade, it can be very overwhelming to process what is happening around us. But, as always, books are here for our rescue!

1. The New Handbook for a Post-Roe America. Robin Marty is a leading writer and advocate who has spent a decade reporting on abortion in the U.S., and the practical support her book offers is unmatched. This resource guide covers the likely state-by-state legal landscape if Roe is overturned, how to prevent a pregnancy, how to self-manage your own abortion, direct actions you can take to support access to care, and much more.

2. The Turnaway Sturdy
Diana Greene Foster and a team of scientists — physicians, psychologists, and economists, among others — conducted a pioneering ten-year study that was the first data-driven examination of the negative impact patients experience when they are denied an abortion. The Turnaway Study also thoroughly debunks many long-held anti-abortion myths, including that the procedure harms patients. Alongside Foster’s findings, the book includes powerful first-person narratives from people who had abortions and those who were denied them.
