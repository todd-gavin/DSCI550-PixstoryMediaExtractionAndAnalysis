‌Irony puts up a seat again when he once being said that Vedas be burned went to Veda Patashala and shared his experiences with the students. He advised them to learn Vedas and also English so that the students should become Vivekananda.

“Everybody who loves nature is a devotee of the god,” he said. Composed dialogues like his songs ( great attempt).

‌Although he said in an interview in Hindustan times : "No, this is not exactly a transformation. A true Marxist respects the spiritual democracy of the people. Religious faith certainly provides temporary relief to the people when they face difficulties. This is real Marxism,” So what all the others have read is a fake Marxism. I hope he writes a book on Marxism. 

‌Maoist usually doesn't believe in entering politics so he stood against all that he claims to be. 

‌Later in 2018, he tried his way best in politics but nothing came his way. 

‌He is being out of the news for almost a year but is reportedly regular in temple visits. 

‌This story from a revolutionary leader to a spiritual one shows how a person threw easily out all his ideals just for power.

If somebody could undergo a such a transformation imagine the power and conditioning of religion. When one couldn't be stable at his ideologies how could he manage a state? Not a fan of Marxism nor spirituality yet this transformation is fascinating as a fan of the human brain.
