Social media if used correctly can become the bane of our existence It is a powerful tool in our hands with which we can achieve almost everything However these days people are too comfortable with hurting and trolling others They think they can hide behind a screen and bully others under the pretext of free speech Abusive language is now the norm on social media platforms Additionally some rogue elements use social media to spread misinformation that caused not only causes disharmony but makes social media platforms a toxic place What was supposed to be our source of entertainment and information becomes a source of negativity It s high time that our leaders should be accountable for it and use their position to positively influence the use of social media In my opinion we got too comfortable with all the toxicity on social media to an extent where it was considered a part and parcel of it I was on the verge of quitting social media for good when I discovered Pixstory through Dwight Howard The integrity factor of the app instantly attracted me and I have not looked back since I get to share my interests and opinions without the fear of being attacked by trolls and bullies Healthy debates have also facilitated my process of learning about new perspectives
