Just like with everything else in life, we want our skincare products to show quicker and better results. We are no longer okay with a moisturiser that simply hydrates, we want something that protects against free radicals, offers UV protection, delivers anti-ageing benefits and what not.

Face massage practices have been around for centuries. This practice involves gently, yet firmly, massaging the nerves on your face to relieve tension, soothe aching muscles, as well as provide a bit of mental release. Facial massages have been a part of skin care procedures in a lot of cultures.

Including a face massage tool in your daily skincare routine has a lot more benefits than you can imagine. It helps in draining lymphatic fluids to reduce puffiness, eliminates toxins from the skin to make it appear clearer, improves blood circulation to give your complexion a rosy glow. 

FACE MASSAGE TOOLS:

2. Cleansing pods are made from silicone with a textured front and vibrating abilities to pull out deep-set dirt, sweat, oil and debris that your normal double cleanse routine or 60-second cleansing rule wouldnâ€™t be able to achieve.
