A joint task force was hunting Monday for a serial killer who has shot at least five homeless men, two of them fatally, in Manhattan and Washington D.C.

A sixth possible victim found dead in Tribeca does not appear to have been shot, as first believed, police said Monday.

Further tests will have to be done by the city Medical Examiner’s office to determine if the 43-year-old man was the victim of a homicide — and if so, if he was the victim of the serial killer believed responsible for shooting two other homeless men, one fatally, in Manhattan on Saturday, and three more, one fatally, in Washington, D.C., earlier this month.

Mayor Adams spoke with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser Sunday night and the two leaders issued a joint statement.

“The two of us spoke about how our teams can coordinate and help one another, and we are calling on everyone in our cities to look at the images of the suspect and report any information, however small, that may be useful,” they said.

“The work to get this individual off our streets before he hurts or murders another individual is urgent. The rise in gun violence has shaken all of us and it is particularly horrible to know that someone is out there deliberately doing harm to an already vulnerable population.”

In the Tribeca incident, police said the victim was found dead in his sleeping bag on Murray St. near Greenwich St. about 6:30 p.m. Sunday. He had an injury to his right leg, near the femoral artery, and died at the scene.

But there was no bullet hole in the sleeping bag or his clothing and the cause of death was not clear after an initial autopsy was done. Police said it does not appear likely he was shot.

A homeless outreach team had checked on the man earlier Sunday. His name has not been released. Neighbors recalled his kind-hearted nature.
