Everybody has to start somewhere. For bands, the debut album is the most important record they‘ll ever make. Get it right and you’re off to a flying start. For some bands, it takes a few albums to really find their true sound which can let them connect with their audience, requiring them to make a very high-quality effort. But some bands knock it out of the park on their very first try, finding their sound on the first try and then going further to refine it to perfection.
 
When bands are formed or artists go about making their music, one of the most important things for them to do is to  be able to make a statement with their first release. The debut album is by far a band's most important album, as it gives artists not just the opportunity to introduce themselves, but also give them a base on which they can refine later in order to build on future albums.
