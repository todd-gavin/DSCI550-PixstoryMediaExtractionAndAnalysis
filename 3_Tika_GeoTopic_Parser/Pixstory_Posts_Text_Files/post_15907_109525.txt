The role of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring Objective Transient ischemic attacks TIA after carotid endarterectomy CEA are not well studied We aimed to investigate the characteristics and the predictive role of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring IONM in TIA post CEA Methods Patients who underwent CEA utilizing IONM from were included Analyses included TIA incidence sensitivity specificity and predictive values of IONM risk factor regression analyses and mortality Kaplan Meier plots Results Out of patients experienced TIA of which were within hours of CEA p Nine of these patients displayed significant IONM changes during CEA The odds of TIA increased with somatosensory evoked potential SSEP changes Odds Ratio OR Confidence Interval CI electroencephalogram EEG changes OR CI and combined SSEP EEG changes OR CI Patients with TIA were less likely to be alive after an average of years OR CI Conclusions The odds a patient will have TIA post CEA are greater in patients with IONM changes This risk is inversely related to the time post CEA Significance Changes in IONM during CEA predict postoperative TIA Post CEA TIA may increase long term mortality thus further research is needed to better elucidate clinical implications of postoperative TIA Sources
