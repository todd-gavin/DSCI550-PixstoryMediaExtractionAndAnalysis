We know how mental health affects and plays a huge role in our general wellbeing. A good mental state will keep us healthy and will prevent one from serious health conditions. A new study has found that positive psychological wellbeing decreases the risk of having heart attacks and strokes. 

But when our mental health is declined this can lead to poor physical health and also will take one to harmful behaviours. 

Chronic disease 

Depression has been associated with many chronic illnesses. And these illnesses includes diabetes, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease and arthritis. 

SchizophreniaÂ is linked with high risk of heart and respiratory diseases. 

The mortality rates of cancer to heart disease is higher between people who are dealing with depression or other mental health conditions. 



Sleep problems 

People with mental health problems around 10 to 18 percent of them suffer from sleeping problems. 

Conditions like depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder leads to sleep problems and this can worsen one's condition. 

Smoking 

People with mental health conditions are more prone to smoke than those who do not have mental health conditions. Among smokers people who have mental health conditions smoke greater number of cigarettes. 

People who have depression have lower levels of chemical dopamine. Dopamine are those that influences positive feelings in your brain. The nicotine in the cigarettes triggers a production of chemical dopamine and so smoking is a negative coping mechanism taken to relieve oneself from the symptoms of depression.
