continuing from Although our batch was a Covid one and the learning and experience was different than the usual years wearing masks and in a restrictive manner I did learn and experience a lot I feel like a completely different person today from when I started my PG I think I m way more confident than I have ever been and this is my best self and I can t wait to be just better Just before the start of the third wave I went for multiple shoots I took interviews for bytes and did VoxPop for my documentary Although we couldn t venture out much with Covid we learnt how to learn new skills and also survive and shoot wearing masks Now only my last leg of Post graduation is left I m just supposed to give my final exams and because of the rising cases of Omicron they re on hold because of the uncertainty lurking around I know if Covid was not there I would have had better experience with the camera or might have taken more interviews of people But I have learnt felt confident had my fair share of breakdowns and moments of stressful situations too I m sure whatever will be the situation in my journey of life and of becoming a journalist I won t feel scared and will take challenges head on along with learning new things and growing more for the better
