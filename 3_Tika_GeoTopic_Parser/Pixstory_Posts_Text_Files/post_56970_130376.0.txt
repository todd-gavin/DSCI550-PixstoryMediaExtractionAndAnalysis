Atkins introduced four phases in his diet: induction, ongoing weight loss, pre-maintenance and lifetime maintenance.
The first phase is an induction phase; in this phase, you can cut out almost all carbohydrates from your diet. 
Although 20gms or carbs can be taken, the rest is taken through different foods added to this diet.
In this phase, you eat protein, such as fish and shellfish, poultry, meat, eggs, and cheese, at every meal. As a result, you don't need to limit oils and fats. 
In phase 2, a person adds 20–25 g of carbs per day during the first week,
30 g of carbs during the second week, 30 g each subsequent week until weight loss slows to 1–2 pounds a week.
The aim of phase 2 is to find out how many carbs an individual can eat while continuing to lose weight. This phase continues until the individual is within 5–10 pounds of their target weight.
The third phase is pre-maintenance. In this phase, you slowly keep increasing the range of foods you can eat, including fruits, starchy vegetables and whole grains. You can add about 10 grams of carbs to your diet each week. But you must cut back if your weight loss stops. You stay in this phase until you reach your goal weight.
Lastly, there is lifetime maintenance. You move into this phase when you reach your goal weight. Then you keep on with this way of eating for life.
