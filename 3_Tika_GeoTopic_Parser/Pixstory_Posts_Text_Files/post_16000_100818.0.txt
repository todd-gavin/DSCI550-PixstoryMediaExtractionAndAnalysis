Abstract 

Aims 

Diabetes is a major health problem in Bangladesh, but nationally representative studies on its trends and associated factors are scarce to guide policy formulation. Therefore, the study aims to determine trends in the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in Bangladesh. 

Methods 

The study included two population-based cross-sectional surveys (n=7,505 in 2011 and n=11,959 in 2017-18). Chi-square association tests and (simple and multivariable) logistic regressions were performed to determine the associated factors and estimate effect sizes (odds ratios). Age-adjusted prevalence was also reported for both surveys. 

Results 

The overall age-adjusted prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes decreased from 52.77% (95% CI: 52.61-52.92) and 10.43% (95% CI: 10.33-10.53) in 2011 to 34.10% (95% CI: 33.43-34.78) and 8.50% (95% CI: 8.11-8.90) in 2017-18. Compared to males, females had higher odds of diabetes in 2011, but in 2017-18 a significant inverse result was observed. In both surveys, the odds of diabetes and prediabetes increased with advancing age, higher body mass index, wealth status, and hypertension. 

Conclusion 

The study shows that the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes is still high in Bangladesh despite decreasing trends. Therefore, the study recommends promoting healthy lifestyles and regular screening for non-communicable diseases.
