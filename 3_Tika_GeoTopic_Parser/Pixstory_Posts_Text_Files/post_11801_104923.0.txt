I have heard it many time that " Woman's have direct contact with Environment !  And Now I know It's Soo true ! ☘️🌎

I will tell you why - 🤔☘️

Women have direct contact with natural resources like fuel , food and fodder , forest , water and land especially in rural areas where 70% of Indian population reside and directly dependent upon natural resources . Women are also responsible for using these resources to satisfy the basic needs of their families . 🙋‍♀️

I still remember Before in 18th and 19th century , it was considered that women have no role in environmental conservation and promotion , as well as they were avoided in all major sphere of social life . But now after spreading awareness about their rights and duties they consciously tried to raise voice against environment degradation . 🌎☘️

Women play a critical role in managing natural resources on community levels and are most affected by environmental degradation . Besides , that woman even played a leadership role for conservation and enhancement of environment . In communities around the world , women manage water , sources for fuel , and food , as well as both forests and agricultural terrain . 

From the high level to the grassroots , the 1992 UN Earth Summit , India’s Chipko movement and Kenya’s Green Belt Movement all highlighted the role of women’s voices and perspectives in sustainable development . Similarly , nowadays Medha Patekar, a social worker , Menaka Gandhi , an environmentalist and politician , are playing key role for the conservation and promotion of the environment . 🙋‍♀️☘️

Therefore , conservation of natural resources and promotion of environment cannot be done without involving the women in planning and training for promoting the values for conservation and promotion of environment . 🌎🙋‍♀️☘️

Happy World Environment Day to all ☘️🌎
