President Joe Biden warned that there is "evolving intelligence" that Russia is exploring options for cyberattacks.

Biden first warned on Monday in a written statement that it was time for the private sector, which owns much of the nation's critical infrastructure and hasn't always heeded government warnings, to immediately harden its online defenses.

Then he delivered a more specific warning in person to a Business Roundtable meeting in Washington.

"The magnitude of Russia's cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it's coming," the President warned. "He hasn't used it yet, but it's part of his playbook," Biden said of Putin.
