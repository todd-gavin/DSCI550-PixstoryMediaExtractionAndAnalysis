First final and first tournament on the ATP circuit won by Lorenzo Musetti A non-trivial victory given that it came against a tennis player who was younger than him but who had already played nine in the final before today and had won them all Musetti still managed to beat the very talented Carlos Alcaraz playing a fast and fun varied tennis A match lasting hours and minutes ending with the result of The victory of the ATP tournament in Hamburg makes Musetti make a significant leap in the ATP ranking from Monday he will be the number in the world his best ranking His opponent, just to reiterate the feat, will instead enter the Top Musetti&#39;s strength was seen when in the second set he wasted match points until the tie break lost He was not discouraged and in the third set the decisive one returned to play better than Alcaraz with continuous variations short balls and fanciful solutions The tennis player from Carrara did not lose his not easy calm after almost throwing away the victory in the second set which seemed to have launched the Spaniard towards a widely predicted victory before the match began But sport is known as a gift incalculable emotions The third set despite the final result did not start in the best way for the Italian Alcaraz managed to make his serve games Musetti made double the effort Until the break arrived and the final lunge At the end of the prize-giving Musetti again too emotional Not easy to talk after a final like this I congratulate Carlos what an incredible player My own sacrifices are inspired by him I thank my team especially my coach Simone Tartarini I managed to make him cry I thank my parents who unfortunately are not here but they followed the race on TV and they must have cried too I also want to thank my grandmother I have a great relationship with her and I want to dedicate this tournament to her
