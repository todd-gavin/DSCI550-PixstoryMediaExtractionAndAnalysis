President Biden arrived in Israel yesterday as he begins his tour around the Middle East. Immediately upon arriving he met with senior members of the IDF to view its newest anti-missile laser system, as much of the funding came from the US. 

Afterwards, he visited Yad Vashem, Israelâ€™s Holocaust Museum, to honor the victims and pay homage to the past. A particularly touching moment was when the President met with two survivors. President Biden refused their attempts to rise from their seats, and instead knelt to meet them at eye level.

Biden continues his trip with meetings with the Palestinian Authority, as well as a planned $100 million award to a Palestinian hospital. The President leaves Israel on Friday.
