Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt’s recently released ‘Brahmastra’ has been creating waves at the box office 🔥🔥🔥🔥Following a promising upward trend over the weekend, director Ayan Mukerji’s Brahmastra appears to have passed the crucial Monday test. The fantasy drama made a reported Rs 16.25 crore on day four of release — Rs 14.25 crore from the Hindi markets, and another Rs 2 crore from the dubbed language versions. 🔥🔥🔥🔥Discrepancies are being observed in the box office reporting for Brahmastra; Dharma Productions, meanwhile, has been sharing gross figures daily, without citing sources. On Monday, Dharma shared that the film had grossed Rs 225 crore over the weekend, a number that has also been disputed. ✅✅✅✅Brahmastra is headed for a Rs 175 crore first week, and is expected to hit the Rs 250 crore mark in India, and is predicted to finish its worldwide theatrical run with around Rs 450 crore. But the film cost a reported Rs 410 crore to produce, and will have to rely on ancillary revenue for profits. ✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️The second Friday of the film will be crucial in terms of the box office numbers. In Mumbai city, the 3D format of the film has been working well but the scenario is a bit different in another metro city like Kolkata. The film also seems to be working better in states like Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. 👍👍👍👍👍It will soon become Ranbir’s third film to cross the Rs 150 crore mark, after Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani and Sanju. Ranbir was coming off a major commercial disappointment Shamshera — his third big-budget flop after Bombay Velvet and Jagga Jasoos.✅✅✅✅🔥🔥
