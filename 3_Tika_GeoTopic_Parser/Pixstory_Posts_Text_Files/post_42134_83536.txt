I think that this generation has normalised using the terms like depression due to which they have lost their true meaning You can often hear people saying I m so depressed nowadays and this happens to everyone it will pass etc I believe that people undergoing depression wont even know what has hit them until they would be at their very bottom The feeling of dread of not having anyone to confide in and feeling totally helpless that s what leads to depression Today s generation needs to understand that not everything has to be normalised It makes people suffering from such situations think that its a phase and it will pass instead of getting much needed medical help
