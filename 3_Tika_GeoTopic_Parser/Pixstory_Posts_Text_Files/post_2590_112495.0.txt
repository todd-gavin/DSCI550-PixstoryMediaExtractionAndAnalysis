Ludo.

Do you know the connection between Ajanta and Ellora caves, the Mahabharata, and  Mughal emperor Akbar  

To everybody’s surprise its a game – our very own Ludo!

The exact origins of this legendary game are uncertain, although the earliest proof of this game comes from the historic Ellora Caves in Maharashtra, where the board game was depicted in the form of illustrations on the walls. This seems to suggest that Ludo was an Indian creation.

Ludo was known by many names across different times in Indian history, like ‘Chausar’, ‘Chopad’ or ‘Pachisi’., The game eventually became famous around the world in many other popular variations. For example, the Spanish version of the game was known by the name  ‘Parcheesi’ and the Chinese called it ‘Chatush pada’ (meaning four cloth). It goes by the name ‘Ludu’
Ludo made an appearance in Mahabharata too. What’s less known is that the dice used in this disreputable game had some magical powers. They would only obey Shakuni’s command. Some versions of Mahabharat explain that the dice were made from the cursed bones of family members of Shakuni. 
From ancient history  to modern, Ludo makes an appearance everywhere! Some historians suggest that the Mughal emperor Akbar used to play this game. But it had a slight variation. Instead of using shells or seeds, the emperor used real, living people from his harem as pieces on a life-sized board! It is believed that he was so fond of the game that his palaces in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri had halls dedicated to this game, with floors depicting the game board drawn on them.

In the year 1891, a Britisher by the name Alfred Collier modified the game by adding a dice cup to it and registered the game of Pachisi for a patent in the UK, naming it The Royal Ludo. Since then the game became popular worldwide by the name we know today. Later on, the British Royal Navy converted it into a board game called ‘Ucker’. ***
