Juventus FC have completed the signing of former Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid star Angel Di Maria on a free transfer. The midfielder has signed a one-year deal with Juventus as he plans to return to his boyhood club Rosario Central (where his football career began) to play and play in the Argentina Primera Division in 2023. 

Di Maria’s former rival FC Barcelona were keen on signing the Argentine midfielder as a free agent and the 34-year old also seemed very interested in joining the Catalunyan club. However, Barca’s interest started fading over time while Juventus kept pushing and thus Angel Di Maria ultimately decided to join the Old Lady. 

In a recent interview, Di Maria revealed why he joined a European club despite his dire wish to return to Rosario Central. 

"We are not talking to Rosario Central, but the idea is to return," he said. "Everyone has the dream of going to Europe, I have already achieved it. Now my dream is to come back, but I want to do it feeling good.

"The World Cup is coming and the return to Argentine football limits you from this point of view. Unless you go to River Plate or Boca Juniors, you normally don't have a chance to take part in the national team.

"I want to continue the path in Europe to the end, but I feel the need to return to Argentina."

Juventus have not made many signings in this summer window but the two free agents they signed are both big names - Angel Di Maria (official) and Paul Pogba (soon to be official). 

After winning 8 consecutive Serie A titles, Juventus have failed to lift the Scudetto for two back to back seasons now and they are going through a bad phase currently. However, their rebuild has started. Brilliant signings like Dusan Vlahovic have already improved their performance a lot. It is now to see how Angel Di Maria and Paul Pogba can help Juventus in the process.
