Fire and Ice

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.




The poem was inspired by Dante's Inferno, it is also said that he points out two possibilities of the world ending either the sun will explode and incinerate the Earth, or the Earth will somehow escape this fate only to end up slowly freezing in deep space(suggested by a scientist friend) which he made into a poem. He says we all stand for the fire as a dangerous one but a cold state/phase is also as deadly as the fierce one. The poem is very compact with smart diction and a rhyming scheme. The clipped precision of vocabulary is what makes the poem special. He symbolises desire and hates through fire and ice in the poem. So which is your favourite poem by Frost? Comment on the notesðŸ˜ƒ
