The novel 'The girl on room 105' is one of the best books that I came across. 
For people expecting something different from Chetan Bhagat this time. Congratulations! You have something to be happy about.
The book boasts of a fresh storyline and a decent effort in terms of plot and plot twists. Mystery and entertainment also don’t come far behind. As is quite obvious from the blurb, The Girl in Room 105 is a story of a love gone wrong but not in a cliché-easy-guessed way.
