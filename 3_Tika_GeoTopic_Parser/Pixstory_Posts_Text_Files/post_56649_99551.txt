Electric cars solar panels large batteries and wind turbines the technology needed to go green relies on what can be a dirty industry It s absolutely ironic but to save the planet we are going to need more mines says Allison Britt director of mineral resources at government agency Geoscience Australia The need for one of the biggest increases in mining the world has ever seen is forcing some tough choices and redrawing old battlelines between environmentalists and miners In Tasmania a mine that s been leaking contaminated water for the past five years wants permission to expand into a wilderness area because the lead zinc and copper it produces are vital for solar panels electric cars and wind turbines King Island famed for its high end produce and rugged beauty will soon be home to one of the world s largest tungsten mines Outside Darwin an open cut mine that will produce lithium vital for electric car batteries looks to be already impacting local waterways Australian National University professor of economic geology John Mavrogenes says tough decisions need to be made These decisions are made even more difficult by China s control of the so called critical minerals which are not only vital for the transition to renewable energy but for economic and national security The US and its allies fear Beijing could restrict or cut off supply in times of conflict And then there s the need to quickly act on climate change Everything is now an emergency says entrepreneur and inventor Saul Griffith whose advocacy organisation Re wiring America has advised US politicians and businesses We need to be making wind turbines times as fast as we do We need to be making solar cells times as fast as we do We need to be making batteries and electric vehicles times as fast as we do today An electric vehicle needs about kg of minerals like copper nickel cobalt and lithium That s six times more than a petrol powered car A wind turbine needs four times more minerals than a coal fired power station to generate the same amount of electricity Read more here
