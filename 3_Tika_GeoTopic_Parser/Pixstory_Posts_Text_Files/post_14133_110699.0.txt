Feyenoord defender Tyrell Malacia has chosen to join Manchester United this summer following a 11th hour bid for his services, French outlet L’Equipe reports.

The 22-year-old was expected to join Lyon before the end of the month, but the Red Devils hijacked the deal yesterday by making an improved bid for the highly-rated left-back.

Les Gones initially agreed on a package of €13m plus €2m in add-ons, but United convinced Feyenoord into a deal by offering €15m plus €2m in variables for the Dutchman.

The French outfit are said to have made an improved offer for Malacia, but it is reported that his representative preferred him to move to the Premier League with the Red Devils.

Malacia has now chosen United as his next club, and the decision has already been informed to Lyon. He should become their first major signing of the summer in the coming days.
