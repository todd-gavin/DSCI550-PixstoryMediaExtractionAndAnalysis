France Football director Pascal Ferre believes Karim Benzema's off-field reputation should not affect the Real Madrid star's chances of winning the Ballon d'Or.
The award ceremony, conducted by France Football, is set to take place on Monday (October 17) in Paris. Benzema is an overwhelming favorite to win the award - a thought shared by his counterpart Robert Lewandowski.
However, there have been questions about whether he is the right person to give the award to given his off-field controversy involving Mathieu Valbuena. The two were teammates for the French national team before a high-profile scandal erupted in 2015.
The Real Madrid striker was suspended from the French national team after he was said to have blackmailed Valbuena with a sex tape. Last year, a court found the former Olympique Lyonnais striker guilty of complicity in the incident.
Ferre, however, does not believe off-the-pitch behavior should matter to an extent where Benzema could miss out on a potential Ballon d'Or award. 
It is worth mentioning that some vehemently believe the Noble Peace Prize has lost its reverence due to the alleged criminal activities of some of its past winners.
Benzema, meanwhile, is coming off the back of a memorable 2021-22 season with Real Madrid. He scored 44 goals and provided 15 assists in 46 games across competitions as his team won La Liga and the UEFA Champions League.
