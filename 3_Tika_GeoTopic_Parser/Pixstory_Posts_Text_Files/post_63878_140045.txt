Steelrising is finally live and as blood and rotting carcasses litter the streets of Paris in the wake of the French Revolution high end challenges full of rage and despair await the player on the other end of the road with enemies waiting to rend your flesh from bone Similar to Code Vein Mortal Shell Thymesia and Lies of P Steelrising is yet another Dark Souls inspired dark fantasy RPG with a bizarre twist to the Souls genre This unique dark fantasy takes place in the wake of the French Revolution Designed by French developer Spiders the game is derivative in its design featuring all of the familiar elements we ve come to expect of the genre The player takes control of Aegis a mechanical bodyguard to Queen Marie Antoinette who possesses a conscience and will of his own As Aegis you are sent into the heart of Paris to find your creator and engage in a bloody conflict to put an end to the king s tyrannical reign From the outset you choose from one of three classes that dictate your starting weapon and attributes opting to be a powerful bodyguard a quick and lethal dancer or an alchemist who shoots enemies from afar Like any Souls like title the world is vast and the combat is quite demanding with its enemies packing quite a wallop giving players little room for error The game prioritizes close quarters combat with well timed dodges being a key element Featuring a tried and tested combat formula the combat of the game is fun and also has some good cryptic and environmental if predictable storytelling But when it comes down to it there is something here that is missing A good Souls like game overall it is prone to various faults such as struggling to maintain frames per second on PC with neither the combat story nor the exploration being particularly a standout even the weapons enemy designs and boss fights are largely forgettable Spider s attempt to make a French Revolution themed dark fantasy RPG is laudable and bears some good fruit but also tends to fall flat on its face at times Score
