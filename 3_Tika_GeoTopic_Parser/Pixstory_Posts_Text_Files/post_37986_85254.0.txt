Shakhtar Donetsk's coach is killed in the war!

As per the Mirror, The Ukrainian-Russian war has taken the life of a Shakhtar Donetsk coach. The said employee of the club was reportedly working with the youth team before his untimely death. 

Shakhtar Donetsk CEO Serhyi Palkin released a statement on Thursday stating "One of our employees was killed, he was a children's coach. He was hit by a fragment of a Russian bullet."

The identity of the youth coach has not been let out to the public. But he is not the only football-related victim of the Ukraine-Russia war. A couple of other Ukrainian footballers have passed away in the scuffle. 

Shakhtar Donetsk is one of the most recognised clubs in Ukraine. They are currently on top of the now-suspended Ukrainian Premier League. The club had shifted bases from Lviv to Kyiv in 2014 as their former home is in the epicentre of the scuffle between Russia and Ukraine. 




Two Ukrainian footballers pass away…


As per reports, Two Ukrainian footballers namely Vitalii Sapylo and Dmytro Martynenko became the first victims of the war. They were 21 years and 25 years old respectively at the time of their death.

21-year old Vitalii Sapylo played for second division club Karpaty Lviv. He was playing for the team's youth set-up. The footballer reportedly lost his life near Kyiv after he joined the Ukrainian army as a tank commander. 

25-year old Dmytro Martynenko was an amateur player with FC Gostomel. He sadly perished alongside his mother as his apartment block was bombed by the Russian forces. All three of these deaths have rocked the football fraternity. 

Football clubs from around the world have stood against the war. But there doesn't seem to be an end to this as of now. We hope that both countries can put their differences aside and sign a peace treaty in the days to come.
