Better Call Saul has come to a devastating end after six enthralling seasons. 

Radio Times reported that the cult American drama has tracked the morally bankrupt Saul Goodman we know from Breaking Bad as he steadily changes from the shady but well-intentioned lawyer Jimmy McGill, with all kinds of dramatic moments and wonderful cameos along the way. 

Fans of the original Breaking Bad weren't sure how the prequel could possibly measure up to the popular AMC drama when it began airing, but the show defied expectations all the way through the note-perfect climax.

The reason the show won't be renewed after its recently finished sixth season is rather obvious: Jimmy's transformation into Saul has been fully realised in the prequel, which has caught up to the events of Breaking Bad. 

In reality, the last season of Better Call Saul featured a substantial segment examining what happened to Jimmy/Saul after the events of Breaking Bad in addition to the fact that the histories of the two shows have now combined.
