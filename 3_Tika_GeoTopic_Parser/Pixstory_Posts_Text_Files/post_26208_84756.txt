Most of the reviews on the Dior show talk about the location and the famous guests sitting in the front row Anyone who understands the slightest bit about fashion knows that this is not good knows that if the clothes are an integral part of the event they are relegated to the last three lines then the problem is Maria Grazia Chiuri creative director at Dior for years who has managed to boost the brand&#39;s sales as never before by sacrificing the heritage and trivializing the message For the Fall Winter collection she proposes the possible marriage between centuries-old craftsmanship and technology A interesting theme very badly done The usual extremely feminine tulle dresses from the archives and the same for years now have been combined with motorcyclist gloves and harnesses from a formula one driver Objects that do not communicate, on the contrary they turn their backs as in the blackest nights of a wedding on the way to sunset Waistcoats and harnesses that tighten, move and speak by themselves on the helpless body of the model terrified by the armor that should protect her The next era appears on dresses and sweaters which, given the collection, seems more of a threat than an exciting I invite you to take a step towards the future imagining that it will not be promising
