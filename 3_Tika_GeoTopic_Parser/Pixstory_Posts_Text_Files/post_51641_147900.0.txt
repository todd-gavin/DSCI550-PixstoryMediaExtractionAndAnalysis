In a "unexpected" move, fifteen players have left the Spanish women's national team "Following weeks of rumours of conflicts within the camp, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) announced a mutual resignation late on Thursday.

Ona Batlle and Lucia Garcia of Manchester United and Leila Ouahabi and Laia Aleixandri of Manchester City were also reportedly among those who had left their positions.
