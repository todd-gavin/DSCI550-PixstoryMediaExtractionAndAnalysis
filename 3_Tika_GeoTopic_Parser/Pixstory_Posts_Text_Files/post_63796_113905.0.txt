A guitarist is perhaps the most audible component of any rock or metal song. The history of rock and metal is filled with guitar gods who have provided some of the most memorable licks, hooks and riffs. But the best guitarists are not defined simply by their ability to shred and create complex arrangements, but rather their ability to breathe life into their songs.
 
Even the simplest arrangements can be the best ones, provided the guitarist knows how to bring life in to them. Unfortunately the common perception among most people is, that shred=great. Shred is a mark of skill as a guitarist, not songwriting ability.
 
 
That is why throw perfectionism, speed and virtuoso out the window. You want to play just a few notes and convey a lifetime of emotions? Look at David Gilmour or BB King, one note from them conveys more than most technical guitarists can do in a thousand notes. You want to shred and still be emotional? Look at Rhandy Rhodes, John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis and Buckethead. They are shred gods who can mix a variety of styles and yet, their each note is written so carefully that it goes down like wine. That is the mark of a top tier guitarist.
