An England stockbroker’s prediction about the FIFA World Cup became famous and here we reveal how Lionel Messi would lead Argentina to glory and Neymar’s Brazil and Mbappé’s France would crash with a hard reality.
Maybe it’s just a worry about the start of the FIFA World Cup, but it’s a fact that English stockbroker Liberum’s Qatar 2022 outcome prediction has gone viral. And how could it not, when it gave the winner to none other than one of the fans’ favorites: Lionel Messi?
According to a story originally published by Bloomberg, the grand final of the upcoming FIFA World Cup will feature Messi’s Argentina and Kane’s England. That’s according to a now-viral prediction by Liberum.
Liberum’s prediction, complete with the fate of each of the national teams participating in Qatar 2022, has now been revealed. Read on to find out the predicted result of Neymar’s Brazil, Mbappé’s France, the USMNT and the other teams that will play in the World Cup.
How reliable is Liberum’s prediction?
Fortunately for fans of Lionel Messi and Argentina, and unfortunately for fans of Cristiano’s Portugal, Joshua Kimmich’s Germany and other national teams, when English stockbroker Liberum publishes its World Cup prediction, there is something to consider.
In the past two editions of the FIFA World Cup, Brazil 2014 and Russia 2018, Liberum correctly predicted that Germany and France would be crowned world champions. So, some complicated but accurate predictions support his view of what will happen in Qatar 2022.
It is worth noting that the model used by the aforementioned English stockbroker does not only take into account sports variables, but also socio-economic values ​​such as the country’s GDP per capita, population size and the country’s temperature, among others.
