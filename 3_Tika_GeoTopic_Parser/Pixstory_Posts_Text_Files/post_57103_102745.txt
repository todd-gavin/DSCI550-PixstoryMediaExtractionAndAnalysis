As text messaging has become one of the most important ways to communicate both in professional and personal life it is also necessary to adhere to certain etiquette or say behaviour while talking to someone on messaging apps But unfortunately sometimes people don t understand the necessity of doing so and hence they end up hurting someone who is expecting a reply In a survey conducted in the United States of the respondents said it is rude when someone does not reply to your message after seeing it This digitally lacking behaviour creates a bad reputation and makes people think that the person on the other side is impertinent It could be that the person is very polite and cordial while communicating face to face but the way they use messaging is just inappropriate whatsoever be the reason Even if the person you re talking to knows you for a long time they would be disappointed by this behaviour of not acknowledging the messages According to the observations it is said that When you don t respond to messages you give the impression that you re too busy to interact with those who are trying to engage with you While you may be pressed for time it must be understood that messaging is one of how people nowadays communicate So take a few seconds to send an emoji or respond another way It would hardly take seconds to respond to a message even if you re engrossed in something significant or one can choose to reply later mentioning why they couldn t answer on time Communication forms the fundamental way of exchanging ideas and discourse and if it is not done correctly it can create a bad impact
