In 1955, at the height of the Cold War, Paul Anderson, as winner of the USA National Amateur Athletic Union Weightlifting Championship, traveled to the Soviet Union, where weightlifting was a popular sport, for an international weightlifting competition. 

In 1956, Anderson won a gold medal in a long, tough duel in the Melbourne, Australia Olympic Games as a weightlifter in the super-heavyweight class, while suffering from a 104 °F or 40 °C fever, with Argentine Humberto Selvetti. The two competitors were tied in the amount of weight lifted, but because Anderson, who weighed in at 304 pounds, was lighter than Selvetti, who weighed 316 pounds. Anderson was awarded the gold medal, the last gold medal to be earned by an American athlete competing in the super heavyweight division.
