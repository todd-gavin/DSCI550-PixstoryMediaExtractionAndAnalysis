LONG MARCH - After a third win in succession, Juventus stretched their unbeaten run to 15 Serie A matches in a row for the first time since March 2019, also under Massimiliano Allegri - overtaking the previous best 14-game streak under Maurizio Sarri.

DOUBLE DIGITS - With his first Serie A brace since 23 May 2021, Álvaro Morata has now scored 10+ goals in all competitions in each of the last eight seasons - that is, since his first year at Juventus in 2014/15.

ON THE SPOT pt.1 - Sampdoria have conceded only two penalties in Serie A this season, both against Juventus. Before Morata’s goal at the Luigi Ferraris stadium, Leonardo Bonucci had struck from 12-yards in the reverse fixture in Turin.

ON THE SPOT pt.2 - In denying Antonio Candreva from the spot, Wojciech Szczesny has become the first goalkeeper to have saved three Serie A penalties in a row since Emiliano Viviano in the 2017/18 campaign (four). Furthermore, no goalkeeper has saved more penalties in the Big-5 European Leagues this season than Szczesny.

MARASSI CENTURIONS - Against Sampdoria, Danilo played his 100th game for Juventus in all competitions, while Matthijs de Ligt made his 100th start for the Bianconeri in all competitions.
