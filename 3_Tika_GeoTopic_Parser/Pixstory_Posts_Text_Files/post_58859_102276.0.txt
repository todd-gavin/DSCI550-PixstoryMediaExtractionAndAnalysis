A little youngster can be heard yelling anti-Hindu and anti-Christian slurs at a protest in a video that has gone viral on social media.

The footage is thought to be from a Saturday march in Alappuzha, Kerala, organised by the Muslim organisation Popular Front of India (PFI).

"Keep rice ready," says the youngster being carried on a man's shoulders in the video. Yama [the god of death] will pay you a visit. You are welcome to dwell in our home if you live in a polite manner. We have no idea what will happen if this does not happen.
