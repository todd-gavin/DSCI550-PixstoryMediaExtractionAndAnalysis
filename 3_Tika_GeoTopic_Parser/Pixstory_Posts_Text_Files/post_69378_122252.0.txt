Sun-dried turnips produce a mouthwatering dish that will satisfy the taste buds of any vegetarian from the Kashmiri Hokh Syun! Turnips used to be dried to perfection by hanging them into necklaces in attics or balconies where the heat of the sun would dry them to perfect spherical bits. Turnips that have been dried can lower blood pressure and strengthen the immune system. The Gogji Aare is a mouthwatering Kashmiri dish that is adored by both Kashmiris and Non-Kashmiris alike and is frequently served with tomatoes, beef, or cottage cheese!
