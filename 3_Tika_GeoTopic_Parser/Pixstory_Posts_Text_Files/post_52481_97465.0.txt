This is what Steve Jobs said in an event "We stand in the Intersection of Technology & Humanity".

Kaash Every Tech Company yeh wali vision k saath apna business karey.

Facebook is Threat to our Privacy.
Google is always in Monopoly.
Amazon is threat to small Businesses.
Tesla is removing job opportunity for drivers.

In this world one way to be in that intersection is through BlockChain (I think).
Everything should be Transparent & Clean.
