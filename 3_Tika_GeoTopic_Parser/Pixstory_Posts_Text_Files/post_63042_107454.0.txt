The Economics of Small Things to me is more like a memoir of every individual who is born, raised, and has lived a life. It relates to our everyday experiences with life tampered with the lessons of economics. What stands for me is the way the author beautifully strings the quotidian stories of common people and explores them with the help of different economic concepts. The flow of the content is well designed as it takes you to your fond childhood memories of renting video cassettes, DVDs, to the delight of eating mangoes, to the times when temple visit was a family affair, it then brings you to the present by discussing the how marketing has changed our lifestyle and habits, how we are dependent on house-helps and how a pen is only an ornament in today's digital era. Further, the book also explores various advanced concepts of economics including game theory and earthquake economics. The most interesting part of the book is where it connects culture, societal changes, future, and human values altogether to give an overview of our hybrid societies today. However, in some parts, I do feel that there is a stereotypical explanation of Indian society and its practices. Other than that the book is an enchanting read. It is nostalgic, witty, emotional, wise, and at the same time very insightful. It gives a good understanding of various concepts like O-Ring Theory, Game Theory, taste-based discrimination, efficiency-based wages, and many more. I recommend this book to all those who want to indulge in exploring the nuances of everyday economics without missing its conceptual relevance.
