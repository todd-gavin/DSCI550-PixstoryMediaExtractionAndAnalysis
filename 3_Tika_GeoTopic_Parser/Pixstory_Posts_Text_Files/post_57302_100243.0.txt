Pandemic has inflicted us in all its ways for the past two years and taught some lessons that one would never forget.
One of the lessons would be the importance of a healthy lifestyle and physical activity. As all the fuss was created around the immune system and physical activities help to make our immune system strong and keep us fit.

Running is the oldest form and way of staying fit when it comes to exercising. It’s been widely accepted that running can improve bone density for some time. In the late 19th century, German surgeon Julius Wolff created what has now become known as Wolff’s Law – if you’ve been wondering how your workout strengthens your bones, Wolff’s law has the answer. 

Wolff correctly stated that bones would adapt to stresses placed on them, so putting a load through your lower body by running will cause the bones in your legs to strengthen over time. 

“Running is an impact activity which means, with each foot contact, the bones in our lower leg, in particular, are exposed to forces two to three times our body weight,” Dr Blagrove says. “These impact forces are beneficial to our bones and drive changes in bone mineral density, which lowers the risk of developing osteoporosis in later life.”

There is a large amount of evidence showing that regular running reduces symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression. Running is also linked to greater self-esteem, and the runners’ high that people often describe after a run can improve mood. Interestingly, regular running has been associated with improved learning capacity and reduces cognitive decline in older individuals. Running even keeps our cardiovascular system active and free of diseases.
