Barcelona appears to be eager to wrap up their summer business as soon as possible this year, and Raphinha, a Brazilian winger, appears to be the next piece of the puzzle.

Raphinha, who has recently established himself as a fixture in the Brazilian national team, has three goals in seven Selecao appearances. Those came as a result of his great form for Leeds United, where he remains a major figure in the club's Premier League survival. Joan Laporta recently indicated that Ousmane Dembele had given no indication that he wanted to continue at Barcelona, and that if the Raphinha transfer goes through, he will most certainly replace Dembele.

Raphinha has accepted personal terms with the Catalans, according to Sport, clearing the path for the two teams to negotiate a cost. Raphinha, whose agent is Deco, is dead set on making the move and will politely decline any additional offers from other clubs.

According to the source, Leeds United has already rejected down a â‚¬35 million offer for the player, and as a result, Barcelona is considering using Oscar Mingueza to cut the cost of the deal. Raphinha is content to accept a salary that is in line with Camp Nou's new compensation structure.

The Catalan club has long admired the Brazilian, but Liverpool, Manchester City, and Bayern Munich are all vying for his signature.

Barca are reportedly hoping that this will compel Leeds to accept a transfer bid, with Raphinha's agent Deco still negotiating with the Elland Road hierarchy.

Despite rival teams being able to offer him a better income, the 25-year-old has reportedly 'given his word' to Barcelona executives that he will sign because he is excited by Xavi's proposal.

Raphinha, who made his senior debut for Brazil in October, has nine goals in 27 Premier League games for Leeds this season.
