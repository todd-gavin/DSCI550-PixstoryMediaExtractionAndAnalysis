August 1-7 is the World Breast Awareness Week. We have been talking to women across our region, all of whom talk about the absence of support systems. In fact, the common thread running through the testimonios of women are families that dismiss childcare and breastfeeding as timepass, as avoidance of work. Swipe left to read the experiences of Uma, Poonam and Gudiya - three women at work in Chitrakoot.
