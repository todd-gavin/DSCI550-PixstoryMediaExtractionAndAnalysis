Chelsea attempts to bounce back from a disheartening loss when it visits Brighton on Tuesday. The Blues saw their hopes of catching Manchester City for first place in the English Premier League take a major hit when they dropped a 1-0 decision on the road against Pep Guardiola's side on Saturday. Chelsea finds itself third in the EPL standings with 43 points, two behind Liverpool for second place and 13 in back of league-leading Manchester City.
