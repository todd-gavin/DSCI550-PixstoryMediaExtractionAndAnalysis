Mary Roy, a celebrated champion of gender equality and a renowned educator, died in Kottayam, Kerala on Thursday. She was 89.
The mother of Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy, Mary was known for winning a landmark Supreme Court case in 1986 that ensured equal rights in family property for women belonging to the Syrian Christian community in Kerala.
Mary had challenged the provisions of the Travancore Succession Act, 1916 and Cochin Succession Act, 1921, which the Syrian Christian community followed. As per the Acts, women in a family were eligible for one quarter of the son’s share or Rs 5,000, whichever was less, if the father died intestate. Mary challenged this, pointing out that members of the community elsewhere in the country were governed by provisions of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, and moved against her brother George Isaac.
However, it was in 2010, 24 years after the Supreme Court’s historical judgment, that a sub-court in Kottayam executed the final decree in favour of Mary and she got a share of the family property, spread across different locations. Of the 27 cents of property, Roy got two portions, her sister Molly three and her brother’s widow Elaine Singleton one piece. “My 50-year battle has finally yielded results. The fight was not for a piece of land, but to win women’s rights guaranteed by the Constitution,” she had reacted then.
