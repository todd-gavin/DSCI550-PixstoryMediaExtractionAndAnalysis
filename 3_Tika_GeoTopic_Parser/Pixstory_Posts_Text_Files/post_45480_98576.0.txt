Everton is ready to sell their number one goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and is open to offers that come in. 
The 28-year-old was arguably man of the match last Sunday when the Toffees secured a vital three points in their bid for Premier League survival in a 1-0 win over Chelsea at Goodison Park. 
There is an argument that his stock has never been higher than it is right now and sources say that he will push for a move if Everton is relegated this season to try and keep his England spot ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. 

Even if the Toffees stay up though, Frank Lampard may take to cash in Gareth Southgate’s number one this summer as he is one of their most saleable assets.

 Tottenham Hotspur and New Castle are the two clubs most keen on signing Pickford but with his previous links to Sunderland, the Magpies may be on the backfoot before the race has already begun. 

This weekend was a stark reminder as to how crucial Pickford has become at Goodison Park and without his expert shot-stopping this season, Everton's fate may already be sealed.
 
Frank Lampard in one of the press conferences said, “You can completely understand why he might want to leave Merseyside this summer, particularly if we are relegated,  we would of course prefer him to stay for a long time yet, we’d still send him best.”


“He has given his all to the club since he arrived at the club from the Stadium of Light in 2017 and he has earned his big move to a top club now.”

Now, it gives Lampard a very tedious task in the summer though with an enormous hole in his side in the most important too.

The Everton scouts are going to have to work very hard to find a potential replacement for the Englishman.
