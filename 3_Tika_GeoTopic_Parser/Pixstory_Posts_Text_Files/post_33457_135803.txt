Son Bhandar Architecturally similar to the ones at Barabar Of the two caves the western one called Son Bhandar consists of a large by and is provided with a doorway and a window It is worth noting here that as described by Kuraishi the door has sloping jambs the width at the top being about inches less than the width at the base which is while the height is The roof is of arched shape with a rise of making the total height of the chamber These are exactly the architectural features quite characteristic and rarely to be found only at Barabar caves hardly miles towards west of Rajgir What is most interesting is the fact that the cave is highly polished inside an important characteristic of the Mauryan era cut caves The polish the vaulted roof and the sloping door jambs of the entrance leave no doubt about the architectural affinities of this cave with those at Barabar In the opinion of Mr Fergusson and Dr Burgess their construction is attributed to the period of the Maurya dynasty Cunningham mentions On Mount Baibhar there are five modern Jain temples besides the ruins of an old Saiva temple of which four granite pillars feet in height are still standing and or smaller pillars are lying confusedly about At the southern foot of the mountain the rock has a natural scarp for about yards in length which at the western end has been smoothed to a height of feet in front of which the rock has been cut away to form a level terrace feet in length by upwards of feet in breadth Two caves have been excavated out of the solid rock behind that to the west now called the Son Bhandar or Treasury of Gold being feet long by feet broad and that to the east perhaps somewhat fallen in naturally through the decay of the rock or which is more probable was blown up by a zemindar in search of treasure as related by Major Kittoe of the other cave
