Magic was in the air at Balenciaga’s post-show celebration in Paris. Hosted by creative director Demna, the decadent dinner gathered fashion’s front row stars, the famous cast who walked the show, and friends of the house to toast Balenciaga’s 51st haute couture collection.

A crowd of fans set up camp in the Place de la Concorde, eager to see their beloved Balenciaga muses make their way into the buzzy cocktail party. Academy Award-winner turned runway model Nicole Kidman arrived with her beau Keith Urban by her side. Dressed to the nines, Tracee Ellis Ross and Samira Nasr enjoyed the breathtaking view of the Paris skyline from the terrace.

Nearby David Blaine caught the attention of Bella Hadid, Emily Ratjkowski, and Dua Lipa while performing an unbelievable card trick. Other notables include Naomi Campbell, Vogue’s Edward Enninful, CL, Alexa Demie, Cédric Charbit, Anok Yai, Offset, Derek Blasberg, Alton Mason, Fai Khadra, Chiara Ferragni, Jaime Xie, Luka Sabbat, and Nadia Lee Cohen.

Of course, everyone was debuting head-to-toe Balenciaga looks straight from the runway. Netflix’s Selling Sunset star turned haute couture model Christine Quinn was caught wearing Balenciaga’s speaker Bang & Olufsen bag, which means that there are only 19 editions left to purchase.
