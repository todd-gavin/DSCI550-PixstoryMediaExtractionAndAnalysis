Erik Ten Hag has reportedly agreed to become the next Manchester United manager. A contract is to be signed between the club and the manager. But the Dutchman has already stated his priorities as per the report.

The current Ajax manager's first job as the Manchester United boss would be to make a decision on transfers. Hence it looks like he has already decided on Cristiano Ronaldo's future at the club. 

As per the Mirror, Erik Ten Hag has reportedly informed the Manchester United chief's that Cristiano Ronaldo is not in his plans. The Dutch manager reportedly feels that Ronaldo would not fit in his team.

Ten Hag has reportedly given the green light to sell the Portuguese icon. Hence it looks likely that Ronaldo would be departing United in the summer much to the dismay of the fans.  

Over the years, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 136 goals for Manchester United in 300+ games. To add to this, he has helped the Red Devils win a UEFA Champions League title and multiple Premier League titles among other trophies. 

Hence with just seven Premier League games remaining, this could be the last chance to see Ronaldo in the famous Red jersey of United. It has to be seen if Erik Ten Hag would change his decision in the coming days. 




What's next for Ronaldo? 

With the FIFA World Cup set to take place in November, it is unlikely that Cristiano Ronaldo would choose to leave Europe for now. The striker is still one of the best players and can represent some of the biggest teams in Europe. 

Rumours suggested that Ronaldo could move to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer. But these rumours have died down since. Hence it is anyone's best guess as to where we could see the iconic number seven play next season.
