For quite some time the industry is in shock as the big budget movie which were expected to do well in the box office is failing miserably. Some actors are forced to bring down their fees. One of the steps industry has taken is to send the movie directly to OTT platforms. 
Shashank khaitan's  Govinda naam mera starring Vicky Kaushal, kiara advani and bhumi pednekar has been sold to Disney hotstar for sum 62 cores. It's a comic entertainer but not a perfect movie in today's time to release on big screen. Hence makers decided to sold it to star networks for sum 62 crores. 
The digital rights are valued at 42 crores and satellite at 20 crores . The initial expectation of market price of the dharma film was 80 crores but the buyers was not ready to buy it at 80. So the deal was finalized at 62 crores . The budget of the flim is equal to the revenue fetched so the movie gets a no profit no loss deal. Which is still better than failing at big screen in today's time.
