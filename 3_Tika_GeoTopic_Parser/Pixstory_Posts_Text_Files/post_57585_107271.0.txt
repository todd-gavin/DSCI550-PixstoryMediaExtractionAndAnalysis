Treating Social anxiety disorders doesn't involve a single therapy or solution; it can be treated depending on the intensity with which it has impacted the person.

Psychotherapy can be an excellent way to treat SAD. Although it includes different types like cognitive behavioural therapy, it can help you reframe some of your beliefs about yourself, leading to more intentional actions and behaviours.
Exposure therapy exposes you to what you fear, individually or in a group setting. Acceptance and commitment therapy helps create a new and more effective relationship, so fear and anxieties do not get in the way of life.


Apart from therapy, people take medications that can reduce the symptoms of panic attacks. Some of the medicines used to treat social anxiety disorder include: 

Antidepressants: This class of medication includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). These can help increase levels of serotonin in your brain.
Beta-blockers: These medications help block the physical symptoms of anxiety. They may lower your heart rate and prevent sweating from happening.
Benzodiazepines: These are anti-anxiety medications you can use temporarily to reduce anxiety.
