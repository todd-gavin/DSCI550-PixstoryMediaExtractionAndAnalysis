Among countless other disruptions, the pandemic also changed the meaning of home for many. For those of us who could afford it, staying at home was the mandate, if not simply the more prudent thing to do. The only permissible activity that promised a relative degree of safety was a walk in the park. 

In the last couple of decades, urban India has witnessed a dramatic shift in the landscape of public parks. Growing up in the 90s, I remember how a Sunday picnic in the park next door was the default recreational choice. The park was the ultimate melting pot, which it no longer seems to be. Although open to the public, each type of park in India’s metropolitan regions goes by an unwritten code of whom it seeks to admit. The gates are open to all, but not everyone is welcome.

Socio-economic stratification, sexual orientation, marital status and gender identification seem to be some of the more pronounced barriers to entry into public parks in India. When I choose to walk in a park in Delhi, air pollution and soaring temperatures notwithstanding, I have to get into the safety of a private vehicle to drive not to the neighbourhood park, but to one far away because it welcomes ‘my kind’ of people. A walk in the park, therefore, is preceded by a drive in the car. Once you choose which park to go to, what you wear to the park is also a matter of careful consideration. I remember having visited a park in the hot month of June in Delhi where I did not feel welcome, and I had to wear my just-in-case jacket despite the heat because I was doing everything to not be ‘seen’. A walk in the park, then, is an exercise in wanting to be, and in not wanting to be seen.

In the pandemic, when I finally found a safe space to be, I realised that getting there is no walk in the park.

What’s your go-to safe space outside the home?
