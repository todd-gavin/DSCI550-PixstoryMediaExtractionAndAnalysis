Donating your old clothes can make someone happy. This is the place where people donate their old clothes for people who need clothes. 

When I clicked this picture, my mind went to the Afghan children who are still suffering from hunger and begging in the streets to can find some amount to feed or buy clothes to cover themselves. 

How it's sad that you are having hope in a country where you don't have any good future. But still, you don't want to give up just because you can do something for your homeland and countrymen.
