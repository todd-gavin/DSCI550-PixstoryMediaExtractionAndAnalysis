How do you describe the Moon,
When it's overexposed and the sun falls short?
The spots feel like perfection,
And every angle sublime.

I'd love to travel through Inferno
Dante would be my guide
He knew the way as Beatrice had once called for him,
Only if she'd just once utter my name mistakenly.

In my dreams every night I scream at Homer,
That Helen isn't the epitome of beauty 
My estranged lover holds that crown. 
Heavy it weighs not; for she's nimble like Zeus' Iris,

Saw her again in the promised land,
I could say nothing,
Just looked down and glided past her,
Into the cosmos of grief,

Nothing ever felt so wrong,
As staring into her eyes for that mere second,
Every memory flashing back,
The past'll never leave my side.

As radiant as Fitzgerald's green light, 
And just as far from my shore...
I reached out just like the trembling Gatsby,
Only to be pulled into oblivion by the waves.

I'd redefine melancholy like him. 
She never lets me try,
Jay was loved by Daisy once,
l'l never have that stature in this life of mine.

As she left the doorstep of my feelings,
The silhouette of her charm and candour,
Still affects my existence,
Everyone calls her wickd but if only they listened...

How cruel their judgement,
Listen to me you insolent fools,
Only I can say whimsical things about her
For she left me in agony that none of you bear.

So, put to silence your tongue.
For me being away from her,
Is the very detail that brings me to her
We'll always be one, thats destined per se.

One day she'll come to this abandoned heart again,
It'll open away for her as the red flare lily,
Does under the moon bloom away,
As my heart will already know...

She'll always be guest under the moon
For I'm Heathcliff or Gatsby.
Only a lover from the wilderness
To be banished when the Dawn calls day.
