As an aspirant filmmaker, more than watching movies or web series, I love to watch behind the scene or making movies or web series.

So, last night I was watching behind the scenes of Netflix’s upcoming series, 1899 and there I got to know about new technology which will help the makers of the web series to get rid of a green screen and the name of the technology is “The Volume Technology.”

So, first let me explain to you, What is Volume Technology?

The Volume Technology is the LED immersive soundstage that many movies and web series have been shot on. An almost 360-degree stage of seamless LED panel screens and a ceiling.

But before shooting the scene, the filmmakers' team needs to already have a virtual backdrop set up, whether it is entirely made from scratch in CGI, layered images or footage of real scenery. 

And when the time for shooting comes, the director will block the scene according to the background and the actors will act with the proper movement as per the background.

Why The Volume Technology is better than the green screen technology?

First of all, the Green screen has many limitations as compared to The Volume because after shooting the movie on a green screen, post-production will consume a lot of time for the editors and the release of movies or web series will take time and another difficulty that comes with green screen is lighting scenes while avoiding reflections and the challenge of matching filming to environments added in later stages of editing.

On the other hand, with The Volume, the pre-production stage of creating the backdrops takes time and the lighting off the LED screens matches the set to the actors and environments are visible to all while filming is taking place.

The List of movies or web series that used the Volume technology is as follows:-

1. The Mandalorian (Season 1and 2)

2. The Batman (2022)

3. 1899 (Upcoming series on Netflix)

4. Ant-Man - Quantumania (Upcoming Marvel movie)
