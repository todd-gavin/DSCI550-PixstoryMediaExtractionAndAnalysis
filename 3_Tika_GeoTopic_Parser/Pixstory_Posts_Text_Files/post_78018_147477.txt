Gobi Manchurian Gobi Manchurian is always a veg option for me Recently me and my friends found a super budget friendly fast food near our hostel The main attractions are veg Noodles fried rice Manchurian etc at So if you are some where near Arakere go to Sri Krishna Udupi Veg hotel and try these dishes It s delicious
