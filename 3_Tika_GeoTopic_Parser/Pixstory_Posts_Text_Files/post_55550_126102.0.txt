No tattoo place is safe and that’s a fact! The procedure of giving a tattoo is not regulated and there are no laws to assure that it is a safe procedure. So your tattoo safety is completely dependent on goodwill of your artist which further proves why you should not get a tattoo! 

As authority tattoo states, it’s challenging to know what goes into tattoo ink since there are no FDA regulations, and almost every brand uses different ingredients. This immediately poses a risk of infection and even cancer!

Moreover, in the wrong amounts, heavy metals used as colourants in tattoo ink are deadly, and subpar tattoo ink has been linked to everything from cancer to mild allergy reactions. 

So is it really worth it?
