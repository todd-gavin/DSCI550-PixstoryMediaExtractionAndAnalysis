Spoken Peer Pressure:

Spoken peer pressure takes place when a suggestion, request or encouragement is communicated persuasively. The person being targeted is more likely to uphold his or her essential values and beliefs if this is done in a one-on-one setting. The peer pressure to join the group, however, is extremely strong if the spoken influence occurs within a group.

Unspoken Peer Pressure 
Unspoken peer pressure is being exposed to the behaviors of one or more peers and being given the option of joining in or not. This could manifest in terms of personal interactions, clothing preferences, and even joining someone in a rather immoral act. Many young adolescents lack the mental development needed to restrain impulses and make responsible long-term decisions. Because they want to fit in, they tend to give in to it more.

Direct Peer Pressure:
This is the kind of peer pressure that is extremely mentally draining and often leads teens or kids to "regret". In this, a teen is put in a position where they have to make sudden, on the spot decisions and don't have the time to think them through. It could be spoken or unspoken. An example includes sudden sexual advances, persuading someone to drink alcohol or do drugs at a party or even making impulsive plans.

Indirect Peer Pressure:
A rather complicated one to figure out. It's similar to unspoken peer pressure and doesn't make a direct persuasion of a task. It makes teens feel the need to be accepted by getting engaged in tasks they wouldn't otherwise â€“ in a way that's influencing them indirectly. For example, overhearing a gossip and engaging in it.
