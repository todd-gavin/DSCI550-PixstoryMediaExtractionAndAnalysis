"We are happy to cooperate with Netflix in showing Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery in our cinemas. I believe that this experiment could mean a breakthrough for both the theatrical industry and Netflix and can pave the way for a stronger cooperation in the future, as Netflix big budget movies for sure belong on the big screen at first. The huge success of Knives Out and the great reactions to Glass Onion in the Toronto Film Festival makes us confident that the movie will have strong performance in cinemas”.
