With the permission of my dear poet, the name of this beautiful poem is Azadi. 
I am a free lale, we grow by ourselves and we smell by ourselves
I have a place in the plain, I have the same nature as a deer
 My water is rain, no matter how much I drink
The environment there is tight, we don't go in the garden
I am a free lale, we grow by ourselves and we smell by ourselves
It is from the blood of my veins, I am proud
Mashata does not want the beauty of my face
Fixed on my own stem, regardless of my helper
A straw in my need, a straw in my grief

I am a free lale, we grow by ourselves and we smell by ourselves
A breeze comes every morning, for the purpose of my circumambulation
The eyes of the deer are bright from seeing me
I am burning my lamp, in the corner of this maman
I have enough butterflies, confused by my surroundings
