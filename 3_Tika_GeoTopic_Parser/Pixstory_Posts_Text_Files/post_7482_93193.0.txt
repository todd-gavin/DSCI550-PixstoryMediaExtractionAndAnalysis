1. Pebble Bar

67 W 49th St
New York, NY 10112

(646) 669-7847

A number of high-profile chefs — including JJ Johnson of Fieldtrip and Igancio Mattos of Lodi —have slowly been opening up at Rockefeller Center and helping make the Midtown tourist trap a place New Yorkers actually want to visit. Newly opened Pebble Bar, which sits in a historic four-story townhouse, is the cocktail destination in the area. A team of nightlife veterans, and some celebrity investors, have transformed what was an Irish bar into a seen-and-be-seen bar. The classic cocktails take on names inspired by the location, such as the Martini 1-H named after what NBC, another Rock Center tenant, called the bar, “Studio 1-H.”

 2. Chez Zou

385 9th Ave Suite 85 4th Floor
New York, NY 10001

Chez Zou feels like a natural extension of the bustling, wood-fired restaurant Zou Zou’s with its plush velvet seats and tropical plants strewn throughout. The team behind the buzzy Mediterranean restaurant at Manhattan West opened this lounge in March to give its cocktails a bigger stage. Beverage director Joey Smith puts twists on classics like a saffron gin martini served with a glass vessel that looks like it could be an art gallery piece. An outdoor terrace is slated to open later in the spring, according to the bar’s representatives.

3. Thyme Bar

20 W 23rd St
Cellar, NY 10010

(646) 600-9257

This Flatiron lounge follows the hidden speakeasy model: New Yorkers snake their way through the front of a bakery and down a set of steep stairs into a dimly lit intimate space. The Prohibition-era similarities end there as the cocktails take a creative turn under the direction of bartender Jeremy La Blanche. It’s like watching a show unfold with drinks like the Gynoecium Old Fashioned, where one glass is for sipping and another is billowing with smoke for the leathery aromas of the classic bourbon cocktail.

4. Bandits

44 Bedford St
New York, NY 10014

(917) 261-6447

A ’70s-themed diner collides with highbrow cocktail-making at stylish West Village newcomer Bandits.
