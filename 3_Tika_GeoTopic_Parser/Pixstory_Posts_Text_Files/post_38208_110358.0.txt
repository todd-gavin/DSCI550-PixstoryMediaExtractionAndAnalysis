Chelsea football club have undergone a massive change in their management after Todd Boehly purchased the club from Roman Abramovich. The USA-based owner wants to make an instant impact in the club and he can do so with a marquee signing. Here are three possible players that Chelsea can sign this summer,



1. Raheem Sterling

The Manchester City star could be heading out of the club this summer. Chelsea have already made two bids for Raheem Sterling and with Foden, and Grealish available to play on the left wing, Pep Guardiola could quite possibly sell Sterling in the summer transfer window.



2. Neymar

Recent reports indicate that Neymar could be leaving PSG in the summer. In this case, Chelsea look to be the ideal location for the Brazilian if he decides to make a move to the Premier League. Neymar would be one of the best possible signings to get the Todd Boehly era underway. 



3. Cristiano Ronaldo 

The Portuguese star would certainly be a shocker on this list. Reports claim that Ronaldo could leave Manchester United to play in the Champions League and Chelsea have emerged as one of the "favourites" to sign him recently. Though United doesn't want to let him go, there is a chance that we could see Ronaldo in blue next season!
