When I was about 6 my parents decided that I should know how to ride a cycle . So they started teaching me , my father would support the cycle from behind while I rode it and once he let go I would fall down .I got a lot if cuts and bruises from it , after 8 days of doing the same thing I was not getting any better . 

My mother thought that maybe we will try next year , but my father said we will do it for a few more days If I dont get it ,then we will leave it. But well surprisingly I got the hang of it and was able to balance myself on the cycle .
Though I didn't realize at that time but I learnt a very important lesson from a father ,  not giving up and getting hurt are important on the path to success.
