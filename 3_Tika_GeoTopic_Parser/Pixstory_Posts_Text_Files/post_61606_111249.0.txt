Despite recently losing the title to Doudrop, Dana Brooke has become synonymous with the 24/7 division on WWE Raw in recent months. Her incredibly entertaining title reign saw everything from a double wedding that descended into chaos to her declaring she wanted to divorce her new husband Reggie just a few weeks later.

However, she was noticeably absent from the red brand on the June 27th edition of the show. The star has now taken to social media to reveal that she “got into a bad car accident” but plans to be back in no time. She also thanked her fans for their support.

Kevin Owens was also absent from Raw this past week. While it was rumoured that he was dealing with a minor injury, Owens said that he just didn't want to be in Texas, continuing his character work earlier this year, before he competed against Stone Cold Steve Austin
