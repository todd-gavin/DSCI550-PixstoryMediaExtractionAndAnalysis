 Behold children are a heritage from the Lord the fruit of the womb a reward Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one s youth Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate Psalm Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea Mark ESV There s a special place in hell for those who hurt kids let alone murder them The Uvalde school shooting shattered my heart and with me crushed all of the world s souls May the innocent souls rest in peace and get the highest place in heaven May God be kind on their families and put hell to the ones who let this happen The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit
