US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan on August 2, 2022, amid tensions with China. Nancy Pelosi issued a statement after arriving in Taiwan. In the official address, she said that the visit of the American congressional delegation to Taiwan honours the country’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy.

Against this backdrop, a video of multiple fighter planes flying simultaneously is viral on social media. This video has been recorded from a ship in the middle of the sea. While sharing the clip, many have claimed that US Navy fighter jets were seen flying near Taiwan ahead of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

Journalist Aji Rasheed Ali associated with Zee Media tweeted the video and wrote that the world was on the verge of World War III as US Navy warplanes were flying near Taiwan. He added, “Before Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, there were still many strong statements from China. Tension in the region has reached its highest level.”
