The reason of this repair is that on the east side of the terrace there grew a pipal tree which the Buddhs call Buddh Brup, and some of them allege that it was planted by a King of Singala before the temple was built, while the Burma messengers alleged that it  was planted by Asoka Dharma. The orthodox with equal probability allege that it was planted by Brahma, and it is an object of worship with all. It is a fine tree in full vigour, and in all probability cannot exceed 100 years in age, and had probably sprung from the ruins long after they had been deserted. A similar tree however may have existed there when the temple was entire. Around the roots has been raised a circular heap of brick and plaster in various concentric stages, and on one of these have been placed, in a confused heap, various images and carved fragments of stone taken from the ruins. On the pedestal of one of the images representing what the orthodox call Hargauri, the messengers of Ava engraved their names and the date of their arrival.”

The above reference reflects the understanding and actual condition of those times. 

The sanctum inside the Great Temple is double storied and has a vaulted roof plastered over and ornamented with rows of panels each containing a small Buddha figure. Along its western wall is a raised pedestal of black basalt for the enshrined image of the Buddha, with the granite paved floor in its front. The floor slabs bear carvings of figures of pilgrims, on their knees, facing the pedestal and holding the flags or offerings. The Shiva-linga installed later, is placed in the centre of the sanctum. 

The ante-chamber in front of the sanctum and the entrance porch have, both of them, vaulted roofs. The total height of the building from the basement floor to the top of the pinnacle is about 160 feet.
