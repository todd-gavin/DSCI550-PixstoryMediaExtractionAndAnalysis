Hemoglobin is a protein that's found in our red blood cells and these are essential for carrying the oxygen around the body. 
In order to transport the oxygen, hemoglobin carries carbon dioxide out of the cells and then into the lungs. Carbon dioxide is then eventually released as the person exhales. Low hemoglobin can make it difficult for the body to perform its various functions. 
How to increase hemoglobin 
By increasing the iron intake 
Iron rich foods are a great source of hemoglobin can be beneficial for those who have less hemoglobin. It also helps in forming iron rich foods like meat and fish, eggs, soy products. 
To increase folate intake 
Folate is a kind of vitamin B which plays a pivotal role in hemoglobin production. The body makes use kf folate to make the heme which is a component of hemoglobin which helps to carry oxygen. 
If a person does not get the needed folate their red blood cells will not be able to mature, which could also lead to folate deficiency anemia and low hemoglobin levels. 
Some of the good sources are as follows: 
Beef 
Spinach 
Rice 
Peanuts 
To maximizing iron absorption 
By consuming iron in foods or supplements is necessary, but a person should also help their body to absorb that iron. 
Foods that are filled with vitamin C like citrus fruits, strawberries, leafy veggies can increase the amount of iron being absorbed.
