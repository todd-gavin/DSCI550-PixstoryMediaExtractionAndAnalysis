Do Gemstones Work—No They
Don’t for 90% of the People

c. One has to be initiated into a mantra by a Guru—the divine preceptor who will teach the finer nuances of the mantra chanting to the individual and also transfer a part of his/her spiritual strength. This process together is called as Deeksha and Shaktipat.

d. Mantra chanting has to be in a rhythm with a proper flow of syllables 
as Mantras basically work by sound waves. For example Hreeng is different from Hreem which in turn is different from Hareeng. Incorrect chanting and choice of wrong mantra creates havoc in an individual’s life and brings more problems including delusion. I have seen many families get troubled by the random and incorrect chanting of the Gayatri Mantra—Yes, the most powerful, divine and pure mantra. Individuals start chanting this mantra indiscriminately after reading a web page and the result is frequent quarrels and confrontations at home leading to a vicious atmosphere.

e. One has to be aware of the fact that most of the mantras have flowed from Shiva and Shakti. At the start of the Kaliyuga (The present time frame), Lord Shiva, after observing the abuse of mantras by human beings, for meeting selfish ends and causing of pain to other individuals made all mantras Kilita, i.e. put a spiritual lock to them. Most of the mantras that we see today are a modified form of the original mantra wherein a particular syllable or a sound factor has been eliminated to create a spiritual lock to make the mantra dysfunctional. To make the mantra an effective one again we have to perform practices such as Utkilana (removal of spiritual lock) and Shapodhara (removal of the spiritual curse). The individuals who are aware of these practices are surely a very rare breed.
