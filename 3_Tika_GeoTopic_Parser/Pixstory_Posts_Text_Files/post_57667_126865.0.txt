Four elements explain the occurrence of negativity bias; Paul Rozin and Edward Poyzman explained this.
The four elements are negative potency, steeper negative gradients, negativity dominance and negative differentiation.

Negative potency describes the idea that though negative and positive events or memories may be equal in magnitude or emotionality, they are not necessarily equally salient.

Another one is a steeper negative gradient; an upcoming dental surgery's negative experience is regarded as more and more negative as the date of the appointment approaches, meaning there is a steep negative gradient. "Rozin and Royzman found that adverse events are perceived as increasingly hostile and thus have a more vertical angle than positive events are. Positive developments then have a flatter gradient in comparison to adverse events."

Negativity dominance describes the tendency for the combination of positive and negative items/events/etc. to skew towards an overall more negative interpretation than would be suggested by the summation of the individual positive and negative components.

Negative differentiation is consistent with evidence suggesting that the conceptualization of negativity is more elaborate and complex than that of positivity. For instance, research indicates that negative vocabulary is more richly descriptive of the affective experience than that positive vocabulary.
