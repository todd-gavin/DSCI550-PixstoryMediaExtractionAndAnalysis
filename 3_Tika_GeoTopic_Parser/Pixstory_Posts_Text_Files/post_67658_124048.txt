Jyoti Bhatt visited the faculty of fine arts MSU recently contributing a talk on his impressive vast experience in the world of arts He is an Indian painter printmaker and photographer known for colourful works that combine a graphic sensibility with traditional Indian folk design as well as an extensive archive of photographs of the Indian countryside Bhatt moved from a cubist influence in his early work to a lighthearted and colorful Pop Art that often drew its imagery from traditional Indian folk designs Though Bhatt worked in a variety of mediums including watercolors and oils it is his printmaking that ultimately garnered him the most attention In Bhatt returned to M S U Baroda with a thorough knowledge of the intaglio process that he had gained at the Pratt Institute at Brooklyn in New York It was partially Bhatt s enthusiasm for intaglio that caused other artists such as Jeram Patel Bhupen Khakhar and Gulam Mohammed Sheikh to take up the same process Bhatt and his compatriots at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda soon came to be known as The Baroda School of Indian art Late in the s Bhatt was asked to take photographs of Gujarati folk art Initially this work was done for a seminar but it soon became one of the artist s passions to document traditional Indian craft and design work The disappearing arts of rural Gujarat became a focus Though Bhatt s investigations into a village and tribal designs certainly influenced the motifs he used in his printmaking Bhatt considers his documentary photographs to be an art form in themselves His direct and simply composed photographs have become valued on their own merit Throughout Bhatt s long career as a teacher at the M S U Faculty of Fine Arts he has photographed the evolution of the university the artistic activities of its faculty and students and the architecturally significant buildings of Baroda This huge body of work is perhaps the best assembled photographic documentation that pertains to The Baroda School of Indian art
