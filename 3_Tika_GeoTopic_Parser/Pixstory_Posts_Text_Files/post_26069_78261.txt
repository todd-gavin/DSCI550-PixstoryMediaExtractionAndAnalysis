The one who wanted to enhance our lives with mindfulness has been left to enhance the interiors of our house It is really sad to see how BUDDHA the philosopher of spirituality has turned into an object of decoration and reduced to the status of just a mere statue We might daily encounter art representing his divinity through even tattoos merchandise and souvenirs like keyrings fridge magnets and furniture During his lifetime Buddha preached how petty materialism is he chose simplicity over fancy elaborations and wanted his disciples to follow the same Beauty lies within human interactions with others their life lessons and not necessarily in the artefacts attributed to showcase their grandeur Similarly Buddha a symbol of beauty in expression interaction and a guide to the right conduct of life is best showcased in his teachings and not in his sculptures or the artefacts It is essential to understand Buddha s significance and his teachings more than just decorating him in the living room The symbols associated with him best describe the aura we can use as people to recognize his support in the present world Even if we want to place him and remember him as a constant reminder of peaceful living and righteous conduct it is better to keep him in our mind and follow it practically It s a better way of acknowledging his contribution than just turning him into a fountain illuminating our gardens Buddha and water are complementary both stand for well being and calmness but it s better to associate them in literal words and not precisely by putting them together Like Buddha could give up his luxury and move towards the right path but the difficult one even generation z can move towards a better beautification of life through words actions and feelings more than forging appearances and popularizing commercialization of a mentor who s teachings cannot be valued and sold in the market If the Sakya prince could give up everything then even we can move towards minimalism Buddha is more than just a person to be decorated it s about his teachings to be cherished and made a part of our lives more than just a showpiece
