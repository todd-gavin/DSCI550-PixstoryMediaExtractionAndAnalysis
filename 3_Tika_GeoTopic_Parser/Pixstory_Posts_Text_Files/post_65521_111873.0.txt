There are different types of clouds, some are fluffy and white while others are dark and stormy. The sky can be a deep blue, or a bright orange depending on the time of day. In fact, the beauty is all around.  The sun and the moon can be seen in the sky, as well as stars on a clear night. Sky is always changing, and it is always beautiful. It is a great place to relax and take in the beauty of nature.
