Deepika would be seen in a Korean series and will work with Gong Yoo but she is not the lead. She will play lawyer in the show. Its going to be a romantic comedy.

This will be the greatest Indo- Korea combination for Bollywood and Korean Industry.

Nothing is confirmed as of yet but if this happens it will be a blockbuster for sure.
 DAYUMMMMMM!!! I'M EXCITED AS HELL!!! 😩🤌❤️
