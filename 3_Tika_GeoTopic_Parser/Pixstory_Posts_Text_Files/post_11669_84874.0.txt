CHARACTERISTICS OF A NUTRITIOUS DIET before talking about the characteristics lets see 2 other topics which are really important.
Nutrient density:  A measure of the nutrients provided in a food per kcalorie of that food.
The nutrient density of a food depends on the amount of nutrients it contains and the comparison of that to its kcaloric content. Nutrient-dense foods and beverages are lean or low in solid fats, and have little or no sugar or sodium added to them. All vegetables, fruits, whole grains, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, unsalted nuts and seeds, fat-free and low-fat milk and milk products, and lean meats and poultry—when prepared without adding solid fats or sugars
Empty-kcalorie foods: Foods with added solid fats or sugar that provide few nutrients for the number of kcalories they contain.
A nutritious diet has four characteristics. It is:
Adequate diet : A diet that provides enough kcalories,  essential nutrients, and fiber to maintain health.
Moderate diet :  A diet that avoids excessive amounts of
kcalories or any particular food/food group or nutrient.
Balanced diet :  A diet in which foods are chosen to provide
kcalories, essential nutrients, and fiber in the right
proportions.
Varied diet : A diet in which you eat a wide selection of foods to get necessary nutrients.
