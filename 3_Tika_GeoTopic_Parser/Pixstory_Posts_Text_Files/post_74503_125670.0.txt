Now Suniel Shetty has reacted to the boycott culture.💯

Over the past few weeks, #BoycottLaalSinghChaddha and #BoycottRakshaBandhan have been trending on Twitter. Netizens have been digging up both superstars’ old comments, and videos that are often taken out of context and shared in a misleading way.⬇️⬇️💯
In the latest interview Suniel Shetty said that netizens calling for a boycott of these films are unfair. “We all work hard. We all aim to do well, our intentions are good. Aamir Khan’s intentions have always been good. He is somebody who could have chosen five films a year, but he chose to do one film in five years and I think we need to respect that. As far as Akshay Kumar goes, there is a continuous effort of wanting to do something and deliver entertaining films. We are entertainers and we go by public choice also.” ✅✅✅✅
