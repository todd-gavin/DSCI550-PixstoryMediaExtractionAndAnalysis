Oregon Coast & Forests Road Trip

You'll pass Portland, the quirky city with charming seaside towns. You'll do mountain climbing, visit hot springs, and visit one of America's most beautiful national parks. Let's get started! If you have the time, visit Mount Hood National Forest, which has plenty of hiking opportunities. Stop for a picnic at Trillium Lake, which offers unsurpassed views of the volcanic peak. Spend a couple of days in Crater Lake National Park taking in the scenery and hiking, and in Umpqua National Forest looking for hot springs.

Glacier National Park 

Along this show-stopper of a road, you might see a family of bears crossing the street or a mountain goat or two hanging out in their natural habitat, and you'll definitely see a slew of epic waterfalls (including some of the state's most beautiful), sweeping vistas made for your smartphone's pano mode, and massive conifers. This day trip is only accessible for a few months each year when the snow is ploughed and finally melts away in mid-June, but when that time comes, take advantage of it to visit Glacier National Park in Montana and its famed Going-to-the-Sun Road.

The Big Five, Utah 

This is one of the best road trips in the United States if you're interested in scorching geography. Because of its number of national parks, the country's southwestern region is a popular tourist destination for both domestic and international visitors. The region is known as 'The Big Five,' since it contains five national parks. Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Arches, Zion National Park, and Capitol Reef National Park are just a few of them.
