With a striking new style, Lil Uzi Vert recently made appearances at the music festivals Summer Smash and Something In The Water. No, not referring to the Kodak Black-inspired hairstyle or the full-body Balenciaga outfits he recently shared on Instagram. We're referring to the enormously complex tattoos on his chest and back that depict a Japanese oni mask and a samurai helmet .

The most recent tattoo that Uzi got wasn't your typical tattoo. Joaquin Ganga, a highly skilled tattoo artist, tells Complex that Uzi's most recent tattoo cost well over six figures and was a difficult effort.

It was divided into 16-hour total labour time into two 8-hour sessions. 

One of the most highly prized tattoo artists right now is Ganga, who owns and operates his own tattoo shop in Los Angeles. The 30-year-old tattoo artist began his career in body art while still a teenager growing up in Spain. He has tattooed everyone from Lebron James to Lil Durk, who boasted that he paid $200,000 for Ganga to ink his thighs for the song "Federal Nightmares." 

Because of his hyper-realistic approach and attention to detail, Ganga has amassed an amazing roster of famous clients. Ganga's precise tattoos speak for themselves, whether she's inked a Tupac portrait for Los Angeles Lakers player Anthony Davis or Virgil Abloh throwing a kite for Drake.
