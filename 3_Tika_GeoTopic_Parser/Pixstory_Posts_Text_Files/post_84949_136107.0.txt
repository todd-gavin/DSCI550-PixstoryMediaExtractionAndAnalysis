Premier League giants, Chelsea were extremely busy on the final day of the summer transfer window. Having announced the arrival of Pierre Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona and the
departure of Marcos Alonso, Chelsea have also announced the signing of Denis Zakaria.
The Swiss international had been associated with Juventus, Zakaria has joined the Premier League side on a loan from Juventus which also includes a buy-option reportedly around £30m. Zakaria rose to fame playing for the Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach. His stint with Juventus, however, hasn’t been as rewarding. He was ruled out for the majority of the season due to an adductor injury and could make only 13 appearances for the Old Lady in the 2021-22
Serie A season.
Zakaria has been a defensive midfielder for the majority of his career so far and he has had the
opportunity to represent the Swiss International team in the 2018 FIFA World Cup and also in the 2021 Euros.
After his move to Stamford Bridge, Zakaria said, 
"I want to say hi to all the Chelsea fans. I’m very happy and proud to be a Blue and I cannot wait to see you soon at Stamford Bridge.""Denis is a talented midfielder with lots of quality and skill. He will add depth and range to our squad this season, and we are looking forward to watching him play in Chelsea blue"
Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly said.
Chelsea have not had the finest of starts to their Premier League campaign this season.
Currently, they are in the 10th spot in the Premier League points table, having won just 2 of the 5 matches that they have played so far. The draw against Tottenham, who clinched a goal in Injury Time against Thomas Tuchel’s side, seems to be hurting them still.
With Aubameyang joining the side and Zakaria making it too, Tuchel and his team might come
with reformed energy in their next outing against West Ham at Stamford Bridge on September 03.
