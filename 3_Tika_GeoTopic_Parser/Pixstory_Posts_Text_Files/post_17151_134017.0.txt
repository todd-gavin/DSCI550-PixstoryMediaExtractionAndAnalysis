Alia bhatt and Ranbir kapoor recently seen promoting their film in IIT Bombay ðŸŽ¬âœ…
During the promotional event, Ranbir revealed what makes his Brahmastra character Shiva different from his other roles. He said: "The personality of Shiva that I really admire and he says in the film that 'Jab bhi kuch andhera ho toh light ko dhundho' and it means that light uss roshni ka naam hai jo hum sabke andheron se badi hai. Aur aap kaha dhundte ho yeh light? Apni doston ki hassi mein, sadakon mein, canteen ki omelette pav mein, ek achi film mein, Alia mein. I think the philosophy of positivity in such hard times. 
There's a lot of negativity in the world. I think the search for positivity and light is something that Shiva does."ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
