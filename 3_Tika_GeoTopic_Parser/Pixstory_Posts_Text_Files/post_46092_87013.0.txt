After Ukraine was invaded by Russia over two weeks ago, Vice President Harris stated that the US will continue to support the country. 

"The United States stands solidly with the Ukrainian people in support of the NATO alliance," Harris said at a DNC meeting in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. "This hostility will not leave us unaffected by the ocean that separates us." 

Ukraine is not a NATO member. 

New York Post reported that after returning from a trip to Poland to monitor the regional situation, the vice president addressed the friendly audience. 

"When I spoke with our allies, I underscored that our greatest strength is unity, especially at this time when we are standing together in defence of democracy and in favour of the rule of law." she said. 

She emphasised that everything we are watching on television she know makes us understand and feel the importance of this moment on many levels.
