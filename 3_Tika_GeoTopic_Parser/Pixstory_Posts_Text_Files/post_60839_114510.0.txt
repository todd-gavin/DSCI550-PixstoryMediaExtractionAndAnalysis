Bangalore residents often boast about the city's good weather. Social media is flooded with memes every summer comparing places scorched by the sun to Bangalore having a moderate temperature.

Has anyone ever stopped to wonder why Bangalore weather is so good? Bangalore is just geographically lucky.

The climate here is moderate and pleasant all year round with very little humidity. The following reasons explain how we remain cool even during the summer.

1) Bangalore is located at the centre of the southern peninsula. The city is flanked by the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on either sides. India has two monsoon branches (the Arabian sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch). It's also known as the South-West monsoon and North- East monsoon. Naturally, Bangalore receives the best of both of these monsoons because it's centrally located. One hits the city in May and the other around October.

2) Altitude: The city stands at 3000 ft from sea level. The higher the altitude, the colder it gets. Therefore, the elevation also plays a crucial role in keeping the climate here moderate.

3) Cyclone spill-overs: Neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha that are close in proximity and affected by cyclones give Bangalore spill-over showers. That's another reason this city gets so much rain.

I love the fact that we don't have to spend money on electricity bills because air conditioning is a luxury we don't really require. We do face waterlogging problems due to the constant rains. Accidents also increase due to puddles and potholes. It's also inconvenient to dry laundry.

I still love this city and can put up with the minor inconveniences despite all the rains.
