I had a question harbouring in my head to all of you is that "what's your favourite South Indian cuisine"?  So, in my perception, the answer to this question would be"Dosa", right? I do love this dish since I ate it for the first time in my life. Whenever it comes on the table, my mouth would be flooded with the water. So tell me what's your favourite South Indian cuisine.
