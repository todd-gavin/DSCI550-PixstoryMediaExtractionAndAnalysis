So today I went out with my school best friends after good long two years and it was such a great feeling to catch up with your old friends and tbh I really missed them through all these days of us being busy in our lives and academic pressure but this date out together made us all unite back So the first thingy we did was to get our food coz that s important for all of us foodie fellows so the thingy which has always been our comfort food is Chinese We all had a great time together
