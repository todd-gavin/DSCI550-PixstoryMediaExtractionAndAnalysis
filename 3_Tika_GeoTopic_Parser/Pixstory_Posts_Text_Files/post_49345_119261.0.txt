Music instruction is a great way for kids to learn about music and have fun at the same time. The benefits of music instruction are numerous and it is extremely advantageous to kids. A child who participates in music makes scholastic gains, gains social skills, and finds a creative outletâ€”all of which are important for a child's development. Music instruction can help children develop skills like listening, speaking, and reading that they will use throughout their lives. Reading is the foundation of learning how to understand music. The more you play an instrument, the better you will be able to understand how it works and how to apply it in your own life. Music lessons can also help kids with language development because they will be exposed to new words through songs. Kids who take piano lessons often develop stronger writing skills because they are required to write down new pieces that they learn from their teachers as well as analyze pieces that they already know so that they can understand them better. Learning new vocabulary words helps students build vocabulary skills and improve their reading comprehension.
