Today, let's start a conversation about a special month that should be a lot more recognized. It brings me most joy to do so as I am a big time mommas boy and enthusiast of the strength, bravery, determination of all women. We must go back to March 8, 1857, to find the origins of National Women's History Month, when a group of women in New York City factories staged a protest over poor working conditions. With that being said, the first Women's Day celebration in the United States was in 1909, also in New York City. The execution of the first woman's History week celebration was completed by an Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on the Status of Women in 1978. Consequently, in March 1980, after celebrations had spread across the country, President Jimmy Carter declared that March 8 was officially the start of National Women's History Week. Let the celebration begin of putting on display all the remarkable beautiful, intelligent, strong, diverse women of the world.
