Hitting is sheer violence Let it be done by teachers or parents or anyone Children are up to mischief all the time big or small it is to be corrected by the parents Do you really think a child who is a bully after getting punishment stops his violence or uses his frustration on others so what is the alternative here Children doing extreme violence are mostly sighted in having traumas Sit and listen to them or take them to a therapist with whom they can talk freely Violence is never an option here You can never prevent violence by violence Recently when I talked to a therapist dad hitting me still remains a horrifying experience in my mind I believe we as a generation have more access to alternatives and hence can be friendly to our children After you beat them for everything they don t complain that they didn t take care of you or they hate you because you instilled hate in their minds In schools corporal punishment can result in undermining the teacher student relationship You teach them violence is wrong and you do the same to them Fear and respect are not the same Hitting can only put fear in the mind of students It is an outdated way of controlling children and will present the school as old fashioned and behind the times Also if something occurs to the child you punish have you considered your guilt ridden mental health Children learn from the teachers and use physical punishments on other children It is just plain immoral we don t allow adults to hit each other to get their way why should it be allowed in schools
