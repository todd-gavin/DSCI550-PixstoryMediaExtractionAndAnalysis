We've all heard teachers say we have nothing against you, we only want the best for you and to teach you properly. 
But when they do stuff like this, it's hard to keep such a view of them in mind😂
I get you want me to do well but let the kids who want to answer, answer and I'll listen and learn. Why put me through that pressure and waste time and take the other kids enthusiasm 😂🤦‍♀️
