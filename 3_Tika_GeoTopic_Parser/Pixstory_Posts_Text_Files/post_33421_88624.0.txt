As I laid my hands on the old report, I was overjoyed to see the spirit of learning then prevailing in Bihar, when, in 1952, in pursuance of a general appeal to the students of the G.D. College to collect information from their localities and, if possible, to bring objects of antiquarian value for the Jayaswal Archaeological and Historical Society and Museum, information reached Prof. R. K. Choudhary, the then President of the Society, about the existence of ancient mounds and images at Jaimanglagarh. On 20th April, 1952, Prof. Choudhary was deputed by the Principal to make a preliminary survey of the site as well as to collect information relating to its antiquity. The report published thereafter in the college’s bulletin admitted that a full scale and complete exploration of the area covering about 25 sq. miles, was beyond the resources of the society, and expected that such work could be undertaken either by the Department of Archaeology or the Ministry of Education, whose attention was drawn to the importance of the discovery for reconstructing the history of a forgotten period in North Bihar. It is interesting to recall that 3 students then studying in the 4th year at the college namely Messrs. Ramudgar Singh, Ramsagar Singh and Baijnath Jha had assisted in the exploration of the site in which Sri Kunjbehari Sharma of the Chitrakala Studio was the cameraman.
