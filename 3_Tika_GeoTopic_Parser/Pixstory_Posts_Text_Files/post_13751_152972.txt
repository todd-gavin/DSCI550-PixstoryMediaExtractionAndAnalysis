Manchester United s win over Omonia was a fair reflection of how Cristiano Ronaldo has fallen Contributing little to play and missing chances that were being put on a plate it became a sorry reminder of how even the greatest fall and not everyone can last forever Ronaldo s performances haven t ever been great at United despite him scoring goals since returning and it is the lack of realisation of this fact that hampers everyone While he hangs onto a false hope that it isn t true United remain stuck to a fallen giant having to play because he s there or out of external media pressures It is certainly hurtful to see a disregard for what he s achieved in the past because of his natural regression Admitting his obvious decline and being honest about it can reduce a lot of damage for everyone or it will turn Ronaldo into a villain even where he s considered a hero
