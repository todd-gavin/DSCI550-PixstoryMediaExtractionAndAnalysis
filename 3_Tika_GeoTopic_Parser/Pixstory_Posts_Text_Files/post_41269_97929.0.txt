Samuel "Sam" Winchester, along with his older brother Dean, is a fictional character and one of the protagonists of the American drama television series Supernatural. Jared Padalecki plays him the majority of the time. 

As supernaturalwiki tells us, when Eric Kripke, the creator and original showrunner of Supernatural, pitched a programme to the WB about two brothers who investigate the supernatural, he invented Sam Winchester. 

Sam's name is a nod to Sal Paradise from Jack Kerouac's road-trip novel On the Road, which ties in with Kripke's idea for an Americana road-trip TV show.

Sam lives a long life, has a family, and eventually dies of old age after Dean's last death. In Heaven, he is reunited with Dean. 

Sam possesses exceptional mental strength, as proven by his ability to overcome Lucifer's possession. Although Sam might disagree, it has been suggested that he is the smarter or more intelligent of the Winchester brothers. 

Sam has adapted to the hunting lifestyle over time and has demonstrated his selflessness by frequently sacrificing himself for the greater good.
