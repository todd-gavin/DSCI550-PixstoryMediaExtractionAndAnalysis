Let's be straight up. There's nothing healthy about restricting yourself to one type of food, or even a kind of food at each meal. The Mono Diet is purely a fad diet that promises weight loss, and that's about it.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture 2020â€“2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming a variety of nutrient-dense foods, including all types of vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains, dairy products or lactose-free substitutes, fortified soy products, lean protein, eggs, seafood, nuts, and other healthy fats like oils.
Federal guidelines also advise limiting foods and beverages with higher amounts of added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium and limiting the consumption of alcohol.

This is a restrictive diet if I've ever seen one. Diets like this will leave you feeling hungry and so restricted. Eventually, this can lead to binge eating, constantly thinking about food and a poor quality of life. Because quite frankly, you can't live life normally and follow this diet.

Restricting your intake to one food or group is a disordered eating habit and should not be normalized. Dieting is an eating disorder's common (but often overlooked) symptom. I fear Mono-style eating will perpetuate food fear, binge-restrict cycles, and other disordered eating habits.
