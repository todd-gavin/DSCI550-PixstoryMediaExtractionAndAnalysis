Pep Guardiola the manager of Manchester City has remained defiant in the face of mounting rumours about Erling Haaland s possible summer arrival Haaland who has a million release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract has been linked with a move to the Premier League winners Man City have signed a startling agreement with the year old striker after discussing personal conditions and the transfer framework according to MailSport However according to BILD the Citizens will pay more than million in total over the course of a five year arrangement greatly above the million cost Man City would pay million in bonuses based on sporting achievement according to the German site as well as a staggering million between Haaland s agent Mino Raiola and his father Alf Inge When you factor in his million yearly pay it ll easily be one of the most expensive transactions in football history Guardiola was asked about City s interest in Haaland before of this weekend s FA Cup quarter final against Southampton The Catalan coach on the other hand gave no hints as to where the deal is at responding with a two word response Dortmund player He continued Since I m here every month we are going to sign players Right now it s impossible that I m going to talk about some guys who aren t here Haaland is a Dortmund player You can ask for this player or another one The transfer window is going to start and many things will happen Maybe I speak about this club needs a striker for the next five six seven years maybe once in months I m not going to be the guy with the success because we didn t have a striker It s important that if you play well seven or eight players arrive in the box This is the best way
