Another bitter defeat for Manchester United in the Premier league their th of the season With a trophyless season it seems as if they ll be forced to walk away with much less than a Champions League spot A month or so ago that was a real possibility but since the win over Tottenham Hotspur things have only gone downhill Their Champions League elimination at the hands of Atl tico Madrid was terrible as it was then returning to Premier league action with a draw and a defeat makes it worse Realistically these are fixtures a team of United s calibre should ve won really Everton who laboured to a win at home will do well to escape relegation following this win Cristiano Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure up top again Bruno Fernandes Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan Bissaka were perhaps the only decent names on today s United team sheet Ralf Ragnick s number has had a pretty rough few weeks and this was the cherry on the icing on the burnt cake if you ll call it that With a lack of support from his wingers and midfield players Ronaldo is very limited on his own as was evident He missed one of his side s only clear cut opportunities that came from a Harry Maguire pass At the full time whistle at Merseyside the Portuguese was clearly in agony limping off with what seemed to be impact from collisions onto his left leg As he rolled down his socks the shin pads seemed to be pretty bloody from one of the double footed challenges he might ve recieved from an Everton player All in all a very unconvincing night for United Ronaldo s patience probably grows thin but it d be unwise to Expect much better from a team in crisis
