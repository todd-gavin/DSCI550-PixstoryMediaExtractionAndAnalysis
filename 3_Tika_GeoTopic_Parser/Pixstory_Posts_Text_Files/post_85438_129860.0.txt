Great Brazil On Saturday, Ronaldo attended the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as a special guest. IS News reported that he was photographed holding up a replica No. 9 jersey with his name on it before the Spurs vs. Wolverhampton match. 

By the time the game was over, everyone was talking about the goals Tottenham's No. 10 had scored. 

It was a historic day for Harry Kane, who scored his 185th Premier League goal to secure a 1-0 victory for Tottenham, giving him the record for most goals scored for a single club in the league's 30-year existence.

It was also Kane's 250th goal for Tottenham. Jimmy Greaves’ club record of 266 is surely under threat this season.

“It’s been a fantastic nine or 10 years in the Premier League," Kane said. “Hopefully many more years to go.”
