Visit to Narwar Fort Continues

Principal Gates........The Gaumukhi Gate bears and inscription of AD 1800, which was the date of its reconstruction by Ambajee, the Maratha Governor under Doalat Rao Sindhia. The original name was restored by the Marathas from Hawa Paur.

Ancient Remains :- The existing remains of the Hindu period are almost confined entirely to the few inscriptions. But the numerous fragments of sculpture and architectural ornament, which are still to be seen in most of the Muhammadan buildings, are sufficient to show that, in the flourishing days of Hindu sovereignity, it was probably only second to Gwalior in the number and magnificence of its temples and other edifices. 

The almost entire disappearance of the Hindu remains is due to the wholesome destruction by Sikandar Lodhi in 1508 AD. Ferishta relates that this bigoted iconoclast remained there for six months breaking down temples and building mosques. The only work now remaining that can be attributed to Hindu rule is a large tank in the citadel called Magar- Dhwaj or Makara Dhwaja. The name is a Hindu one and is said to be of the Raja under whose expense it was excavated. 

The work must have been rather costly as the tank is 300 square feet at the top and 35 to 36 feet deep, the whole cut out of solid rock. The tank is now quite dry, except for the rainy season. Of a later date, the only objects of interest are the iron gun of Sawai Jai Singh of Amber and the Roman Catholic Chapel and burial ground.

Narwar in recent times :- The city of Narwar is no longer the prosperous place described by the poet Bhavabhuti, but a small town of not more than 4000 houses enclosed by a wall of little strength. It has three gates â€“ Gwalior Gate, Jhansi Gate and the Dobai Gate. 

On all its sides it is surrounded by crumbling houses and mounds of ruins.
