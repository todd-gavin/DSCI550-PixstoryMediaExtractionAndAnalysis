I did ask my grandfather, when I finally realized that Nehru Park and the Dal Lake became a much more, celebrated area. I asked him, Why not here? Why were we living in Wazir Bagh. He gave a very logical explanation, he said, at that point of time, the area wasnâ€™t as developed. And it was like going to the back of beyond, and how could I have taken my family there. So that's how we came to be in Wazir Bagh, grew up in a huge house. He made a huge house, with about 35 to 37 rooms. He ran a large family. 
We were a joint family, a typical Kashmiri family. My grandparents, our family and some of Paternal aunts who had gotten married outside Srinagar- their daughters stayed with us and got educated with us. So there were at one point of time, seven to eight children growing up in varying ages- some 15 some 12, some six , some four.

My mother was a professor of economics at the woman's college and my father was an engineer. And I do remember one more thing about the house, is the huge Veranda, it was a four storey house . Our grandparents lived on the top floor, the kitchen was common. As we grew we did get to get to live in our own individual floors finally, but at that point of time, they were tenants and they were mostly Punjabis. Wazir Bagh was a mixed religion area-there were Punjabi, the Mehras, Suris, the Batras. who worked for the Maharaja and did other businesses in Kashmir, they used to live there. And so some Muslims who had earlier migrants who had sold out houses the downtown, were rich had bought in properties here and had started settling down. So it was a mixed use mixed religious kind of settlement very cosmopolitan now. 
It was very well planned as well.
The Tagore Hall, a theatre and auditorium was close by. There was a stadium next door, a beautiful park called the Iqbal park in the vicinity.
