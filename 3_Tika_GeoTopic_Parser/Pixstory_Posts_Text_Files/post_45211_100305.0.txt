Thomas M端ller has spent the last decade being one of the finest footballers in Germany and
also one of Bayern Munich's aces. From being an academy Graduate at Bayern's academy
to possibly finishing his career as a one-team man, the 32 year-old has come a long way.
And now despite Robert Lewandowski's imminent departure M端ller will continue in Bavaria
for another two seasons at least. He spoke recently of how his career could've easily ended
up differently.

"Bayern clearly rejected the whole thing - despite this insane offer from United." M端ller told of
Manchester United's interest in his signature following the appointment of Louis Van Gaal in
2014. "[But it was a] huge vote of confidence from Bayern."

The club obviously had no doubt with their intentions. In 2014, or today M端ller remains one
of the European games finest playmaking assets. Even as a youngster of tease and poise,
his name attracted other teams in the German Bundesliga, he revealed.

"It was relatively close at the time. Luckily, looking back, [Bayern Munich II boss] Hermann
Gerland fought back with all his might and prevented the transfer."

He also spoke of a relatively difficult time under Niko Kovac, possibly his only time at the
club where he would find himself playing as little as he did.

"Since I didn't get the playing time that I would have liked to have in this phase, I sought a
conversation with the club about all the possibilities."

Things could've been verily different had he left for Manchester United on the back of a successful World Cup with Germany. Or had he not pushed back to regain his place in the
national team after the 2018 debacle.

About the two year renewal, "I'll push that back," he added. "I feel good about it, don't feel
any pressure and have a wide variety of options." He added.
