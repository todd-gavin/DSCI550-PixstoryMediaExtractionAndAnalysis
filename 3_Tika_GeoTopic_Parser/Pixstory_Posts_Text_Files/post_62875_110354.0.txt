Japan embodies an extremely technologically advanced society. Although their way of life and culture are fascinating, they still uphold traditional values in many areas, such as the respect that is shown for others, their surroundings, their time, and their lives.

And honestly? An experience in Japan is one of a kind. Because every part of Japanese culture require such meticulous attention to detail, it is quite difficult to find them elsewhere. There are numerous foreign fine arts, cuisine, live performances, and cultural displays. Japan is the subject of intense global interest, and the general rule is that everything that can fit in a shipping container is probably located in Tokyo.

There are historical sites and temples/shrines that date back more than 1500 years. There are ancient cedar woodlands that date back several thousand years too. You can already witness a highly developed culture, literature, and architecture in Japan from more than 1300 years ago.

So if you're looking for something fresh, visit Japan to see a vastly distinct nation and culture. Observing how things work will teach you just as much about your own nation as it will about Japan.
