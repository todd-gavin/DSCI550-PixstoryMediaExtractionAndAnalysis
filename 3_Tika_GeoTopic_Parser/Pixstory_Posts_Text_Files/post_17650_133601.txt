It was all going according to plan for Viera and Crystal Palace until a certain Erling Haaland announced his arrival at the Etihad in a grandstand fashion In the recent past the Etihad has been a good hunting ground for the Eagles from Selhurst Park And it was deja vu for Guardiola and City as they found themselves in familiar territory like last season Crystal Palace started off brightly and established an early lead in the first half It went from bad to worse for the champions as their struggles with dealing with set pieces again came back to haunt them The first they conceded was comical whereas the second was just lazy defending Crystal Palace defended resolutely and looked threatening at counters whereas City looked devoid of ideas for the entirety of the first half Their clever players like De Bruyne Foden Silva and Mahrez were got given the time or space to maneuver anything for their new marksman Haaland Guardiola and his boys were constantly forced to move the ball back or sideways because of Palace s press and high line In the second half like in Newcastle the champions turned it up a notch and produced one of their trademark comebacks It was sparked into life by Bernado Silva the Portuguese scored a tantalizing first and was heavily involved in all City goals But the stage was set for Erling Haaland to showcase his ridiculous goal scoring ability The Norwegian marked his arrival with a breath taking brace at West Ham and the all important second against Newcastle Prior to his first goal Haaland was just a mere spectator who was struggling to stamp his authority in the match But City s new hitman showed his new fans just a glimpse of the future The Norwegian s first two goals showed his exceptional poaching ability And his third was a display of his physical strength and pace as he tussled and bullied two Palace defenders before slotting it beyond Gueita s reach This hattrick against Palace marks the year old s th of his career As the champions start their home campaign with a win over Palace
