Who do we have to thank for when it comes to our national flag? 

The man behind Indiaâ€™s Tricolour is Pingali Venkayya.

Pingali Venkayya, a freedom fighter and staunch Gandhian, was the first to draw up a rudimentary design of the national flag in 1921. Today, the Centre is honouring him by releasing a postage stamp on his 146th birth anniversary.

He was born in Telugu brahmin family at Bhatlapenumarru, near Machilipatnam, in the state of Andhra Pradesh.

According to The Hindu, "Pingali Venkayya lived as an agriculturist and also an educationist who set up an educational organization in Machilipatnam. 

A national flag is a flag that represents and symbolizes a nation. In India, the term "tricolour" almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.
