The Supertech Twin Towers in Noida were destroyed by a huge explosion yesterday. The two towers were brought down using about 3,700 kg of explosives, which caused the region to be covered in a sea of smoke and debris.Â 

The approximately 100-meter-tall towers, which were higher than Qutub Minar in Delhi, were the highest buildings ever torn down in India. Drone footage shows the two buildings disintegrating in less than 9 seconds. 

Thousands of people who lived in surrounding flats and societies were evacuated before the destruction. 

Earlier, the operation's officials had estimated that 55,000 tonnes of debris would be produced. Debris removal might take up to three months. The trash will be disposed of at authorised locations.
