Nothing to do the injuries this year do not leave Matteo Berrettini in peace The Italian tennis player will not be among the protagonists of the Miami Masters which for him should have started this afternoon against the Argentine Juan Manuel Cerundolo This time Berrettini was stopped by a hand problem right for which he preferred not to risk His debut on red clay like that of many other tennis players at this point will take place in Montecarlo It should be remembered that Berrettini had also had to retire in Acapulco due to abdominal problems, the same ones that had stopped him at the ATP Finals in Turin in November Berrettini&#39;s place will be replaced by a so-called lucky loser whose name has not yet been announced
