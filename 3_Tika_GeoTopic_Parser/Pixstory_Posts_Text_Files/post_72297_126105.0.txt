FC Barcelona vs Rayo Vallecano: Barca player ratings as their first league match of the season ends in a 0-0 draw

FC Barcelona kicked off the 2022-23 La Liga season with a draw against Rayo Vallecano at the Spotify Camp Nou and it was definitely not the start to the season that they had expected. Contrary to their performance in the pre-season campaign, Barca looked mightily off-touch in their opening match and in this article, we shall be rating the performances of every player individually. 

Marc-Andre ter Stegen - 7

The FC Barcelona goalkeeper was tested twice by the Rayo Vallecano goalkeepers and he was stiff on both occasions. Apart from that, he looked confident in distribution. 

Ronald Araujo - 4

Perhaps one of the worst performances by Ronald Araujo ever. He was oddly out of shape as a right back and he also committed a big mistake once, which was luckily saved by Ter Stegen. 

Andreas Christensen - 8 

By far the best performer in Barca’s back-4 tonight and also the best performing debutant of the night. He made a sensational last-man tackle in the second half to prevent Rayo Vallecano from causing any serious troubles. 

Eric Garcia - 5.5

Eric Garcia too committed some mistakes and was not at the top of his game. 

Jordi Alba - 6

Jordi Alba was good with his ball progression and helping in the attacks but his poor judgement in passes often caused trouble for FC Barcelona. 

Gavi - 5

Gavi could not change the pace of the game tonight and his contribution defensively was negligible. 

Sergio Busquets - 2

It was a night to forget for the captain Sergio Busquets. He was weak defensively and rarely contributed anything in developing the attacks whatsoever. Moreover, he received a second yellow in the injury time and got himself shown out. 

Pedri - 7

Pedri looked off-touch in some moments but at other times, his teammates could not sync with him and predict his vision.
