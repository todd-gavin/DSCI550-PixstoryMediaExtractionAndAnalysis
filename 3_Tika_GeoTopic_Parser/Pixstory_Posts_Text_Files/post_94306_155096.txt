Japan U women s made a bright start to their tournament as they took on Tanzania U women s at the Fatorda Stadium for the evening fixture in Group D The Japanese side dominated the match winning against a Tanzania side that played most of the match down to women The red card was virtually the first real action of the match with Tanzania s Neema Paul Kinega being sent off for a mistimed tackle on Yoshioka Initially the on field referee had shown Kinega a yellow card but the decision was overturned by VAR and adjudged as a possible red card foul Japan were up and going with the extra woman advantage and their first breakthrough in the nd minute as Shiragaki slotted in a well worked team goal The final chance of the first half fell to Momoko Tanikawa who had her long range shot deflected onto the crossbar by the Tanzanian keeper The Japanese side had to wait till the th minute to double their advantage But it was worth the wait as substitute Mao Itamura produced possibly the goal of the tournament so far She won the ball in the right side of attack and dribbled her way past her marker into the box nutmegged a player guarding her sight of goal and produced a low shot that had no stopping Japan did not put the breaks and went up in the th minute thanks to striker Tsujisawa making a neat finish off a through ball from the midfield The final goal of the match a rather unfortunate one for goalkeeper Makau fell to Tanikawa who finally got her reward A free kick from the yard range was let in by the Tanzanian keeper who couldn t punch the ball away The African side shouldn t be disheartened though as going a player down early in the th minute is a huge loss for a team On the other hand Japan would be happy to have four different goalscorers on the sheet today
