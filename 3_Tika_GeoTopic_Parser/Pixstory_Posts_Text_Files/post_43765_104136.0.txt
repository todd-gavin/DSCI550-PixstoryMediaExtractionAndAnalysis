Arsenal were on the verge of sealing the top four spot despite the hapless display at the start of the season. On the GW 36, they were leading the race to top four against Tottenham Hotspur. However, the loss in the GW 37 poured water on their dreams and they had to settle for the Europa League. Mikel Arteta has again failed to get the qualification for the Champions League. Itâ€™s six years now since Arsenal have not qualified for the UEFA Champions League.

On the other hand, Unai Emery, the former Arsenal gaffer, not only went on to win the UEFA Europa League but also took his side to the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Unai Emery was sacked after a poor start to the 2019/20 season. Before that, the club had failed to clinch the Europa League finals against Chelsea. Nevertheless, Unai Emery tried his best to take the Emirates outfit to the continental showdown. In this article, we shall look at the players whom the Spanish signed and what they are doing. 

Dani Ceballos

The Real Madrid man came on loan to Emirates in the summer of 2019 and played a big role in winning the FA Cup. The player once again joined Arsenal on loan during the COVID 19 but Arteta did not decide to make the signing permanent. Bossing the midfield, he had five assists to name across two seasons. Currently, the player is at Real Madrid but was sparingly used by Carlo Ancelotti. He was also featured in the UEFA Champions League against Manchester City and Liverpool.
