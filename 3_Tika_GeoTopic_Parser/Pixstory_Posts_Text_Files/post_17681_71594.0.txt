In 1895, a shipbuilding company based in River Thames set up a football club for its workers. It resulted in the birth of one of the most decorated clubs in England. Originally known as Thames Ironworks, West Ham United came into existence in 1900. Following the club's decision to officially rename the club. The newly named West Ham moved to the famous Boleyn Ground in 1904, and this marked the beginning of West Ham's remarkable journey.

Back in 1984, West Ham went on to lift their first FA CUP after beating Preston. The hammers were blowing bubbles more joyously than ever, after lifting the FA Cup twice again in 1975 and 1980 after. West Ham also lifted the famous European Cup Winners Cup in 1965, defeating 1860 Munich.

The club also got relegated three times, the latest being in 2011. Following their promotion to the PL, in 2012 the talks about moving to a new stadium spread like wildfire. 

After 100 years in Boleyn, West Ham moved to the Londom Stadium in 2016. The move to London Stadium meant the Irons could accommodate double the fans and compete at the levels of the Top 4 in the PL. However, after a promising season under Bilic, West Ham went downhill.

The move to London Stadium seemed more like a curse than a blessing for the Hammers, before the arrival of - David Moyes. After failing to set up his trade at Old Trafford, the appointment of Moyes certainly raised some eyebrows. 

On the contrary, the appointment of Moyes turned out to be a masterstroke. West Ham is back in Europe and has established itself as a top 6 club in the PL. The work Moyes has done at West Ham is remarkable. 

Once a club basking in the glory of the River Thames had lost its shine, resulting from the rise of other superpowers. However, under the regime of Moyes, there is hope for a better future for the Irons.

The sound of the riveting gangs of the Thames ironworks is gone forever, but their heritage is still celebrated today in the famous chant " C'mon You irons."
