Absolutely thrilled to hear this announcement. Mike is coming to head the Climate Group at a very critical juncture of human history. I have full faith in Mike to lead the way on building a better sustainable world. 

We at pixstory is honoured to have you on board! 

Mike was Premier of South Australia from 2002 to 2011. He was also Climate Change Minister, the first in Australia and one of the first in the world, passing groundbreaking carbon reduction legislation that was used as a model internationally. When he was elected in 2002, South Australia had zero renewables. It now generates more than 60% of its electricity from wind and solar and will reach 100% by the end of this decade.

More powers to your shoulder, albeit a dislocated one 😁
