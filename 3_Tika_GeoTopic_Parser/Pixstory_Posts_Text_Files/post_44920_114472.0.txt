After Juan Mata's departure, the Portuguese midfielder has finally received his desired number.For Manchester United's upcoming campaign, Bruno Fernandes will don the No. 8 jersey.

Since moving to Manchester United from Sporting CP in January 2020, the Portuguese
midfielder had been playing with the No. 18 jersey. He kept his eye on his new number, though,
and was finally able to get it before the upcoming season.

At Udinese, Sporting CP, and the Portugal national team, Fernandes wore the No. 8 jersey. He
acknowledged that he wanted the same number at United, but Juan Mata already had it. Given
that Mata left Old Trafford after his contract expired, Fernandes has moved to acquire his
desired digit.

Because it was his father's playing number, his birthday, and the number he preferred, he has worn No. 8 for the past three seasons. In addition to being his wife's birthday, number 18 is
significant to him for other reasons, including the fact that he saw Paul Scholes wear it while growing up. I believe he will enjoy sporting this jersey and bearing the number of an incredible player even though he is aware of his great responsibility.

When fixed shirt numbers were established in 1993, Paul Ince was the first player to be assigned as United's No. 8. When Wayne Rooney first moved to No. 10, in 2007, Nicky Butt and
midfielder Anderson, both wore it. From 2015 until his exit this year, Mata held the number.

Tyrell Malacia was recently acquired by United in a transaction worth an initial Â£13 million ($16
million) from Feyenoord. The left-back will wear jersey No. 12 next season, the club announced
on Thursday.
