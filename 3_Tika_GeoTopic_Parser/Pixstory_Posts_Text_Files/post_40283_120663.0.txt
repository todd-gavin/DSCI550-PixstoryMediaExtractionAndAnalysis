It is rightly said that , "A newborn baby has only three demands : Warmth in the arms of Mother , Food from her breasts and Security in knowledge of her presence . Breastfeeding satisfies all three" ! ❤️

From August 1 to August 7 , World Breastfeeding Week is observed every year across the world . It is a celebration of Motherhood and the healthy life of the newborn . As breastfeeding is of utmost importance for growth and healthy development of infants , the week is celebrated to spread awareness regarding early breastfeeding . 👩‍👧

Scientifically breastfed babies are more intelligent and healthier than babies who were not breastfed in childhood . Breast Milk is considered as the best food for newly born babies as it contains antibodies , which are essential to cure babies from severe diseases . So the main objective of celebrating the WBW is to educate parents about the benefits of breastfeeding and encourage them to adopt it .❤️

World Breastfeeding Week theme for 2022 is "Step Up for Breastfeeding : Educate and Support". ❤️👩‍👧

Let's Celebrate World Breastfeeding Week Together ❤️👩‍👧
