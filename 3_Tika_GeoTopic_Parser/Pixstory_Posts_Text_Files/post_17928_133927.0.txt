Wendy Williams is cheerful and upbeat this weekend.
On Saturday morning (August 27), the 58-year-old former talk show presenter was spotted exiting her New York City apartment.
In a statement earlier this week, Wendy's former lawyer charged that her former financial manager had "abandoned her to die."
According to Page Six, Wendy's bank Wells Fargo asserted in February that she is a "incapacitated person" who requires a guardianship. The media figure is currently a defendant in a case brought against the bank.
The real problem is that Wells Fargo, through its consultant, refused to provide Wendy access to her own accounts, including the right to check her balance, according to Wendy's former attorney LaShawn Thomas, who provided a new statement to the same station. No bank should be able to make that decision. None of Wendy's accounts were ever subjected to an intrusion attempt. The only persons with access were the Wells Fargo adviser and [former manager Bernie Young]. Wendy was left to perish.
Thomas claims that because Wendy was unable to access the money in her bank account, she was compelled to utilise her American Express card for "all of her living expenditures."
