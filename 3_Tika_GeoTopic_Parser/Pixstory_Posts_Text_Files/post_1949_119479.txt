In a recent letter to the director general of the World Health Organization the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health urged the WHO to immediately rename the monkeypox virus In reaction to the apparent stigmatizing impact of the term monkeypox WHO announced on June th that they will rename the virus Because HIV AIDS originated from monkeys and the spread of monkeypox throughout the homosexual male population has been cited as a reason for the specific stigmatizing impact on the LGBTQ community The politicization of health is disturbing Detractors of the term Wuhan virus opposed it as racist and unusual for a virus despite the fact that other viruses throughout history have been called by its places of origin including Zika Ebola MERs and others I have no objection to individuals giving viruses whatever name they choose However the problem created by name changing and name shaming is that the virus itself becomes a conduit for both disease and division Why while millions were dying from COVID did some believe it was appropriate to ridicule belittle and label others as racists just because they wanted to use a name that was similar in nature to other location based viruses they were acquainted with Undoubtedly some individuals will use these terms in a racist manner but when the media and the general public repeatedly bombard people with the notion that a term is racist it becomes racist and empowers others to use it in a racist manner in protest And if there was any doubt that this had nothing to do with the fact that COVID originated in China or that Chinese interests promoted this story about racism the top trending topic on Twitter as of this writing is What you need to know about the Marburg virus Marburg is the German city where the virus was first detected
