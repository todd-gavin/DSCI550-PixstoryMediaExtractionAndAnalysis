Frenkie De Jong


FDJ has been the talk of the town. The Dutch international is being recalled by his former boss to Old Trafford. But the Barcelona man is reluctant to move to the Theatre of Dreams, as he won’t be getting Champions League football. He is being linked due to his passing accuracy, and ability to find his teammates through defence-splitting passes. His ability to play long diagonal balls at the right precision to find his teammates. His ability to cover every blade of the pitch, using his ability to marshall the defenders and his aerial prowess is what the manager will be looking for. In short, he is a workhorse. FDJ usually jumps back to support his backline. He is also decent in front of the goal, as he has scored 3 goals.

Attack


Let’s get to the elephant in the room first - Cristiano Ronaldo. The 4 time UCL winner has won every title in England, Italy and Spain. He is the highest goalscorer in the history of football with 807 goals to his name. He made his move to Manchester United last summer. But it has not panned out as was hoped. With the attack boasting Cristiano Ronaldo, Bruno Fernandes, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani, it looked like the perfect attacking lineup. But the way the season panned out, with other players misfiring, United will finish this season in the sixth place. The only man who was the shining light was Cristiano Ronaldo. How will Cristiano Ronaldo fit into the ETH system, we will see that.

Cristiano Ronaldo

The 37-year-old Portuguese has been a beacon of light in a dismal season for Man Utd. His 23 goals in both Champions League and Premier League have been a saviour. He scored 2 hat tricks, which talks about his goal-scoring ability, even at the age of 37 years. Ronaldo is excited to work with Ten Hag. United are after an attacker this summer and it would mean that ‘Ronny’ would have to make do with the bench or come on during the crucial stages. ETH usually prefers 4-2-3-1, but transitions to 4-3-3.
