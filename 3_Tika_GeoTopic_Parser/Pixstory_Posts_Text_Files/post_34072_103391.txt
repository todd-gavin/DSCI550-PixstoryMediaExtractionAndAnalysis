called up for the internship in Coverciano In the last few days, the national coach Roberto Mancini has viewed and studied a large number of young players in light of the new cycle that is preparing for matches after the disappointment of not qualifying for the World Cup When I was young at least once we were in Coverciano a month I think it&#39;s feasible even nowadays Some of the squad we didn&#39;t even know yet they are very good How is it possible that they don&#39;t play in Serie A It would be very useful for all of Italy Working with young people during the year would be positive I think that something more could be done in March it is not possible to prepare such an important match in one day The fans are still attached to us for the European championship won Let&#39;s say that that mitigated a little the undeserved failure to qualify for the World Cup
