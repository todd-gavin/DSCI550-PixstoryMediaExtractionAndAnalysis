With gusts of early January winds blowing on my face I fled from life s humdrum Off into the shady pun intended forests I sped barefoot with my mind on the seventh heaven Keeping my fears at bay I faced life head on The skies looked over me the clouds whispered in my heart To my heart beats I danced Life isn t about rainbows and sunshine a bed of roses But once you dive into the arms of nature you cannot return as the same person It turns you into a new leaf and you can have my word for that
