After a charge was filed against her for assaulting a police officer, Congress politician Renuka Chowdhury stated on Thursday that she did not assault the officer. As she was being pushed, the Congresswoman stated she lost her balance and grabbed the collar of a police officer she didn't recognise for support. The incident occurred in Hyderabad during a big Telangana Congress protest, which included former Union minister Renuka Chowdhury. The demonstration was in response to Rahul Gandhi's continued questioning by the Enforcement Directorate in the National Herald case.
