A few days ago, Apple announced that they are organizing an event on 8th March, 11.30 pm IST and like every other user of Apple, I got excited. 
And here I am, just watched the Apple event and I’ll give you a sneak peek of the event and tell you about the new products announced by Apple.

1. Apple announced that they partnered with Major League Baseball and Apple TV+ will air two Friday night matches every weak, once the season begins. 

2. After the success of the iPhone 13 range, Apple announced that iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 pro will come in new color which is Green and Alpine Green respectively. 

3. Apple announced a new ‘iPhone Se’ with the same A15 Bionic chip that they use for iPhone 13 range. So people can buy smaller phones but the technology will be the same. 

4. Apple also announced new iPad air with the M1 chip in it which means customers can enjoy the same speed, same technology, that Apple is providing in the iPad Pro range. So yeah, again a pocket-friendly announcement from Apple. 

5. To make iMacs and MacBooks more powerful, Apple announced their new chip ‘M1 Ultra’. Apple believed that this chip will change the game forever and no other chip can come closer to the performance of ‘M1 Ultra.’ 

6. Another announcement from Apple was a new Mac Studio and studio display. MacStudio is useful when the customer has a  studio where they are using multiple macs at one time. Studio display is a new upgraded version of an earlier display that Apple used to produce. Studio display will enhance the user experience because it has now better colors, better sound quality, better camera, more USB-C ports. So yeah, for professionals these upgrades will be very useful.

One thing I want to say is that Apple never disappoints with the presentation of the new Apple products. This time they got 6 new updates and they got something for everyone in this announcement.
