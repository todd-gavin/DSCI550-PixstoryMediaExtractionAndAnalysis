I have found that when the shit hits the fan, the element of fear disappears.  It may exist before and after the fight.

1. embrace the fear, it is actually your ally and keeps you from doing something carelessly. 

2. Fear is not contradictory to bravery/courage.

3. Bravery/courage is doing what needs to be done despite fear.

4. There are meditative methods and this is one of the reasons kata are done.  Its at the deeper levels of instruction beyond beginner.
