It s important to speak for male victims of abuse But everytime people do it they bring along misogynist statements I haven t seen any man celebrity accused of abuse receive half of the attention and hate Heard is getting Does pointing it out makes you in favour of Heard No it doesn t It s not taking sides but only pointing out the hypocrisy of society dealing with an accused that s male and one that s female Ronaldo for example That man is practically worshipped He confessed and gave a description of how he raped a woman and he s still where he is No outrage no career damage nothing In fact his following keeps growing Why is he not being subjected to the same treatment Amber is Chris Brown abusing Rihanna is no news The inhumane level he went to in order to hurt her her pictures have always stuck with me He has since released albums a documentary a clothing line and a cereal He s gone on six tours and has a residency lined up in Vegas And he s still getting public s support Sylvester Stallone has had several allegations dating back to The first public allegations came in No charges have ever been pressed Since he s been cast in movies and documentaries as well as writing directing and producing a number of them In early Aziz Ansari was accused to pressuring a woman into having sex with him even after asked to stop He resumed touring by summer He was nominated for a Grammy in He s released two more comedy specials on Netflix He s in the Bob s Burgers movie And to be honest there are countless such men who ve gotten away with much worse Where s the outrage with them People see both victims and accused in different lights based on gender It s not to say female abusers don t deserve to pay they do but keep the same energy for the men I don t think there s any doubt left in how the world gets behind a woman who s accused and let go a man who even confesses to his crimes via DailyJulienne Twitter
