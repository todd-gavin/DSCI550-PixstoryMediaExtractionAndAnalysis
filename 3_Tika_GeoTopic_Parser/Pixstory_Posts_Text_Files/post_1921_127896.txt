That seems a lot better a lot more efficient and a lot fairer than the government compelling private enterprises to reduce their revenues and as a result their employment Instead capitalism may encourage these companies to reconsider their business practices and ultimately conduct commerce more equitably and at the same or comparable profit levels The concept of labor unions is one of those subjects that touches almost everyone For business owners it may be an issue for their bottom line the people they recruit and the price they pay for them but for employees it can influence a variety of aspects of their job including salary and the potential to be fired If labor unions help employees why do many workers reject labor unions despite the many benefits they provide Labor unions can provide employees with a higher average income as well as improved working hours and working conditions However these advantages come with a high price tag For instance labor unions may make the employer employee relationship hostile rather than amiable They work on the assumption that employers are ready willing and able to exploit them In addition employees are not free to conduct their personal business as they choose This is especially problematic if an individual does not choose to join a union but is compelled to pay union dues in order tokeep their job To make things even worse unions represent their members Thus due to the fact that they are organizations their viewpoints may not always coincide with those of the individuals they represent Lastly since the employee has less opportunity to negotiate pay the salary for a worthy employee may remain lower than it would have been otherwise had they had the autonomy to negotiate
