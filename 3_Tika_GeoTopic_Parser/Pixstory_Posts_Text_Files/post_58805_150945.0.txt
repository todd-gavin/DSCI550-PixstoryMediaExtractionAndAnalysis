India Friday abstained on a draft resolution at the UN Security Council condemning Russia’s “illegal referenda” and annexation of four Ukrainian territories.
The resolution failed to get adopted as Russia vetoed it. Of the 15-nation Council, 10 nations voted for the resolution while India, China, Gabon, and Brazil abstained.
