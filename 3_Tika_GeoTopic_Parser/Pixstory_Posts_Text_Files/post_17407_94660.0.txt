The Paris Saint-Germain striker, who became the top scorer in the club's history, was presented with the trophy by the club's president, Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, on Sunday evening at the Parc des Princes during the Ligue 1 matchday 32 game between the club from the capital and Olympique de Marseille.

It was an unforgettable evening for "MAK", who had an emotional time on Sunday evening. The President of Paris Saint-Germain Nasser Al-Khelaïfi presented the striker with a trophy, that of the top scorer in the club’s women's team history.

Katoto also took part in the pre-match Kick-Off show, live from the Parc des Princes, alongside another famous rouge et bleu striker, Pedro Miguel Pauleta, during which Katoto was also presented with a jersey with the number 132! The rouge et bleu striker also received numerous messages from several players and former players congratulating her on her performances.

"It gives me great pride to be the top scorer for this great club," she told PSG TV. It's my first club and I'm very happy to be able to make history here. And I hope this is just the beginning!"

It is also alongside the former Parisian number 9 that Katoto gave the fictitious kick-off of the match, after having been able to greet the Auteuil crowd, which gave her a warm welcome, and honoured this very special moment.
