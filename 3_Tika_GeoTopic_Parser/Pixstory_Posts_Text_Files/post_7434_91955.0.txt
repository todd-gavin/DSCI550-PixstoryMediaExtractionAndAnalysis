I love New York – let me count the ways. I've loved the city since I was a youngster, and now that I've called it home for eight years, I can honestly say that I still love living here. You might ask, "What do you love about it?"  Honestly, there are probably at least 100 reasons to love living in New York City, and for me to conjure up the complete list, I need a few days. So, let's take a look at the qualities this town has that no one can overlook.

1. Diversity

One of the city's greatest attributes is its diversity, and NYC is often thought of as America's melting pot. About 36 percent of New York's denizens hail from other countries, and you can hear as many as 800 languages spoken. I love how each person has his or her own New York Story, whether they're a native, an immigrant or a transplant.

2. Energy

There's no other city on earth with an energy that can compete with New York. The fast pace, the buzzing traffic, the hustle and bustle of the people, the 24-hour life, and the creative spirit make NYC one of the most vibrant places in the world.

3. Inspiration

New York has a way of giving me a feeling that I can accomplish anything I set out to do. On an ordinary day when I step outside my apartment building, I might find inspiration in any place – on the street, in the subway, at a Broadway show or in a sidewalk café. A plethora of inspiring, smart, creative people dwell in the nooks and crannies of this city.

4. Convenience

A steak dinner at midnight? An early morning manicure? I can get anything I want at almost any time in NYC. Within a five-block radius of my apartment, I can hit the grocery store, drug store, pet store, and wine shop in a single sweep. This convenient lifestyle is addictive. We New Yorkers get spoiled, and when we leave the city, we forget that the rest of the world lives differently and on a more normal schedule.
