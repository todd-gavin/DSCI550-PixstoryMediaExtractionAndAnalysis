Jimin's first-ever OST With You for Our Blues is out. This song also features Jimin's friend and former HOTSHOT and Wanna One member Ha Sung Woon. So over-all it was a full packed emotional song which features actors Shin Min-a and Lee Byung-hun in Jeju Island. 

JIMIN'S voice can definitely bring you to heaven, specially when the lyrics goes like "I am nothing without your love, I promise Iâ€™ll never leave your love my heart is beating cause of you."

On Twitter, fans praised both the singers, and the OST went on trending for hours.
