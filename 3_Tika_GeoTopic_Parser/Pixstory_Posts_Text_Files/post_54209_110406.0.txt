With the end of the school year here, parents, caregivers and educators may find themselves reflecting on another turbulent year in education.

For researchers of children’s literacy, year-end reflections may prompt discussions of the “summer slide” — children’s loss of knowledge over summer break, particularly in literacy and numeracy — and what can be done to mitigate this learning loss.

Everyday activities that promote early literacy skills can be pursued in ways that don’t involve imposing rigorous summer academic work. Harnessing children’s interests and experiences and prioritizing their social and emotional needs are critical to learning and can nurture early literacy skills.

Prioritizing family well-being
Although the maintenance of academic skills gained during the school year is important, discussions of the summer slide should be carefully situated against the current backdrop of pandemic-related parental burnout, ongoing concerns of learning gaps and the need to prioritize children’s mental well-being.

Within these discussions, a focus on parental supports and resources must also be included. When parents are supported, they are better able to support their children. This is particularly critical for parents with fewer resources or supports than more advantaged parents.

In the classroom, the most effective way to develop early literacy skills is through explicit, systematic and evidence-based instruction. At home, these skills can be reinforced in subtle ways that don’t interfere with children’s desire and need to enjoy the summer.

Parents and caregivers can nurture early literacy skills in ways that do not place heavy expectations on the domestic responsibilities of parents, often mothers, that have already intensified during the pandemic.
