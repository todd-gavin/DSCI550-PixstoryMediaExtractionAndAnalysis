Juventus drops to 4th after draw with Torino


It has been tough so far for Juventus at the start of the year. They lost the Supercoppa Italiana final to Inter Milan on Jan 13 and dropped down in Serie A table not by losing but because of draws. In the last match, they conceded in the second half (Andrea Belotti 62') to go level with Torino after getting De Ligt goal(12') lead from a corner. Torino is at 10th with this draw (M25, W9, D6, L10, P33) while Juventus have now 47 points from 26 matches. 13  matches won while 8 drawn and 5 lost. 


Milan is enjoying top spot with 55 points from 25 matches while Inter is at second spot with 54 points from 24 matches. Napolis are at third with 53 points from 25 matches. 


In 2022, Juventus have played 7 matches in the league so far. They have won 3 and drawn 4 of them. 


1. Juv v Napoli 1-1

Jan 7


2. Milan v Juventus 0-0

3. Atalanta vs Juventus 1-1

4. Juventus v Torino 1-1

It was a good chance for the Old lady to go top of the table as Inter lost 1 of their 5 matches in 2022, and drew 2. Juventus' wins include Jan 9 vs Roma 3-4, came back from 3-1 down. They are expecting to win more matches in upcoming fixtures as the new sensation Dusan Vlahovic also is in the line up. Their upcoming matches include a UEFA Champions league away clash against Villarreal on 23 February and Coppa Italia semi final against Fiorentina on March 3rd. 



Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri must be hoping to secure his position with better performances in all three competitions including a final in the Coppa Italia final.

He has slightly changed his playing style and formation, now using 4-3-2-1 with Vlahovic as lone striker, and Morata, Dybala behind him with a role of giving fast paced striker ball and using him to score.
