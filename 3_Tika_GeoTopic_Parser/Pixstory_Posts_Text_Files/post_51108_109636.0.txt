Then going on with the challenge next food item i’ve tried today is LAPHING in Rs.30

I visited Majnu-Ka-Tilla to savour a delight that blew my mind away. The dish is a very popular Tibetan snack known as 'Laphing' and is served at a small stall in the courtyard of the Dalai LamaTemple.

Although, there are many places in Majnu-Ka-Tilla that serve Laphing, this stall trumps every other place in popularity, because the dish here is made fresh, not in a machine, but with hands, and right in front of your eyes. Served by Tenzing Aunty at just Rs 30 per plate, I think this unique snack is quite affordable and super delicious!

Plus it is available in veg and non-veg too also they are serving different flavours of laphing at a reasonable price .😍
