Making waves all over the globe, Priyanka seems to be unstoppable. A global style icon in every sense, there is no stopping for this diva. 

With her commendable performances in Bajirao Mastani, the American tele-series Quantico and the latest feather in her hat- her debut in Hollywood with the Baywatch film, she is truly someone to idolise. 

Priyanka is a fitness freak who likes to do a lot of running, yoga, spinning and cardio. Because she is mostly on the go, she is very careful about her diet and prefers eating at every fixed interval. She also has a lot of green leafy veggies and fruits and doesn’t depend on supplements. 🧘‍♀️🥦🥬

🍴 Her usual diet routine consists of:


📍For breakfast, she has two egg whites with a glass of skimmed milk. She sometimes has oatmeal instead of eggs. 🍳🥚 🥛 🍽

📍For lunch she has two rotis with dal and veggies.
In between meals she likes to have coconut water and dry fruits. 🫓🥦🫑🥬🥒🥔🥗🍅🥥🌴🥜
