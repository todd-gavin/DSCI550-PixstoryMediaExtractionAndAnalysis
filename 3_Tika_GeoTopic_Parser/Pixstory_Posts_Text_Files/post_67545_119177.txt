It s true Although it looks like pulled barbacued meat it s actually jackfruit Jackfruit meat is a trend that s taking the food world by storm The texture of cooked jackfruit flesh closely resembles that of meat and the fruit readily absorbs any flavourings added to it Vegetarian and vegan diets are quickly adopting this meat alternative Any type of jackfruit be it fresh or canned ripe or raw can be used as a meat substitute It s easy to cook and tastes wonderful too My favorite way to eat cooked jackfruit is with a piquant barbacue sauce on a homemade bun with some crisp lettuce and a few slices of pickles The first time I made this burger nobody could believe it wasn t meat And we re a meat eating family And moveover I couldn t believe how quick and easy it was It took just minutes from start to finish and most of the cooking time was unattended All I had to do was cover the vessel and let it do its thing I ve since made jackfruit burgers a number of times and it just keeps getting better and better Would you try a jackfruit burger Comment your thoughts below
