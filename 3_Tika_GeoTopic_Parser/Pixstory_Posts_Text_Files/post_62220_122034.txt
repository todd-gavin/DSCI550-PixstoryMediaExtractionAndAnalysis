Every time I ve tried to start meditating I ve faced the same conundrum I think I m supposed to think about nothing which of course leads me to think about everything The key to getting into meditation is to reframe the practice away from the goal of clearing your mind and toward the goal of witnessing your thoughts For most of us the instruction of don t think is futile and stressful Instead a more practical approach is to accept and embrace whatever thoughts do come into your head The challenge is to sit back and let your thoughts drift in and out without causing a strong emotional reaction The takeaway here is that your meditation goal doesn t need to be to empty your mind So long as you re focusing on your thoughts and attending to them as objectively as you can you can count that as your mindfulness practice for the day Meditation is more like a workout than it is a quick fix to your stress And when you first start a new workout regime you re going to feel a little sore The only way to overcome that soreness is to keep at the practice consistently Look at meditation as a muscle it might not work at first but that s because you haven t put in the work yet Meditation gets easier but you need to move on from the notion that you re failing at something If you re showing up to listen to your own thoughts then you should count that as a meditation win
