—Answer me quickly, O Lord! My spirit fails! Hide not your face from me, lest I be like those who go down to the pit. Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love, for in you I trust. Make me know the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul. – Psalm 143:7-8

In this psalm, David feels lost and helpless and on the edge of death. He feels a sense of desperation that only God can help him to overcome. Rather than wallowing in his misery, however, he cries out to God, looking to Him for guidance, trusting that He will help.

—Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. – Psalm 42:11

In this verse, we see that David is in a depressed and sad condition. He describes his soul as “downcast” and “disturbed.” Rather than remaining in his depressed condition, he engages in self-talk to help himself get out of his funk.

When we find ourselves in a depressed state, self-talk can be a good way to fight our way free. Not just any self-talk will do, however. It must be self-talk that recognizes God as our reference point and Savior. We can know that our downcast state is temporary because God is our hope.

—“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” – Matthew 11:28-30

In this passage, Jesus promises gentle rest to those who come to Him weighed down by the toils of life. Are you tired of your depression? Come to Jesus to find rest. Are you carrying a heavy load of care and worry and sadness? Come to Jesus to find relief.He only requires that you humbly come to Him as you are, and He will bring about the change to your life.
