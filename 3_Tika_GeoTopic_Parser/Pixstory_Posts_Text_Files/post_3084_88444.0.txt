It might be the most crucial debate today: Is liberalism dying? Commentators raise the question in editorials in newspapers and magazines, and there’ve been several well-reviewed books on this subject. The latest is from Francis Fukuyama, among the most influential political philosophers. ‘Liberalism and Its Discontents’ (releasing this week) takes the debate forward. 

Though in economics ‘liberalism’ means free markets; in philosophy and by extension in politics, it is a view that all people are equal. This goes counter to the conservative thought which accords privileges based on gender, race, class, caste, religion, etc. Over the past couple of centuries, with political revolutions and economic-technological progress, the old elite had to grudgingly accept the new order – loosely termed ‘Liberal Democracy’.
 
Liberalism strove to make societies equal – by measures like positive discrimination, extra concern for marginalized groups and various minorities. This is also reflected in the human rights movement. Such moves were resented by those who used to be privileged. Such measures also left much to be desired in their implementation, leading to the failure of the Liberal Project. 

As a result, a backlash formed up. In the US, the white middle class felt left out, and in Europe many felt their traditional culture and way-of-life were being swept aside by refugees. This anguish, understandable within their own framework, led to the rise of Donald Trump in the US and Brexit in the UK. In Brazil, Turkey, India and elsewhere, the old order came to reassert itself with the advent of a number of populist, right-wing leaders.

Putin then famously said in 2019 that Liberal Democracy was “obsolete”: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48798875

That is the backdrop to the question. Fukuyama, well known for his ‘End of History’ thesis around the fall of communism used to be placed in the conservative camp. After ‘Identity’ (2019), he has emerged as a philosopher sympathetic to liberal value while fully appreciating conservative concerns. In the new work, he argues there have been excesses from both the right and the left, damaging liberalism, and argues for revitalizing it: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374606718/liberalismanditsdiscontents
