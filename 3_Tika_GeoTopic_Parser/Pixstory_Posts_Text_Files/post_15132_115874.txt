We are on the eve of a new heat wave which from tomorrow July will affect a large part of Italy and all of Lombardy, lasting for about days until July. The Arpa Lombardia Meteorological Service communicates it, specifying that the prolonged rise in maximum temperatures will see two more acute phases the first on Friday and the second probably more intense and lasting between Tuesday and Saturday July Also the minimum temperatures in the plains will rise several degrees above the average, remaining almost everywhere above C and consequently increasing the series of tropical nights which in Lombardy as a whole has already broken every historical climatic record of the measurements made since to date This new heat wave is caused by the expansion of an anticyclone of sub-tropical origin from North Africa towards the countries bordering the Mediterranean The extremely hot air mass that has already affects the Iberian peninsula progressively pushed eastward by a low-pressure circulation and in the next few days after transiting France and the United Kingdom it will reach Italy and central Europe where it will tend to stay. Thus a new period of rather prolonged anomalous heat with minimum temperatures will begin in our region and highs consistently above the averages by at least degrees
