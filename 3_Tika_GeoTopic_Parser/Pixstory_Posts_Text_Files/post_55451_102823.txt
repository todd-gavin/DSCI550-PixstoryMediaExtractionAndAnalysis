Sometimes all we need to hear is that it is okay So darling I just want you to know that it is okay it is okay that you had a bad day It is okay that you picked up some old habits It is okay that you had dark thoughts again It is okay that you are hurting It is okay that you made that mistake It is okay I know it is easy to be hard on yourself but you have to remember that you are still healing Be gentle Be kind Breathe It is okay
