Being a psychology undergraduate student I always feel obligated to profess this whenever I talk to people about stress life work life balance and pressure to excel in the cut throat competition in this world and around us And this one advise I feel is the golden mantra for everyone It is equally applicable and beneficial to each of us I deem it absolutely necessary to be known and propagated just like a philosophy or religious doctrine It is always seek company guidance and advise of the people you feel are empathetic and mature enough to understand you whenever face a block or a hard time in life I know it s not a technical advice that will ease you work or bring instant monetary gains but I bet practicing it would benefit you manifolds for larger benefit of life of yours Why I say this you may ask Wqhenever we are under stress or pressure our brain is wired to think in the wrong direction that is follow a negative trajectory of thoughts We indulge in inappropriate comparison pointing out blatant flaws in our lives we are reminded of everything that is wrong with us start imagining catastrophic outcomes of fickle actions and magnifying on our problem This is when we need an external agent to stop this negative spiral of our mind and remind us that there can be ways of getting out of stressful situations Isolating oneself in times of misery is one of the worst kinds of decisions that we can make thereby adding to the already existing problem that we may have The other person brings a fresh perspective on the problem may suggest a plausible solution for the same but if we remain in our dark space of mind we may not be able to act on our resources available and unnecessarily affect our mental health
