The story begins with an old man who decided to go on a jungle safari in Africa, taking his faithful boxer named Ollie, along for the company. Where Ollie started chasing butterflies and soon found out he was lost. He noticed a hungry fox moving quickly in his direction. Ollie knew he was in big trouble! Then he saw bones on the ground. He immediately settled down to chew the bones, turning his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard was about to jump on him, Ollie exclaimed loudly, “Wow, that was a tasty fox! Who knows if there are others here to eat? Hearing this, the fox skidded to a halt. He was terrified that the dog would see it and that it would become the dog's next meal. Silently, he slipped into the trees. Meanwhile, a macaque who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, decided he could put this knowledge to good use by trading it for protection from the fox.  So he went chasing after the big cat at top speed. Ollie saw him go, said to himself.' This macaque is definitely up to something.” The macaque soon caught up with the fox. He told him everything. The fox was furious at being made a fool of and he hops macaque on his back. Ollie saw this coming with them and pretended that he hadn't seen them. Then, just as they got close enough to hear, Ollie said loudly, 'Where the hell is that macaque”. I sent him back an hour ago to bring me another fox! ".This story taught me a never-ending lesson that there isn't an opponent that can not be defeated if you've got the right mix of confidence and mindfulness and is always stuck to my memory.
