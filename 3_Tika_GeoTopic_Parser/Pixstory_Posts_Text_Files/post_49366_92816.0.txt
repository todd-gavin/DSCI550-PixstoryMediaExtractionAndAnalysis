Quoting TedEx, 'Sylvia Plath's breathtaking perspectives and unflinching language made her a touchstone for readers seeking to break the silence around issues of trauma, frustration and sexuality.'

I have so much to say about Sylvia Plath! Only a few poets have been successful in capturing the despair and the pain of the young. As a teen girl, I tend to find a lot to look at in Plath's works. Her poetry's ferocious passion makes it evident that the emotions expressed are genuine and aren't written only for the sake of evoking feelings of hopelessness or despair. 

I am always awestruck by how beautifully and heartbreakingly Plath is able to create imagery in her readers' minds. In her images and similes, she was a master at combining numerous meanings and perspectives. It felt like I was skiing through both hellfire and the coldest of glaciers as I read her for the first time. She had a tremendous ability to convey that the world is both lovely and terrible, liberating and suffocating, and that deciding what to face is often a difficult task.

Sylvia Plath had blazed a path through a dark, chilly forest where only men had dared to tread before her. Her lack of empathy and cynicism can move some readers to call her cruel at times, oh and she was, sometimes. But here was a person on the verge of despair and perplexity, a person who was struggling alone, a person who had no one to truly fathom the enormity of her thoughts. Even in these situations, she was giving more empathy and compassion to the world than she was receiving.

"Plath is an epitome of fighting spirit and an inspiration to women poets around the world." Truer words haven't been spoken! Despite how dark her works have been or how unfortunate the end of her journey was, as a young girl I can only look up at her in awe.
