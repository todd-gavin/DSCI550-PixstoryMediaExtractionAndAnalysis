has accumulated a long list of achievements throughout his spectacular NBA Finals career, including awards, honours, scoring records, and personal milestones. However, after the stardust settled on his 43-point outburst on Friday, many were left with the impression that they had just watched the Golden State Warriors superstar's all-time best performance. The 34-year-old overcame a sore foot to lead the Warriors to a 107-97 victory against the Boston Celtics on the road. This tied the best-seven series at 2-2 and gave Golden State the advantage going into the final two games, which they will play in San Francisco.

Curry's fellow accurate "Splash Brother," Klay Thompson, who has played with the Warriors star for the most of his career, was certain where Friday's gem belonged.
