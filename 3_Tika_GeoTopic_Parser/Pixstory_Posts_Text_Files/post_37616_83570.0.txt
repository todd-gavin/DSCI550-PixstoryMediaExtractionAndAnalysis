Although India had already lost the series 4-0 when New Zealand won all the first 4 matches. India won the toss in the final odi and opted to bowl first. 

Smriti Mandhana (71), Harmanpreet Kaur (63) and Mithali Raj (57) cracked fifties while the spinners shared the spoils as India Women registered a consolation six-wicket win in the fifth ODI versus New Zealand in Queenstown. 

The foundation for India's victory was laid out by the bowlers. At 95 for 1, with Sophie Devine and the in-form Amelia Kerr going strong, New Zealand would have set their sights on getting to a score of around 300. Just then India's spinners made an impression by striking at regular intervals to peg the home side back. Sneh Rana made the crucial incision when she induced Devine to play the cut, with the New Zealand skipper spooning a catch to backward point.


Mandhana in particular played with freedom and cracked a few eye-catching drives. She also got a couple of reprieves in the 17th and 18th over respectively. After Deepti was dismissed, she also stitched a partnership of 64 with Harmanpreet Kaur to put India on course. Harmanpreet, who before this innings had accumulated just one ODI fifty in the last four years, played with positive intent and essayed the loft as well as sweeps. In the 24th over, Kaur skipped down the track to loft Fran Jonas for a six, which in turn would have boosted her confidence. She also got a hug from Mandhana for playing that stroke.

The morale-boosting win would give India some confidence ahead of the World Cup. New Zealand, meanwhile, would want to put behind a rather disappointing performance. Their fielding in particular was sloppy, with the home side dropping chances of Mandhana and Harmanpreet.
