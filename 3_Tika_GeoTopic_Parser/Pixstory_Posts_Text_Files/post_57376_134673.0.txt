The recent news has created a chaotic situation, revealing some hard-to-accept truths about the Greenland sheets.
The new research has found that there would be a significant sea level rise because of the melting of the Green land ice cap, and the scariest part is that even if all the emissions of greenhouse gases would cease today, it can't save us from this situation.
The situation is inevitable, and sadly nothing can be done about it.
Research suggests that 3.3 per cent of the Greenland ice sheets will melt, akin to around 110 trillion tons of ice.
This will lead to an increase in sea levels very rapidly, creating a problem for the entire world.
According to a Washington Post report, Richard Alley, a professor at Pennsylvania State University, has made some critical remarks insinuating the grim future, â€œ[The] rise can be a little less than usual projections, or a little more, or a lot more, but not a lot less."
The climate crisis has been a lingering issue, but as far as actions are concerned, no one was even bothered a few years back to think of these menacing pitfalls.
For some time now, it has come into light as all have woken from a long slumber.
