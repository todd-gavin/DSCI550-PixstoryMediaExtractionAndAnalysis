Making mistake during football games are just normal we all are human afterall not robots We all make mistakes during the game The most important part is how do we recover from them Read below DON T SAY SORRY It is pointless saying sorry if you miss a pass cause sorry won t change anything happened instead Don t keep negative thoughts in your head and look forward switching on to do the right thing in the next play BEHAVIOR When making a mistake just calm down take a breathe in and and breath out Forget the mistake and recover your position and focus on the next action happening in the match MORE MISTAKES If you make consecutive errors while playing it could be cause its not your day Sometimes it happened even though greatest players make mistakes and have rough days Instead make the next action a simple action maybe just a simple pass to your teammate and basic playing Do not moan or shout on your mistakes just move on an act on your mistake Try Analysing your mistakes after the match in the locker room imagine all the situation happened when u did mistakes Try to find out the best you could ve did at that moment Remember it and the next time when the same problem approaches you Jump over it like a beast Let me know in notes if this will help you Thankyou
