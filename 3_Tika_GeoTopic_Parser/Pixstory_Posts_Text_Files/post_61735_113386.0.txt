The mourning family of a dead person should not cook food until shraddha. It's an ancient practice of Hinduism still followed today. 

There are many superstitions attached to this practice. Superstition says this is to prevent the burning of the soul of the deceased.

While this is hard to fathom, it does give us some insight into what it might be about. 

The reason for this practice is rooted in the understanding of grief. If we do not face our grief head on, it might hamper our emotions and grow up into our self destructive tendencies. 

Hence it is a traditional practice for hindus to not engage into anything else after the death of someone in the family.
