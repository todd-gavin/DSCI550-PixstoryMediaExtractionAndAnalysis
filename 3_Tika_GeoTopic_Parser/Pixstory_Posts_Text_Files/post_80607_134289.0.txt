My inspiration in sports is Sachin Tendulkar. Iâ€™ve never seen a player toil as hard before a game. In 2010, before the Mumbai Indians game, I had the privilege of meeting him and I was astonished when he practiced just batting for 2 hours. Despite being in the industry for so long, he prioritized hard work and practice over everything else. Seeing this idol toil away to better his game, changed my life in ways indescribable. Along with this, my bowling idol is Glen McGrath. Their journeys inspire me and play a pivotal role in keeping me motivated.  

I did not have it easy at all times. While my father did support me financially as much as he could, I depended on the money I won from local tournaments until I had a job of my own. While I did have community and family support, the support I received from the governmental bodies was not as substantial in the beginning. I truly hope that going forward that budding cricketers get more support from not just their family and friends but also from the government, as it would ease a lot of difficulties. The government job I currently have enables me to take off for training and camps when there are matches like they did for the Ranji trophy. I wonder how this kind of support from an earlier period in time will help young sportsmen and women. 

If, after all this, I had to pass down something I learned, it would merely be a few points. Practice as much as you can and keep doing better. Aim to represent your country and let nothing stop you. And lastly, never forget the community that supported you.
