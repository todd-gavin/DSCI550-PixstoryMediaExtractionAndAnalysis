Edu was asked on Arsenal s probable failed signing of Raphinha from Leeds United who ultimately choose Barcelona as his destination He said People think we went in too deep about Raphinha because Raphinha was everywhere It s fair we did have some conversations with Deco because Deco is his agent and I have a good relationship with him we are friends I just said to Deco Can you explain to me the situation with Raphinha and he was clear Edu we have a good relationship but I m not going to lie to you his idea is to go to Barcelona because he s dreaming to go to Barcelona and we ve been talking to Barcelona since a long time ago Okay thank you very much if something happens then just let me know because I can explore and understand the situation If not no problem and we carry on with our relationship IN TERMS OF MOVING PLAYERS OUT IT S NOT EASY IS IT No but it s a part of our job to try to create some opportunities for the players I think the most important thing is to make the player understand why he is here or why he needs to go and then we have to create some possibilities with the player s agents and try to find the best solution possible for the player As soon as you give to them a clear idea of what you want to do it helps the situation It s a challenge because you have to find clubs situations and loans But again if you can be direct to the player in a very respectful way that helps a little bit to make the best decision Please find PART of this interview in the support section
