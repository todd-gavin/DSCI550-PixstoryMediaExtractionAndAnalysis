I have written about this deep rooted desire of the diaspora to find connection with home through cricket and films especially songs and music I try to capture these poignant moments of how lonely it can be to live in a country that you find difficult to connect with My most instructive and memorable moment was however at Sharjah while travelling in a taxi which was taking us from the ground to our hotel The taxi driver was from a village in Pakistani and was stunned to know that we had come all the way from India to watch and report on cricket matches He struggling to make a living for himself couldn t believe that this was our vocation and we were being paid for doing this Three decades later his laughter and what he said still rings in my ear Wah jee wah duniya maen assa bee hota hae What a wonder Do such things also happen in the world One of my most moving experience which I have written about it in the book happened on my tour to the West Indies I was invited over dinner by an Indian descent couple whose forefathers like most Indians must have moved their as indentured labourers in The early th century I had a wonderful time they were excellent hosts During the dinner they played songs by the late legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar Soon the couple got immersed in the songs with tears flowing down from their eyes I realised that somehow through those songs they felt connected to their homeland Even though they didn t speak Hindi they were still able to feel connected with their roots in a land which was still alien for them They needed an anchor to overcome their loneliness As told to Sanya Tyagi To be continued To get books NOT JUST CRICKET A Reporter s Journey through Modern India
