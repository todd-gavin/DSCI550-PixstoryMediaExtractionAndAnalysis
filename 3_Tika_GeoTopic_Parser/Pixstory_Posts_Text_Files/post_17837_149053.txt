When Hollywood actor Tom Hardy turned up to compete in a martial arts championship in Milton Keynes it took most people by surprise What they did not know is he has a passion for a charitable cause that makes him want to spend his free time being grappled to the ground Last weekend Hardy proved he was a real life action hero when he took part in the Milton Keynes Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Open held by Ultimate Martial Arts Championships UMAC at Oakgrove School He walked away with a gold medal after winning both his fights The actor is well known for playing tough guy roles on screen with credits including the BBC s Peaky Blinders and films such as The Dark Knight Rises Inception Dunkirk Venom and The Revenant His blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu however is less well known But in fact it was acting that led to him to train in the combat sport as he first learned the skill for the film Warrior in which he played a US marine who enters a mixed martial arts contest Last month Hardy was in Wolverhampton to compete for the first time in an open tournament It was organised by Reorg a charity that promotes the therapeutic benefits of Brazilian jiu jitsu for the wellbeing of military and other service veterans who have serious life altering injuries or who are suffering from PTSD or depression The charity teaches the Brazilian martial art that focuses on ground fighting and submission grappling instead of the Japanese variant which involves throwing opponents It was while competing in the West Midlands that he met the organiser of the UMAC tournament who invited him to the Milton Keynes contest The actor agreed and entered under his own name Edward Hardy with only the organiser aware of his true identity so he could compete in a normal way UMAC said it was very exciting to have Hardy fight at its tournament and he was sure his participation would have a tremendously positive effect on the sport and bring an increased awareness of the great work he does for Reorg
