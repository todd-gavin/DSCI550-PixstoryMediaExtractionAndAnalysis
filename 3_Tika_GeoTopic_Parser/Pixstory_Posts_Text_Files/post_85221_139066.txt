 Manchester United possess great quality One thing which is clear is that this United side possesses tremendous quality This has never been in question even when they were suffering from poor form and fans felt the players needed to work harder This has come to fruition as the team has grasped the ability to dig deep and show a good level of work rate in recent games A solid base has meant United are then able to show their quality in the opposition s half The clearest examples of this have come in United s victories over Southampton and Leicester The Red Devils were not dominant in them games and did not play free flowing football They showed the ability to be competitive and match the opposition s work rate Bruno Fernandes scored in the victory at Southampton and finished off his chance brilliantly Jadon Sancho showed great composure in his winning goal against Leicester This proves the amount of quality Ten Hag has at his disposal and it will be difficult for many sides in the Europa League to match United s quality Manchester United s squad depth is strong Ten Hag will be forced to rotate the squad in the upcoming months as United will be playing a game every days This is not a disadvantage as the squad depth is now strong The club also possesses talented youngsters with the likes of Zidane Iqbal and Charlie Savage who impressed in pre season These players will surely be given a chance to shine under Ten Hag and they will have the opportunity to compete for starting places for United in the Premier League Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw are also set to be given a chance in the Europa League as they have lost their place in the starting eleven Both players are established international players and have what it takes to perform at a high level Confidence seems to be an issue and the Europa League is a good stage to improve their confidence leaves The same is the case with Cristiano Ronaldo as Ten Hag seems to prefer Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial over the Portuguese legend
