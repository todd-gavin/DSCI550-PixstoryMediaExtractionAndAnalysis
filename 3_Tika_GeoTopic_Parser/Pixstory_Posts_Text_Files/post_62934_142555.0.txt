1. Egypt- The most well-known site where ancient fossils were found is in Egypt, where a team of archaeologists working at the Giza Plateau discovered the remains of four animals that lived more than 30 million years ago. This discovery helped to change our understanding of the early evolution of mammals, and has since led to further discoveries at other archaeological sites in Egypt.
2. Iraq- In 2003, an Iraqi team led by Dr. Zahi Hawass discovered a number of fossilized animal skeletons in the Gharraf desert near Baghdad. These remains date back to around 50 million years ago, and have helped us to better understand the history and evolution of early mammals.
3. Spain- a team of Spanish archaeologists working in southeastern Spain discovered the remains of a prehistoric elephant that was over two meters tall and weighed nearly one hundred tons! This find has helped us to better understand how elephants evolved over time, and has also led to the discovery of other ancient elephant fossils around the world.
4. China- A team of Chinese researchers working at Jiufeng County unearthed a number of specimens from the Middle Jurassic period (163â€“201 million years ago). These include fossils from both land and marine creatures, which have allowed us to gain a better understanding of prehistoric life on Earth.
5. North America - While North America isn't known for its prehistoric findings, evidence suggests that this may not be the case for much longer. Fossils have been discovered that date back over 55 million years!
6. Kazakhstan - Kazakhstan holds some of the world's oldest known fossils, which date back to over 600 million years ago!
7. India - India has also yielded a wealth of ancient fossils, including ones belonging to the elephant family and even an extinct genus of monkey!
8. Antarctica - Perhaps one of the least expected places to yield prehistoric finds is Antarctica! This includes specimens from both land-dwelling and marine animals alike.
