Jan 6 committee has warned of more violence that too upon their party. “There is violence in the future, I’m going to tell you,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), on ABC’s “This Week.” “And until we get a grip on telling people the truth, we can’t expect any differently.” Kinzinger described the threats that he had received in the mail at home about violence against him, his wife, and his baby. 

According to Washington Post, Public officials have been immersed with such threats in recent months, many ones spurred by former president Donald Trump’s continued obsession with the baseless claim that his 2020 loss was the result of a vast conspiracy of fraud. 

Kinzinger said. “If you truly believe the deep state-owned the election and the democracy were stolen and the election was stolen, that’s the most logical outcome,”. He had also voted to impeach Trump after the Jan 6 attack and is not running for reelection. The committee aimed to make clear to the people of America that Trump was repeatedly told his loss was legitimate and that his strategies to overturn Joe Biden’s win were illegal but moved forward anyhow.

On the fourth public hearing, the panel will be focussing on the pressure applied to a state official to overturn the elections.
