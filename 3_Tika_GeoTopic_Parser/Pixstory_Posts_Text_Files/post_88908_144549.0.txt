Cheetahs, the world's fastest mammals is set to make a comeback in India after 70 years. The species of big cat family went extinct in 1952 falling prey to the royal bait. 
The government has planned to reintroduce 50 cheetahs in India over the next five years.
This year the country was to receive 20 African cheetahs – 8 from Namibia and another 12 from South Africa, but Environment Ministry officials have said that, the assent from the South African government is still awaited.
However, India signed a pact in july with Namibia for the reintroduction of Cheetahs. In the first phase 8 African cheetahs- 3 male and 5 females, will be brought to the Kuno national park (MP), on 17th September. 
Kuno national park became an important consideration as it was once home to cheetahs, having ideal vegetation for them to ambush and hunt. 
On friday (September 16), B-747 Jumbo jet will take off from Hosea Kutako International Airport in Windhoek, Namibia for Jaipur. From there Cheetahs will be transferred by helicopter to Kuno national park. They will be quarantined for a month, then will be released into a bigger enclosure of six square kilometres until they adapt to the new environment. 
Cheetah facilities have been well developed, the staff has been trained, and leopards larking in the enclosures have been moved away. 
According to the PIB release, Cheetahs will help in the restoration of open forest and grassland ecosystems in India. This will help conserve biodiversity and enhance the ecosystem services like water security, carbon sequestration and soil moisture conservation, benefiting the society at large.
