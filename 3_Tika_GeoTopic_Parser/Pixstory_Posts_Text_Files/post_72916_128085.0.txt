Food safety officials searched several eateries inside a well-known mall in Anna Nagar, Chennai, on Tuesday. They seized stale meat from a few eateries. Following complaints about the unsanitary food supplied in the local restaurants, the authorities took this measure.

The food court of the mall had a surprise examination by a team of inspectors led by Dr. Satheesh Kumar, the city of Chennai's authorised food safety officer.

Flies and even small cockroaches were seen running on the kitchen walls of one of the hotel management's well-known vegetarian restaurants, revealing the poor hygiene standards upheld by the staff. The raw ingredients stored by the hotel management were also infested with flies. The government ordered the hotel management to destroy all of the raw materials after issuing a stop-sale notice. They can reopen only after a thorough and completely cleanup of the premises. 

The authorities discovered improperly packed food in another Italian restaurant. The investigators discovered cold drinks in one of the chaats establishments that had no expiration date.

"We received a complaint on Monday of poor quality food served at a restaurant here in which a worm was found. Based on it we inspected several restaurants today. We found stale meat in a couple of restaurants and we have seized them. We have issued stop-sale notices to four shops. They need to be rectified within 15 days. They need to follow all procedures including the pest control measures and submit their report. I will inspect these shops again and then only will provide permission to reopen them. We will be monitoring all the restaurants in the city and stringent action will be initiated against those who are not following the food safety norms,‚Äù he said.
