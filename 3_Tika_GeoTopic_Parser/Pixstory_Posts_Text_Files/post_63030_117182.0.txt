After the debate about homework being good for children happened on pixstory, it made me very curious about knowing why some people believe homework isn't good. And after reading people's cases, I have indeed have a different perception of the same.

Our education system has many flaws, and homework is just one of them - often overlooked and quite often not even considered in such discussions. 

Kids, being young and in their developing years, need proper time and rest for themselves, to help them grow, explore their interests and hobbies. 

The idea of homework - of having extra work to do around the same thing that one just spent hours on, is exhausting. That, coupled with the quantum and nature of homeworks generally given to children do nothing but increase stress for kids, add to the pressure and set an extra standard of measurement for a child's worth, which is extremely unhealthy, especially at that age. 

Also, the quantum of homeworks given lead to kids having to give up their play time, time they could've spent on exploring new things, sometimes even sleep - inculcating the culture of overworking, overburdening which later develops into difficulties in maintaining proper work - life balance, thus leading to decreased performance and negative enviroments overall. 

Homeworks are doing more damage to our children in an already broken system.
