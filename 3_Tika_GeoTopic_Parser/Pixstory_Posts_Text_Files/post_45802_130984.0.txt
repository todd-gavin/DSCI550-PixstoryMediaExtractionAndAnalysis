Unless you're a colossal black hole, no one can hear you cry in outer space. 

On Sunday, NASA shared what the organisation referred to as the sound of a black hole in a listenable format, making this abundantly clear. 

And as Mashable reported, NASA has an answer for the question of how the hell sound travels in the void of space. 

"The misconception that there is no sound in space originates because most space is a ~vacuum, providing no way for sound waves to travel. A galaxy cluster has so much gas that we've picked up actual sound. Here it's amplified, and mixed with other data, to hear a black hole," NASA's account dedicated to exoplanets tweeted.

You are "hearing" the Perseus galaxy cluster, which was recorded in May for NASA's Black Hole Week using data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. "Astronomers discovered that pressure waves thrown out by the black hole generated ripples in the heated gas of the cluster, which might be translated into a note â€“ one that humans cannot hear," NASA said at the time.
