I was born in Odisha s Khurda district as the eldest of three brothers however I identify myself as a woman I have always been a woman now I have transitioned into one and am proud of it However it wasn t always easy My life and its struggles were difficult for sure From a poor family but a good student hence excelled in studies and did my MBA Childhood wasn t easy It was all about the harassment I faced in school I always wanted to be a girl I wanted to be like my mother a woman who would just stay home take care of her family and raise children very traditional roles of a female fascinated me Even today given a choice I would be a stay at home mum however earning is living so I have to earn to live So with time my struggle became multifold as I grew I tried to hide myself hide the woman in me and in the process act more manly It was only when my family started putting pressure on me for marrying did I have to come out They just didn t seem to understand hence in I had to leave my family and my home With a friends help got a sex appropriation surgery done While the sex change operation is legal in the country however with it came the insensitivity of the world and that hit me While you can legally change your gender marriage of a transgender person is not legalised as yet Although transgenders have been there since the time of Ramayana but we still have a long way to go Inspite of my education I had no job I was a marketing executive for a multinational but I lost my job due to my gender identity The transgender population in the state was either begging or doing sex work for a living I also tried to do that for a while but something in me maybe my conscience my pride didn t let me do that As told to ToufiqRashid Part one To be continued
