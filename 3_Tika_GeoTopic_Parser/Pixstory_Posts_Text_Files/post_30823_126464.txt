Great scare for Letizia Paternoster engaged in the European track cycling, the thirty-year-old who fell at km/h after being unbalanced by the Polish Lorkowska by beating against the glass barrier The first aid was used to stabilize her and then transport her to the Bogenhausen clinic in Munich The medical report speaks of concussive trauma slight non-displaced fracture of the right clavicle in three points complete amnesia of what happened After the night in the clinic her conditions are judged to be improving and Paternoster herself has reassured everyone through a story published on Instagram I try to smile and try to think to the big goals in front of me I broke my collarbone in three parts and had a head injury I will be back soon Thanks to all for the messages A kiss I will keep you updated
