So I practiced this silent sensitization for almost three years. Finally, when I started my gender-affirming surgeries, I spoke to the managing director of the hospital, and he was so supportive. 

We had a compiled meeting for the staff, who were shocked to know that I am transgender. But they couldn't reject me, they accepted me because they knew I am the same old person, the same old doctor. 

There were struggles in the beginning, but as my transition progressed, my colleagues accepted me, my workspace accepted me, and my patients accepted me.

It was the toughest with patients, who would search for a male doctor, and I would tell them, ‘Here I am. I am the same gender. Don't judge me by my gender. Because I'm the same human being with the same degree, and graduation and post-graduation, and knowledge.’

When I was doing my graduation, even I wasn't aware of the term transgender or LGBTQI+ but now we have queer clubs, in almost all professional colleges in our state. 

They're inviting me for talks. I am very proud and happy to attend in my own identity, speaking about my gender, which I had to hide from students in the beginning stages of my career. 

I'm happy practicing as myself. It's definitely a happy story.
