Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick has spoken out on Marcus Rashford s future after reports linking the attacker with a move away from Old Trafford The manager insists that the player s future can only be decided when the transfer window reopens in the summer Following Manchester United s loss to Manchester City last weekend there were whispers that Marcus Rashford was disgruntled with the club Ralf Rangnick has refuted the allegations claiming that he is unconcerned about what is published in the media I spoke with him Rashford yesterday and the day before yesterday so I don t know anything about that the tactician was quoted as saying as per Sky Sports In my years of professional football I have been deciding not to take too much notice of things happening in the media He didn t say anything to me He said to me that he s still happy and that he wants to perform on a high level here for the club He didn t mention a thing about not being happy here Ralf Rangnick on the other hand refused to rule out the possibility of Marcus Rashford leaving the club Instead the German has advised the attacker to concentrate on the present season and postpone his transfer aspirations until the summer transfer window reopens But again I mean the window is closed right now Even in case suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club well then he can do that but in the summer Now the window is closed and it s got nothing to do with tomorrow s game or the game on Tuesday Rashford is clearly not performing at his best right now In the summer he might be tempted to leave the club in pursuit of greener pastures
