Tennis coach and former player Darren Cahill has said that Lleyton Hewitt was unlucky in his career because of the injuries he had to deal with along with the emergence of generational talents like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

A 20-year-old Hewitt became the youngest male player to be ranked World No. 1 after winning the 2001 Tennis Masters Cup in Sydney. He also won his maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open that year, beating four-time champion Pete Sampras in straight sets in the final.

Hewitt added to his Major collection at Wimbledon the following year, but a string of injuries and the rise of Federer and Nadal stymied his progress. He won four of his first five matches against both players but went on to lose 15 matches in a row against Federer and six against Nadal.

Nevertheless, the Australian had a successful career and was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, this week
