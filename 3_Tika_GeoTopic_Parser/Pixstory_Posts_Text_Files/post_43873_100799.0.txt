The top four race was in their favor. They had their fate in their hands but it is onto Tottenham
Hotspur and Norwich City now.

Arsenal will be ruining themselves for missing an absolute
chance to get back to the European elite competition after six years. The loss to Newcastle
United is hurting not only the players but their fans also.

Arsenal started the season on a poor note as they lost all three games and found themselves
with a negative goal difference and 20th position. However, the club under Mikel Arteta made a
significant effort to take them to the top half of the table. By the time they approached the
mid-season, they were able to spot the top-four position within touching distance.

With multiple results going their way as well as a few clubs bottling the easy games, Arsenal
finally found themselves in the top four. With two games to go, they had their fate in their hands
and were against Newcastle United and Norwich City.

However, the loss against Newcastle
United have compounded Arsenal’s misery.

With a game left, Arsenal will have to pray for Tottenham’s downfall on the final day of the
season. Arsenal still have a chance to qualify for the UEFA Champions League 2022/23 and
here is how they can make it:

Scenario 1: Arsenal to win and Tottenham Hotspur to lose
Arsenal need a win no matter what on the final day of the campaign. On the other hand, they
need Tottenham Hotspur to lose to Norwich City at Carrow Road. This would allow Arsenal to
reach 69 points whereas Tottenham Hotspur will drop out of the top four with 68 points to their
name.

Scenario 2: Arsenal to win and Tottenham Hotspur to draw
Arsenal have to take three points and will have to pray to Norwich City to hold the Lillywhites for
a stalemate or a draw. In this scenario, both teams will end up at 69 points. However, if they
have to take this route, they will have to defeat Everton by a 15-goal margin which will be the
Premier League record in itself.
