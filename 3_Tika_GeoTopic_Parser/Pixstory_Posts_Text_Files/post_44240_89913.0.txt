Why does Barcelona spend so much money on football players when they could just rely on La Masia?

Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Pep Guardiola, Carles Puyol, Amor, Albert Ferrer, Vctor Valdés, Pedro, Thiago, and others are just a handful of the graduates.

The top ten worst Barcelona signings in recent memory will be discussed in this article.


#7.  Roberto Bonano

In 2001, he was signed from River Plate for €1.2 million.

Roberto Bonano was such a bumbling fool.

Bonano will always be remembered for palming a misplaced Zinedine Zidane chip into his own net.

Steve McManaman chipped him later in the game.

What was the significance of this game?

It was the first leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-finals in 2001/02.

Real Madrid won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League for the ninth time a month later.


#6.  Alexander Hleb 

In 2008, he was signed from Arsenal for €15 million.

This is the epitome of a career-threatening decision. Since leaving London, Alexander Hleb has never been the same footballer.

Hleb was the ideal player for Arsenal. He wasn't world-class, but he was a Premier League footballer with a lot of technical ability.

He threw everything away to keep the Barcelona benches warm.

In addition, €15 million? Are you joking?

He is still on Barcelona's books.


#5.  Alfonso

In 2000, he was signed for €16.5 million from Real Betis.

This signing could not have been written any better.

In the aftermath of Luis Figo's betrayal of the Culés, Barcelona signed Alfonso from Real Betis, a Real Madrid product.

Alfonso had surpassed a pricey, ineffective showpony in Denlson during his tenure at Betis.

Alfonso was now on his way to Barcelona as a high-priced signing, but he was ineffective.

In the end, each La Liga goal, he cost Barcelona €8.25 million.
