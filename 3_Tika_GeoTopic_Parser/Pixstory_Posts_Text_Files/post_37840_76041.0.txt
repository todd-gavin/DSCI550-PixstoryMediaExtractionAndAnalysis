The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:

-Crowded places;
-Close-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;
-Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.  

The risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3Cs” overlap.
