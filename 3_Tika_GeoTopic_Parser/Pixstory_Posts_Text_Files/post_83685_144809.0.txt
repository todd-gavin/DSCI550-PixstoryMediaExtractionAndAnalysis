If you want to be in a happy and healthy relationship, here's the number one I think most important thing, and it comes from the Austrian musician Franz Schubert, he says:
Happy is the man who has found a true friend.
Happiest is the man who has found a true friend in his partner. And I love that so much. Because what is friendship with a partner? 
It means being heard and understood introverts together. It means not needing the rest of the world, such as when I'm at a party and all I want to do is go home and be with you. It means I could sit with you in silence and still feel happy and fulfilled. Or it could mean that we will never run out of things to talk. That is friendship within love; I want you to be the first person I see every day and the last person I kiss good night before we go to bed. That is also why Nietzsche stated that what causes most relationships to fail is a lack of friendship rather than a lack of love.
"He said the happiest man is a man who finds friendship with his partner," Schubert knew.
