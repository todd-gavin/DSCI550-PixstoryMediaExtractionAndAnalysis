According to rumours, Arsenal has made an approach to recruit Feyenoord midfielder Luis Sinisterra.
The Gunners are aiming to expand their squad once more this summer, with teenage winger Sinisterra fitting Mikel Arteta's requirements.
The Colombian, at the age of 22, is the ideal age for the Spaniard to work with and develop.
 The Gunners have submitted a proposal to Sinisterra and his advisors, according to Corriere dello Sport, but will face stiff competition for his signing.
Napoli is the most recent team to pursue the four-cap international. The Serie A club is looking for a successor for Lorenzo Insigne, who has agreed to join Toronto in the summer.
The £12.5 million-rated ace is also wanted by Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen.
Sinisterra, on the other hand, has started learning English this year, which gives the Gunners an advantage. 
His contract in the Netherlands expires in 2024. This season, the 5ft 8in ace has been in superb form for Feyenoord.
In 38 games in all competitions, he has 18 goals, including a recent strike against Ajax. Arteta would gain yet another quality offensive option if Sinisterra could be secured.
He'd be exclusively deployed on the left wing, where he'd compete for a spot with Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe.
ARSENAL are the clear favourite to win the competition. 
Cody Gakpo of PSV Eindhoven Gakpo has had an outstanding season, scored 16 goals and provided 15 assists in 37 games.
The north Londoners, according to Voetbal International, are the most likely to win the bidding war and sign the £42 million-rated winger. 
After losing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Barcelona in the January transfer window, Arsenal attempted to sign the Netherlands international. 
Mikel Arteta, the manager, sought to bolster his assault, but Eindhoven had already signed the 22-year-old to a new contract until 2026.
