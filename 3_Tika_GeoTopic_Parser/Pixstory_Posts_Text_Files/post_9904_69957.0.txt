It is the fear I see in their eyes which gives me strength
So much effort to put us in chains, because clearly we are a threat
When the women become educated and hold up their guns to defend their people,
What words can describe the shame that will fall upon the "men" who call themselves Taliban?
Placed amongst political games, our hands become tied
They take away the things that will empower us to rise up and beyond their selfish shallow games
They take away our freedom to learn, our freedom to dress
our freedom to speak
So we put on their attire and become our own breadwinners
They kill our Men and call themselves 'men'
Where is the ghairat (dignity) when you proudly display your so called strength
by opressing innocent women?
The Afghan Woman has endured years of this
Her children have endured years more
We endure, but we do not break
If you silence us, our sisters will speak out.
If you try and silence them,
their sisters will scream out.
We have become scientists, doctors, and scholars.
We have become athletes and engineers and activists.
Does that scare you?
Because you should know,
We will scream until the world can hear our voices
Not a plea for help because it has become clear that
everyone is here to help themselves
We will scream God is Great from our rooftops
Our voices will melt into our land
The Watan does not accept you
These lands are for the pure of heart
Take what you like but you will never see the blessings
Of those which are taken forcibly
These are the lands which our blood has been nurtured on
Intruders are not welcome.
These are the lands you have torn away from our children
and their children and their children
We will scream until you understand that
no matter how many shackles you bind us with
Our hearts and our hope can never be caged.
