United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders Mary Lawlor, since her appointment in April 2020, has frequently written to the Indian government about hounding of or attacks on human-rights defenders and criminalisation of their work. She told us that the government rarely responds but she would continue to press for dialogue and advised Indians to never give up hope.

 “It is hard to take someone seriously if they won’t even grace you with a response.” 

That was United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Mary Lawlor, to Article 14 during an interview, conducted over email, referring to the government of India’s lack of response to communications sent by Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

Lawlor, 70, said India’s response rate to the OHCHR was only 37.5% since she took over as the Special Rapporteur in May 2020, with a response to 10 of 16 communications, seeking the government’s response on issues related to threats and police action against human-rights defenders.

The most recent OHCHR communication with the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on 26 April 2021, about the threats against and attack on a Tamil Nadu human rights defender with disabilities, Ramachandran (who appears to use one name).

Lawlor also referred to the law used (here, here, here and here) against many human-rights defenders, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967, and how its vague definitions of “unlawful activities” and “membership of terrorist organisations” gives discretionary powers to State agencies and allows “arbitrary enforcement with weak judicial oversight”. 

“As a result,” said Lawlor, “those critical of Government policy, such as human-rights defenders, have been disproportionately targeted under its provisions”.

Lawlor, said though the conviction rate for those charged under the UAPA was “incredibly low” (3 %), it allows for human rights defenders to be held without bail for extended periods of time with little proof.
