Erik Conover is now 96kg of pure muscle.

Without a doubt, Chris Hemsworth would take out the prize of ‘Hottest Celebrity Bod’ year after year. So, when the A-list celeb launched his own fitness program Centr, YouTuber Erik Conover jumped on the opportunity to follow Hemsworth’s exact diet and exercise routine for 90 days to see if he could replicate the Avengers stars’ iconic body.

What he wasn’t expecting was that only 30 days into the challenge, Erik saw “amazing results”.

He then posted a YouTube video of his progress, which went viral (it already has over 5 million views) and caught the attention of Chris himself.

And just because Chris is well, Chris, he decided to meet with Erik in New York to do a personal training session with him. Literally our dream.

Fast forward another 60 days of training and eating like Thor, and Erik is ripped. Like, true Hemsworth-ripped.

But what’s even more interesting is the fact that his body transformation isn’t one of weight loss. It’s one of weight gain.

“I have gained about 10 solid pounds (almost 5kg) of muscle,” Erik tells Body + Soul.

And his results definitely didn’t come without hard work or determination.

We exclusively spoke to Erik to get all the juicy deets on exactly how he was able to completely transform his body in three months.

What did your diet and exercise routine look like before the challenge?

A: I have always maintained a relatively healthy lifestyle. I was a competitive swimmer growing up and rower at Northeastern University in Boston. Prior to the challenge I thought that eating clean meant eating bland, but through Centr I’ve discovered lots of meals that I wouldn’t have normally tried that are delicious.

What was your heaviest weight?

A: I am currently at my heaviest weight! 213 pounds (about 96kg) of pure muscle. I have never been one to measure my health and wellbeing by a number on a scale. This challenge was about putting on weight through muscle.
