AFC Champions Al Hilal SFC faced European champions Chelsea in the first semi-final of the Fifa Club World Cup 2021, which took place in Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi.

Since the game took place close to my home, I reached the venue early to witness the preparation of match-going supporters of both clubs. 

Being a neutral fan, it was difficult in the beginning for me to confidently reach out and speak to people as each and every person asked me one question: “Which team are you supporting today?” To be honest, I stuttered since I didn't have an answer. 

Watching the game with Al Hilal fans was a no brainer for me as I support one of Chelsea's fiercest rivals in the Premier League. Sitting at Section W, which was situated behind the goal post, gave me a vertical view of the pitch. 

As I was making myself comfortable, a man with a blue jacket came up to me asking the same question as above regarding the team I supported. Again, I didn't have an answer. 

That didn't stop the person from giving me a blue scarf labeled Al Hilal. I was quite surprised with that man's kind attitude as he invited me to join the chorus of chants sung by the traveling fans from Saudi.

The Blues from Riyadh acted as the 12th man by motivating their team to take risks against Chelsea. They were close to scoring a good goal but Chelsea's Kepa saved it. Game ended 0-1.

Despite the loss, fans praised the team spirit and gave each other a hug to sign off with respect. This amazed me because before the game, every Hilal fan had a divided opinion on Leonardo Jardim's side but the travelling supporters were UNITED till the end and acted as anchors of the ship that sailed along tumultuous waves.

Most fans predicted a defeat but they never gave up their support. Both Chelsea and Hilal squad members appreciated the vocal fans from Riyadh for encouraging each player to stay on their toes.

Overall, this event taught me the true value of seeing a match live in an arena.
