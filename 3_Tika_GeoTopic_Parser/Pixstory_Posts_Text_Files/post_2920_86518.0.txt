For the all-powerful, world-conquering men's rugby team of All Blacks, it was a simple message on International Women's Day. The team on Wednesday tweeted a post with four male players. It read, "Forever grateful to all the women in our lives that allow us to play the game we love. Partners, mothers, daughters, doctors, physios, referees, administrators and fans. Appreciate you every day."

The firestorm of criticism followed with many saying that it was a "tone-deaf" message on Women's Day. And it was not limited to New Zealand alone. What incensed many women by the post were pictures of Sevu Reece and Aaron Smith, rugby stars with controversial pasts, especially of Reece, who has pledged guilty of assaulting his partner in 2018.

New Zealand's women team - known as the Black Ferns - is also a champion team, and it also tweeted, but it was about women. 

Looking at the heavy criticism, New Zealand Rugby finally had to douse the fire by apologizing. "NZR and our Teams in Black celebrated International Women's Day across all of our digital channels and our intent was to portray the many roles women have in our game," a NZR spokesperson said. https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/all-blacks-issue-apology-over-tone-deaf-women-s-day-tweet-20220310-p5a3iv.html "We didn't get it right and we apologize – our entire rugby whānau are so proud of our Black Ferns and all our wāhine, in everything that they do on and off the pitch." Whanau means an extended family or community of families. Wahine in Maori means young women. The All Blacks' Twitter account deleted the controversial tweet.
