Bernd Schuster

To take things a step further, Schuster did not simply travel from Barcelona to Madrid; he also travelled across the street to Atletico Madrid.

Schuster, dubbed "the Blonde Angel," joined Barca from Cologne as a 20-year-old in 1980 and won a number of championships during his eight seasons there.

He was a key player of the squad throughout the 1980s, scoring 10 goals or more in seven of his eight seasons at the club until leaving for Real Madrid in 1988.

After two league victories in two years, Atletico won two Copa del Rey medals in two years. He returned to Germany in 1993 after 12 years in Spain, joining Bayer Leverkusen.

Gheorghe Hagi

The 'Carpathian Maradona' spent two seasons at both Real Madrid and Barcelona, but did not win a league title with either club.

After impressing for Romania at the 1990 World Cup, he joined Real Madrid, although his time there was marked by flashes of brilliance rather than continuous success.
In 1992, he moved to Brescia after scoring some great goals but only winning one Spanish Super Cup. They were demoted in their first season, but he returned to assist them reclaim Serie A at the first try before joining Barca in Spain.

Hagi won another Super Cup under Johan Cruyff, but he left in 1996 to join Galatasaray, where he had a more prolific time.
