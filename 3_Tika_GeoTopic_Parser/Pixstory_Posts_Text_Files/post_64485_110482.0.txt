Imagine you’re walking through a mall, window-shopping with your friends. The bright lights surround you everywhere, and the crowd is bustling, each person a part of this pushing organism that seems to expand everywhere. And suddenly, a bright flash – a thundering sound that shakes your bones and the entire structure. A missile blast. Something similar happened in Kremenchuk, Ukraine on June 27, 2022 – just yesterday.

Two Russian missiles damaged a crowded shopping centre in the centre of city. About 59 people were wounded, and (at least) 16 were killed. Rescuers are still searching the rubble, and will most definitely come across more dead bodies. 1,000 people witnessed the terrible attack, watching as the missiles claimed the lives of their fellow citizens and caused a huge fire spreading black smoke across the sky.

“It’s useless to hope for decency and humanity from Russia,” Zelenskiy wrote. Russia probably targeted the city because therein lies Ukraine’s biggest oil refinery, making it a strategic site for carrying out an attack and injuring the country by destroying infrastructure. Russia’s deputy ambassador has claimed that the attack was a “Ukrainian provocation”, citing zero evidence to the United Nations. This isn’t the first missile attack on Ukraine – and it’s useless to hope that this will be the last.
