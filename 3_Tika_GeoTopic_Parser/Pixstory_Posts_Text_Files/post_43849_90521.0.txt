Cristiano Ronaldo made his Portugal debut in a 1-0 win against Kazakhstan, and few could have predicted the impact he would have on the national team over the next 17 years. Ronaldo was named captain of Portugal in 2007 and has led his country to recent international success. Ronaldo, the 10-time Portuguese Footballer of the Year, is now universally regarded as one of the best players of all time, and here's a look back at what has happened since his debut on August 20, 2003.

Ricardo
Ricardo retired in 2014 after making 79 appearances for Portugal and stints with Sporting Lisbon, Real Betis, and Leicester City. On the Algarve, he now runs his own real estate company.

Miguel Monteiro
Miguel was one of the most sought-after right-backs in European soccer in 2005.
Valencia won the race to recruit him, but the defender never lived up to the anticipation during his seven years in Spain, spending time in and out of the squad before retiring in 2012.
He tried unsuccessfully to come out of retirement in 2014.

Fernando Meira
Meira was a record signing for VfB Stuttgart in 2002, and he helped the German team win the Bundesliga in 2006/07.

After one season with the club, he moved to Galatasaray before finishing his career with Zenit Saint Petersburg and Real Zaragoza.
Meira chastised Ronaldo for rushing off the pitch and throwing his captain's armband on the ground before the final whistle in Portugal's 2-2 draw with Serbia earlier this year.

Fernando Couto
Fernando Couto, a central defender for Portugal, was one of only six players to reach 100 caps. He retired in 2008.
Following his retirement, the former FC Barcelona player temporarily tried his hand at managing with SC Braga in Portugal and Manchester Howrah in India.

Rui Jorge
Rui Jorge, a left-back who spent his whole professional career in Portugal, retired in 2006 with Belenenses.
Since 2010, the now 48-year-old has served as the manager of Portugal's national under-21 squad.
