Today i went to see EK VILLAIN RETURNS 
According to me it was a good movie not a blockbuster kinda thing but a one time watch you can say. 

The movie keeps u on the edge of your seat till the end. Full of action with rocking music and background score.
John Abraham is there to steal ur hearts again. 
Arjun Kapoor is very much surprising 
What to say about Disha and Tara mam. They have blown away everyone's minds with their sizzling look , also their role was good enough. But Yes, the trailer looked promising with some serious suspense hidden within, true, but the movie hardly has any suspense. 
And the story line could be more powerful.

And according to IMDb the movie was Made on a budget of ₹39 crore, the film became a major box-office success with earnings of over ₹100 crore domestically and a worldwide gross of ₹170 crore. The songs "Galliyan", "Zaroorat", "Hamdard" became huge hits.
