‌Religion and faith are magnets that attract people. Do magnets seek permission to pull people towards them? Faith is a very subjective issue. From Christians to Atheists every faith or faith in absence of faith should be respected. Politics comes with agendas, and differing opinions but should stand together in a nation. But what if religion marries politics? And politicians of all shades and regions have used religion to further their political agenda at some time or another. 
‌
In my opinion, ‌when religion comes into contact with politics there is a loss of freedom and peace. Favouritism prevails.  America is no different in this regard where evangelical Christians have played an important part in the journey of the Republican party.  It isn't easy for a non-Christian to succeed at the top level of US politics.  Judge Jackson said: “My faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in judging" this is good as it is always better to separate religion and politics. But can she really put aside her faith while judging? 
‌
‌Let's not forget about Russia; the notion of holy war it propagated. Just days after Putin's fiery announcement that he will invade Ukraine came the statement of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Russian Orthodox Church in which he congratulated Putin for his responsible service to the people of Russia. He praised the military service as “an active manifestation of evangelical love for neighbours.” Within hours, bombs began to pour down in Ukraine! Putin's theological groundwork did its job in Russia for the most affirming the war as holy in the minds. What does the church get in turn, reviving faith and sticking to religious norms such as dismissing same-sex relations or abortion? This religious storm isn't taking the world anywhere, I say so better keep religion and politics separate.
