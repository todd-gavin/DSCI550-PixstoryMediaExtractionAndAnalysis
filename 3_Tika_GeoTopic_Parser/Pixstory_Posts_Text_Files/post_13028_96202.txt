It is clear that the years of war and crisis have deprived Afghanistan of everything All the infrastructure of the country was destroyed These include agricultural resources and livestock and infrastructure The destruction of forests and pastures is another part of this tragedy This widespread destruction occurred either directly as a result of the war or due to misuse But the result has been one thing and that is the destruction of the environment and the beautiful nature of the country References to historical documents all speak of the special beauty of Afghanistan A country that has enjoyed a special natural freshness and freshness Especially Kabul whose beauty has been well known in general and in particular He had bequeathed to the king that he should be buried in Kabul after his death But what is left of all that beauty today Except for a trail of dirt and debris Dry fields and stressed lands Dense forests with only a few trees left now Snow capped mountains and rivers whose roaring waterfalls caressed the ears and made the eyes shine But now they have either dried up or turned into mud and swamp A clear example is the Kabul River The river that once gave beauty to the city of Kabul but now its swamp and decay have not only made the city ugly but also made life difficult in Kabul and have become the source of dozens of Sari and non Sari diseases In any case if in the years of war and crisis there was no clear and responsible political rule now there is a clear political system and responsible officials in the country who should show sensitivity and conscientiousness towards these issues One of the important departments and departments that also allocates a part of the national budget is the Department of Environmental Protection In the current situation if the shortcomings and losses of the past are not compensable but there is no expectation that those shortcomings and losses will continue and expand
