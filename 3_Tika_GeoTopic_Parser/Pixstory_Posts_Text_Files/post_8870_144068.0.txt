“(9) There will be less of law making. Each State is making so many laws, 
even lawyers and judges do not know what the laws are, though everyone is 
supposed to know the law. There is great multiplicity of laws. That country 
is best governed which is governed by least number of laws. To keep legislatures going, some laws have to be made whether necessary or not and whether enforcible or not. In course of time there will be endless laws and we will be in a jungle of laws. All we need in India is one law making body i.e. Parliament and no more. 
“I am fully conscious of the fact that my proposal has no chance of success 
unless it is sponsored by you and Rashtrapatiji and Pandit Pant. Constitution cannot be changed except with consent of State legislatures and they certainly 
will not be prepared to sign their own death warrant. It will be strongly 
opposed by local politicians and it will have no chance of a reasonable or fair hearing, unless you take it up. With your prestige and influence there is a 
possibility of providing a safeguard against disruption in the country by amending the Constitution, otherwise it would go into pieces again and history 
will repeat itself. 
“As an alternative I would suggest curtailment of power of State legislatures and State ministers and adding to the power of the Central legislature 
and of the Centre. Concurrent list should be done away with and power to make laws on these subjects left to the Centre, State powers mentioned under 
list 2 should be cut down and law and order and police made Central subjects 
and most of the important services should be made Central. “Hoping to be excused for the encroachment on your valuable time.
