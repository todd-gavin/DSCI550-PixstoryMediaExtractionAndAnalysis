Australia s looming challenge of extreme turning Sri Lankan Test wickets has been laid bare after being spun out of the one day series with a four run defeat in Colombo Chasing David Warner played a lone hand with as Australia capitulated from in the th over to be all out for and down in the five match series The margin could also have been far worse if not for Pat Cummins s and Matthew Kuhnemann scoring from the final over off Dasun Shanaka before being caught in the ring on the final ball But it couldn t paper over Australia s uphill battle against spin Seven wickets fell to the slower bowlers as Sri Lanka played five turners and sent down overs from them on a used wicket that spun well into the night Just over a week out from the first Test in Galle the hosts win will likely confirm the blueprint on how they plan to beat Australia in the red ball format Legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay took offspinner Dhananjaya de Silva and mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana Warner meanwhile had looked in control after Aaron Finch Mitch Marsh Marnus Labuschagne and Alex Carey all came and went The opener was cagey in the early overs before taking on Theekshana He hit boundaries in his knock going hard through the covers and driving superbly And when he reached Warner looked almost certain to end the longest century drought of his international career which now sits at innings across all formats But the match then swung violently in Sri Lanka s favour handing them their first bilateral one day series win over Australia at home since With Warner at the non striker s end Travis Head was bowled by Dhananjaya before Glenn Maxwell was trapped lbw by Theekshana next over And when Warner finally got back on strike Dhananjaya drew him off balance and beat his outside edge to have him stumped
