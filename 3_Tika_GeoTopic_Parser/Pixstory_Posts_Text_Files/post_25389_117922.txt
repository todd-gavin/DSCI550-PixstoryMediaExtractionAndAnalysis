Being back home after months made me realise how much I took my mother for granted What i am today what skills i possess today its all because of my mom She s the only person I can ever fully trust to have my back whenever I ll fall I ve never really had good relationship with my father and I don t think I ll have one in future as well So my mother is everything I have she s devoted her life for me and my brother She got married very young and then had me she never got to explore or live her life so it is my life s purpose now to give her the explorer life she forever wished for I m literally in teard while writing this post but it is what it is My mother has truly sacrificed herself for this family yet her efforts are not appreciated which is wrong on so many levels and even after doing so much for everyone she s always got to hear what have you ever done Recently only she s has started speaking up against my father because of my brother s and my motivation and its a good step towards being independent on her part TMI now but I ll just leave this post here as an appreciation for everything she has done for me and how she s gone against my father to make me a dancer and swimmer that I am And being back home reminded me of how much i love laying my head in her lap and being comforted in her arms I ll always love her
