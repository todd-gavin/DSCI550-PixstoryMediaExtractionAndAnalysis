Committee's hard work is very evident and Liz Cheney indeed puts up a good fight here. For two hours the committee aired snippets of about a dozen pretaped interviews, varying from Trump’s former attorney general to his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump (testifying that she accepted the Justice Department’s assessment that the election wasn’t stolen), from Trump campaign officials to attackers who are now serving jail time for breaching the Capitol.

They also showed the public new footage of the attack, splicing images of serious rioters yelling obscenities and waving Trump flags as they marched, with body-camera footage from panicked Capitol Hill police officers.

 Cheney reminded the American public: “[O]ur investigation is still ongoing. So what we make public here will not be the complete set of information we will ultimately disclose.” And she added that Justice Department criminal investigations are also ongoing, precisely mentioning that investigators are de-encrypting messages from those involved in the attack or election conspiracies.

That could mean completely new evidence may be disclosed even with the hearings underway, or that the committee will keep sharing disclosures throughout the summer — as the midterm elections near.

Committee plans on releasing the final report in September.
