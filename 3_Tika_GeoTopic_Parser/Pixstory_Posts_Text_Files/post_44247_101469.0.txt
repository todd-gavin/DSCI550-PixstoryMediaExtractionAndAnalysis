Divock Origi, a "Liverpool icon," will depart the club this summer, with the attacker poised to join
AC Milan when his contract ends, according to Jurgen Klopp.

Since joining Liverpool in 2015, Origi has become a cult hero thanks to a succession of
memorable goals, including his comeback-sealing double against Barcelona in the Champions
League semi-finals and his stoppage-time winner against Everton in 2019.

But the signing of Luis Diaz in January has only added to Origi's lack of first-team opportunities,
and his desire for more regular playing time will almost certainly see him leave Merseyside for
Milan at the end of the season.

"I anticipate Div being given a special send-off. He will always be a Liverpool legend to me, and
working with him has been a pleasure, "Klopp added.

"He's one of the most valuable guys I've ever had." He will be successful in any endeavor he
undertakes. "When he goes, it will be a difficult time. "Without a doubt, he is a Liverpool legend.

"I don't want to see anyone leave, but that's life," Klopp said of other possible departures.
No
one has approached me and expressed a desire to quit. Now isn't the time for it.

Because of the group of world-class players, what transpired this year was feasible. It was also
lovely that the children took part.

"At the moment, I have no idea who wants to go, but if someone comes to me and says they
want to join a club, we'll make an offer to the club."

Origi has reached a personal agreement.

"It's not yet a done deal in terms of a physical and finalizing that transfer, but he hasn't played
enough for Liverpool to activate the contract extension provision."

"It's only a matter of putting the finishing touches on what would be a legendary transfer at the
age of 27, with Milan fighting to win the Italian title and return to the Champions League, so I
hope that'll happen."
