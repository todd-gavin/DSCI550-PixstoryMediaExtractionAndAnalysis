Last season gave us what felt like a two-horse race for the NBA’s dunk of the year.

In one corner, there was Anthony Edwards baptizing Yuta Watanabe with a baseline dunk that saw the then rookie completely overpower the 6’9 forward in the air. In the other corner was Miles Bridges cocking the ball back as far as possible for a tomahawk dunk on Clint Capela moments after Capela had blocked his teammate at the rim. We asked readers which dunk they thought was better, and Bridges won 54 percent of the vote.

This year’s dunk of the year race doesn’t feel like it has any overwhelming favorites. Instead, we think there’s at least nine dunks that could take the crown. With the regular season over, let’s look back at the best dunks of the 2021-2022 campaign. You can vote on your favorite dunk of this season below.

9. Aaron Gordon reverse alley-oop

We know Aaron Gordon is one of the best dunkers in the game, and this one is particularly impressive. The coordination it takes to catch the ball in the air while running at full speed and still have the wherewithal to turn and dunk it is pretty ridiculous. This isn’t a poster, but it’s a pretty amazing play.

8. The Eastbay boys: Jaxson Hayes, Obi Toppin, Greg Brown

I remember thinking I’d never see an under-the-legs dunk in a real game when LeBron did it back in high school. Now we have 7-footers like Jaxson Hayes doing it in transition, and Obi Toppin doing it twice in one season. Sheesh.

7. Anthony Edwards on Gabe Vincent

Here’s a hot take for you: with apologies to Giannis, Anthony Edwards is the best pure athlete in the NBA. The No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft is a freight train going to the rim, and he proved it again with this dunk on Gabe Vincent.

Jaylen Brown had several great dunks this year. You know you did something fantastic when Kevin Garnett gets out of his front row seat to dap you up.
