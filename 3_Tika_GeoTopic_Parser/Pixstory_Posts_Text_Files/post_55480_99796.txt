Which of these stuck out to you the most For me it s the you can t be thissssss hungry UGH I used to be so judgemental towards myself when I had hungry days Those I m a bottomless pit days But guess what Those are normal Some days you ll be hungrier Some days you ll need more snacks Some days you ll be hungry When no one else that you re with is Some days you ll need to eat lunch just because it s the only free time you have even if you re not perfectly hungry Some days you ll want to enjoy the cookie a friend gave you even if you re not feeling hunger cues Honor all of it Your body is talking to you telling you what it needs you re enjoying life we need to respect that Ignoring our hunger cues is how we get ourselves into the sticky situation where we have NO hunger cues Where we swing back and forth from haaaangry to overly full It s like when a friend texts you and you don t respond she s gonna stop texting Same with your hunger cues Your body is gonna stop giving you cues to follow But the good news is you can get those cues back can learn to trust them again
