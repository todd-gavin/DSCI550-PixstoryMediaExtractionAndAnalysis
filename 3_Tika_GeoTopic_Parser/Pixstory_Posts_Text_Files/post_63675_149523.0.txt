A new Silent Hill game called The Short Message may be on its way, according to a Korean rating. The rumours of the possible return of Konami's horror franchise have been in the air for a while, with this being the most recent one. Konami has not officially announced anything, but the age rating agency in South Korea has registered a new product of the saga in its inventory.
The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea has given a new rating to the previously unannounced Silent Hill: The Short Message. As of now however, it’s unknown what this new game is, or even what platforms it will appear on. 
The publisher was listed as UNIANA – the publisher of Konami’s recent free-to-play soccer fiasco eFootball 2023. It is unknown whether The Short Message will be a new installment in the Silent Hill, a teaser, a spin-off, or mobile game. Considering UNIANA’s production of arcade cabinets, it could even be an entirely new Silent Hill experience.
According to multiple reports, a remake of Silent Hill 2 is understood to be under active development. It’s also claimed that an episodic series of Silent Hill “short stories” are also in development. Even so, there are no details regarding the new Silent Hill project, there is no details given in regards to plot, gameplay, or even other content warnings with the new rating, such as any use of violence, gore, or swearing.
With Silent Hill, these things are bound to figure into the overall equation. If a project regarding the horror survival is in development, then it may be slated to come out by 2024 or 2025. But even if that may be true, we ought to take this speculation with a grain of salt.
