Liverpool have announced the signing of their €100 million man, Darwin Nunez. 

Nunez, 22, has emerged as one of the brighter prospects in Europe and the Uruguayan striker has secured a historic move to Liverpool. His signing is now the most expensive signing in the club’s history, with the total package going up to €100 million (including add-ons). 

Manchester United were in the race to sign the former Benfica striker but the Reds had other plans for their bitter rivals. Liverpool sealed the deal early and secured the player’s consent, who was looking to only settle for UEFA Champions League football. 

Nunez netted 34 goals from 44 outings for his side last season. This is of course, including the goals he scored against Liverpool across both the legs of the UCL Quarterfinals last term. 

With this, Jurgen Klopp’s attacking options are shaping up nicely for next season. With Sadio Mane set to depart, Klopp now has Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota, Roberto Firmino, Luis Díaz, and Darwin Nunez at his disposal. 

Premier League, Liverpool are coming.
