Alarm bells ringing at the Nou Camp, as Joan Laporta seems to have finally pulled the latest
rabbit out of his presidential hat. As of today, Bayern Munich's big centre-forward Robert
Lewandowski is the catalan club's priority striker.

With Luis Suarez's untimely move away from the club two years back, the club has been forced
to settle for less than Barça quality in the past. Martin Braithwaite was and still is one of their
strikers, with January addition Pierre Emerick Aubameyang taking that role.

Antoine Griezmann seems to have joined Suarez at Atlético on a permanent basis and
Barcelona are left without a world class number 9, however great Aubameyang is — he isn't
Lewandowski. Just a couple seasons back, the Polish forward seemed to be untouchable at
Bayern. A string of recent events has transpired a move away from Bavaria, with the club
offering just a year's extension.

Lewandowski himself is still in elite shape, as was clear during Poland's recent World Cup
qualifiers and Bayern's Champions League games where his 11 minute hat-trick set a record for
the quickest hattrick in competition history. 

He is just the player Barça need, to not just chip in
with goals but to score regularly.

Those in and around president Laporta's entourage strongly believe that Erling Haaland is no
longer a reliable option with Manchester City and Real Madrid leaving the cules with little room
to compete. Just two weeks back, news had emerged of Lewandowski offering himself up to two
of Spain's biggest teams. Real though, have their eyes on younger, more long-term prospects.

Xavi Hernandez's arrival has sparked a flame at Barcelona. Bayern's asking price of €65 million
can be met, or so Laporta believes. Even if the revolution at the Nou Camp is lead by some of
the younger players, the need for an experienced goalscorer cannot be denied. Afterall,
certainty in that position with a player of that quality for another 3-4 years is what Barça are
after.
