Weight loss is beneficial for those who wants to loose down excess weight when compared with individuals who are already lean, as per new studies. 
The study was published in PLOS Medicine, observed weight loss strategies and their health effects closely in 200,000 people and found that these people with obesity had lost weight who had a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but when lean people tried to loose weight, their risk of contracting type 2 diabetes was more. 
Bariatric physicians were surprised to know that the weight loss strategies had an opposite health effects depending on people's body mass index (BMI) at the baseline. 
The biological differences is what impacts on how and why people's bodies respond differently to weight loss efforts, this is what they suspect. 
Dr. Mir Ali, a bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told Healthline, said that, “The main takeaway is that weight loss is beneficial for those who are overweight; lean individuals did not experience the same or more benefit."
Why weight loss’s effects vary depending on body weight
Obesity can lead to hormonal and metabolic complications which can lead to a range of health problems which includes type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension and heart disease. 
Dr. Dana Ellis Hunnes, a senior clinical dietitian at UCLA medical center, assistant professor at UCLA Fielding school of public health, and author of Recipe for Survival, says that, the risk of diabetes and other health issues, depends on a person's weight.
