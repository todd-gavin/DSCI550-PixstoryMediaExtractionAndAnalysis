A similar message that claimed Muslim-owned hotels on highways across Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra are mixing the food served to Hindus with tablets that cause impotence was shared last year. It further alleged this step is being taken to reduce the population of Hindus in India and added that Muslims are also secretly mixing meat in the food.

The complete message reads the following in Hindi, “सावधान, सावधान,!! मित्रों, राजस्थान, गुजरात और महाराष्ट्र के हाईवे पर सभी मुस्लिम होटलों में हिन्दू लोगों के लिए नपुंसकता की दवाईयां खाने में मिलाते है। मुस्लिम होटलों से सावधान रहें। ये लोग हिन्दूओ की आबादी कम करने के लिए और हिन्दूओं का धर्म नष्ट करने के लिए नानवेज भी मिलाकर खिलाते हैं। ऐसे केमिकल रसायनों का इस्तेमाल करते हैं जिससे हमारी सेहत को नुक्सान पहुंचे। राजस्थान से आने वाली सभी बस वालो को मुस्लिम होटलों पर ठहरने रोके। आगे सावधान रहें।”

That this is happening in Coimbatore was also claimed last year.
