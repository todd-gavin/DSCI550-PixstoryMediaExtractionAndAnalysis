Louis Tomlinson has announced details of his second solo studio album Faith in the Future.
The One Direction star has revealed the tracklist and artwork of the follow-up to his 2020 debut Walls, which will be released on November 11 2022.
Meanwhile an Indian fan on Twitter pointed out that Louis Tomlinson announced his brand new album on Ganesh Chaturthi. 
The singer-songwriter had previously shared a photo on his Instagram some time ago of him recording the album, and there was a photo of the Indian diety, Lord Ganesha. 
The Indian fans are absolutely ecstatic about this detail. 
Is it just a happy coincidence or something more, remains to be seen
