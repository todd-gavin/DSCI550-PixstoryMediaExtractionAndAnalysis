Hot Little Hands, a collection of stories with young to youngish female protagonists set in the United States, Russia, and Australia from the 1990s to the present, was just released in the United States by young Australian writer Abigail Ulman.

As lithub tells us: When 14-year-old Ramona tells her classmates that she has been abused, her popularity soars; when 22-year-old Amelia is unable to finish a book, she decides to have a baby; and 16-year-olds Elise and Jenni try to stave off their impending adulthood by enrolling in pony camp. 

These stories elicit a feeling of unease in the reader, which Ulman does with ease and excellent impact by quickly moving between nonchalance and shock.

As David Francis points out, Ulman's characters are endearingly witty, streetwise, and honest—a candour praised by Colm Tóibn, Ulman's Stanford professor (where she was a Stegner Fellow in fiction). Abigail Ulman is a riveting contemporary Australian voice whose stories have a very current and even American feel to them.
