Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi both pulled out fabulous performances for their respective countries on Sunday. Both the legends of the game stood out as Portugal and Argentina picked up crucial wins on the road to the World Cup. 

Argentina played a friendly against Estonia on Sunday. The Copa America champions secured a comfortable win against their opposition in Spain. Lionel Messi was the pick of the Argentine setup as he scored all five goals in the 5-0 win over their opponents. 

Owing to this, Messi created history once again. The former Barcelona star is now the only player to score 5 goals in a game at both club and country levels. Argentina are on an unbeaten streak heading into the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Hence, they would surely be the favourites at the marquee event. 

Cristiano Ronaldo too played a crucial part as Portugal beat Switzerland 4-0 in the Nations League. The Portuguese captain played a key part in the first goal. Ronaldo then followed this up with a brace of his own to hand his country the advantage in Group 2. 

Portugal are finding crucial form heading into the World Cup later this year. Ronaldo has been a key part of the team. Hence it has to be seen how the superstar performs in the months ahead.
