Versatility is the of the game in the modern NBA and fortunately for the Los Angeles Lakers they have LeBron James James is one of the most complete players in history as he has shown an ability to play every position James started as a small forward but has spent time as a full time point guard and backup center While the star will always act as a pseudo point guard whenever he is playing James said during his end of the year exit interview that the important thing is being able to help his team win games It doesn t matter for me personally My personal goal is to be able to play any position on the floor Every game is different Matchups is different at times so to be able to have the availability to our team that I can switch off and play center for minutes or point guard for minutes or play the wing spot for minutes according to what the game dictates or needs That s for me to make sure that I m equipped and I m in the best possible shape I can be in to help us win ball games While there might be some concerns about James spending more time at center he downplayed the toll and detailed the differences between playing on the perimeter and in the paint I m sitting here saying want to get to the free throw line more so me worried about physical taxing is definitely not something that I want to think about But I think the only difference is I think playing on the perimeter and playing the five you do a lot more rolling you do a lot more rim running from baseline to baseline things of that nature things that you see more natural fives do You re running a lot more pick and rolls so I think that would be the only difference you re playing in the paint a lot more than being on the perimeter
