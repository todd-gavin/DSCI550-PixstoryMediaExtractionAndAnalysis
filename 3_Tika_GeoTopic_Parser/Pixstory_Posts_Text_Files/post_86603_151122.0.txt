The shirt that Diego Maradona wore when he scored his legendary "Hand of God" goal against England in 1986 will go on display in Qatar for the World Cup, a top official announced on Saturday.
The shirt, which sold for $9.3 million to a secret buyer, has been loaned to Qatar's 3-2-1 sports museum and will go on display from Sunday until April 1. Qatar has not named the shirt's new owner, who paid a then-record price for any sports memorabilia object, but negotiations are understood to have started just weeks after the May 4 auction.
The head of Qatar Museums and a member of the Gulf state's royal family, Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, expressed her excitement at having acquired the shirt for a unique World Cup show.
"The jersey has been through quite a journey," she was quoted as saying to the news agency AFP.
"Starting with the moment when Nottingham Forest midfielder Steve Hodge swapped jerseys with Maradona after the match, in what now seems an inspired move."
In the quarterfinal matchup of the 1986 World Cup versus England in Mexico, Maradona donned Argentina's No. 10 jersey. He scored what was known as the "Hand of God" goal six minutes into the second half to give his team the lead.
Four minutes later, Maradona dribbled from his own half to score a goal widely considered one of the greatest in World Cup history. Maradona, regarded as one of the world's best-ever footballers, died in November 2020, aged 60.
