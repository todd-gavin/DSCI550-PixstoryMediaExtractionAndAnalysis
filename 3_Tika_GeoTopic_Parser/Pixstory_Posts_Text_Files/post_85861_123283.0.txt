Birmingham, Aug 7 (PTI) World championship silver medallist Kidambi Srikanth signed off with a bronze but double Olympic medallist P V Sindhu and debutant Lakshya Sen stayed on course for maiden gold medals at the Commonwealth Games here on Sunday.

Srikanth prevailed over Singapore's world number 87 Jia Heng Teh 21-15 21-18 to claim a bronze medal to go with the silver that he had won four years ago in Gold Coast.

The Singaporean grimaced in pain after suffering cramps on his left thigh in the second game but still kept fighting till the end.

Earlier, Sindhu, who has a silver and a bronze from the 2018 and 2014 editions, rode on her technical superiority to outwit Singapore's Yeo Jia Min 21-19 21-17 in a 49-minute contest to reach her second successive final. The Indian had also beaten Min in the team event.

In the following match, world number 10 Sen, making his CWG debut, seemed to have lost his way after a dominating start against Jia but recovered in time to complete a 21-10, 18-21, 21-16 win in the men's singles semifinals.

Satwik Sairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty ensured a third gold medal match for India on Monday when they downed Malaysia's Chen Peng Soon and Tian Kian Men 21-6, 21-15 to reach the men's doubles final.

The world number 7 pair, who had claimed a silver at Gold Coast, was too good for the Malaysians.

It could have been an all-Indian men's singles final but an error-prone Srikanth squandered a first game advantage to lose to lower-ranked Tze Yong Ng 21-13, 19-21, 21-10 in the semifinals.

It was his second successive defeat to the Malaysian, having lost to him in three games in the mixed team final as well.

The world number 42 Tze had shocked reigning world champion Yew Kean Loh of Singapore in the quarterfinal and would face Sen in the summit clash on Monday.
