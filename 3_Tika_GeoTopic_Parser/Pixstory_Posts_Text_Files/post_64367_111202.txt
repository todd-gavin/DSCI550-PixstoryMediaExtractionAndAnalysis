All this while we have believed that media is the single most powerful entity in the world but the very idea that media is the most credible source of information is flawed Let us not forget that new technology has opened the confine of encyclopedias At this point it is easy to find any kind of information and falling into the traps is a sure risk But now it s time that we start quelling the myths and unveil the real face of media Real fake news Really We have to resort to language like this Putting the adjective fake before the word news doesn t just qualify as news Fake news as people call it only creates confusion punches holes in what is true and causes a kind of fun house effect that leaves the readers doubting everything including the real news Let us all go back to January Angry people out on the streets all over India internet shutdowns section These agitations during the anti CAA protests were driven by poor knowledge dis and misinformation and plain emotions rather than facts and critical thinking People might say that media is successfully yanking off the curtains from terrible crimes being committed But the question still remains that why are important stories overshadowed by trivia why are the news channels obsessed with the unfortunate death of a famous celebrity or a film personality s irrelevant comments on every other person than the more relevant issues like economic recession or the plight of the farmers Even the mass media industry is same as any other capitalist society it exists to make profit and is governed by the TRPs Media today has strayed from its central purpose its reason for existence its modus operandi i e to inform society about people events and issues The question is no longer where do you get your news from Now the question is what is news The dark side of media is that within seconds anything can be blown out of proportion and taken out of context Image Source NBC News
