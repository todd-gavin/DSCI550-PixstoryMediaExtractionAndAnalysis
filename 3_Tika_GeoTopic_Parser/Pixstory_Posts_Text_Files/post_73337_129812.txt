Large grey clouds covered the pale white sky and darkened the day I heard a tapping on the window and then it became a pitter patter I looked out from the glass and saw people running for cover outside and umbrellas were opened as the clouds spat out their beads of water Puddles began plinking as the rainfall became heavier The roofs of the cars danced with spray and I could hear the murmuring of the rain through the window All i knew then was to fill in the grey air with some joy balls The batter ready to be dipped in the oil came out perfectly with its crispy golden texture Stomach roared loud on seeing them and the happiness screamed through it s aroma Happiness is surely home made and so is my home made monsoon Pakoras
