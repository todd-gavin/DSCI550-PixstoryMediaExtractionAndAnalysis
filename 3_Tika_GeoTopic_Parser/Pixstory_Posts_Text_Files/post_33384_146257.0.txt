The caves as noted by Beglar / Stein are now generally believed to be the site of the first Buddhist Council. However, the caves are natural formations and it is curious and strange that no ancient Buddhist stupa or antiquity is reported from this area, though the caves are otherwise quite suitable for the identification. The district gazetteer of Patna (1924, LSS Oâ€™Malley, ICS) has referred to the views of Cunningham, Beglar and Stein on the subject. Though Stein has mentioned that he could not notice the fissures as noted by Beglar, a study of the remarks of D.R. Patil in the Antiquarian Remains of Bihar, suggests that the caves noted by Stein as near the Adinatha temple were infact first noted by Beglar in 1872-73. (ASI Reports Volume VIII).
