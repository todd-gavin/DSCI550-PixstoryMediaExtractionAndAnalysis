A football fan who gestured in a Nazi manner toward Spurs supporters has been barred from 
stadiums for three years. Shay Asher, a 24-year-old supporter of Newcastle United, previously pleaded guilty to racially aggravated harassment during a Premier League match at St James' Park in October.

When the former Royal Engineer confessed the offence in April, Newcastle Magistrates Court 
fined him Â£200. He returned to court to contest the application of the prosecution for a Football Banning Order to prevent similar offensive behaviour at games.

After an hour-long hearing, the magistrates decided to enforce the three-year order with 
stipulations. A guy seen making a Nazi or fascist salute at the game was wanted by Northumbria Police, according to the prosecutor, Brian Payne.

According to Mr. Payne, the goal of the prohibition orders is to stop future acts of violence and unrest at sporting events.

In defence, John Wesencraft argued that Asher lacked a season ticket and had last seen Newcastle United play several years prior, when they were a Championship team. Since the Spurs game was the first to be played under the new Newcastle owners, he claimed Asher had 
lined up to purchase tickets.

Due to a traumatic event, Asher, of Gibside View, Winlaton, Gateshead, had been medically 
discharged from the Royal Engineers.

According to Chairman of the Bench Jane Barnes, the panel decided to impose the ban, whichalso includes orders not to enter football stadiums or attend England games and to forfeit hispassport should Asher apply for one.

She claimed that by enforcing it, chaos at future sporting
events would be reduced.
