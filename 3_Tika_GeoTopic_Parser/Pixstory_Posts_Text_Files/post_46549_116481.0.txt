While away from basketball and playing for the Birmingham Barons, Michael Jordan dropped a stunning $350,000 on a bus. 

As yeh Sports Rush says, Michael Jordan established himself as an all-time great in just 9 NBA seasons. His Chicago Bulls, who had missed the playoffs for six consecutive seasons, ultimately edged out the Detroit Pistons and never looked back. From 1991 through 1993, they would win the championship three times in a row, with the last year appearing to be when they were at their most ruthless. 

Despite dominating North American sports as a whole during this era, Michael Jordan noticed a decline in his passion for the sport of basketball. During their time working together on the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he would open up to Magic Johnson about how he felt exhausted from the game. 

Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago Bulls, also happened to own the Chicago White Sox’s minor league team, the Birmingham Barons. He greenlit Jordan’s transition to baseball and even paid him his Bulls salary as he claims MJ was way underpaid while he was in the league.
