Marvel Studios is gearing up for another major year of content, although various streaming projects coming to Disney+ still don’t have set release dates. Included in this group is She-Hulk, Tatiana Maslany’s solo series that will introduce MCU fans to lawyer-turned-superheroine Jennifer Walters. Even without a ton of promo material yet, excitement is building for its release.

The first footage for She-Hulk came during Disney+ Day 2021, which confirmed Maslany’s team-up with Mark Ruffalo’s Bruce Banner for the first time. Coming in alongside Jameela Jamil’s new villain Titania and Tim Roth in his long-awaited return as Emil Blonsky/Abomination, this show will bring the first expansion into the Hulk legacy in 14 years.
