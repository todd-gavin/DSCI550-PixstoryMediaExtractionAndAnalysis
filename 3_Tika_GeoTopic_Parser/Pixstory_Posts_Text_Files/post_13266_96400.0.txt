Abdul Rauf, a Balkhi child who had been held hostage for about two years, was handed over to his family on Saturday.

Pictures have been released of Abdul Rauf's father embracing his two children in a Taliban hall.

A delegation of Taliban officials attended the child's handover and posed for pictures with him.

Abdul Salam Hanafi, Deputy Prime Minister of the Taliban, and a number of local Taliban officials, during a visit to Balkh province on Saturday, May 23rd, handed over Abdul Rauf to his family during a ceremony.

The kidnappers demanded $ 1 million from the child's family in exchange for his release.

He was 9 years old at the time of the abduction.

The former Afghan government worked hard to secure the release of Abdul Rauf. Former President Ashraf Ghani had threatened to fire three Balkh security officials if he failed to release the child.
