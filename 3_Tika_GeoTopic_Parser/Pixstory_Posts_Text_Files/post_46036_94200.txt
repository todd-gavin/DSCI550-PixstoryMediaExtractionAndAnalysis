Every year on Easter hundreds of rabbits are exploited and abandoned in the name of this festival There is a culture in our country of gifting bunnies to children on Easter because they are cute and of course the parents want to make any holiday memorable for their children But amidst all this people forget about the lives of these rabbits These rabbits are not gifts but living creatures who have complex needs and need proper care to thrive Rabbits are very active animals and often require a dedicated owner Unfortunately as one can predict these cute animals fail to hold the fancy of children for more than four or five days and the results are catastrophic Often when people realise that they or their kids are not capable of taking care of these animals they bought on a whim they abandon them in the country where they are not able to survive because of the wild It has been reported that each spring animal shelters and rabbit rescue groups face the inevitable problem of unwanted Easter rabbits To counter this various activist groups have been trying for years to educate people about this and discourage them from gifting rabbits on Easter Furthermore some stores have also come forward saying that they will not sell rabbits until after Easter It is high time we realise that animals do not exist to entertain our whims and fancies but are living creatures who deserve best
