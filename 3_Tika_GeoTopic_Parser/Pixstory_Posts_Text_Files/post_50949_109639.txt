Last but not the least I went to kamla nagar market which is nearby north campus And just ate the best momos their from my favourite place which are again were super delicious and reasonable they cost me Rs King momos A momo stall serving veg paneer and chicken momos in kamla nagar opposite to spark mall And ganne ka juice which costs me Rs from a local vendor in the market And after all this my rs challenge came to an end with full satisfaction of my tummy
