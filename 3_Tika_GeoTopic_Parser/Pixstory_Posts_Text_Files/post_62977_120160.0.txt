I had no clue about this! But perhaps because I never knew enough about Koalas to begin with. But this is an adorable information to be honest, highlight of my day! It's always great to see animals exhibiting emotions or behavior like humans. I think it's very fascinating.

I did know about Koalas not being from the bear family and the fact that they value tranquility and don't exactly like to socialize but that's about it.

Also, I found this adorable picture of a joey playing with a butterfly, thought I'd share. Everybody needs a joey playing with a butterfly on their feeds!
