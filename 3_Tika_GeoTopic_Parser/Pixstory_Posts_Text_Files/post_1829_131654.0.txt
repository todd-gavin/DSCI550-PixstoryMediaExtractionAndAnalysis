How can a city have a birthday?
While many will be celebrating our favourite city Kolkata’s birthday today, there will be others who will go by the lawbook. Almost a decade back Calcutta High Court had settled a two-year lawsuit about Kolkata’s antecedents that Job Charnock was not the founder of the city and his historic landing on August 24, 1690, cannot mark Kolkata’s birthday. The lawsuit was filed by a 500-member Sabarna Roy Chowdhury clan who brought forward that Job Charnock usurped the three villages of Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata from their ancestor Lakshmikanta Majumdar. The clan had actually leased him the villages for 99 years! 
The historical pitfalls are indeed there and even a five member team of historians appointed by the High Court submitted that there cannot be any particular date or any particular founder of Kolkata.Claiming any day as the birthday of the city meant disregarding the early settlement years, especially because Charnock’s arrival in the city was predated by settlements there.
No, a city cannot be formed in a day. The date of Charnock’s arrival was indeed documented and he did decide that there would be a settlement in Calcutta, but that was not the city itself.
