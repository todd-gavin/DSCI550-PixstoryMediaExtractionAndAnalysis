3. Addressing barriers to federal services and benefits by improving transgender, nonbinary and gender-noncoforming folks’ experiences in accessing them:

-The Social Security Administration will remove the barrier of requiring trans folks to give “proof of identity” to update their social security record, to improve access to retirement benefits, health care, and applying for jobs.

-The intake process for filing employment discrimination will be updated with marker X

-Updating federal student aid applications to reflect questions on gender identity and race for better understanding on “possible barriers students, including transgender and nonbinary students, face in the financial aid process.”

-Updating the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System with marker X to make campus entry more accessible

4. Expanding the collection and use of sexual orientation and gender identity in federal data

-Funding research on adding gender and sexuality related questions to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey so that the federal government can better address barriers faced by LGBTQI+ folks in accessing jobs, education, home ownership etc.

5. Combatting the record-breaking legislative attacks against trans youth

-Condemning the attacks: “The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential,” Biden said in his March, 2022 State of the Union Address.

-Reaffirming the right to access lifesaving gender-affirming healthcare in light of states banning it

-The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division has filed statements and amicus briefs to protect the constitutional rights of transgender individuals, including: “in Brandt v. Rutledge, a lawsuit challenging legislation restricting access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth; B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education, a lawsuit challenging legislation restricting participation of transgender students in school sports; Corbitt v. Taylor, a lawsuit challenging legislation restricting the ability to change gender markers on state driver’s licenses; and Adams v. School Board of St. John’s County, which involves the right of a transgender boy to use the boys’ restroom at his school.”
