Coronavirus Omicron March 1 Highlights: Delhi reports 344 new COVID cases, 4 deaths

Covid-19 India Live News, New Omicron Variant Cases in India, Coronavirus Vaccine Statistics and Registration March 1 Highlights: India has recorded 6,915 new Coronavirus infections, 180 deaths and 16,864 recoveries, as per the official data shared by the Union Health Ministry on Tuesday. The country’s active caseload stands at 92,472, now comprising 0.22 per cent of the total infections, while the recovery rate has further improved to 98.59 per cent, the Health Ministry said. The data suggests that the daily Covid-19 cases have been recorded at less than one lakh for 23 consecutive days.

As India sees the receding third wave of Omicron-driven coronavirus infections, a new study has warned that the country will see yet another round of new Covid cases sometime in June. Looks like this is no time to lower our guard down! IIT-Kanpur’s yet-to-be peer-reviewed study says that the fourth wave of coronavirus will probably hit India in June and peak in August. This shows the cyclical nature of the virus, giving us an indication that the danger can’t be ruled out completely. Though the daily cases have seen a sharp decline, the subsequent spike in coming days can’t be ignored.
