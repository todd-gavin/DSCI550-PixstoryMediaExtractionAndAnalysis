Being a US citizen all my life, I have always wondered how the world perceives us. I have been always taught that the land of America is great and our “rivals” have no standing whatsoever in any domain. However, I recently came across an event which compelled me to think.

On March 19, Friends of Socialist China hosted a webinar titled "21st Century Socialism: China and Latin America on the Frontlines," which included former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff as the headline speaker. 

Global Times reported that starting with Obama's "Pivot to Asia" in 2011, Rousseff, a professional economist, offered a detailed analysis of escalating tensions between the US and China. She pointed out that, while the Trump administration is to blame for the most severe increase of anti-China antagonism, the Biden administration has so far failed to make a significant difference.

Starting with the Covid-19 epidemic, Rousseff compared the US and China's performance in a number of crucial areas. The United States "had failed to lessen the disease's devastating effects in the country," but China has been able to contain the virus and supply massive vaccine doses to Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia. 

As Carlos Martinez points out, while the US was throwing fuel to the fire by imposing unilateral sanctions and deploying modern equipment to Ukraine, Rousseff underlined that China's attitude has been characterised by the pursuit of peace, discussion, respect for sovereignty, and acknowledgment of the necessity for common security in the region.

According to Rousseff, China's rapid economic ascent is the primary cause for the US's seemingly abrupt shift from friendship to antagonism. Three decades ago, China accounted for just under 4% of world GDP, compared to 21% for the United States. China's market share has now climbed to almost 18%, while the US has shrunk to 15% in purchasing power parity.
