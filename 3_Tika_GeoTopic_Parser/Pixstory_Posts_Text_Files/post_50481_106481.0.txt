While the 58-year-old was always keen on donating blood, he realised the responsibility he had when he discovered he was one of the few thousand people in the world to belong to the Bombay blood group.

Shridhar is part of the network of the few Bombay blood group donors in India.

Shridhar has donated blood 48 times so far, and has often travelled to cities like Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Chennai, among others, to answer a call for requirement of the Bombay blood type.

Many times, the recipient is a pregnant woman; he has also donated blood to cancer patients.

Sometimes, the requirement is so acute that Shridhar gets calls for blood requirement for a surgery, months in advance. Since one is only allowed to donate blood once in three months, Shridhar often has to turn down calls, because he’d have donated blood less than three months ago.

Shridhar shared his thoughts on the sense of responsibility of donating such a rare blood group.

“I am thankful that now we have a network of recognised Bombay blood type donors, thanks to Sankalp (a blood bank) and social media groups and sites specifically for this rare blood group.
