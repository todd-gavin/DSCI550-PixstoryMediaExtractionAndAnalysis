 In the aftermath of the Sandpapergate scandal in the Cape Town Test between South Africa and Australia three Aussie cricketers Steve Smith David Warner and Cameron Bancroft had to suffer punishment and were banned for one year nine months for Bancroft Apart from the ban Smith was ripped off from the captaincy for two years but Warner was handed a lifetime ban Since then till today a lot has changed Warner made his comeback after the ban and was outstanding for Australia in the World Cup He had a forgetful IPL season last year but he showed his class during the T World Cup and bagged the Player of the Tournament award by helping Australia win their first T World title Even though Warner wasn t allowed to lead in Australia he did don the captaincy hat in the IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad and now there are talks about revoking his ban from leadership in the Australian circuit as well Many former and present greats have advocated for it saying the ban was a harsh penalty and should be removed On Sunday August after signing a two year deal with Syndey Thunder in the Big Bash League BBL Warner has called on Cricket Australia to approach him about overturning his lifetime ban on holding any captaincy position The Thunder have yet to name a new captain following the departure of former captain Usman Khawaja to the Brisbane Heat If the ban is revoked in time then Warner may be seen leading the Thunder team in the BBL this year That captaincy prospect hasn t really been brought to the table Warner said on Sunday As I ve said plenty of times off the record it s upon the board to reach out to me and open their doors Then I can sit down and have an honest conversation with them The board has changed since back in when all those sanctions were dealt It would be great to have a conversation with them and see where we are at
