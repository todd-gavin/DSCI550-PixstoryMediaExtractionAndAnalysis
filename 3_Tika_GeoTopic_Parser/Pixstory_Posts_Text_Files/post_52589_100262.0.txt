D.C. is also home to some of the largest populations of Ethiopian and Salvadoran expats in the nation. Ethiopian favorites such as beef or lamb tibs and stewed chicken doro wat at the Habesha Market or Dukem in the Little Ethiopia area of Ninth Street NW, at Chercher a few blocks south, or at essential Zenebech in Adams Morgan. At Mélange in Mt. Vernon Triangle, French-trained chef Elias Taddesse is mixing Ethiopian traditions into an American burger shop with items like a berbere-marinated fried chicken sandwich. Find Salvadoran pupusas at Gloria’s in Columbia Heights, El Tamarindo in Adams Morgan, or El Rinconcito near the convention center.

No trip to D.C. would be complete without a chili-cheese half-smoke from Ben’s Chili Bowl. The historic, Black-owned restaurant sits on a U Street corridor once known as “Black Broadway.” Nearby soul food staples such as Henry’s Soul Cafe — famous for its sweet potato pie — or breakfast go-to Florida Avenue Grill have been comforting customers for decades. Oohs and Aahs is another must-visit for crunchy wings, collard greens, and gooey mac and cheese.
