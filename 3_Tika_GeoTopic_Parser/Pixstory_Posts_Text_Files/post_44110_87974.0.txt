Portugal's roster for the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs includes superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. The country will be counting on their captain and all-time leading scorer to guide them to the World Cup finals in Qatar.

In 184 international games, Ronaldo has 115 goals to his name. He'll try to provide A Selecao the goals they need to beat Turkey in their upcoming playoff semi-final.

During the playoffs, Ronaldo will be accompanied by two familiar faces: Manchester United colleagues Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot.

Despite Ronaldo's 18 goals across all competitions, Ronaldo and United have not had the finest of seasons so far. The Portugal team, on the other hand, would provide the three United players an opportunity to redeem themselves.

On March 24, Ronaldo's team is likely to triumph over Turkey. The Portuguese will be hoping to avoid any setbacks and qualify for the quadrennial event this winter.

In the playoff final, the winner of Portugal-Turkey will face either Italy or North Macedonia. Italy will be the favourites against North Macedonia, which might lead to a clash between Italy and Portugal for a spot in Qatar.

Fernando Santos, the coach of the Selecao, is certain that his team can make it to Qatar if they maintain their composure and overcome their challenges.

While they should have an easy time against Turkey, defending European champions Italy could provide a far greater challenge. If the Portuguese lose one of the two games, they will be eliminated from the World Cup for the first time since 1998.

If Santos' team beats Turkey, the pressure will be on them even more in the game after five days. The coach will hope that the team's more experienced leaders, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, would motivate them and calm their worries.
