The number of asteroids passing by Earth has grown recently. Another asteroid roughly the size of an aeroplane is now on its way to Earth and will make its closest approach today, according to a warning from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 

As per news reports, the NEO 2022 QP3 asteroid will pass Earth today at about 9:55 pm UTC, or 3:25 am IST, according to NASA's CNEOS. This asteroid, which is 100 feet wide, could pass by the Earth by 5.51 million kilometres. 

Due to its near to Earth, the asteroid has been identified by the Planetary Defence Coordination Office of the US space agency as a "possibly hazardous object." The distance to the Moon is 19.5 times greater. CNEOS confirmed that the asteroid has a velocity of 7.93km per second.
