At the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine), more than 1415 students participated in the biggest game of red light, green light, breaking the previous record. The children's song from South Korea was performed by the students on Wednesday in Aldrich Park. There are numerous varieties of the well-known children's game Statues played in various parts of the globe.
In the wake of its well-received debut in the South Korean drama Squid Game, which is currently streaming on Netflix, the game Red Light, Green Light has become a worldwide phenomenon. Unmissable evidence of the game's unexpected resurrection may be found in memes and pop culture references.
Now, as part of its Welcome Week tradition, UCI has organised the Red Light, Green Light tournament and shattered the record for the most students playing the game simultaneously, which says volumes about the game's popularity.
A Guinness adjudicator in attendance at the competition confirmed that the UCI beat the previous mark, which had been established by 1203 competitors at Willamette University in Oregon in 2015.
According to the authoritative journal, Connie Nguyen, vice president of student services, and professional personnel helped Semaan organise the event.
