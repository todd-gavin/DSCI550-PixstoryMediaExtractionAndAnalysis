Bajrang Punia successfully defends his title after winning gold in the men's 65kg freestyle wrestling category at Birmingham 2022.

Bajrang Punia, a bronze medalist at the Tokyo Olympics, won gold in the men's 65kg wrestling event at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, UK on Friday.

In the gold medal match at the Coventry Stadium and Arena, Bajrang Punia, the defending champion in the category, defeated Canadian youngster Lachlan McNeil.

McNeil, 21, is a junior Pan-American champion and is regarded as one of Canada's brightest up-and-coming wrestlers.

Bajrang Punia was the early aggressor, and McNeil, 21, needed to be quick on his feet to avoid the Indian.

A passivity call on McNeil, on the other hand, forced the Canadian to throw caution to the wind, and Bajrang Punia took advantage of the opportunity by scoring three quick points with a takedown. Bajrang Punia pushed McNeil out of the ring near the end of the period to increase his lead to 4-0.
