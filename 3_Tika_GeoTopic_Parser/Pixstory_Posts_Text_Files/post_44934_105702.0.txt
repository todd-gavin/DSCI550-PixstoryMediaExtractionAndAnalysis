Jose Mourinho is all set to sign Nemanja Matic for a third time with the defensive
midfielder joining Roma for a free transfer after leaving Manchester United this summer.

Matic previously worked with Mourinho at Chelsea during both the player and
manager’s second spell at Stamford Bridge, winning the Premier League together in
2015.

After winning another title with the Blues, this time under Antonio Conte, he moved to Manchester United to work with the Portuguese coach in 2017. In his five-year stay at
Old Trafford, he could not win any silverware.

And now, Sky Sports Italia has reported that the Siberian international has agreed on a one-year deal with Roma with an option for a further year depending on appearances.

In May, when it was announced that Matic was not renewing his contract with
Manchester United and was preparing to leave the club, Mourinho remained coy when
asked about the possibility of signing the 33-year-old.

He said,” Everyone knows my relationship with Nemanja. He is one of the guys with my
trust. We won together, we fought together in United too. He is a fantastic player, but
that is a kind of answer that is not good for me and the player as well.”

Mourinho already had a couple of former United players in his Roma squad, namely
defender Chris Smalling and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan although the latter
is said to be heading to Inter Milan.

Matic is the latest ex-premier league player to head to Italy’s capital, with Rui Patricio
and Tammy Abraham joining from Wolves and Chelsea respectively last summer, while Arsenal’s Hector Bellerin has also been linked with a switch to Seria A this summer.
