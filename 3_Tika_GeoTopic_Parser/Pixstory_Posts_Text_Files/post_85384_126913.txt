Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders I have no mockings or arguments I witness and wait I believe in you my soul the other I am must not abase itself to you And you must not be abased to the other Loafe with me on the grass loose the stop from your throat Not words not music or rhyme I want not custom or lecture not even the best Only the lull I like the hum of your valv d voice I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn d over upon me And parted the shirt from my bosom bone and plunged your tongue to my bare stript heart And reach d till you felt my beard and reach d till you held my feet Walt Whitman
