Burnley split the points with West Ham United after a 1-1 Premier League tie on Sunday. Ivory Coast international Maxwel Cornet missed a penalty as the Clarets were held to a 1-1 draw. When Cornet was pulled down by Lukasz Fabianski, the Ivorian had a wonderful chance to score for Burnley, but his penalty attempt sailed wide in the 33rd minute.

The Clarets became the 20th and last team in the league to take a penalty this season, but Cornet became only the third Burnley player to miss a penalty in the league, following Scott Arfield (September 2014 at Crystal Palace) and Matthew Taylor (September 2014 vs Crystal Palace) (April 2015 vs Leicester City).

Only Tottenham Hotspur (52) have conceded more Premier League penalties at home than West Ham, with Cornet's miss being the 50th penalty conceded at either Upton Park (37) or the London Stadium (13). Meanwhile, Nick Pope saved Burnley from going behind when he produced a fantastic save to tip the ball away for a corner to stop Jarrod Bowen's shot inside the penalty area.

The home side had a chance to take the lead, but Aaron Cresswell was denied by a goalline clearance by James Tarkowski. Cornet should have scored in the 20th minute after finding space on the left, but he missed the target, wasting Burnley's fantastic opportunity.                                

The Clarets seized the lead, though, when Cornet provided a fine corner that was met by Jay Rodriguez, whose header hit the bar, but Wout Weghorst was waiting and headed home.

In the second half, the African sensation had another chance to score, but he ended up firing wide from 25 yards out when in space. Said Benrahma of Algeria was substituted for Nikola Vlasic four minutes after the hour mark, and the Hammers equalised in the 74th minute through Tomas Soucek.
