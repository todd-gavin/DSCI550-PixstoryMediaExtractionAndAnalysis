Donny Van De Beek has not had the best of times since joining the Red Devils. But Erik Ten Hag's arrival could be a blessing for the Dutch midfielder. 

Erik Ten Hag has reportedly agreed to become the next Manchester United manager. Hence his arrival could be the "blessing" that could finally make Donny Van De Beek unleash his full potential at the club. 

Donny Van De Beek was a first-team regular under Erik Ten Hag at Ajax in the 2018/19 and the 2019/20 seasons. In this time, the midfielder scored 17 goals and provided 15 assists in 57 Eredivisie games. 

The Ajax manager certainly got the best out of the midfielder. But it has been clear that both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick have failed to do the same with the Dutch midfielder. 

In his one and half years with Manchester United, Donny Van De Beek has mostly warmed the bench. The Dutchman has made 28 Premier League appearances for the Red Devils. But out of these, only 4 have been from United's starting XI.

Donny Van De Beek is currently on a loan deal with Everton until the end of the season. The 24-year-old has made 6 appearances for the Toffees. But a muscle injury has kept him out of action since mid-March.

Paul Pogba looks likely to leave Manchester United in the summer. To add to this, the Red Devils are also looking to sign a marquee defensive midfielder.

Hence it has to be seen how the club's midfield shapes up next season. 





Will the Dutchman play for United next season?

With Donny Van De Beek's loan set to end in the summer, he would be returning to the club in June. Erik Ten Hag is likely to keep the midfielder at the club as he has had success with him at Ajax. 

The 52-year-old manager could probably pair Van De Beek along with Bruno Fernandes and an incoming defensive midfielder to get the best use out of him. Hence it has to be seen if the midfielder would finally get a chance to shine at Manchester United next season.
