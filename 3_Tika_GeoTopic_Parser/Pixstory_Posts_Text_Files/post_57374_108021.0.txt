More than one-third of Americans take supplements. Multivitamin or mineral supplements make up 40% of all vitamin sales. The most common supplement contains fish oil, omega 3, DHA, or EPA fatty acids. About 30% of adults age 65 and older take four or more supplements. It's estimated that the global market for supplements could be more than $65 billion dollars and as much as $200 billion, according to industry reports.

But the question arises here how good these supplements are?
Almost half of the advertisements show the recommendations and benefits of taking supplements; even social media influencers promote different supplement brands stating how good they're for your health.

Well, supplements can be beneficial for health, but it depends on how you choose them. Hence one should have a wary eye while deciding what to take for your well-being.
And for this consideration, the advice of a healthcare provider is of no harm. However, they would know better about how and when you should take supplements and, most notably, the quantity.
Many negative impacts of supplements occur due to the excess intake of supplements. So taking supplements as directed by the health care provider is essential.

Besides this, what you can do to be careful is never forget to read the labels, including ingredients, drug interactions and per cent daily value.
Be aware of extreme claims that a supplement makes. Tags like "extremely sage" or "work better than" do not justify the authenticity of any supplement.
Nevertheless, supplements can be beneficial but can never overpower the importance of a healthy and balanced diet.
