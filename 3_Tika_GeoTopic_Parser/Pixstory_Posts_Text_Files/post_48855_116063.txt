For a country and countrymen that advocate so strongly against abortion because they care about the lives of babies we sure seem to not give a damn about those babies once they re born Our incapable childcare minimum wage and healthcare are the proof Then there is the constant battle with racism that BIPOC fights Forcing those women to birth children and then killing those children in some sort of mass shooting or police brutality seem far from caring for children to me Not to mention there is no federally funded paid parental leave no broad support for full time inexpensive high quality child care no universal health care and no free college education in the United States Even while the most marginalized families must get child care subsidies and some free preschool but there aren t enough spaces particularly full time preschool slots to allow low income parents to work full time Working class parents are forced to stay at home to care for their children due to the high cost of child care Only rich and upper middle class and families can afford full time child care while both parents work even if barely Does all of it sound like caring for the lives of innocent human beings to you
