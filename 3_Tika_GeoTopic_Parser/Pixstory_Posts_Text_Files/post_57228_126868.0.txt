Negativity bias is an important phenomenon. Negative emotions would definitely evoke sad feelings in someone, but they do have the power to motivate people.

Psychological research suggests that negative bias impacts our motivation and ability to complete tasks. We have more motivation to complete a job when we are doing so to avoid a loss than if we are motivated by a means to gain something. Whether an action is framed in a positive or negative context can change how driven we are to complete a task.

Sometimes thinking of all negative consequences could help someone to work in a way that would let them avoid those negative consequences.
Always focusing on negative emotions would make someone stronger because whatever it would inflict on their minds could make them more focused on their goals.
