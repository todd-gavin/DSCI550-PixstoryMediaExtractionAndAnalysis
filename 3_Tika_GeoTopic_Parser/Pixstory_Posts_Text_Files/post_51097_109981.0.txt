You probably know that drugs affect feelings and moods, judgment, decision making, learning, and memory. But they can also cause or worsen other health problemsâ€”cancer; heart disease; lung disease; liver function; mental disorders; and infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis.

So itâ€™s important to quit them, 
Reducing or quitting drugs can be hard â€“ you may have become dependent or addicted. Itâ€™s a good idea to be prepared for whatâ€™s involved.

Admit you have a problem:
The first step in quitting drugs is to admit that you have a problem. 

See your specialist alcohol and other drugs service or local doctor :
Itâ€™s important to talk to your specialist alcohol and other drugs (AOD) service or doctor about reducing or quitting drugs. They can help you get appropriate help and support.

Know your triggers:
Keeping track of your drug use can help you identify habits, emotions, and social situations that trigger the desire to take drugs.

Make a plan:
Making a plan and writing it down can help you commit to quitting.
Setting goals for your recovery helps you stay motivated and can make the process less stressful. 

Some examples of realistic, short-term goals are:
I will see my doctor this week.
Iâ€™m going to walk for half an hour 3 times this week.
I want to be drug free for 2 weeks straight.

avoiding places where you know drugs and alcohol will be available.

surrounding yourself with friends who don't use drugs.

learning how to cope with stress and relax without drugs.

distracting yourself with activities like exercise or listening to music.

This is how a person addicted to drugs can help himself/ herself to quit them .
