‌We are not dissimilar between issues that the EU resolve as well as creates. We have a similar issue between the UK and Northern Ireland. 
‌
‌The Brexit withdrawal agreement refers to an agreement signed by the UK while withdrawing from the EU and Euratom. 
‌
‌Northern Ireland is a protocol to the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement that regulates the unique customs and immigration issues at the border in the island of Ireland between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the European Union, and on some aspects of trade in goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
‌
‌The terms were negotiated in 2019 before the 2019 general election and conceded and concluded in December 2020. The UK-Ireland border has had special status since the thirty-year internecine conflict in Northern Ireland was ended by the Belfast Agreement/Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The border later was largely invisible without any physical barrier of custom checks at crossing points which was made possible by the common membership of both countries in the EU's Single Market and Customs Union and their Common Travel Area.
‌
‌When the UK withdrew from the EU the border in Ireland became the only land border between the UK and the EU which made the need for certain custom checks and trade controls on the borders from both sides. The Northern Ireland Protocol is aimed at protecting the EU single market while avoiding the imposition of a 'hard border' that might provoke a recurrence of conflict and destabilise the relative peace that has held since the end of "the Troubles".
‌
‌The protocol gives free EU free movement of goods rules and EU Customs Union rules still apply; this ensures there are no customs checks or controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island.
‌
‌Under the terms of Article 18, the Northern Ireland Assembly has the power (after 31 December 2024) to determine whether to terminate or continue the protocol arrangements but the UK decides how the decision should be main which rests on a simple majority of Assembly members. This burns up and down in the UK with opinions and statements.
