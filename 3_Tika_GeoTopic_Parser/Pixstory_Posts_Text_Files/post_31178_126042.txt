For the third consecutive year, a team of experts and volunteers will climb to high altitudes with the Caravan of the Glaciers, the campaign promoted by Legambiente with the scientific partnership of the Italian Glaciological Committee, a journey in stages that will start from the Aosta Valley on August and cross the entire Alpine arc up to Friuli Venezia Giulia to raise awareness of the high-altitude mountain and tell the story of the inexorable retreat of the glaciers due to global warming From to August the Caravan will be in Lombardy in Valtellina first in Santa Caterina Valfurva and Bormio for a two-day trek monitoring in-depth analysis scientific culture and art dedicated to glaciers and then to Milan to reflect on the future of our mountains and the planet Due to global warming Alpine glaciers are shrinking More than they have already disappeared giving way to debris and rocks The comparison between today&#39;s reality and old photographs of glaciers leave no doubt about the decline they are going through A worrying phenomenon that is taking place everywhere in the world The rapid retreat of the glacial fronts does not only lead to the loss of fascinating landscapes and biodiversity it is equivalent to the disappearance of important fresh water reserves In addition the permafrost the perennially frozen ground degrading causes instability on the slopes with heavy risks for the high altitude infrastructures Monitoring and knowing what is happening to the glaciers is important for increasing awareness of the dramatic risks to which our territories are exposed due to climate change The purpose of the Caravan of the Glaciers to guide political decision-makers towards farsighted choices and people towards more sober lifestyles In the belief that sustainable development is the only possible
