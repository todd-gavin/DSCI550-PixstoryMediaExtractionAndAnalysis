I come from Lucknow, known as the city of Nawabs. It's a wonderful city really, life's not too slow there that  you get bored but neither is it too fast paced that it feels like you're running out of time while you're in your twenties only. 
The chikankari, the food, the kebabs, and the "tehzeeb" which belongs to Lucknow is something worth mentioning.
But that doesn't mean that there aren't any shortcomings there. If there's one thing i could change about my city it would be the traffic and people's driving sense. With poorly maintained roads, absolutely  no traffic rules being followed, barely any working traffic lights and the sheer lack of traffic police on the road, the roads of lucknow can often be a nightmare if you go out during peak traffic hours. Even if we ignore the shortcomings of the authorities there, even the people themselves don't care much about all this, they drive on the wrong side, jump signals when there is a working one and overspeed on roads that clearly say to drive slow.
I will end by saying that the traffic conditions are slowly improving over there but it's still a long way to go.
