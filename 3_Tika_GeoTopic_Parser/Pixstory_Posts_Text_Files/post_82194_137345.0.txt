There is nothing more delightful to watch than colour seeping through the water lathered on the canvas, for me. With one stroke of the brush, colour blooms on the white page. I also get immense pleasure 
when mixing two or more colours to achieve the perfect shade to make painting come alive. 
Watercolour is one of the most used and loved medium of painting. The origin of watercolour has been associated with Europe. Pigments consisting of earths or vegetable fibres ground to powder and bound with gum or egg were used in Middle Ages. They were applied to vellum to adorn manuscripts and depict religious scenes. In Asia, ink was used to paint. 
In 17th century, Netherlandish artists used it extensively for landscape subjects, it was easy to carry on travels and helped to record real places. It was popularised with Romantic Revolution in 19th century. 
With Renaissance, watercolours flourished across Europe, Asia and America. It was famous for its versatility and portability to draw immediate real life scenes. 
Now it is used by almost all artists, including me. It is a timeless art.
