Liverpool are set to add to their midfield ranks having agreed to sign Arthur Melo on a season long loan from Juventus on deadline day. 

Per Gianluca Di Marzio, the Juventus midfielder has departed Turin for England to undergo his medical in order to complete his signing at Liverpool. 

The Brazilian joined Juventus from Barcelona in 2020 — two years after he joined the Spanish giant — in a swap deal that saw Miralem Pjanic move the opposite direction. He struggled to make an impact at the Italian club scoring just a goal and an assist while featuring 63 times across all competitions. 

Liverpool are currently bereft of midfield options with most of their midfield players including Thiago, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Curtis Jones and Naby Keira all sidelined with injuries. 

The most recent hamstring injury suffered by club captain Jordan Henderson in their comeback 2-1 victory over Newcastle last night necessitated the arrival to land Arthur Melo. 

Jürgen Klopp who has earlier admitted that Liverpool were not in need of a midfielder retracted his statement last week when he claimed that Liverpool will hunt for the right midfielder as a panacea to their midfield crisis. 

It is no doubt that Klopp’s game tactics centres around the press-resistant, proven pass-masters Thiago who orchestrates and engineers the ball progression and control at the centre of the park while ensuring stability in the game. 

However, his absence has left Liverpool’s midfield vulnerable. Hence the dire need to to sign a look-alike player in person of Arthur Melo. 

Arthur is ranked in the 97th percentile in Europe’s big 5 leagues for pass completion (%) and in the 83rd percentile for progressive carries per 90. 

This is to say that Arthur utilises the ball in an efficient manner during play. And going by the major area where Liverpool are currently lacking, that is, the deep-line playmaking role occupied by Thiago, the 26-year-old look to be a solid short-term replacement.
