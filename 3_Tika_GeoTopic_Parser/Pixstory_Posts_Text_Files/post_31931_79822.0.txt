Antonio Rudiger has increased his wage demands to remain at Chelsea for the foreseeable future.

The German international's deal at Stamford Bridge expires this summer, and as of yet, the Blues have been unable to agree terms on a new contract.

Rudiger was said to be looking for £200,000 per week, but he has now increased those demands to £225,000 per week with the likes of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich sniffing around (The Athletic 5th of February).

The former Stuttgart man has been with Chelsea since the summer of 2017, and under Thomas Tuchel, he has become a key squad member.

So far this season, Rudiger has made 32 appearances for Chelsea and also popped up with three goals (transfermarkt).

However, there is the very real possibility that he leaves at the end of the season.

Given that he is 28, you would think this will be his last major contract, so you can't blame him for wanting to get the maximum amount of money that he can.

However, will Chelsea decide that £225.000 per week for Rudiger is too much?

Again, this is a possibility, and you would have to think that both the player and the club will need to compromise.

The one positive for Chelsea is that Rudiger admitted that his family were settled in London, which could play a major role in his next decision (Sky Sports).

Certainly, this is something that I will be keeping a close eye on because Rudiger has been one of the best defenders in the world since Tuchel arrived at Stamford Bridge, and it would be a shame if he moved on in the summer.

Hopefully, Chelsea resolve this contract issue soon and avoid splashing out on a new replacement.
