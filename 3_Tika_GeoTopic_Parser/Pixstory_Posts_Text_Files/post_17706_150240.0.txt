Arsenal are into the group stage of this season’s UEFA Women’s Champions League after they defeated Dutch club Ajax 1-0 in the second leg of their Round 2 tie this evening.
Vivianne Miedema made all the difference back home in her native Netherlands as her well-worked goal was the only thing that separated the two red and white sides under the stormy skies of Amsterdam. Despite fighting until the final whistle to get a result on home soil, Ajax fell to a 3-2 defeat on aggregate with Miedema’s early second half goal being enough to see visitors Arsenal progress through to the group stage.
