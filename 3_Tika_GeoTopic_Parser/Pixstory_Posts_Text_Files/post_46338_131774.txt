Stress is a normal human reaction that happens to everyone In fact the human body is designed to experience stress and react to it When you experience changes or challenges your body produces physical and mental responses That s stress Stress responses help your body adjust to new situations Stress can be positive keeping us alert motivated and ready to avoid danger But stress becomes a problem when stressors continue without relief or periods of relaxation One should always know the signs and symptoms of stree Let s discuss some Cold or sweaty hands and feet Chest pain and rapid heartbeat Frequent colds and stomach upsets Dry mouth and difficulty in swallowing Clenched jaw and grinding teeth Sleep problems Fatigue Blurred eyesight or sore eyes Depression and anger The hormones that our bodies produce to respond to stressful situations can have many physical effects If we experience high levels of stress these physical effects can get worse This can also happen if we experience stress for a long period of time In some cases stress may cause long term health problems Not just Physical effects Stress can affect our emotions too our body and how we behave in lots of different ways Sometimes when we are stressed we might be able to tell right away But at other times we might keep going without recognising the signs So try not to take any kind of stress And keep Calm
