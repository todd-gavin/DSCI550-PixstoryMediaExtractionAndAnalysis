Racism is not something new. We know its origins and people's suffering. Do we have a long history of treating Black people even without basic human right-not even considering them as humans-what for? skin colour? has anyone thought of this-skin colour as the reason for the injustice the black community faces! How preposterous and unfair! 

Black lives Matter: moment came on the fact that the African Americans felt unsafe in the world! The community as a whole felt that their lives are not a matter to the white supremacists. They randomly pin you down and kill you or arrest and treat you with prejudices. How can we disagree when we see incidents almost every day! The hatred has grown so much as people started believing all the nonsense such as the great replacement theory and taking guns and shooting down innocent lives! Shouldn't we be ashamed of this culture?  Culture of hatred-so much hatred to take lives of people whom one doesn't even know-what was his reason, other than the people being black? 

It is easy to live with the racist ideology that whomsoever ingrained in you and live as a burden and threat to many lives and it is your choice to change your notion of hatred and spread love instead of hate.
