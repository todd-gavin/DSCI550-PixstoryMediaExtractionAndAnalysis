After the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, it&#39;s time to start summarizing It is certainly a positive expedition as evidenced by the medals won Of these, only two are gold, according to the president of Coni Giovanni Malag, this should make us reflect I always said that we would have won between and medals but no one can think that when you win only two are gold A numerical reading could summarize that Italians are much better at winning medals than gold A matter of hundredths injuries judgments but something to think about But from the quantitative point of view it remains a record expedition Malag said again it is clear that we are multidisciplinary like no one else In terms of quality of the medal collection this could be an element of weakness but in terms of sporting culture this is an added value that we have If let&#39;s look at the disciplines that won medals all over the world between Tokyo and Beijing we are in this ranking, it sees us in third place in the world first United States second Russia and third Italy This reason for great reflection on sports policy that will have to be developed with a certain urgency but at the same time a source of great pride
