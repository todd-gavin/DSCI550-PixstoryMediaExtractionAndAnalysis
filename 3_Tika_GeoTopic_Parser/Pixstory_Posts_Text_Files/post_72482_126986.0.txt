As kids, we all celebrated Independence Day at school. And that probably was the last time we celebrated the day with full enthusiasm.

If you too miss those golden days, then it is time to feel nostalgic. Here are some Independence Day memories that every 90s kid can relate to:

1. A dance performance on Des Rangila song.

2. The saffron-white-green dress code.

3. Tricolour on cheeks, hands, forehand and everywhere.

4. A child dressed as Mahatma Gandhi.

5. Two ladoos packed in a brown envelope.

6. Plastic flags.

7. Flag hoisting followed by march-past with plenty of vitamin D.

8. Watching patriotic movies.
