AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli commented on the match after the draw against Nicola&#39;s Salernitana to Dazn. we could have dominated the match better which was complicated we managed to draw but we have to try to do better Leao wasn&#39;t decisive but if he scores that goal we&#39;ll talk about something else We can do everything better if you approach well then you have to continue We had to be more lucid because then the opportunity would come fair It was not our best night We have to think about playing as we are capable of doing during the week we will analyze the goals conceded It is useless to think about what we could have done we try to score as many points as possible and do better the things we know how to do If this result could jeopardize the Scudetto race The situation around Milan is strange Nobody thinks we can win the Scudetto and then you ask me if we can still win the Scudetto We are undoubtedly disappointed and for this reason we will try to do better from the next match The second leg is increasingly complicated but we are today we had to make a different performance We were not lacking from a mental point of view but lack of quality Scudetto quota It is undoubtedly high there is so much to push and so much to do the very high level Photo credits AC Milan
