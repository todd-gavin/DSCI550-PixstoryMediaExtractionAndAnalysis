This collection is very important to me It is called Salsedine because it wants to corrode the layers until reaching the authenticity of people by dissolving the barriers to feel free The events of recent years have made this experience of collective and universal reflection stimulating questions and evaluations on our most intimate self Once the most superficial layers are consumed, we remain naked and exposed, enveloped in an apparent sense of precariousness and fragility represented in the collection by the use of transparencies corrosive effects breakages deconstructed and recomposed garments The raw cut and frayed edges the color is not applied regularly and the natural raw fabrics tell a history They talk about nights on the beach or afternoons with friends at the salt pans of Cervia
