Valentino is set to unveil its Pink PP advertising campaign for fall 2022 which will feature none other than one of our favorite fashion muses, Zendaya.

The actress took to Instagram to unveil looks from the campaign today where she’s donning an all-pink look and photographed posing in an all-around pink set. “One color, bold, strong, fluid, extravagant, one color to summarize everything I like in fashion and everything that I choose to represent: the liberation from the ordinary, a space to be oneself, a loud symbol for equality and love,” creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli said of the shots.
