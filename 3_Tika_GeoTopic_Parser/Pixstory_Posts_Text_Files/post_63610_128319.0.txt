Activision recently just released the teaser trailer for Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. In addition to showcasing the bunch of environments and scenarios the game is going to put players in, fans can digitally pre-order the game for a chance to play the campaign one week before it launches.

Modern Warfare 2’s single-player campaign picks up from the events of 2019’s Modern Warfare, following the globe-trotting elite Task Force 141, an elite international team of operatives that includes returning characters Captain John Price, Sergeant Kyle “Gaz” Garrick, Lieutenant Simon “Ghost” Riley, and Sergeant John “Soap” MacTavish, as well as a few new faces, like Colonel Alejandro Vargas and Corporal Phillip Graves.

The Campaign for MW2 will release as an early access mode starting on Oct. 20, meaning players can hop into the Campaign and play it before the full game releases one week later. In order to gain early access to the Campaign, players must digitally pre-order Modern Warfare 2 on their system of choice.

It doesn’t matter which version of Modern Warfare 2 fans pre-order; they can choose any edition of the game and still receive access to the Campaign beginning on Oct. 20. This gives a strong incentive to get players to actually play the story-based side of Call of Duty, which is typically overlooked due to the competitive multiplayer component.
