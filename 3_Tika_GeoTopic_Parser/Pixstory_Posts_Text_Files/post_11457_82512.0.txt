•You’re probably familiar with the Mediterranean Diet. It’s consistently ranked as the healthiest diet out there, and numerous studies have linked it to a lower risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, as well as a lower risk of premature death .

•But while there’s plenty to celebrate about the Mediterranean Diet, there’s also a big problem that we’re not talking about enough.

•The diet is based on traditional eating patterns of European Mediterranean countries, but it excludes the traditional cuisines of many other nations with Mediterranean coastlines.

📍The Mediterranean Diet isn’t representative of the entire Mediterranean region

•There are 21 countries that touch the Mediterranean Sea: Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey.

•However, the Mediterranean Diet is based primarily on the traditional cuisines of Italy, Greece, Spain, and southern France, excluding those of the Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and African countries in the region.

•The reason for this can be traced back to the Seven Countries Study. From 1952–1957, American researcher Ancel Keys conducted informal, exploratory studies in seven countries: Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Finland, Japan, and the United States.

📍The basic principles of the Mediterranean Diet can be applied to any cultural cuisine.

•Widening our idea of what the Mediterranean Diet looks like can also make it more sustainable and realistic for people, Spence says. “If someone does not have a taste for seafood or olives, this way of eating would not be sustainable.”

•Likewise, if someone can’t afford to eat these Mediterranean staples all the time, they may get discouraged and feel like healthy eating is out of reach.

📍Bottom line-

•The Mediterranean Diet is indeed nutritious and health-promoting, but its focus on European cuisines excludes many other cultural foods that are equally nutritious.

•Instead of trying to follow the Mediterranean Diet to a T, try adopting its overall patterns, such as eating lots of plant-based foods and choosing unsaturated fats over saturated ones.
