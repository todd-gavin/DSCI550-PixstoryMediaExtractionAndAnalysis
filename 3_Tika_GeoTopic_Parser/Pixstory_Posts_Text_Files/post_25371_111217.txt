 june Jujutsu Kaisen vol released in india today in PVR cinemas and your girl caught on to it on the first day itself My rating Even stars can t describe my experience First of all it was in sub Japanese audio with English subtitles that s a win win And i had literal goosebumps on all the fight scenes it was that good This was the first anime movie ever that I watched in theatre and I ll remember it forever Demon slayer mugen train was released in India too but they didn t release it in my hometown and it was released in English dub so I wasn t pumped up about it either ways but this one was crazy
