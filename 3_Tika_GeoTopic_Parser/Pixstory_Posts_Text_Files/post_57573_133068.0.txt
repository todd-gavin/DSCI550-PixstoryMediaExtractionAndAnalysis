The utmost freedom social media has given us to express our thoughts and views is quite startling and somewhere acceptable to a certain extent, but when it harms, it becomes unacceptable.
The discussion here is not about the harmful impacts of social media, although that is also one of the essential parts covered in this whole sphere of debate.
The discussion here is about fandom, the state or attitude of being a fan.
We all have a long penchant and liking for something, and we call ourselves a fan; portraying the identity that one chooses to define themselves whenever speaking of their desired object ( could be a piece of work, artist or anything)
Like a group of people boasting and acknowledging their deep love for anime, k-pop or marvel movies.
Fandoms have made their way for expressing their views and thoughts through different mediums, even involving meet and greets with the object of their liking.
Besides, with the growing use of social media, there have been many changes in how fans have reviewed, talked or even critiqued anything to defend their liking or interest.
The safe space that was built and designed with a positive motto has kind of entered the negativity, making the whole idea of being a fan toxic.
When we speak of freedom of expression without confinements or restrictions, social media gives you that medium and doing it anonymously is a bigger benefit of it.
As much as they love anything, fans can hate too just to defend it, like spreading rumours, abuse or, in the worst scenarios, threats.
The behaviour of toxic fans is not limited to this; they even go around making groups on social media and proliferating the propaganda against someone or something.
This behaviour is toxic and social media bolsters these negative attitudes.
