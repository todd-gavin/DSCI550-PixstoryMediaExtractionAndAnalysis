How can you tell if your partner truly loves you? According to Theodor Adorno, a German philosopher and social critic, this is a pretty simple. He says, "You are only loved when you can show your weakness". And I think it's a beautiful idea. I believe it is very true, because one of the most difficult things to do in a relationship is to be able to show yourself at your worst after already showing them how you are at your best. And the kind of thing where you don't have to put up a front and say, "Actually, I'm struggling, I don't feel good today, I feel weak." And opening yourself up to the point where you can tell someone you're struggling without fear of being judged. That's LOVE.
