The trailer for Star Wars Andor is finally out and damn does it look good Looking dark gritty and rough Andor carries the aesthetics of Rogue One featuring a pre Rebellion galaxy where the Galactic Empire is all but dominating everything Without revealing almost any bits of the story the teaser shows Cassian Andor and his comrades engaging in covert operations against the Empire while the Rebellion is still under formation Created by Tony Gilroy Andor is set sometime between the fall of the Republic and Rogue One and it covers a huge amount of time starting with the early days of the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire while also showing the earlier parts of the Rebel assassin s life In addition to its wide scope and darker tone the series also promises intense fight scenes created with limited green screen use Andor will have two seasons each with episodes The first season will bow on Disney Plus on Sept with a three episode premiere Now we can only hope against hope that the show will not repeat the same mistakes of Obi Wan Kenobi and make it another agenda driven mixed bag of a series which will mess with the canonical lore and introduce some new garbage character who no one cares about From its initial looks Andor seems to carry more restraint and better command of itself than Obi Wan Kenobi so it may very well prove to be a better product overall Diego Luna reprises his role as the titular warrior from Rogue One while Genevieve O Reilly will return in the role of Galactic Senator and later Rebel leader Mon Mothma Forest Whitaker will reprise his role as Saw Gerrera the leader of the militant rebel organization the Partisans which used brutal methods and shock tactics against the Empire Among the newcomers of the cast include Stellan Skarsg rd Adria Arjona Denise Gough Kyle Soller and Fiona Shaw
