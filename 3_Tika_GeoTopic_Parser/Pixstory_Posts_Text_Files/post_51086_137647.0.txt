There is no doubt that being a teacher is a noble profession that deserves an equal amount of love and respect as any other profession. Teachers' Day 2022 in India is celebrated every year on September 5 to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. He was a former President of India, scholar, philosopher and Bharat Ratna recipient. On Teachers' Day 2022, students all over the country pay respect and tribute to their teachers. In some schools, special programs are also organised to celebrate Teachers' Day on September 5.  Teachers' Day 2022 is a reminder of the role that teachers play in nation-building by guiding and educating the brightest minds of our country. 

Teachers Day is one such event to which students and teachers equally look forward. The Day is important for the students as it gives them a chance to understand the efforts put in by their teachers to ensure that they get a proper education. Similarly, teachers also look forward to the Teachersâ€™ Day celebration as their efforts get recognised and honoured by students and other agencies as well.
