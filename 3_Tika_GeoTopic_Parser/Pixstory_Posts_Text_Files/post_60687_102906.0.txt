In the recent Texas shooting, an 11year old girl, 4th grader, showed exemplary courage and smartness. 

She put blood on herself and played dead and got saved in the shooting. 

This shows us that if we keep ourselves sane and think smartly despite of being in chaotic situations, we can  save our lives.

May God give peace and strength to the families who have lost their loved ones.
