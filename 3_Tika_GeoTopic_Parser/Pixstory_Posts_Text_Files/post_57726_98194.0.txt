All of us go through Phases of Procrastination, Laziness, Anxiety, Disinterest and many other emotions that lead to us not doing what we had thought or set out to do with our time in a day. Effective management of time and energy to complete tasks can never truly be a 100% as we are only human and we have our ups and downs. But, we can create a methodology that caters to our swings in mindset to still be able to accomplish what we set out to do any day. Many people have come up with various methods and even apps to help us manage our time and do things, but we have to understand our needs and mindset on a daily basis and tune and/or identify a method that works for us. Fixating and just thinking about a task continuously is unnecessary and unhelpful. Routines help classify our time based on urgency and necessity so that we are not only able to devote time properly but also able to take care of ourselves while doing so. Self-care is an important part of a routine, for achieving effective time management and to be able to successfully complete tasks. If our minds and bodies aren't healthy, our efficiency is as it is compromised. We cannot do what we could were we in a better state of overall health. Thus, to evade and overcome the types of health issues that are created from not regularly and properly taking care of ourselves, we should create a routine that caters to the needs and priorities of both our professional and personal lifestyles. There will always be a sense of nervousness regarding the risks and failures of something, but that only lasts until you're actually doing it and then it becomes a flow state where you start doing it out of habit and instinct. Cultivating the right habits and instincts for the right and necessary things for yourself, that help you learn, grow and develop is the essence of time management.
