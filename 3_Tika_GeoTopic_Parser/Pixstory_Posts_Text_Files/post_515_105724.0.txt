A known drug has done something u precedents . First time in ever what some are even calling a miracle . 
A small group of people with rectal cancer reported complete vanishing of the disease after an experimental treatment. 
According to New York Times, in a very small clinical trial, 18 patients took a drug called Dostarlimab for around six months, and in the end, every one of them saw their tumours disappear. 
Dostarlimab is a drug with laboratory-produced molecules that act as substitute antibodies in the human body. All 18 rectal cancer patients were given the same drug and as a result of the treatment, cancer was completely obliterated in every patient - undetectable by physical exam; endoscopy; positron emission tomography or PET scans or MRI scans.  

The patients were administered dostarlimab every three weeks for six months, according to the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 5, 2022. “No patients had received chemoradiotherapy or undergone surgery, and no cases of progression or recurrence had been reported during follow-up (6 to 25 months),” the authors noted.
The trial was conducted in patients diagnosed with Stage II or Stage III rectal cancer. Traditional treatment for this is radiation, followed by chemotherapy and surgery which could likely result in neuropathy, infertility, bowel, urinary and sexual dysfunction. 

Although the trial is small it can open new horizons in the cancer therapy and optimism is obvious . 

 However everything depends on how the patients react in the future . Whether the cure is long term, whether there is re-emergence . 
So far however things look bright .
