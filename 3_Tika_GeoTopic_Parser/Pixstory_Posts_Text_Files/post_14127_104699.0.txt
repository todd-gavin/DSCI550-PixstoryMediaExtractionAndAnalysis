Manchester United’s talented prodigy Facundo Pellistri’s future may lie away from Old Trafford next season. Many European clubs have been observing the young Uruguayan winger after impressing consistently at both club and international levels.

The talented Uruguayan has caught the eyes of several European clubs this season. The United Journal  have been told by people close to the player that numerous clubs from La Liga and Serie A have been intensively monitoring the player’s progress after an impressive display for his national team. 

It is understood that initial contacts have taken place between intermediaries from various European clubs and the Uruguayan international’s agent to assess the player’s future at Old Trafford. It is still unclear at this stage whether the move will be on a temporary (loan) or permanent basis as both options haven’t been dismissed.

Manchester United haven’t revealed their plans for the player’s future yet but Pellistri is waiting to discuss his role at the club with Erik ten Hag and his coaches in the upcoming preseason which starts on 27th June 2022.

On Thursday, Facundo Pellistri showed his brilliance with flair in dribbles/take-ons and assisted Edinson Cavani to score his first goal of the game against Mexico at the State Farm Stadium in Arizona.
