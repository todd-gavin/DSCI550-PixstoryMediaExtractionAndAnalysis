A three-day international conference on the "Interface between Agriculture, Food Chemical and Biological Science" was organised by Kashmir University and the Association of Food Scientists and Technologists India (AFSTI), Mysore, on Friday with the goal of advancing the valley's food industry through the use of cutting-edge technologies. 

Dr. Adil Gani, the event's chief organiser and coordinator for the Food Technology Department, outlined the goals of the three-day gathering. According to him, "designing a meal for the future" necessitates an interdisciplinary approach with prospective partnerships in many food science fields, which the current event attempts to explore. 

Given the growing importance of food sciences and the widespread adoption of the food processing culture by young entrepreneurs, the Department of Food Science and Technology at the University of Kashmir organised the event. However, they are experiencing a variety of problems as a result of inadequate infrastructure and exposure, which is preventing the growth of food industrial units. 

A variety of lectures, including PowerPoint presentations, were delivered by food scientists and other specialists during the conference, drawing both attendees and local participants. Entrepreneurs, students, and academic researchers can always exchange ideas at such significant conferences and benefit from the knowledge of world-class scientists.
