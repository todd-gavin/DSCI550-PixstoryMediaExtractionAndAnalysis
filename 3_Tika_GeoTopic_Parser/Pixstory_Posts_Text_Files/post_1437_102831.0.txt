Tomb of Sand is the first book in any Indian language to win the prestigious International Booker Prize. 

A family saga set in Post-Partition India, the novel follows an 80-year old woman after the death of her husband. 

"Ultimately, we were captivated by the power, the poignancy and the playfulness of 'Tomb of Sand', Geetanjali Shree's polyphonic novel of identity and belonging, in Daisy Rockwell's exuberant, coruscating translation," said Frank Wynne, chair of the judging panel.

"This is a luminous novel of India and partition, but one whose spellbinding brio and fierce compassion weaves youth and age, male and female, family and nation into a kaleidoscopic whole," he said.

 Truly an exciting moment for Indians and literature lovers - although plenty of English-language novels have won Bookers, there is a vast literary tradition of books in other Indian languages that has gone completely ignored. 

Shree's novel was chosen from a shortlist of six books, the others being: 'Cursed Bunny' by Bora Chung, translated by Anton Hur from Korean; 'A New Name: Septology VI-VII' by Jon Fosse, translated by Damion Searls from Norwegian; 'Heaven' by Mieko Kawakami, translated by Samuel Bett and David Boyd from Japanese; 'Elena Knows' by Claudia Pi√±eiro, translated by Frances Riddle from Spanish; and 'The Books of Jacob' by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Jennifer Croft from Polish.

This year the judges considered 135 books in total.
