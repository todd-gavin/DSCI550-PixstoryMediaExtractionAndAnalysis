The very first thing you need to do is to learn the cause of your smelly hair. 
The things that cause smell in your hair can be:
Improper diet
Hormonal imbalance and stress
Unhygienic hair habits
Seasonal changes 
Excessive sweating etc. 

How To Get Rid Of A Smelly Scalp?

1. Use Shampoos Made For Smelly Hair
If dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis are the main causes of your smell, try using shampoos with coal tar, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide.

2. Lemon Juice + Yogurt
The mixture of these two can help incredibly to reduce dandruff, bacteria, and smelly odor. Since lemon is a really strong acid, don’t apply it directly if you don’t want irritation or sunlight-sensitive scalp.

3. Try Essential Oils
I am not a huge fan of essential oils but I cannot live without my tea tree oil either. It is my overnight acne remedy as well as works like magic if you want to get rid of dandruff or smelly scalp. 

4.Apple Cider Vinegar
Apple cider vinegar has a special place in my kitchen for its anti-microbial properties and ability to infinite uses.
And that’s why it has been proven beneficial for treating dandruff or the smell.

5.Do Not Sleep In Or Tie Wet Hair
It is highly recommended to air-dry your hair before going to bed and avoid tieing them into a bun or pony when they are wet. I would not recommend blow-drying because it can be insanely harmful in long term but if it’s urgent and you don’t have time, it can work.
