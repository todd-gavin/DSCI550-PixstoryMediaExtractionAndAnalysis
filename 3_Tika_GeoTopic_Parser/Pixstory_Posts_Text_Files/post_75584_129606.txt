When Mikel Arteta signed to become the manager of Arsenal in late he faced an almighty rebuild job The squad before him was full of underperforming overpaid aging players In just two years and months he has transformed that squad into one full of young vibrant entertaining players capable of competition and constantly developing The club was in dismal place financially too Years of signing older players on high wages had left the club locked into contracts and put of the Champions League Arsenal have not yet qualified for the Champions League since Arteta s arrival but they came close and are in a great place to go again this season Lastly the connection between the fans and the club was non existent Granit Xhaka had a very public falling out with the fans and was stripped of the captaincy and most of the other players were unpopular due to a lack of effort Now the Emirates is arguably the loudest it has ever been The fans are incredibly connected to the players and the manager and songs are sung about each player regularly Mikel Arteta has taken some tough decisions to get to where he is now the Aubameyang saga Ozil s exit Guendouzi too He s spent a lot of money too One thing is clear however Arsenal are in a dramatically better place then they were when he arrived There has not been excitement around Arsenal in a long time and that excitement has been created by Mikel Arteta
