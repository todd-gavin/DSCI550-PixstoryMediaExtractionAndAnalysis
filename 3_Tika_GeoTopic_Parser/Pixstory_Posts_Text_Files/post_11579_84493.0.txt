•Sweet, cold, and creamy, ice cream is enjoyed by people all over the world.

•However, because it’s traditionally made from milk, regular ice cream isn’t suitable for those following a vegan or dairy-free diet.

•Fortunately, plenty of vegan-friendly frozen treats are available, and they’re just as delicious as their dairy-containing counterparts.

📍How to choose the best vegan ice cream product

•You should consider several factors when shopping for vegan ice cream.

•For starters, consider which flavors you enjoy and whether you’re craving a scoop of ice cream or a bar, pop, or sandwich.

•Be sure to also read the ingredients list to see what it’s made from. This is especially important if you have any food allergies or prefer a frozen dessert made from certain ingredients, such as coconut milk or oat milk.

•Some people may want to avoid products that contain artificial flavors, fillers, or sweeteners as well.

•Additionally, you should take a look at the nutrition label and opt for a product that’s relatively low in added sugar. If you’re trying to lose weight, you may also want to pick a variety that contains a low amount of calories per serving.

•Finally, be sure to consider the price per serving to determine whether it can fit into your grocery budget.

📍The bottom line

•Ice cream is a delicious dessert with plenty of plant-based options to choose from.

•Many varieties of vegan frozen desserts are available, including bars, pops, and ice cream sandwiches.
