Arsenal are one of the most prestigious teams in English football. Since their establishment in 1886, they have won the league 13 times and hold the record for winning the FA Cup 14 times, more than any other club. The majority of Arsenal's dominance came during the Arsene Wenger era which is when the London club had their dominant invincible season
which still hasn't been repeated by any other club. Looking at Arsenal now, it's easy to think back to these glory days when the likes of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Ian Wright. However, despite these years of dominance and all of Arsenal's modern success, it'simportant to also look back to where it all started for the Gunners.
Arsenal was founded by a group of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament Factory who decided to form a football team. The club was originally called 'Dial Square' before changing their name to 'Royal Arsenal'. Arsenal were only a small club at the time and weren't on the level of some of the other clubs.
In 1895, a few Nottingham Forest players moved to Arsenal and took their red shirts with them. Arsenal inherited the red colours from this year and never looked back. Two years later, the club turned professional. Despite taking on the red colours, Arsenal didn't havetheir iconic canon logo until the early 1970's. As the club grew, the shirts started to bedesigned by Umbro and even got their first sponsorship, JVC.
Despite the name, kit and players at the club, there was still one thing stopping Arsenal from being one of the 'big clubs'. This was their stadium. In 1913, club share holder Sir Henry Norris invested heavily in the club to get them a new stadium, Highbury. This is when Arsenal were finally seen as a prominent force in English football and the rest was history.
