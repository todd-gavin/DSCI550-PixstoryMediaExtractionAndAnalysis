In last night&#39;s unfortunate match Atalanta lost their playmaker Ruslan Malinovskyi The Ukrainian attacking midfielder in fact fixed a problem during the first half of the match against Verona and had to leave the pitch prematurely Today we will certainly know more after the instrumental exams What could apparently seem like just a blow could turn out to be a knee sprain which could therefore force Malinovskyi to stay away from the playing fields for a while
