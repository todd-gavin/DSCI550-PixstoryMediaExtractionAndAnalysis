According to Gary Neville, Manchester United's chances of securing Champions League football are all but over following Saturday's stalemate with Leicester City, with the former defender feeling they are now out of the top-four fight.

Fred saved a point for the Red Devils against the Foxes at Old Trafford, allowing them to close to within three points of fourth-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand.

With Tottenham level on points with United with a further game to play, securing top-tier European football appears to be a long shot at the Theatre of Dreams, and Neville agrees that their aspirations may be dashed.

"I think so," Neville said when asked if United's top-four prospects were over. "The run-in started today following the international break. They had to start it with a win but they didn't get it. It was the way they drew the game - that was really bad out there today.

"This is going to be a long two months for those United players and fans. It's going to be difficult in their remaining eight matches if they continue in that vein of form. It was so flat."

The Red Devils were anticipated to challenge this season after finishing second in the Premier League last season and nearly missing out on the Europa League after a protracted penalty shootout, especially with Cristiano Ronaldo's return to the fold.

Instead, they stumbled through the first half of the season, resulting to the firing of Ole Gunner Solskjaer and the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as an interim manager until the end of the season.

 The German has failed to make a significant difference at Old Trafford, and the club now faces another run in Europe's second tier competition, as well as the possibility of a summer exodus of superstars
