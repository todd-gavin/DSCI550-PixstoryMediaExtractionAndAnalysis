I may or may not agree with some of your points but I think school is extremely important for children. Some reforming can be done, sure but calling it a bad institution neglect many important aspects of a formal education in a person's life. One of the most important is that it allows you to gain the skills and knowledge needed for a successful career. A good education will teach you how to think critically and solve problems, two essential skills that will help you in any job.
It gives you the opportunity to learn new things. School can give you access to world-class providers of education, which means that you'll be able to learn whatever it is that you need to know in order to succeed in your field.
It builds strong relationships with other people. In school, you'll be required to collaborate and communicate with others on a regular basis, which will help develop strong working relationships later on in life. These connections will come in handy when it comes to finding a job or starting your own business.
It gives you experience and credentials that are valuable in the workforce. As mentioned earlier, an excellent education will give you skills and knowledge that are highly sought after by employers. This makes it easier for you to find employment and secure promotions over time â€“ both of which are crucial for success in today's economy. Let's not mention how it teaches tolerance and understanding of different cultures and lifestyles. A good education will also equip students with great morals.
