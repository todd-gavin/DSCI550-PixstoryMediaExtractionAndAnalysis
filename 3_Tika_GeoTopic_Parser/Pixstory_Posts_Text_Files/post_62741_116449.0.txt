The night is black and the forest has no end;
a million people thread it in a million ways.
We have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where
or with whom – of that we are unaware.
But we have this faith – that a lifetime's bliss
will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips.
Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs
brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks.
Then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:
whomever I see that instant I fall in love with.
I call that person and cry: 'This life is blest!
For your sake such miles have I traversed!'
All those others who came close and moved off
in the darkness – I don't know if they exist or not.

Tagore days that the search for a soulmate seems to go on forever. You meet millions of people in million ways just to see that one. With no real destination in mind, we walk through life, still hoping we'd meet the one we look for.

Tagore's take on love has always been fascinating. Be it of a devotee to his God or of a person towards his strange partner. A poet worth reading!
