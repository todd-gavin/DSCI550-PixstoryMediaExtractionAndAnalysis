Where Did He Score Goals?


Though he is an attacking midfielder, he has the luxury to play as a striker or a false 9 and he has scored in every possible way, whether it may be headed goals, long-shot goals, from set pieces, or tap - ins, he has done it all. He has scored goals as well as contributed to assists, as he has 11 of them this season. At Arsenal, he will have Saka, new joinee Gabriel Jesus and ESR around him, so the fans can expect a flurry of goals and assists from him. Mikel Arteta is indeed building up a young and exciting squad that is capable of challenging Manchester City and Liverpool and rest of the Europe. 

Passing ? 


He has created 14 big chances for his team, whether it may be through key passes, through balls, or progressive passes, he has done it all. Fabio poses a danger to his opponents. He is flexible enough to let his teammates carry the ball forward to shoot for a goal or shot with his slick passes or ‘ no look’ passes are something to look out for. He has a pass accuracy of 83%, but it can be honed even further under Arteta. Arteta termed him as a ‘special talent’ and it'll be something to look out for this season. Keep your eyes peeled for his link-up play with Saka and co because he is an attacking midfielder so expect him to progress the ball forward through carries and passes. He is a decent dribbler as he has made 0.4 dribblings per 90 past opposition in the game.
