Day 5

After doing the paragliding activity, we wanted some more adventure. The driver, who took us to Rohtang Pass, suggested that we visit Bijli Mahadev. Bijli Mahadev is the name of a Shiva Temple located at an altitude of around 2400 meters. 

We were not mentally prepared for it because it was a long long trek, but then everyone was talking about it. So, we couldn’t resist going. We packed our bags and got ready to leave at 8 in the morning.

The temple is known as Bijli Mahadev as every year during the monsoons, lightning hits Lord Shiva's idol, shattering it into several small pieces and dispersing them throughout the mountain top, according to mythology. 

These pieces would then be collected by the temple priest, who would use butter as glue to put them together in the shape of the original idol. For the same reason during the monsoons, a yearly fair is hosted on the mountain top. 

It is a 15km stretch from Kullu town to the top of the hill with a breathtaking experience. Not just this, the beauty of the trek is amplified because of the tall apple trees, pear trees, and orchards of Jana village. During the trek, there were a few little stores where we got cool drinks and refreshments. The major part of the trek is up a steep incline followed by some easy steps too. 

It was a 2-3 hour long trek but trust me, once you reach the top, it is all worth it. The view, the vibe, the greenery, and the peace it gives made the trek very memorable and amazing.
