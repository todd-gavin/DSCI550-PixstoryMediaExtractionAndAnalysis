Everyone barring four first-team players away on Durand Cup duties joined the contingent which began practice at the Salvador do Mundo Panchayat Football Ground on Friday.

“We have some new addittions into the squad and it's essential to create connections between them and the old players and put everyone in the same path.”


The excitement at the Salvador do Mundo Panchayat Football was palpatable in the opening days. Speaking on the same, Pena, added, “As it always happens in preseason, people come excited and look forward to start training on the pitch. I see players who are highly committed and have good energy. Our mission will be to keep and maintain this for the whole season.”


A midfield mainstay, Glan Martins sounded ecstatic on his return to the ground with his fellow Gaurs.


“I am just thrilled to be back playing football.After a long season in the bubble, the break was a welcome one and now I am looking forward to getting back into the thick of the action.  I'm happy and now it's time to train hard.
