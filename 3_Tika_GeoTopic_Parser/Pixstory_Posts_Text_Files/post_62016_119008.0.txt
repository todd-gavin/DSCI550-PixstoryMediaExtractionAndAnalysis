Spanish tennis legend David Ferrer was not impressed with those who accused Rafael Nadal of using doping at the French Open. At the French Open, Nadal was using anesthetizing injections for two weeks straight to completely numb the pain in his foot.

After Nadal won the French Open, French cyclist Guillaume Martin suggested that Nadal used a prohibited substance and seemingly accused him of being doped. 

It led to WADA chief Olivier Niggli releasing a statement, in which he made it clear what Nadal used was not on the prohibited list.

“That is total ignorance, because in the end they pass the same ADAMS controls as anyone, it is the same control,” Ferrer told Super Deporte. “Playing  does not mean that you are doped or doing something illegal, it is simply an infiltration to be able to endure the pain at some point, which cyclists, tennis players, athletes, any type of sportsperson can do, because it is the same organization of all the sports.

Nadal won fair and square and instead of being respected for giving everything he has for the sport, when he doesn't have to, disrespecting him and his fans, with such vile allegations is just downright disgusting
