Beyond sharing the song titles, she offered a bit of insight into “Anti-Hero,” which she said is among her favorites because “it’s really honest.”
“I really don’t think I’ve delved this far into my insecurities in this detail before. I struggle a lot with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized,” she said of the song in a video she shared on Instagram. She added: “Not to sound too dark, but I just struggle with the idea of not feeling like a person… This song really is a real guided tour throughout all the things I tend to hate about myself. We all hate things about ourselves. And it’s all of those aspects of the things we dislike and like about ourselves that we have to come to terms with.”
There are five more reveals left to complete the 13 tracks, so fans can expect more “Midnights Mayhem” episodes to arrive in the coming days.
