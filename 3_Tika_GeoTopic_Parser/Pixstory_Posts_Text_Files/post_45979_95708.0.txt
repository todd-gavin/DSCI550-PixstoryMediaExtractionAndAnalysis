For decades, a misunderstanding that the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area was "defunct" prevented living members from getting federal recognition. 

That, however, could alter in the near future. A recent DNA research reveals a genetic through line between 2,000-year-old skeletons discovered in California and modern-day Muwekma Ohlone people, according to Celina Tebor of USA Today. 

Jane Recker talks about how members of the tribe, academics, and the general public are praising the study as an opportunity to rectify the record—and maybe reclaim federal recognition, which permits tribes to qualify for federal funds and grants while still being recognised as independent and sovereign. The tribe was on a federal list of recognised tribes in the early twentieth century, but was removed in 1927.

The history of the tribe is similar to that of other Native Californians. Native people were compelled to submit to colonisation and Christian indoctrination after more than 10,000 years in the area, first by the Spaniards who arrived in 1776, and then, beginning in the 19th century, by settlers from the rising United States.

Members of the Muwekma Ohlone Group believe that new evidence of the tribe's long-standing connection to the land—and to their ancestors—will persuade legislators to finally acknowledge the tribe.
