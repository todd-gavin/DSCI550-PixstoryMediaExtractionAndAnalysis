A striking image is painted by all the Netflix original series and films quitting this month. There are horror movies, anime, and cop dramas. We frequently never get around to watching these series, so our already bloated watchlist just continues growing. However, due to the fact that almost all of the movies and television shows that are leaving Netflix this August are worthwhile, you will undoubtedly be managing your time and racing against the clock. Additionally, we have chosen a number of TV shows and films from a larger selection that we think you'll really like. binge away!
