Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down the speed at which your body processes information. This can lead to problems with coordination and fine motor skills, as well as slower reflexes. It can also result in impaired vision and hearing.
When you drink alcohol, it moves from your stomach into your bloodstream quickly. This is where it starts to interact with other chemicals in your body, including those that are responsible for skin health. Alcohol affects the way these chemicals are used by the body and can have a number of negative consequences for your skin. 
Here are various ways in which drinking alcohol affects your skin: 
- It causes dryness and scaling on the skin.
- It makes the skin more sensitive to sunlight and environmental irritants.
- It makes the skin more prone to acne and other skin problems.
- It can cause redness, itchiness, and swelling.
- It makes the skin less elastic, so makeup or prosthetic devices may not fit as well.
- It can make existing acne worse by releasing blocked oils and allowing bacteria to grow unchecked. 
- Alcohol can make scars darker and thicker, potentially leading to disfiguration or even scar removal surgery. 
- It can increase wrinkles by thinning out the dermis layer of the skin.
