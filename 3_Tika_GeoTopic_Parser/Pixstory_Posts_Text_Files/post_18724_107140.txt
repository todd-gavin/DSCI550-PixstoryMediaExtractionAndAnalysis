After seven years it seems that Andrea Belotti&#39;s adventure with the granata shirt has come to an end. From what Tuttosport reveals, the granata captain whose contract is about to expire does not intend to accept the renewal proposed by the club but rather has already telephoned all his team mates last season&#39;s team to inform all of them of his decision to leave Turin Where he will go for still a mystery and perhaps Belotti himself doesn&#39;t even know That he has a soft spot for Milan which he knows but that the Rossoneri are willing to sign him even if on a parameter zero is certainly not so Belotti will wait for the first of July the day in which the transfer market will open to say something more about his future With all due respect to his now ex fans but for years one of the last useful trains to be able to play the Champions League and win something important
