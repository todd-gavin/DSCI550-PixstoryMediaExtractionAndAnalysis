‌Twitter a major social media platform belongs to Elon Musk now. Our audience is worried as much as we are excited to see the changes. Elon Musk seems to promote free speech on Twitter, Musk tweeted that he hopes "even my worst critics remain on Twitter because that is what free speech means." Free speech is a myth as we cannot blabber whatever nonsense that comes into our mouths, including abuses Twitter is known for. People are worried whether this means Twitter will promote disinformation. 
‌
‌According to the US today, a survey of 2,000 Americans by Preply.com found that 2 in 3 people did not want Musk to take control of Twitter. In another survey done by platform OnePulse, 55.4% of 1,000 Americans believe Musk has his own interests in mind about buying Twitter.

‌Another point is that It's Elon Musk man who is one of the richest people on the earth and he buys such open and reliable social media. Can't he use this platform as a way to manipulate minds, of course, another form of capitalism?
