The ICC Womenâ€™s Cricket ODI World Cup 2022 will commence on Friday, 4th March, in New Zealand. The 29-day marquee tournament will see a total of eight teams battle to get their hands on the trophy. 

All the teams are currently playing warm up fixtures ahead of the world cup.
During the warm-up fixture against South Africa, the Indian opener was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Shabnim Ismail. Mandhana was assessed by the team doctor following the incident and was originally declared fit to continue, only to retire hurt an over and a half later after another consultation. The ICC stated that the left-hander did not show any concussion symptoms as per India's medical staff, but left the field as a precaution.

Smriti Mandhana is 'stable' after being struck on the head. Mandhana sustained a blow to her left ear and lower temple - later diagnosed as a 'mild soft tissue' injury to the earlobe - and walked off the field retired hurt an over and a half after being cleared of a concussion. As a precautionary measure, the southpaw didn't take the field for South Africa's chase. "Her progress will be monitored by the medical team and a decision on her participation in the next match will be taken accordingly," the BCCI said in a statement.
