There's just something about a sandwich that can cure even the worst of days . Feeling sad ? Eat a sandwich . Hungry ? Sandwich . Anxious ? Sandwich ! 😋✨
I love eating sandwiches ! I have seen most of sandwich recipes call for some or the other sauces , spreads or cheese . I do not stock up on my bottled spreads pr sauces as most of them come with loads of creepy ingredients . I always try and make the sandwich filling which is full of nutrients . 💪
Recently i got my hands on chicken - yoghurt sandwich ! It's full of nutrients and so tasty ! Let me share the recipe with you ;

Very much delicious and perfect for my evening . This sandwich is is my favourite , easy to make and packed with good values ! 😋💪
Now Let me tell you about nutrients present in this sandwich ; 
1 Chicken is rich in protein , chicken help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease ! Chicken contains the amino acid , which has been linked to higher levels of serotonin (the “feel good” hormone) in our brains .
2 Paneer is Super rich in protein , having paneer in sandwich filling makes you feel full for longer . Paneer is also rich in fat , iron , calcium and magnesium , which makes it an even healthier choice .
3 Spinach is rich in many nutrients including Vitamin A , Vitamin C , Vitamin K , iron , folate and potassium .
