Stuttgart will play host to Wolfsburg on Saturday afternoon at the Mercedes Benz Arena in this weekend's German Bundesliga match. 
Stuttgart is having a hard time staying in the Ligue. They suffered a defeat in their most recent game against Hearth Berlin, another team fighting for survival. Stuttgart has 28 pts in 31 games, which puts them in 16th place on the table. They would then look to conquer in this match. As they have their last 2 games against tougher opponents. 
When it comes to Wolfsburg, they recently suffered a humiliating 6-1 loss to Borussia Dortmund. Max Kruse defeated Wolfsburg by scoring a hat-trick in the opening period. Appreciatively, Kohfeldt is undefeated in both of his 3 personal home encounters with Stuttgart, maybe he will draw encouragement from that heading to this battle.
