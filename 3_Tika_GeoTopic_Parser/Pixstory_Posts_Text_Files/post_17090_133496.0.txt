On August 26, 2022, designer duo, Kunal Rawal and Arpita Mehta had hosted a cocktail bash for their industry friends, and the paps spotted the lovebirds, Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor, making a stylish entry at the event. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Malaika opted for an ivory lehenga featuring intricate embroidery and minimal embellishments all over it and paired it with a full-sleeved blouse. She completed her look with a pearl neckpiece, emerald choker and a statement ring. On the other hand, Arjun looked dapper in an all-black suit💪💪
