What i ordered VS What i got 🫶
I recently bought this beautiful  pink crop top from meesho 
with upper arm sleeves
The fabric was supercomfortable and finishes are finely done 🤍
Though you have to wear a spaghetti inside because the fabric quality is quite opaque
I got it for inr 178 with free delivery.
The top is actual to the size 
I ordered L for myself and paired up it with black pencil skirt.💞🙈
I'll will 3.5/5
If interested can buy from this link 💞
