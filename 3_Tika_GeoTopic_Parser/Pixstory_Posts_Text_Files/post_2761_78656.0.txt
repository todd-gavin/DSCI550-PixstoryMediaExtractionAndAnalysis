The US judge overseeing the lawsuit against Britain's Prince Andrew for the alleged sexual assault of Virginia Giuffre, when she was a minor, has sought help from courts in the UK and Australia for help in obtaining testimonies from potential witnesses. The US New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan has said that (https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/prince-andrew-case-british-australian-authorities-called-witness-testimony)

The UK authorities have been asked for help in obtaining testimony from Robert Olney and Shukri Walker. While Olney worked as Andrew's assistant, Walker had claimed she saw royal at a London nightclub around the same time Giuffre claims he abused her. The request to question Onley and Walker have come from Giuffre.

As Prince Andrew's former equerry, Olney, according to Judge Kaplan, was likely to have "relevant information" about travel plans of the Prince at the time when he has been accused of sexually assaulting Guiffre. 
He could also know if the Prince had any communication with Guiffre. The Prince has claimed that he has never met or abused her. (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60208231)

In Australia, the courts have been requested for a testimony of Giuffre's husband, Robert, and Judith Lightfoot, a psychologist who has treated Giuffre. This request has come from the lawyers of Andrew. Prince Andrew and his lawyers would bear the costs related to testimonies in Australia.

Prince Andrew is accused of sexually abusing Virginia Giuffre when she was a minor. Giuffre alleges that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew thrice in 2001. Prince Andrew has denied the allegations. Giuffre alleges that she was trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died in his cell in New York in 2019.

If the trial goes ahead, it will make Andrew the first member of the British royal family in many decades to be cross-examined that involves serious allegations.

Many people still believe that the Prince may choose to settle the case as soon as possible, or his legal advisors are confident that he may be sitting on a strong case. Prince Andrew has been demanding that the case be dismissed.
