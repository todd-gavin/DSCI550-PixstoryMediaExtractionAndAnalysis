A few fans at the Australian Open were asked by security to remove T-shirts featuring the slogan "Where is Peng Shuai?" This is in reference to the Chinese tennis player who vanished for weeks after she accused a former Communist party leader of sexually harassing.

Tennis great Martina Navratilova has come down heavily against the organizers of the Australian Open to ban fans from wearing the T-shirts. The legend has said that Tennis Australia has “capitulated” to China.

Is that the case? Tennis Australia has defended itself saying that it was justified in its move. Talking to News Corp Australia, it said, “Peng Shuai’s safety is our primary concern” and that spectators were not permitted to display “clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political.” And that it was not limited to Peng Shuai but applied even otherwise.

But Tennis Australia is under a cloud after a radio host Ben Fordham, accused organizers of trying to protect its commercial interests after signing a five-year sponsorship deal with Chinese liquor brand Luzhou Laojiao. The deal signed in 2018 is said to be worth US$60 million and it will end in 2023. (https://ausopen.com/articles/news/australian-open-partners-luzhou-laojiao)

The deal was considered the biggest when it was signed in 2018 and the Open had to even rename a Melbourne Park court 1573 Arena after one of Luzhou's hottest selling brands. The tournament organisers have not said anything regarding the commercial deal and its connection to its action against protesters, if any.

A few tennis players have also come out against the organizers. For instance, French tennis player Nicolas Mahut has accused Australian Open organizers of 'lacking courage'.
