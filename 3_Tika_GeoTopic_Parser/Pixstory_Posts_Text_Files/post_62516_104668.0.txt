While the biggest of crocodiles to ever exist measured to be as long as approximately 50 feet, Lolong was the world's largest crocodile in captivity, standing at 20 feet 3 inches (6.17 metres) and weighing 2,370 pounds (1,075 kilogrammes). He was also the world's largest crocodile in terms of length from snout to tail.

Lolong was suspected of eating a fisherman who went missing in Bunawan, as well as a 12-year-old girl whose head was unearthed two years before. He was the primary suspect behind the disappearance seahorses in the area. Remains of water buffaloes reported missing before Lolong's capture were discovered in the stomach contents after his capture, but no human remains.

The gigantic crocodile was pursued for three weeks, and it took roughly 100 people to carry him onto land once it was discovered. During the capture, he became agitated at times and broke restraining ropes twice before being properly restrained. He was at least 50 years old, according to estimates.

Lolong was extremely gentle in his enclosure, despite his early aggression. The shock of being trapped, poked and prodded, and introduced to a completely new and strange habitat is a distressing event for any animal, especially one as enormous as Lolong, who has been the lord of his territory for decades.
