Sometimes I look at myself and wonder what really am I?Sometimes been branded as good sometimes weird and again sometimes outright ignored. What is the outside referring to while judging me?... Is it the covering of the CV that at sometime has become the standard for survival? Or is it the layer of personality that is not personality at all? Just a mask to live by. 

Sometimes I think, Oh yes art is my soul. I am an artist. But whom am I kidding?.. How do I know if it is not another layer this time just to survive in myself. 

I guess I'm just a void that absorbs everything you put in and takes shape of everything that it has to.
