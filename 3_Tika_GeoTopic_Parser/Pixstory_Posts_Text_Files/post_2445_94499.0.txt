Lalita Pawar whose birth anniversary falls today was the quintessential 'saas' in Movies.
Started as a young actor at the age of 9 in 1925 and continued to act till 1988. She died in 1998.
An accidental slap caused an injury which led to facial palsy and loss of sight in left eye.
She called it the best thing to happen to her.
' After that, I was out of work for almost three years and when I did return at work, I had no other choice but to accept character roles, even though I was just 25 years old! I had to play mother to heroes who were as old as me! Would you be­lieve, I am younger than Ashok Kumar? Raj, Dilip and Dev are also younger to me by just a few years…and I had to play mother to each of them! Anyway, I think the ac­cident was a blessing in disguise. Oth­erwise, I would have got stuck being a heroine and wouldn’t have got the chance to play the various kind of roles that I have played over the years. I won awards and rewards, honour and respect, love and attention.'
It's not as if she only acted in negative roles. Her roles for instance in Anari, for Which she got the best supporting actress, and Anand.
