For over24 hours, Twitter has been flooding with this particular hashtag and this has everything to do with BTS. It is because airports across the world have been tweeting the lyrics of BTS’ song on their respective Twitter handles.

At least 40 airports from around the world, have suddenly started to post pictures of the boy band while tagging the official handle of BTS.

AND AS FAR AS INDIA IS CONSIDERED, DELHI AND HYDERABAD AIRPORT HAS ALSO JOINED THE SAME TREND!! 

IS BTS REALLY COMING TO INDIA OR ARE WE GETTING CLOWNED AGAIN?🥲
