The Australians adore farms! Bush tucker refers to Aboriginal foods, which are the most distinct and culturally significant of all Australian foods. Meals in Australia tend to be meat-centric, with beef and mutton (lamb) being popular choices. Barbecuing "snags" (sausages) and eating meat pies are popular Australian pastimes. 

Due to its temperate and tropical climate zones, Australia is a hub of organic agriculture and produces superb fruit. South Australia is a renowned wine area, and the Tasman and Coral Sea seafood are world-class. Over the humble and "cheeky" side of things, though, nothing says "Australia" like a dab of salty Vegemite spread on bread – a classic Australian dish.

As GBC tells us, one of the best ways to explore Australia is to explore Australians’ love of sports is a love of nature and rural living. Living the farm and ranch (often called a “station” in Australia) life is still a popular undertaking in Australia, raising livestock and crops as farmers and cowboys have historically. Scope out the film Australia with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman for a peek into the adventure of “station” life.
