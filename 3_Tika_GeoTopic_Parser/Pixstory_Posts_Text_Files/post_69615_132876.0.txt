Women's Equality Day allows us to celebrate the historical achievements of women. It is important to note that we can learn a lot from those brave women. 
The day also fosters feelings of thankfulness. The world undoubtedly would not have recognised women as it does today if women of the past had not fought for their rights. Last but not least, and possibly most significantly, it serves as a reminder that the fight is not yet done. Women continue to suffer the adverse effects of patriarchal tyranny and stereotyped thinking. Some unresolved problems still need to be brought to the fore.
