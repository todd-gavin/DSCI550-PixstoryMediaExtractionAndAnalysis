SPANISH STEPS - Juventus have won ten of their 17 two-legged ties against Spanish clubs, including the most recent, in the 2018/19 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 when a 3-0 success in Turin overturned a 2-0 first-leg defeat against Atlético Madrid.

TWICE SHY - The first-leg draw at Villarreal means Juventus have now lost just two of their last 10 matches against Spanish clubs, home and away. Furthermore, Juve have also lost only two of their last 14 home matches against Liga visitors, having won eight of those games.

GREAT EIGHT - The Bianconeri have won 12 of the 15 UEFA competition ties in which they have drawn the first-leg away, emerging victorious in eight of the 11 occasions when the opening match finished 1-1.

HALF CENTURY - Juan Cuadrado will make his 50th appearance for Juventus in the Champions League should he be picked to face Villarreal. The Colombian has delivered 11 assists in the competition, more than any other Bianconeri player since his arrival in 2015.

EXPERIENCE TALKING - While Juventus have featured on 17 previous occasions in the Champions League knock-out rounds, Villarreal are making only their third appearance at this stage of the competition. The Spanish club have won both their previous Round of 16 ties, against Rangers in 2005/06 and Panathinaikos in 2008/09.
