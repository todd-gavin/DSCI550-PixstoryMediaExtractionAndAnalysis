The son of mega star Shah Rukh Khan named Aryan Khan had a drug case started on him in few months ago and many people who don't like Shah Rukh Khan or the people who loves Shah Rukh Khan, both sides have different views. Court kept Aryan Khan under police and narcotics department custody and the good thing according to me is court doesn't looked if he is a start kid or an ordinary one. The hearing and the judgement given by the court were on point and was not biased.

Aryan Khan was released from Arthur Road Jail today. Aryan, Arbaaz Merchant, and Munmun Dhamecha were granted bail by the Bombay High Court on Thursday after being arrested by the NCB in the drugs-on-cruise case.
Shah Rukh Khan's 23-year-old son, Aryan Khan, was released from Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail two days after the Bombay High Court granted him bail in the drugs-on-cruise case. After a tense countdown that went down to seconds, he had to spend two nights in jail because his bail papers were late.
