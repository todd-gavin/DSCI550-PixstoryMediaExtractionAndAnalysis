Jeremy Lalrinnunga clinched the second gold medal for India at the Commonwealth Games 2022 by setting a CWG record in the men's 67kg weightlifting final. Jeremy, 19, lifted 136kg in his first snatch effort and bettered it by successfully attempting 140kgs in his next try. He then coupled it with a bonkers lift of 160kg in the Clean & Jerk category to finish with 300kg - which is a CWG record - and brought India its fifth medal of CWG 2022.

Jeremy's third attempt was unsuccessful but it did not matter as he entered the Clean & Jerk way ahead on top. In the second part of the event, Jeremy lifted a herculean 154kgs in his first, but increased the heartbeat of a billion Indians by injuring himself. Despite pulling off the first lift successfully, Jeremy looked in discomfort as he hobbled back inside. Fortunately, he came back and nailed the 160kg effort, which eventually won him the medal. He tried for a 165kg lift in his third attempt but could not. The clean was good but while trying to lift the barbell above, Jeremy fell down in pain. Samoa's Vaipova, who had shot back to a silver medal contention, needed a monstrous lift of 174kg to take gold. But he failed, which meant that the Indian National Anthem was now certain to resonate the arena for the second time at CWG 2022.
