Francesco Totti returned to talk and did so by giving advice to Ibrahimovic, one who is just years younger than him but who would like to run behind a ball on the pitch for a while longer. Injuries are affecting his season and therefore we are talking about the future risk with the Rossoneri shirt as well as that nail where to hang your boots one day seems ever closer As a football lover I hope that Ibra can continue said Totti it would be a gift for all those who follow this sport The decision is too personal I hope it continues as long as I have desire but only if his physique allows him to be decisive as he always has been. I wish him never to convey a sense of tenderness to anyone who sees him on the bench or struggling on the pitch. There are some similarities between the last year of the former Giallorossi number and that of Ibra and unfortunately these are the benches and the injuries I wouldn&#39;t wish my last year even on my worst enemy When you get used to only taking over slowly you lose the rhythm of the game You enter and you realize that you arrive later on the ball your head still tells you exactly what to do but the legs arrive a moment later And then a piece of advice to the Swedish giant Someone like Ibra in terms of image and impact everyone would like to have One must be careful not to become a poster or a flag to be waved only when needed The day it stops Ibra will immediately understand what he wants to do If a proposal should come to him, ask immediately what I have to do and with whom I have to do it
