A lot of what men think about women is frequently reflected by the representation – or let me correct myself, stereotypical representation of women on television. 1• We have countless advertisements where women are represented as the homemaker. The domestic obsessive mom. From cleaning products to kitchen supplies, it's women who are the "protagonists" of the ads. But why? Why aren't men casually thrown in these ads as the homemaker? These commercials look nothing out of the ordinary, and that's the deal – expecting women to spend her life looking after the home is the norm, which it shouldn't be. 2• The second and probably my least favorite representation has to be women being shown as Sex Objects. From men's perfume and underwear ads to young adult romances–women have constantly been shown as someone always ready for sex for the male "stud" main character, or the sole purpose of that framing is to sexualize them. Now what's wrong with women wanting sex? Nothing. What's wrong with these films? Everything. Women face crazy harassment from men because of how sexualized our bodies are. Women are NOT always up for sex and our bodies are not here to be fantasized by men for merely existing. 3• The "can do it all" woman. The unrealistic standards set for women are tiring enough and it doesn't help at all how most women centric shows are about "a damsel struggling between her personal and professional life and ending up handling it perfectly". Or even, crying about not being able to get a boyfriend. Really?! While men get shows where they lead as cops and superheroes and monster hunters, women are mostly just dismissed as the wife, the daughter or the overworked employee. Why can't the media be as creative and careful with female character arcs as they are with male ones?
