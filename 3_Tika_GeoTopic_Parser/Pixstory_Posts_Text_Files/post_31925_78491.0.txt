Manchester City 

Grade - B

Overall, it was a rather quiet transfer window for Manchester City as they only made one significant signing and allowed several players to leave on loan or for good.

However, I have handed them such a high mark because they managed to offload Ferran Torres to Barcelona for £50million.

Now, Torres had a good goalscoring record for City and scored 16 goals in just 43 appearances (transfermarkt).

However, considering they managed to sign him for £30million from Valencia in the summer of 2020, they have made a huge amount of money back on the Spanish international.

It was almost the perfect deal for Pep Guardiola's side, who exploited Barca's need for players and bagged themselves a huge profit for a player who only made four Premier League appearances this season.

In his place, City have signed Julian Alvarez from River Plate.

The 22-year-old has been capped at senior level by Argentina and has been described as "the best Argentine player at the moment" by Daniel Bertoni this year (Italy 24 News).

For the Argentinian giants, Alvarez has scored 36 goals in 96 appearances, and it seems as if City have signed a player with a huge future ahead of him (transfermarkt).

The fee at £15million seems reasonable, but City fans will have to wait until next season to see Alvarez at the Etihad as he has been loaned back to River Plate until the summer.

Several other players left City on loan, including Taylor Harwood-Bellis, who moved to Stoke City.

So, though it was a quiet month for City, they still managed to pull off some good deals and to sell Torres for £50million is a stroke of genius.

The summer should be much busier for Guardiola's side, but he can be satisfied with City's work in January.
