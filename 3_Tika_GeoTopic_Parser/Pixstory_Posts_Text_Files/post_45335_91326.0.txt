In their Bundesliga match against RB Leipzig on Saturday, Borussia Dortmund will wear a special "Danke" shirt to commemorate the return of a full house at Signal Iduna Park. It's been nearly 750 days since the German giants' famed stadium welcomed 80,000 or more fans through its doors.

Dortmund have disclosed that as a "token of gratitude" for the lifting of the Covid-19 limitations, they will wear jerseys with the names of all 987 of the club's official fan clubs on them.

Dortmund's attendance counts have fluctuated wildly this season due to capacity constraints in place for the 2021-22 season. 25,000 spectators were allowed at Signal Iduna Park during the early weeks of the Bundesliga season. The number gradually grew till it reached 66,709 for a meeting with Koln on October 30, 2021. Only 15,000 people were allowed in when Bayern Munich faced their arch-rivals in a Klassiker match on December 4, and only 750 fans made it through the turnstiles against Freiburg in January.

On March 13, after being bumped back up to 10,000, 33,000 fans watched a 1-0 triumph over Arminia Bielefeld. For their next match on home soil, BVB will have a full house, with head coach Marco Rose overjoyed to have "the most important" person back at his disposal — a 12th man in the stands.

He has said: “The fact that everyone can come back, that we have a full house, that the Ultras are returning - we're really looking forward to it.

“Our captain Marco Reus has been walking through the dressing room with an enchanted smile for days. We can look forward to a great atmosphere and want to use that to our advantage.”

Victory over Leipzig would help to keep Dortmund in the Bundesliga title hunt, as they sit six points behind defending champions Bayern at present, but star striker Erling Haaland is nursing another knock picked up on international duty with Norway.
