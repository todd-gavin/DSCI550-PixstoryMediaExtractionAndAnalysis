Millions of people in the UK will die hungry and without heat this winter while being forced to witness funerals and coronations that will cost billions of dollars. It is a prime example of how badly the system is broken in this age. It happens time and again, there's somehow never enough money to house the homeless or to feed the hungry but every time an event for the rich politicians, or in this case, the royalty happens, we have no limits or qualms in spending money. Now, THAT'S THE PROBLEM. Someone's death has become more important than millions of life. A stupid ceremony to crown an old man is more important than giving shelter to children who are preparing themselves to die in the cold. 
Talking about morals is easy when you try to conceal the immoral by making it look ethical. It would mean a lot more if your actions aligned with your morals and you truly stood with those in need.
