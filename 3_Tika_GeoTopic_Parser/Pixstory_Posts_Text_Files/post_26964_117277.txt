On the occasion of the exhibition Fashioning masculinities The art of menswear exhibited at the VA Museum in London, a conversation was held open to the public between the fashion critic and collector Alexander Fury and the creative director of Gucci Alessandro Michele The fulcrum of the talk was the dressing of men in relation with the constraints of gender stereotypes and the newfound freedom One of the artists and styles that contributed most to freeing man from these constraints was the Gucci designer who with his arrival at the top of the maison years ago presented the world a new vision of menswear Michele in fact prefers to go beyond the binary gender division by creating clothes for everyone I&#39;m in love with life and that&#39;s why I work in fashion I like to talk about human being One can be a man in so many different ways
