Hibbett is the latest retailer to say changing consumer habits are impacting sales.
The sporting goods retailer reported Q1 results Friday, mainly in line with its expectations. Q1 net income was $39.3 million, or $2.89 per diluted share. Net sales decreased 16.3% to $424.1 million. Comparable sales declined 18.9% compared to the prior year.

The sportswear retailer said "the prior year's first quarter received a significant boost from stimulus funds that did not reoccur in the current period," affecting sales growth in its most recent quarter.
"During the first quarter, our team effectively executed our strategic plan and delivered comparable store sales and financial results in line with our expectations. However, as we've previously discussed, our customer's spending habits were affected by lower discretionary income due to the absence of stimulus payments received in the first quarter of last year," said Mike Longo, chief executive officer of Hibbett.

"We are pleased to report that the supply chain disruption we experienced at the end of last year has improved, and our current inventory position is strong and consistent with our forecast. Our inventory increased by approximately $94 million during the first quarter, with a significant portion arriving late in the quarter. As a result, we have improved our inventory levels in many high demand products and are well-positioned to achieve our sales targets moving forward."
