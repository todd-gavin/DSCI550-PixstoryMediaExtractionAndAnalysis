Mumbai is bracing for more showers and a heavy rain alert has been issued in the city. It has been raining in the financial capital for the past two days, leaving its roads waterlogged and traffic movement affected. Mumbai's Powai Lake overflowed yesterday. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who visited the civic body's disaster control room, said 3,500 people had been shifted to safer places from flood-prone areas.
