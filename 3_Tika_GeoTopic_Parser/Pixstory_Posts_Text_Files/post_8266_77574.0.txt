Voters have many factors to consider when choosing the MVP every year. They can look at a player’s per game statistics and number of games played. They can analyze advanced metrics and on/off ratings and defensive impact. They can weight a team record and reward any candidates from no. 1 seeds.

But most of all, it seems, voters care about which player gets the most buckets, preferably for both himself and his teammates. Last season, Nikola Jokic was involved in the creation of 59.6 points per 36 minutes, the top mark in the NBA. (As we outlined two years ago, our points created metric includes the points a player scores, points off their assists, and points off their screen assists.) He rightly won MVP.

In 2019-20, Giannis Antetokounmpo led the league in points created; he won MVP. In 2018-19, Giannis ranked second in points created, 1.5 per 36 behind James Harden, and won MVP. In 2017-18, Harden led in points created and won MVP. And in 2016-17, Russell Westbrook led in points created—and, guess what, he also won MVP.

That’s as far back as this metric can be calculated, because 2016-17 is the first regular season for which screen assist data is publicly available. But in that time, which neatly coincides with the modern era of heliocentric offenses, four of the five MVPs led the league in points created, and the fifth finished a close second place.

So as we pass the halfway point of the 2021-22 season with a persistently uncertain MVP race—get well soon, Kevin Durant! And you, Steph Curry’s jumper!—how does this season’s points created leaderboard look? Which players lead the field, and which surprises are pushing toward the top?
