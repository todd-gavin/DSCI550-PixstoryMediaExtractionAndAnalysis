I said in one of my posts about how the latest bills and rulings are just Christian nationalism at its best. Overturning Roe v. Wade? Let's face it, this is about more than simply abortion; it's also about religious sexism towards women. And what's been the biggest weapon religious sexism carry? Slut shaming.

From modesty culture to abstaining women from having sex, everything is excused through slut shaming. And so does the arguments by pro lifers. Which is funny to say the least because didn't God tell them something around 'love thy neighbors', yeah?

Women are penalized by society for showing interest in men. Examples include abortion restrictions, slut shaming, discussions about women's "worth" lowering, and having to give up all ambitions in order to care for a man and children.

And guess what else society penalizes women for? Not showing interest in men. Women are constantly met with privacy invasions and behavior policing when they are not interested in men, when they say no. From asking them to "smile because he gave you a compliment" to "explain to him politely despite how uncomfortable he makes you."

It feels like there's no escape for us.

Now, people who are telling women to simply stop having pre-marital sex if they are scared of motherhood are missing not one but two points: Most abortions are not carried by unmarried women but by married women with children. And, two, have you forgotten what men do when we tell them a no? The people who are speaking against abortion and pre-marital sex are the same crowd that tells women to politely abide by what a man demands from them â€“ sex included.

Basically the point of this post was that no matter what happens, the responsibility and the blame comes on women so we might as well stretch that a little more and take those reigns in our hands. The law is not for us, we gotta be for each other.
