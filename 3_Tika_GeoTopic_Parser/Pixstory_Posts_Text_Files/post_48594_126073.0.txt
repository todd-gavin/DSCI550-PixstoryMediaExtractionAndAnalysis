The effects of violent video games depend on the type of game being played. For example: Watching TV violence has been consistently found to have negative effects on aggressive behavior; playing violent video games has been found to increase aggression in some cases but not others. Some researchers suggest that playing violent video games may be beneficial for young people as it helps them develop social skills such as communication and collaboration with others.

Talking of research, in the study, "Video Games Can Make You a Better Person," conducted by psychologist Dr. Craig Anderson and others, participants played either violent or nonviolent video games. The authors found that playing violent video games did not increase aggression or other negative emotions, but did lead to increased levels of guilt.

They believe that this is due in part to "the moral systems of these games." They write: "Games often have moral themes; for example, some games are based on cooperation or altruism." In addition, many games have been designed with an eye toward encouraging players to both cooperate and compete with one another. The thing about video games is that they're not based on violence, it's just a part of their game. They're based on teams. Video games are a great way to socialize.

The mass shooter claim. It makes sense for violence to be triggered by video games if you're already in an environment like that. The fault was in the culture and upbringing, not video games.
