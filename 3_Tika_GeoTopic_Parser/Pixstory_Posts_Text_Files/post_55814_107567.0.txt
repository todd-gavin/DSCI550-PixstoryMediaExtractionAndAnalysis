Garner appeared on the literary scene at the time where Australian writers were still a minority, and Australian women writers even rarer. 

Regarded as a feminist, and a realist, Garner’s novels have been described to elicit strong feelings. She grounds her work in Australia, telling her audience ‘I understand Australia. I fit in here.’ Her trademark theme is of obsession, especially in regard to love and sexuality.

Moreover, she has a reputation for incorporating and adapting her personal experiences in her fiction, something that has brought her widespread attention, particularly with her novels, Monkey Grip and The Spare Room (2008).
