The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the US Navy (USN) have deployed several military assets in the Philippine Sea near Taiwan amid the recent build-up of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces around the island.
The deployments include the flagship of the USN's Carrier Strike Group 5, USS Ronald Reagan , and the JMSDF's Murasame-class destroyer, JS Yudachi .
The JMSDF has also deployed an unspecified number of P-3C maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) to monitor the movement of a PLA Navy (PLAN) Jiangdao (Type 056/056A)-class corvette, Xiaogan (615), that was said to be in close proximity of Japanese maritime territories near Taiwan.
The PLA announced on 2 August that it would be conducting an expansive series of military drills around Taiwan. The announcement came after a highly controversial visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her delegation to the island, which Beijing views as a violation of its sovereignty.
