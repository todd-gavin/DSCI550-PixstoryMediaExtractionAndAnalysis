(G)HDLE's latest album, "I NEVER DE," is considered the girl group's "last chance," according to leader Soyeon. (G)HDLE is currently promoting "TOMBOY," the title track of their album "I NEVER DE." The album reaps outstanding achievements. Many were shocked by the success of the girl group since they remained out of the spotlight for over a year.

Additionally, their lineup decreased by one member after Soojin left the group because of school violence accusations. Soyeon recently had the opportunity to talk about what (G)HDLE went through after losing a member.

During an interview with W Korea Magazine, the female idol revealed that many changes occurred to (G)HDLE over the past year and mentioned how their line-up was reduced from six people to five. Because of what was happening, their latest album was considered their last chance. She told the publication:

"Last year, the group went through many changes. First, our team lineup changes from six members to five. During that time, I told the girl that this album was our last chance, so we had to do rise and do well. So I decided to title the album 'I NEVER DE' and got to work."

With the confident title "I NEVER DIE," it can be seen that this was the last chance to revive (G)HDLE. When asked if she was confident with her album, Soyeon revealed her faith in the release, saying:

"I am confident. I think I can say that this album is everything to me." "I NEVER DIE" proved to be highly successful. During the first week of its release, the album sold 176,914 copies, breaking their own personal record. In one week, the music video for "TOMBOY" surpassed 44 million views. The song achieved a digital real-time all-kill, topping several South Korean music charts.

Though (G)HDLE lost one member, they were able to make a spectacular comeback! They successfully won the love of the public back.
