Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted : 

"If the Supreme Court overturns Roe, abortion could be banned in states across the country, putting women’s lives at risk.
 
Since day one, our position has been clear: We will defend women’s constitutional rights and fight to protect the right to self-determination."
