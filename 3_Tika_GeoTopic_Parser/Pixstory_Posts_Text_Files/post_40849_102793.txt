In ancient days by emperor and clown Perhaps the self same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth when sick for home She stood in tears amid the alien corn The same that oft times hath Charm d magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn Forlorn the very word is like a bell To toll me back from thee to my sole self Adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well As she is fam d to do deceiving elf Adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows over the still stream Up the hill side and now tis buried deep In the next valley glades Was it a vision or a waking dream Fled is that music Do I wake or sleep John Keats
