On Monday, The Food and Drug Administration gave a green flag to Moderna's coronavirus vaccine for adults, which marks as the second of such authorization approved for the COVID - 19 vaccine in the U.S. 

“Safe and effective vaccines are our best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic, including currently circulating variants,” Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “The public can be assured that this vaccine was approved in keeping with the FDA’s rigorous scientific standards.” 

More than 200 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine, which the company named “Spikevax,” have been administered in the U.S. under an emergency use authorization, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

“Our COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to hundreds of millions of people around the world, protecting people from COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. 

In August the Pfizer's vaccine was fully approved for the people of the ages of 16 and above, which marks the first COVID - 19 shot that was given an approval beyond emergency use authorization in the U.S. 315 million and more Pfizer doses have been administered across the country. 

The Public health officials have conveyed their hope on a full approval that would reinforce vaccine safety and spur more people to get the shots, but surveys states that a full approval on the Pfizer shot moved the needle very little. 

According to CDC data, approximately 25 % of the Americans are yet to have received their first jab.
