Our baby boy Louis Tomlinson is coming back to light the world on fire, and make more people fall in love with him through his regular twitter check-ins. 

Louis Tomlinson, formerly of One Direction, has become a household name due to his association with band, and now due to his social demeanor where everyone who comes in contact with him, can't help but fall in love with him. 

Louis has registered four new songs for his second solo album.

The 30-year-old singer has been hard at work on his follow-up to 2020's 'Walls', and has co-written a bunch of tracks with former 'Fame Academy' winner David Sneddon and Hurts' Theo David Hutchcraft.


According to listings on PRS and ASCAP, the songs are: 'Silver Tongues', 'Pre-tender', 'Saturdays' and 'She Is Beauty, We Are World Class' as reported by several media outlets. 

Hopefully, widely anticipated LT2 would be released before we are done with this year.
