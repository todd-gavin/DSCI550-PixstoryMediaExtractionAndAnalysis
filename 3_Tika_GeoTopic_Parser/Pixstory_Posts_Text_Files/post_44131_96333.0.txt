Yaya Toure

Yaya Toure, another member of this club who went on to become a Premier League legend,
was one of the world's most frightening midfielders during his prime.

Toure would be one of City's biggest goal threats from midfield, with the technical elegance of
David Silva but the force of Patrick Vieira, and there was plenty of enthusiasm when he joined
from Barcelona for Â£24 million in 2010.

Toure returned to Olympiacos for one season in 2005 after departing City, where he spent eight
seasons and scored 79 goals, before retiring following a year in the Chinese Super League with
Qingdao Huanghai.

David Silva

David Silva, another Manchester City star, was an absolute wizard with the ball. After ten years
and 436 appearances for the club following his move from Valencia in 2010, Silva returned to
Spain with Real Sociedad, where he is still displaying his talents at the age of 35.

James Milner

James Milner, who is the same age as Silva, was a consistent and versatile option for City for
many years before leaving on a free transfer to Liverpool in quest of regular playing time.

He's still at Liverpool, where he's played all over the field and has a phenomenal resume that
includes three titles and a Champions League win. Milner joined Manchester United from Aston
Villa in 2008, and Barry followed him a year later.

Edin Dzeko

In England, the Bosnian target man perhaps never received the recognition he deserved.

Dzeko, who joined the club just six months before Aguero and the countless other attackers City
bought, was a player with enormous attacking quality who was overshadowed by Aguero and
the countless other strikers City signed.

He went on to play for Roma, where he scored 119 goals, before joining Inter Milan at the age of
35 in the summer of 2021. He continues to impress even now, and given some of the other
forwards City tried to replace him with, he may have deserved more chances in Manchester.
