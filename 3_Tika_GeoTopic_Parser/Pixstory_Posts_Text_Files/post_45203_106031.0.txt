On matchday 3 of the UEFA Nations League 2022-23, Portugal will face Czech Republic in the
early hours of Friday, June 10 at the magnificent Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon.

The game will
begin at 12:15 a.m. IST (Indian Standard Time).

Now that the matches are being played at regular intervals, Fernando Santos of Portugal may
decide to shuffle his players for this encounter. This might indicate that Pepe, who is getting
older, will get some much-needed slumber. Bernardo Silva and Rafael Leão, who came on as
replacements against Switzerland, might possibly return to the main team.

Czech Republic is still concerned about the fitness of both of their left-backs, who were injured
against Spain the last time they played.

Portugal vs Czech Republic: Probable Playing XI

Portugal : Diogo Costa; João Cancelo, Pepe, Domingos Duarte, Raphael Guerreiro; Bruno
Fernandes, Ruben Neves, Danilo Pereira; Bernardo Silva, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rafael Leão

Czech Republic : Tomas Vaclik; Vaclav Jemelka, Jakub Brabec, David Zima; Vladimir Coufal,
Tomas Soucek, Michal Sadilek, Jaroslav Zeleny; Jakub Jankto, Adam Hlozek; Jan Kuchta

Portugal vs Czech Republic: Prediction

The aggressive and positive attitude used by the Czech Republic against Spain could have a
similar effect against a tired Portugal team, especially given Santos' limited choices in the center
of defense.

The hosts, on the other hand, were in superb offensive form against Switzerland, and even with
a few of changes, we can only see Santos' side taking all three points.

Prediction: Brazil 1 - 3 Argentina
