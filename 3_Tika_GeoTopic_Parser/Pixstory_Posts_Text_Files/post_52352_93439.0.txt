What exactly is a Chiko Roll? Processed beef and vegetables wrapped in an egg, flour, and dough mixture and deep fried. Chiko Rolls have been a cultural icon in Australia since the 1950s, and their popularity at shows, sporting events, and carnivals shows no signs of abating. The Chiko Roll is a no-no with 1600 kilojoules per serving, 18 grammes of fat, and 1100mg of sodium. There are less fatty ways to be patriotic.
