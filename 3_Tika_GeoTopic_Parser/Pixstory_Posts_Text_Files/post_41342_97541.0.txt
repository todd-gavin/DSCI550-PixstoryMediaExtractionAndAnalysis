The United States Army gave climbers a leg up this week on North America's tallest peak. 

US News reported that two bus-sized CH-47F Chinook helicopters from B Company, 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment at Fort Wainwright flew to Denali on Wednesday to help set up base camp, continuing a decades-old tradition. Denali is a 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain located about 240 miles (386 kilometres) north of Anchorage. 

Thousands of pounds of supplies and equipment were delivered to the lower base camp at 7,200 feet on the Kahiltna Glacier (2,195 meters). 

As climbers attempt to summit Denali using the West Buttress route, the most popular for climbers, the National Park Service creates one camp and another at 14,000 feet (4,267 metres).

When the helicopters are needed for high-elevation rescues, soldiers from Fort Wainwright frequently return to Denali. When the National Park Service's helicopter is out of service or when there are more patients than the park service's smaller chopper can handle, this aid is provided.
