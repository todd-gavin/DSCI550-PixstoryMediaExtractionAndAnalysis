Abstract Aims We addressed the question whether chronic kidney disease CKD may contribute to cognitive decline in type diabetes Methods Participants with type diabetes with elevated cardiovascular risk or CKD from cognition substudies of two large trials were studied prospectively CARMELINA n mean SD age years CAROLINA n years Estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR and urine albumin to creatinine ratio UACR at baseline were related to cognitive performance Mini Mental State Examination MMSE and attention and executive functioning score A amp E in linear regression analyses adjusted for demographics cardiovascular risk factors and treatment at baseline and follow up Results CKD at baseline was more common in CARMELINA than CAROLINA eGFR lt in and macroalbuminuria in and respectively Baseline eGFR was related to A amp E in CARMELINA b per ml min m CI Baseline UACR was related to A amp E in CAROLINA b per doubling of UACR mg g CI Baseline UACR predicted decline in A amp E in CAROLINA median years follow up b CI per doubling of UACR mg g Conclusions eGFR and UACR were associated with A amp E in two cohorts with type diabetes enriched for CKD and cardiovascular disease The small effect size estimates indicate limited impact of kidney dysfunction on cognition in this setting Sources
