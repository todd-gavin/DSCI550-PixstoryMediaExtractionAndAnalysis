3 Aleksandar Kolarov
The Serbian defender who mesmerised us with his defending at City was one of the club's greatest transfers, costing less than 16 million euros. He was known for his overlapping runs and ability to break counter-attacks. His left-foot ball-striking ability was exceptional, as was his free-kick accuracy.
Kolarov appeared in 247 games for City, scoring 21 goals and assisting on 37 others. And he left the club with two Premier League titles to his name.


2 Pablo Zabaleta
Zabaleta joined City in 2008 and is known for his gutsy and relentless pressing in the game "The offer is too good to pass up, and not just because of the money... Juventus wanted me as well, but I wanted to come to England, specifically Manchester."
Zabaleta got an opportunity to make himself a popular player in Europe after he joined Premier League club. His breakthrough was imminent, and he made 333 appearances, scoring 11 goals and assisting on 28 others. He was also named PFA Team of the Year, Manchester City Player of the Year, and a member of the FIFPro World XI.

1 Vincent Kompany
City has never had a true leader and an aggressive defender playing for them. But arrival of Blegian defender changed everything,   Kompany takes the top spot because he adores the club and what he has accomplished with them. He joined the club in 2008 and quickly adapted to the Premier League tempo; his reliability earned him the captain's armband.
Kompany made 360 appearances for the club, scoring 20 goals and assisting 11, winning four Premier League titles, being named player of the year once, and being inducted into the FIFPro World XI.
