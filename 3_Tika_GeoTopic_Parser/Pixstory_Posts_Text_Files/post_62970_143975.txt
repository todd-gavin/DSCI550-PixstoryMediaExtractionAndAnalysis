Listening to music from different languages can be a exciting and enriching experience Like Eileen mentions it can help you learn new vocabulary increase your fluency in the language and even improve your pronunciation Depending on the type of music you listen to it may also promote cultural awareness and appreciation Here are some specific benefits of listening to music from different languages Music from different languages helps you learn new words and phrases When you re learning a foreign language singing along with songs in that language is an excellent way to remember what you ve learned I ve also been told that music encourages memory retention because it engages multiple parts of the brain auditory cortex the part responsible for hearing hippocampus the part responsible for storing memories frontal lobe responsible for rational thought cerebellum responsible for movement and parietal lobe associated with spatial coordination Music from different countries or regions can help increase your fluency in that language You might not have ever heard all of the words in a French song before but by listening regularly to French songs over time those words will start becoming ingrained into your memory as well as your ability to speak that particular dialect of French fluently This is due largely to exposure practice which again is why listening to music is such an effective way of learning When we hear certain accents or tones through our ears this activates certain areas within our brains associated with those sounds As we continue to listen to new music we re actually learning to communicate better
