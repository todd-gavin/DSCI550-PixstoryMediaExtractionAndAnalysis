Manchester United vs Arsenal- The Invincible 2.0 run Broken
In the 66th minute, Eriksen made a pass to Bruno Fernandes, who made a scrumptious assist to Marcus Rashford to make it a 2-1 scoreline. 15 minutes before full time, Bruno Fernandes made a beautiful pass to Eriksen, who ran down to the half of the pitch, instead of finishing it for himself, he made a square pass to onrushing Marcus Rashford, who put it behind the net. United were 3 goals up to the 1. It was a very unselfish move by Christian, as Marcus has been devoid of confidence, instead of taking the glory he made a beautiful assist to Rashford.
United finished the game 3-1, which saw them jump to 12 points, 3 points behind Arsenal with 15 points.
