Beginning with suffrage during the late nineteenth or twentieth century for the first time women fought for their autonomy they knew it would be a long odyssey as the years of endured oppression would not cease so early It startles me when I think of how the atrocities of the world always chose struggles for women equality was never a thing to settle with The power dynamic where a woman was constantly persecuted and meant to obey the things a patriarchal society foisted on her Men held power even earlier or now It was always a battle to fight either to speak of the th century or the st century we are living in Hundreds of years have passed the longest a journey would go on but the battle still seems new and the fight for equality never ebbed Speaking of the st century changes were occurring women who were part of the fight could see it changing but some moments never fail to remind us it is still not done yet The most recent would be the talk on abortion rights it brings me deep despair when I see how far we have come and things seem to be settling but then again women are on the streets protesting to gain their bodily rights and right to privacy It is a shame pure shame They are fighting for the right to what they can keep in their womb Bodily autonomy is the basic decency a woman or any human expects restricting that would mean exerting power on anyone else s body I think all the changes and revolutions were just delusions nothing changed then and nothing has changed now
