While going out for coffee, a person operating an elevator struck up a friendly conversation with my mom while taking short glances at me, speaking about COVID’s wreckage.

I was dressed in a denim jacket and masked up — an outfit that helps me feel more like myself and sometimes throws people off: too short and narrow to be read as a ‘man’ but too masc-presenting to be a woman.

He started asking my mom questions about me – Did I go to school or college? There was no way I could be an adult, he said, subtly scanning my body.

Most people read me as butch, or as a 14 year old boy, as long as I don’t speak. I’ve embraced this imposed youth, but being infantilized by it still manages to create a cocktail of heightened dysphoria and internalized transphobia that I am still grappling to understand.

With time, it becomes easy to interact with folks who don’t know how to perceive me. I lean on my overused catchphrases with some luck in creating new ones in the loop of how visibility lead to steps towards invisibility — to be gender-nonconforming where conformity is the norm, and to be immediately brushed aside because of it.

But in this moment, I couldn’t get myself to speak the words waiting in my mouth: I was being spoken about in third person and didn’t want my feminine voice to satisfy the clocking, to give away the little self-preservation of identity left in that elevator.

I’m not ashamed of being trans, but there is still shame when someone else perceives me as trying to pass off as a young boy. Like while getting my hair buzzed short, the barber uses a child’s gown and pats the back of my neck like he’s telling me I’m a ‘good bud.’

I don’t care much for these perceptions – they don’t reflect who I am. My days of performing a soft femininity for others are long over and grown men need to stop imposing their boring margins of binaried clothing norms onto other people’s bodies.
