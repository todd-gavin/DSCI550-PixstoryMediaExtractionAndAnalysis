Defending himself and other Australian swimmers from "false headlines," Commonwealth Games hero Kyle Chalmers said that if they continue, "my career in the sport would be done." 

According to reports, Chalmers and ex-girlfriend Emma McKeon kept their distance from one another as they won the 4x100m freestyle mixed relay gold on Friday. 

Mirror reported that Chalmers won gold in the 100-meter freestyle at the Rio 2016 Olympics. Both swimmers, however, have denied those allegations in the intervening time, with Chalmers adamant that he "absolutely whispered congratulations" to McKeon after she finished the final leg of their relay victory. 

After singer-turned-swimmer Cody Simpson stated earlier in July that he was now dating McKeon, rumours of a "love triangle" started to circulate. 24 year old Chalmers posted on Instagram that his mental health was "at rock bottom" and and that the ordeal had left him at "breaking point."

"After trials I sat down and assessed whether I was going to continue on in the sport because I have given everything to this country, I have given everything to my sport," Chalmers told reporters after he won gold with the menâ€™s 4x100m freestyle team on Saturday evening.
