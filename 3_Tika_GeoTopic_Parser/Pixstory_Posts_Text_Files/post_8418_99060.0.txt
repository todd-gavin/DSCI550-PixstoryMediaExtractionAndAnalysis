While the world vies to know the origin of the universe,
I see its eternal presence in the womb of mothers;

Like the roots hold up the magnificence of a tree, 
a mother holds up life before setting it free;

She bears the unbearable to light up this world, like she's the ultimate truth and the only one who deserves;

You can't run away from her, hiding your tears, she knows everything and every way how you bear;

Her endearment epitomizes the feeling called love,
as nature breathes in the song of a dove;

While everything is uncertain about life and its cycles,
there'd be nothing like a mother's selflessness and its sacrifices.

there'd be nothing like a mother's selflessness and its sacrifices.......

All love begins and ends here.

PS: Mothers are such divine souls who epitomise the feeling of love on this planet.

Every day is a mother's day as we can never thank 'em enough!

Bow down to this divine force 🙏
