LA (Associated Press) â€“ Stephen Curry, the winner of the NBA Finals MVP award, co-hosted the ESPY Awards on Wednesday and called attention to WNBA star Brittney Griner's arrest with WNBA teammates Nneka Ogwumike and Skylar Diggins-Smith. In February, Griner was detained in Russia when customs officers allegedly discovered cannabis oil-filled vape cartridges in her luggage. If found guilty of the drug transportation allegations, she may spend up to 10 years in jail.It has been 153 nights since BG was unfairly detained thousands of miles from her home, her family, her friends, and her team, according to Diggins-Smith. Even while we are aware that it won't be enough to bring her home, y'all, we have kept her in our hearts and minds throughout that period. Curry noticed the attempt being made to liberate Griner while wearing her Phoenix Mercury jersey underneath his track suit.
