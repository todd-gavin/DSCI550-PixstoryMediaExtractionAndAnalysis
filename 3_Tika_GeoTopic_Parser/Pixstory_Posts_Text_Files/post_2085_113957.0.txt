Five speech therapists in China, all in their twenties, were arrested and recently charged with sedition by Chinese prosecutors for providing their patients a book describing two warring societies, one of wolves and one of sheep, with the society of wolves intended to represent China. According to reports, the book contained numerous anti-Chinese government sentiments. 

Hearing about such circumstances makes one realize how much we take the United States for granted. The United States has the least restrictive speech laws in the world, for better or worse, as a result of the first amendment. 

It is lamentable that many powerful interests in the United States and throughout the world are still dependent on China based on China's global market share. Too many individuals are willing to overlook China's misdeeds in order to lime their own pockets, despite China's numerous transgressions.
