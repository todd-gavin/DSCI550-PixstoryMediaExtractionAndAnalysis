Authorities claimed on Friday that a kangaroo assaulted and injured a 69-year-old woman on a golf course on Australia's Gold Coast, leaving her with severe cuts and scrapes all over her body. 

According to Queensland state Ambulance Operations Supervisor Joel McEwan, the kangaroo attacked the woman without notice while she was playing golf, slamming her to the ground and continuously kicking and stomping on her. 

â€œShe was walking down the fairway, and the kangaroo has come from the side and just attacked," McEwan said.

Experts estimate that there are about 50 million kangaroos in Australia, and they have been known to visit golf courses. As housing has extended into places where the marsupials live, it is not uncommon for them to have conflicts with people.
