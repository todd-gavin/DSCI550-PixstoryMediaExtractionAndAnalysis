A Dad is a person Who is loving and kind, And often he knows what you  have on your mind. 
He's someone who listens, suggests, and defends .A dad can be one of your very best friends; 
He's proud of your triumphs, but when things go wrong,
A dad can be patient and helpful and strong. In all that you do, a dad's love plays a part 
There's always a place for him deep in your heart And each year that passes, you're even more glad, More grateful and proud just to call him Thank you  dad! 

For listening and caring, for giving and sharing, but, especially, for just being you.
