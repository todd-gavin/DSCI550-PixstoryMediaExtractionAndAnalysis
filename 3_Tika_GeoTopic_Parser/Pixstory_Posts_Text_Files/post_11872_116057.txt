Gender inequality is an issue that has been debated for many decades It is a social problem which causes unfair treatment in society between different genders Bryan Robinson Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte states in Forbes that gender discrimination is still alive and well in the workplace in One of the causes for gender inequality within employment is the division of jobs Due to this reason Gender inequality is most prevalent in the healthcare sectors Women report greater barriers to healthcare and adhere to more traditional gender roles than men and thus unnecessarily creates a huge difference in the pay gap There is an increase in gender pay gap of about from across all geographic and income regions Women in the healthcare sector are being paid less than men per hour worked Most of the reasons for such pay gaps are unexplained which shows the ignorant behaviour of healthcare sector Studies show that mothers appear to suffer a wage penalty while fathers seem to be rewarded with a wage premium This redundantly shows the unnecessary stereotype Thus the time has arrived to revise the policy and call for decisive policy action including the necessary policy dialogue between institutions
