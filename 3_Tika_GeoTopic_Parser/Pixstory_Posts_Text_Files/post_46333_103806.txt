Wake Up Sid I just Love this Movie one thing Which i still remember about this movie is Love isn t always normal or perfect In movie Aisha and Sid expected something else from each other Their relationship wasn t perfect yet they found comfort in each other Love according to me is When two people are in love their souls share a language unknown to the rest of the world Just being with them makes you forget everything and it feels like you have got everything you ever wanted Well it s true that with the right person by your side you can find joy and happiness even in the smallest things of life Love isn t always about fancy dates or grand romantic gestures it s actually the little everyday things which makes it a lot more special Love is sitting with them on rainy evenings playing their favourite songs and sipping a cup of tea Love is when they just look at you and smile Love is wearing their favourite colour Love is when they go out of their comfort zone to cook your favourite biryani Love is when they ask you to drop a text as soon as you reach home Love is looking into their eyes and never getting tired of it Love is sitting under the sky and holding their hands Love is silently shifting them to the opposite side of the traffic Love is keeping their picture in your wallet We have a thousand perceptions about love and one day we find someone who gives meaning to all of those You find home in their embrace and your soul feels at peace with them They are our sunshine in the morning and peaceful sleep in the night With them life has changed in a way you never expected and you don t want to give this love away for anything in the world Tell me in notes how many of you love this movie
