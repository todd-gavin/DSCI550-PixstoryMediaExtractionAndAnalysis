Tibet-China Relations

Thirdly, the Chinese, who eventually were semi-colonised through armed might by the British and other Europeans under a polite legal fiction of Manchu rule, (unlike in India where they physically took over after deposing a degenerate and token Mughal ‘emperor’), realized that the Europeans played by different rules. The Asian methods of subordinate vassal states, and of no precisely-delimited and demarcated formal boundaries, had been replaced by the new European concept of ‘nation-states’ with precisely-defined boundaries denoting ‘ownership’. 

The Manchu court thus decided to physically take possession of Inner Mongolia, eastern Turkestan and Tibet. (Manchuria, lying to the northeast of Han China, was their own home country, and therefore did not need to be taken over, it was already theirs) Thus began the Chinese attempts to take over Tibet militarily, in a continuous mind-set from the Manchus through the Nationalist Chinese of the KMT to the Chinese Communist Party and the PRC. The Manchu effort began from 1905, with the appointment of General Zhao Erfeng, the Chinese warlord and Governor of Xining who was already in overall charge of Western China, as the Army Commander for Tibet. Under him, his brother Zhao Erxun was in charge of the province of Sichuan. The mission given to Zhao Erfeng was to ‘re-integrate’ Tibet into the Chinese empire. But more of this later.
