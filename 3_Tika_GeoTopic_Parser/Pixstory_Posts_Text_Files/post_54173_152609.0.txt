433 people win a lottery jackpot – impossible? Probability and psychology suggest it’s more likely than you’d thinkMore than a few eyebrows were raised at the weekend when it was reported a staggering 433 people won the jackpot of a government-backed lottery in the Philippines – sharing in 236 million pesos (about A$6.2 million).Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has led to calls for an enquiry into how this seemingly “near-impossible” outcome could have arisen.However, a basic understanding of probability and human psychology helps explain why this outcome isn’t as implausible as you might think.How the lottery worksEach person to purchase a lottery ticket picks six numbers between 1 and 55. The winning jackpot sequence is drawn at random. A ticket wins the jackpot if the six numbers on it are the same as the six numbers drawn.Each ticket therefore has:a six in 55 chance of getting the first number drawn, multiplied bya five in 54 chance of getting the second, multiplied bya four in 53 chance of getting the third, multiplied bya three in 52 chance of getting the fourth. multiplied bya two in 51 chance of getting the fifth, multiplied bya one in 50 chance of getting the last.Together, this means any given ticket has a 1 in 28,989,675 chance of winning the jackpot. So how is it possible for 433 tickets to have done this?What are the chances?Without knowing how many tickets were actually sold, we can’t know the exact probability of getting 433 winning tickets.One widely circulated estimate this week assumed there were around 10 million ticket sales, and claimed the chances were as little as “one out of one followed by 1,224 zeros” – a truly absurd number. This is smaller than the chances of flipping a typical coin 2,800 times in a row and seeing tails every time.Read more: https://theconversation.com/433-people-win-a-lottery-jackpot-impossible-probability-and-psychology-suggest-its-more-likely-than-youd-think-191946
