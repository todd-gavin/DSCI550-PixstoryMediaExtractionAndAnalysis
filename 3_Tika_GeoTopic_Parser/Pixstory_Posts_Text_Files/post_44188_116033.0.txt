Barcelona has started doing some serious business in the summer transfer window not long
after pulling the first economic lever, which was the sale of 10% of its La Liga TV rights.

Speaking of important matters, Ousmane Dembele has been renewed by Barça, putting an end
to one of the longest-running contract sagas in football history. A two-year contract signed by
the Frenchman keeps him at the Camp Nou through 2024.

Dembele, who remains one of the most expensive football players in history, was signed in 2017
as part of a €130 million transaction (including variables). But he hasn't lived up to the asking
price. That is, until Xavi took over the steering wheel.

Under the Spanish manager, the 25-year-old winger found a new lease of life, compiling an
astounding 13 assists in 21 appearances. His second-half performance was a result of Xavi's
desire to keep him active after he declined to sign a contract extension with Barça.

Dembele has reportedly taken a 40% wage cut to renew, if rumours are to be believed. His pay
comprises of a meagre basic salary plus multiple performance-based bonus. That is still a
significant step down from what he desired.

Although the source of Barcelona's funding is currently unknown, the club has achieved a
preliminary deal to buy Brazilian wide forward Raphinha from Leeds after pulling a "second
economic lever."

A recent report from Diario AS provided an update on Memphis Depay's future. The future of
numerous players at the team is questionable, including the former Manchester United forward.

He has not yet signed up for Barcelona's impending preseason tour of the United States as a
result. Before committing to the upcoming season, the Dutchman is awaiting a firm answer from
the club regarding his position and future at Camp Nou.
