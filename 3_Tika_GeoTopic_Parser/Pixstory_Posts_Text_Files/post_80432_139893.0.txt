Despite his attacking presence, Zinchenko has also had a very important role to play in Arsenal's defence. Playing on the left hand side of a back four, it is important for Zinchenko to remain confident and disciplined. This is especially the case in the Premier League as he would have to defend against some of the greatest wingers in football such as Mohamed Salah and Bernardo Silva. However, the former Manchester City defender has been accustomed to the league having already played for the blue side of Manchester under Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta. This meant he didn't need time to adjust and slotted into the Arsenal defence effortlessly.
Zinchenko has a better clean sheet average than any other Arsenal defender this season. He has played four games and kept a clean sheet in two of them. Mikel Arteta was forced to sideline Zinchenko for two fixtures after he suffered from a sprain in his knee. Arsenal were unable to keep a clean sheet in either of these games, highlighting the importance of Zinchenko.
"He gives us the flexibility to attack in different ways in relation to what the opponent wants to do, wants to prevent and make spaces that we want to exploit," Arteta said describing Zinchenko's positive impact on the club.
"It's something good to have in the team and we encourage him and he's a midfield player playing as a full-back, it gives us the adaptability and the variety of positions to attack and defend spaces. It's an extra weapon to have because we are unpredictable."
It is clear Arteta rates the full-back very highly and has had nothing but high praise for Zinchenko since he joined.
