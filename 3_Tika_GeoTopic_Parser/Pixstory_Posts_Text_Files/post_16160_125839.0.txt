Aamir Khan has been facing the wrath of netizens who have been calling for boycott of his recently released film Laal Singh Chaddha because of his 2015's intolerance remark. ❌

Similarly, Kareena Kapoor Khan too has been at the receiving end of hate over her, 'If you don't like our films, don't watch them' remark. She has now requested people not to boycott her film.😕😕

When Kareena was asked whether people have taken her thoughts like, 'public ko lightly le rahin hain kya?' she said, "I think it’s only a section of people that are trolling. But genuinely, I think that the love the film is getting is very different. These are just a section of people who are probably on your social media, which is probably like 1 per cent.”✅✅

But the fact is that they shouldn’t boycott this film, it’s such a beautiful film. And I want people to see me and Aamir khan on screen. It’s been three years, we’ve waited so long. So, please don’t boycott this film, because it’s actually like boycotting good cinema. And people have worked so hard on it; we’ve had 250 people work on this film for two-and-a-half years,” she added.💖💖
