The three wickets claimed by Rashid Khan and Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi's good performance helped Afghanistan defeat the Netherlands by 36 runs in the first of a three-match one-day international series in Doha on Friday.

Afghanistan needed the expertise of their newly-appointed leader in conditions where hardly any batter from either side scored at more than run a ball.

Shahidi, who batted at No. 4, hit four fours and two sixes as he continued the innings all the way through to the 50th over. He had the well-played Rahmat Shah for support, who scored 70 off 102 balls. 

The Netherlands' hopes of chasing the total down rested primarily on their opener, Scott Edwards, who scored 68 off 82 balls, with eight fours, but his dismissal by Mujeeb Rahman created the opening that Afghanistan needed to take control. The Netherlands fell from 121 for 3 to 186 all out as Rashid (3-31) cared for the match.

Shahidi was named Player of the Match for his outstanding knock of 73.

The series is part of the World Cup Super League that will determine the qualifiers for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

The second match of the series is scheduled for Sunday, with the final ODI on January 25.
