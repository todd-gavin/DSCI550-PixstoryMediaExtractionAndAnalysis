A goal by Defrel in the last minutes gives Dionisi&#39;s Sassuolo three fundamental points in the match won against Fiorentina This is the comment of the neroverdi coach on the match in the press conference In the first half we did well in the second half Fiorentina created above all with shots from outside Fiorentina changed a lot in the second half we didn&#39;t have those chances because there&#39;s a difference we have many young players who will make it and it wasn&#39;t a young game we had on the bench we had to push as much as possible and I changed the system to cover ourselves on the flanks we conceded systematically and to take advantage of Matheus Henrique&#39;s quality in the middle of the field It&#39;s a pity about the equalizer because from then on Fiorentina lowered and we started playing again We attacked well the depth and the goal was born from a situation like this this allowed us to create but also to spend a lot Traore and Berardi, for example, have spent a lot If it had ended even I would have said that Fiorentina could have deserved it but whoever believed in it more won, thanks to us We saw two good home and away matches with two teams that they do not try to speculate and it is normal that it could be a match with many chances because both teams have quality players Italian is making an extraordinary journey Photo credits Serie A
