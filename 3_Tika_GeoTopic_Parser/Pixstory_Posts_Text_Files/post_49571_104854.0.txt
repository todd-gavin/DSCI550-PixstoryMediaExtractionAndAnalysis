Most people are apprehensive about travelling alone. It shouldn't be that way. It could be at the top of your to-do list, if you take that leap of faith. The first thing I discovered when travelling was that most anxieties are unfounded. I mean, sure, there are risks. For some more than the others but I think if you can do your research and pick a safe place, it's a once in a lifetime experience.

Don't let this opportunity pass you by.

Taking a tour without a guide might provide you with a wealth of fresh experiences. Taking public transportation, such as the metro, taxi, or bus, will allow you to live like a local. You can also rent a two-wheeler to tour the city and get a firsthand look at how the residents live. It's also a cost-effective way to go around any city. It's great fun. You can learn to live a new life for a few days.
