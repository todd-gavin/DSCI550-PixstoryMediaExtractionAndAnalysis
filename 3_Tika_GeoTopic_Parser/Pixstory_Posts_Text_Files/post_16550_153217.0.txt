The Housefull franchise created by Sajid Nadiadwala is synonymous with the indispensable comic timing of Akshay Kumar. It’s among the rarest of the franchises in Hindi Cinema to have a 100 percent hit ratio. And now, we have learnt that Sajid Nadiadwala has locked his idea for the fifth installment of Housefull franchise, titled Housefull 5 and is presently working on the script. The NGE production will be one of the biggest multi-starrers of Hindi Cinema and bring together Akshay Kumar, John Abraham, Abhishek Bachchan, and Bobby Deol.“Sajid Nadiadwala has the plan of bringing an entire universe of his Housefull franchise under one roof ever since the release of Housefull 4. He has been trying to crack a plot that justifies the presence of all the characters and he finally has the plot locked. He is currently in the process of finalizing a story and screenplay around his idea,” revealed a source close to the development, adding further that Housefull 5 will be the biggest film of the franchise.
