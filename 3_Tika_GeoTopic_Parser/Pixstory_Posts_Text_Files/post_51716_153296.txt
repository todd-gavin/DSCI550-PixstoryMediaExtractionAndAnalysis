Wesley Fofana to miss four weeks with sprained knee According to reports in France Wesley Fofana only had a sprained knee and will thus miss only a few weeks of matches Maybe four weeks That s not great news but it s certainly not the worst news that we had feared after he limped out of last night s game The year old jarred his knee after a challenge from Rafael Le o and while he tried to play on twice eventually he had to call it a day From laughter to tears as he put it on Instagram having scored his first goal for the club not ten minutes prior Fofana was seen leaving stadium on crutches afterwards with his right knee in a brace nbsp all good indicators of something major having gone wrong Having personally spent the last couple years recovering from ACL surgery I pretty much assume every knee injury is a torn ligament So hopefully this report is accurate and hopefully it is also the full extent of the diagnosis and not like Chilwell s case last year where we tried for a month to rehab the injury before biting the bullet and having him undergo the operation I wish him the best recovery What do think about his career in future Let me know in the notes Thankyou
