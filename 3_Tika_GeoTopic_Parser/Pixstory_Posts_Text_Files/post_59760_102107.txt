 Rain doesn t fall in the forest the clouds are of ash City shrouded in toxic fumes as money and sanity clash Slash and Burn turns days into nights for the fire in the forest rage The world watches in helpless horror as we enter a new age These lines rightly capture the situation which arises during a forest fire We being one of the major sources still choose to close our eyes and turn a deaf ear to such a heartfelt portrait Forest fire is no longer a rare phenomenon in today s world Who can forget the iconic Disney s Bambi wildfire or the Amazon forest fire that lasted for about ten months Forests have been an important part of the ecosystem They provide shelter and food to flora and fauna But it is unfortunate that the world has lost one third of its woods an area twice the size of the United States While a few forest fires are due to natural causes most of them are a result of man made causes naked flame spark Humans are selfish beings Men work for a single purpose and aim for making gains forgetting that all lives are interrelated The desire to earn profit refutes the value leading to depletion of the planet s lungs through which the world breathes turning it to ashes with ranging fumes The theft of resources is a crime that we greedy humans have been doing since eras We should take precautions on an individual level so that no forest fire can be caused yet again because of human beings we should not leave the source of fire unattended Safe practices must be adopted in and around the forest The government should make sure that the infrastructure necessary to control forest fires is available We can use technology that warns us before much harm has been done for example sensor systems It is high time that people should drop their ignorance and try making the planet a safe place for other species to live Let us be the change we wish to see in the world
