Transforming a very usual Thanksgiving family gathering to an unusual one the eeriest possible I can t find more simple words to explain Stephen Karam s debut directorial The Humans adapted from his own play The Blakes Erik Richard Jenkins and wife Deidre Jayne Houdyshell visit their daughter Bridgid s Beanie Feldstein new apartment in Manhattan along with his second daughter Aimee Amy Schumer and his mother Momo The prospective new member of the family is Richard Steven Yeun Bridgid s live in partner I loved his sensibility and patience among all Out of all I felt the apartment is the most mysterious character in this film It captures all human emotions as its own Creaky doors narrow passages filthy toilet flickering bulbs unstable electricity thudding noises spiral staircase all elements create a paranormal mild horror throughout Everybody gathered there holds stories dusted deep within Stories that carry disappointment anguish and abandonment The house resonates with them when they cross their own tunnels Erick is seen at the window looking outside wearing a lonely self amid the crowd Bridgid often seeks refuge in open halls or terrace or Richard s hug whenever she drops Aimee uses the washroom often to check her texts and she breaks down in the corridor Deidre struggles with her middle class values not acceptable to the family She acts modern and ends up a joke at the table Secrets kept from her daughters shatter Erik Momo remains in a wheelchair representing a rotten old age Each suffers from their tiresome self travel and attributes them to the apartment In an objective view this is common in occasions of family union Time travel into the past tests people s formal present Things may not end white if they begin scratching the surface A totally untraditional camera plays magic staying far from indoors yet absorbing micro human emotions At the end of a patient you really need it watch I came to the conclusion that Stephen is directing the environment not the people That pressure forces the inmates to come out of their fake selves and turn into real humans
