Table Tennis Ping Pong or TT is a racket sport played on a table with a net dividing the table in halves While the sport is rather easy to understand what makes it interesting is the different grips one can use to enhance their game such as The traditional Chinese Penhold Grip inspired by the action of holding a writing instrument The volatile Western Shakehand Grip as if one were performing a handshake The Seemiller Grip inspired by American player Danny Seemiller who came up with this grip to support his playstyle that was accompanied by Twiddling his racket To learn more about the sport I would start with YouTube channels like Pongfinity Adam Boborrow TableTennisDailTableTennisDaily
