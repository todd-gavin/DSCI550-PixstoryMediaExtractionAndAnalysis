Barcelona have announced that defender Ronald Araujo has signed a new deal until 2026, with
his release clause increasing to €1 billion ($1.16 billion).

Araujo's previous contract was set to expire in 2023, and ESPN reported last month that
Manchester United and Liverpool were interested in signing him.

Although the money on offer from Premier League clubs was larger than Barca's, sources
informed ESPN that the player's first objective was to stay at Camp Nou.

Araujo, 23, has been with Barca since 2018, when he joined the club's B squad in a €2 million
trade from Boston River in his country.

As a result, he was one of the lowest-paid players in the first team heading into this season, with
his representatives pushing for a raise in line with his new standing at the club.

He has emerged as a crucial player this season under coach Xavi Hernandez, making 39
appearances in all competitions and scoring four goals, one of which came in the 4-0 Clasico
triumph over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.

Due to their financial difficulties, Barca have been a thorn in Araujo's side throughout
discussions.

Earlier this month, sources informed ESPN that discussions had finally progressed, with Barca
increasing their first offer and Araujo eager to meet the club in the middle, despite approaches
from English teams.

In addition to signing Araujo to a long-term contract, ESPN recently reported that Barcelona has
agreed to sign Andreas Christensen on a free transfer when his contract with Chelsea expires in
the summer.

Araujo and Christensen will battle for a spot in Barca's defense next season with Gerard Pique
and Eric Garcia, with the club open to offers for Clement Lenglet, Oscar Mingueza, and Samuel
Umtiti.
