Paul Heyman feels that Roman Reigns is the greatest star in WWE history, an accolade The Tribal Chief has seemingly achieved in the last few years.

Reigns has been on a hugely successful run in the Stamford-based promotion as The Tribal Chief, a gimmick he debuted in 2020 after turning heel. He currently holds the Universal and WWE Championship simultaneously

In his recent appearance on the MackMania podcast, Paul Heyman stated that Reigns' Tribal Chief gimmick has established himself as the greatest in the promotion's history.

"Here's a conversation that Roman Reigns and I like to have quite often. And the conversation is something along the lines of, I inform him of my honest opinion, which is, I think in my heart of hearts, Roman Reigns is the GOAT. I think he's the greatest performer in WWE history," said Heyman.

There is very little that can be said to argue against this statement because Roman Reigns has defined the business in a way that very few have before him. So in my opinion, Heyman is not completely out of line to put forth Reigns' name in this contest. After all, WWE had its most profitable quarter in the history when Roman Reigns was the top Champion in the company.
