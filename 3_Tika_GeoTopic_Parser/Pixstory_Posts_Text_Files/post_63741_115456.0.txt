Monty Norman, best known for composing the iconic score of the James Bond movies died on 11 July at the age of 94. A statement posted Monday on Norman's official website said, “It is with sadness we share the news that Monty Norman died on 11th July 2022 after a short illness.” Norman was born on April 4,1928 as Monty Noserovitch in east London, to a Jewish family.
However his most remembered piece was his Bond theme, which was commissioned in 1962 for James Bond debut ‘Dr. No’, which was used throughout the series. 

For the main theme, the composer used the structure of one of his earlier compositions -'Good Sign, Bad Sign’, from an abandoned musical production of VS Naipaul's novel ‘A House For Mr Biswas’ - and re-wrote it using the gentleman, womanizing assassin in mind.

After switching the main riff from a sitar to an electric guitar, Norman said that he knew he at that point, that he had captured the essence of 007."His sexiness, his mystery, his ruthlessness - it's all there in a few notes.," he later went on to recall. His music for ‘Dr. No’ also includes the song "Underneath The Mango Tree", which he taught to Sean Connery and Ursula Andress, and a theme that accompanies the opening scene with the three blind assassins.

In a varied career, Norman also sang with big bands and also appeared in variety shows alongside the likes of Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Tommy Cooper. He also wrote the music for the Hammer movie ‘The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll (1960)’,’ The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961)’, the Bob Hope Eon Productions movie ‘Call Me Bwana (1963)’, and the TV miniseries ‘Dickens of London (1976)’.
