India create history by beating Indonesia 3-0 to clinch first ever Thomas Cup title in 73 years

Indian men’s badminton team created history when they upset 14-time champions and holders Indonesia 3-0 to clinch their first ever Thomas Cup title in Bangkok on Sunday.

The underdogs, who had not reached the last four stage of this prestigious tournament since 1979, had assured themselves of a medal by beating Malaysia on Thursday and then got the better of Denmark in the semi-finals with both matches going to the wire.
“It's a very proud moment for Indian badminton. We have had many individual triumphs but winning the Thomas Cup crown is very special. This shows the depth of talent we have among the men and full credit to the players and coaching staff for giving their ultimate best through this week and beating some of the biggest badminton powerhouses on their way to the title win," said Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, President, Badminton Association of India.  

World No. 23 HS Prannoy had justified the selectors decision to pick directly in the squad by winning both the deciding rubbers and remained undefeated, especially the second against Rasmus Gemke of Denmark despite hurting his ankle in the opening game.
He was declared fit to play the fifth rubber again in the final but the likes of Lakshya Sen, the men’s doubles combination of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty and Kidambi Srikanth ensured that he could just put his foot up and enjoy the triumph.

Given Indonesia’s doubles prowess, it was important for Sen to give them a winning start and the World Championships bronze medallist did just that as he fought from a game down to beat Anthony Ginting 8-21, 21-17, 21-16 in an hour and five minutes.
The Olympic bronze medallist ran riots from a favourable side as he clinched 12 straight points on either side of the mid-game interval to draw first blood.
