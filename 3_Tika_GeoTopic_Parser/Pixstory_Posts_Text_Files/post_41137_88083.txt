According to a new University of Michigan study antiracist and feminist movements frequently fail to campaign for the rights of Black women who are less likely than white women to be recognised as typical women and perceived similarly to Black males Stewart Coles has talked about this issue at length They point out how black women even though they endure a unique combination of both forms of discrimination at the same time black women are frequently neglected in discussions about racism and sexism A normal woman was thought to resemble a typical white woman far more than a typical Black woman Black women and men were also thought to be more similar to one another than white women and men Coles rightly pointed out that that the operative word in defining how similar to other groups Black women are is more Black and less women The absence of distinction between Black women and Black men may explain why Black women and Black men experience equal rates of racial disparities in traffic stops and arrests while antiracist movements frequently target Black men in the fight against police brutality According to previous studies Blackness is connected with masculinity which leads to mistakes when defining Black women s gender or recognising their appearance According to other studies Black women and girls are more likely to feel threatened and in danger than white women and girls Feminist movements that focus solely on issues that impact white women without addressing racialized sexism according to Coles disregard the concerns of Black women who are subjected to higher rates of police brutality including sexual violence Therefore it is high time that feminist and anti racist groups should include Black women in leadership capacities and push for their rights
