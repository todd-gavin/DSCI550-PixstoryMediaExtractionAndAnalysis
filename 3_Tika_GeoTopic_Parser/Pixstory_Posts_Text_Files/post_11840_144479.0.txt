What people think a failed IVF cycle is
like:
You're sad because you're not pregnant.

What A Failed IVF Cycle Is Really Like:
you're grieving the loss of an embryo and the loss of the future you were planning. 

you feel unsure if you're even allowed to grieve because this is a loss you and no one you
know has experienced. you feel isolated because no one you know understands what you're going through. you're even more frustrated and confused than you were before
IVF. 

you feel lost, hopeless, angry, and sad all while having to decide if you should try again.
