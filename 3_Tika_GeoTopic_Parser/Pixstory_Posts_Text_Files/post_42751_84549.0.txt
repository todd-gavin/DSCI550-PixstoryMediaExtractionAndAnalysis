Singing out loud, our chest is such a song- Monster. How clearly can one resonate with its deeper meaning! As today's youth, we are many a times doubted, insulted, critiqued, screamed at, even before we can clearly express ourselves. It's like one small mistake, and BAM, it's all over!

But is it? I don't think so. We as humans are so much capable! We're no monsters if we get caught up in our mistakes, so as long as we are taking responsibility for it, and accounting it to rectifying and learning from it as a lesson. 

Head down and listen to this song if you too feel discouraged sometimes for making mistakes and not being given the space to learn and unlearn. 

Let us grow and learn together!
