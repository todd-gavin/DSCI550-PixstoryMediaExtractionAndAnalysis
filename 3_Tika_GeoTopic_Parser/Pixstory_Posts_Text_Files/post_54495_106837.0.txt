While reality television may be escapism, Survivor highlights the pulse of socialization.

Since its premiere in 2000, Survivor has been a social experiment providing a window into the lives of how people live with each other amid social and physical challenges.

Players, however, are not disavowed from their lives outside of the game — who they are does not change. They’re not only battling each other for immunity, but players are also grappling with the ways in which social constructions of identity bleed into the game, like race.

If you look back at Survivor winners there is some racial diversity, however patterns remain and have often been pointed out by cast members. In Season 42, Episode 9, Drea Wheeler pointed out that Black players get voted off before white players which opened up a discussion about race.
In 1989, critical race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw gave a name to the experiences of injustice Black women are confronted with as they were often left out of policies meant to move justice forward for racialized people: intersectionality. The term addressed the ways in which Black women were oppressed by the dual identity of being a woman and being Black.

Since then, intersectionality has been expanded to other groups of people because it is “a way of thinking about identity and its relationship to power.” And when we think differently about relations of power, those who hold power begin to feel threatened as their power has been normalized through our engagement with socialization and the ways institutions and systems reproduce power. This is systemic racism.
