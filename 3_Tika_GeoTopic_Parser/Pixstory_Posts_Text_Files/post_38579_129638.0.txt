Casemiro is a beast in aerial duels, whether it maybe offensive or defensive, he does not shy away in jumping and vying for the ball. Casemiro has made 3.42 aerial duels per 90, ranking at 96 percentile, 


Goal Threat?


Along with 3 assists, the Brazilian has scored 1 goals.However during his 8 seasons at Real Madrid, Casemiro has scored 24 goals and has 16 assists to his name.The Brazilian has scored in 2575 minutes. It's very poor considering he should contribute more to goals.Casemiro has 1.2 shots per 90, while his goal scoring output has been 0.0 per 90. It's very poor, considering he had his best season in 2017/18 where he scored 5 goals. United will be hoping he could contribute offensively while taking care of defensive work.

Looking at his scout report, we can see that he fares in strength to vie for the ball, in passing he is very decent. However in speed he gets beaten. He needs to work on his speed, as Premier League is a fast game. There would be many speedsters. Casemiro needs to cope up with it.


Final Verdict


Casmiro has finally made his move to Manchester United. Hope it’ll be the end of the famed duo of Scott McTominay and Fred, often known as McFred. United are paying 60 mil plus 10 mil add ons. It can be considered too much for a 30 year old but we have seen 30 years setting it on fire in the European Leagues(Ibrahimovic,Ronaldo,Messi and co). 


So it’ll depend on how well he copes up to the rigor of the Premier League. But one thing is that United has put paper over the cracks, because after 2-3 years we will be in the market searching for a new young defensive midfielder.
