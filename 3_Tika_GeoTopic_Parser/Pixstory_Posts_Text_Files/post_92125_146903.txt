Near the hot sulphur Palm Springs reached only on Day due to late morning starts Godfrey miraculously found another water stream and filled up But it was never enough to last through the hot days By Day thirst forced his fussy resolve to drop Thereafter he would rush towards the river pool and fill his bottles forgetting the purification drops drink up and wet his hat or take a swim to cool down On this hike my worldly thoughts switched off and I was in full focus on the Canyon With each mindful step I engaged with the majestic Canyon her rocks loose beige sand her variety of earthy colours and her string of differently shaped river pools How does a sea shell end up in your belly How have you acquired these royal colours like your golden brown mountains black and grey rocks granite formations to pure white deep purple and sweet pink coloured stones And just how do you manage to sprout the greenest bushes with the yellowest and whitest flowers that stand out in a desert of sand Footprints in the sand guided our path My nephew Allistair who walked in front followed an ice block tray shaped shoe print for most of the route My mind wondered to who the wearer of this shoe was Was he young Was he an experienced hiker Did he enjoy the hike Or was he rushing through I assumed the ice block tray shoe print person perhaps wrongly so to be a man because of the size of the footprint We were four men and one woman who completed the hike which starts at the Hobas Nature Reserve and ends at Ais Ais Resort on Saturday September To be continued
