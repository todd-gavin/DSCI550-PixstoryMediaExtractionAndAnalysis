This person is making no sense to me except the understandable rant at something which cant be justified in a secular country I think prohibition on wearing any visible form of expression of political philosophical or religious beliefs in the workplace or school or college is in tandem with the secular need to present a neutral image Any piece of clothing which does not expose the face completely is a security risk Therefore hijab should be completely banned from public places like hotels airports or wherever People should be able to practice their religion in the confines of their houses or religious places mosques etc
