Justice Stephen Breyer heard about two hours of arguments in a case affecting a Native American tribal authority in Oklahoma that was the last one on the court’s calendar for its nine-month term.

Breyer, at 83 the oldest of the nine justices, declared in January he would retire when the court begins its summer recess, typically at the end of June after all the pending rulings are issued.

Chief Justice John Roberts delivered an emotional note to the 83-year-old justice, saying the justices “leave the courtroom with a deep appreciation for the privilege of sharing this bench with him.” 

Breyer has served on the Supreme Court since 1994, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton. He announced his impending retirement in January following months of speculation about when he would step down, as the liberal-leaning justice came under heavy pressure from many Democrats to clear the way for a new justice while the party controlled both the White House and Senate. “Justice Breyer has worked tirelessly to give faith to the notion that the law exists to help the people,” President Joe Biden said in a speech announcing Breyer’s retirement, adding the justice “has been everything his country could have asked of him.”

He is to be followed by Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose historic confirmation will make her the first Black woman to sit on the supreme court.
