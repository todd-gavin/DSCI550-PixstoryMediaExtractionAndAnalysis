The emergence of communist China continues .....

It turned what would have been a decisive victory for the Nationalists into a strategic defeat. The Nationalist advance lost momentum and could never manage to reach Harbin. Three years of bitter fighting (1946-49) in Manchuria followed, after two years of which the Communists captured Mukden (today's Shenyang), the key to the control of Manchuria. The Communist PLA then turned south and in quick succession captured Beijing, Tientsin, Nanking, and Shanghai (1949). The Nationalist Army was completely beaten in spite of all the American help, and driven southward right off the mainland to Taiwan. The Communist Red Army now controlled all of Han China and Manchuria. 

The PRC which came into being on 1st October 1949 was as Chinese as any other previous Chinese government or imperial dynasty, and led by battle-experienced politico-military leaders with geo-strategic vision, like the Chairman, Mao Zedong, the newly-appointed Premier, Chou En-lai, and other leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. They were quick to consolidate their new empire and to acquire a stable buffer zone for the Han heartland. Having won control of their country through deeds, not words, and at the cost of many thousands killed in battle, they were not the kind of people to be impressed by either the 
feeble protests of pacifist religious leaders like the Tibetan Dalai Lama and his government, or by the Western-educated lawyer leader of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. Thus began Tibet’s and India’s problems with the Chinese leadership.
