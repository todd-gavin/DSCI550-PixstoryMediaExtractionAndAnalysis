The IBA supported the IOC recommendation for the participation of boxers and competition officials (including referees and judges) from the IBA's national federations of Russia and Belarus, while denouncing the breach of the Olympic Truce and military activity against Ukraine.

"As a result, they will not be invited or permitted to compete in international boxing tournaments." They will only be allowed to participate as neutral athletes if this is not practicable on short notice due to organisational or legal concerns. "This judgement will take effect immediately," according to an official statement.
In accordance with the IOC's proposal, the Board also approved the cancellation of international competitions scheduled for Russia and Belarus this year. These choices will be revisited frequently.
