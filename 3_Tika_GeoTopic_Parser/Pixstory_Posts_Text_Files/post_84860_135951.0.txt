Newly promoted Premier League side Nottingham Forest have announced the signing of experienced defender Willy Boly from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final hours of deadline day. This is their second big signing in the summer transfer window after Jesse Lingard. They have undoubtedly made a mark in the league so far at least as far as transfers are concerned. 
The Reds announced the signing of the Ivory Coast international today through a post on their social media handles and a club statement on their official site. 
Willy Boly is a Clairef youth academy product and he spent the fair share of the early days of his career in France. He made his move to AJ Auxerre in 2009 at an age of just 18. He played for Portuguese clubs SC Braga and Porto before making his big move to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2018. 
He quickly helped them in being promoted to the Premier League and has been a vital cog in their team ever since. 
Nottingham Forest will only be the second English club that he plays for. He has signed a 2-year deal with the club that will keep him at Nottingham till June 30, 2024. 
"I'm very excited to have a new adventure with this club," said Boly in his first interview as a Nottingham player. 
"I spoke to Morgan Gibbs-White [former team-mate at Wolves] before I came and I'd seen the spirit of the team and he said I'd love it because it is a big club - the fans and everyone wants to go in the same direction.
"I watched the game against Tottenham and the spirit of the team really impressed me. I was listening to the fans in that game and they were unbelievable."
Nottingham Forest will play their next match against Bournemouth and the 31-year old will definitely look to make his debut in that match.
