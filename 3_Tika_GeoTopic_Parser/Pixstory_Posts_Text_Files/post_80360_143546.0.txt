#5 Zoumana Camara
Camara athleticism was unmatchable at PSG; despite playing at his 35, he was the first-choice player at PSG. His impact was immense at the back and regarded as the heart of PSG defense. In addition, Camara was intimidating because of his physic and dreadful defender. 
He contributed to PSG with his rock-solid defensive ability and aided them to three Ligue titles in his time at PGS, featuring in 153 games for PSG. 
#4 Bernard Mendy 
Mendy was a big fan of PSG and ultimately joined the club, but his lack of experience resulted in him being loaned to Premier League club Wolves. However, with the arrival of the new manager at PSG, Mendy was given an opportunity, and the player did not fail to impress the manager. 
He was the club's first-choice player and played one of the best seasons at PSG. His performance saw him getting a call from the national team. After seven years and appearing in 238 games, Mendy left the club. 
#3 Presnel Kimpembe
Kimpembe had a positive development through PSG youth academy, and he was later called up by the senior team. He is physically strong and makes accurate tackles; he is agile and pacy as well. This made him an imperative player at the club. He played alongside Marquinhos and Thiago Silva. 
Kimpembe has always been PSG's priority in defense, and his consistency has aided PSG in its backline. So far, he has starred in 229 matches and won six Ligue 1 titles.
