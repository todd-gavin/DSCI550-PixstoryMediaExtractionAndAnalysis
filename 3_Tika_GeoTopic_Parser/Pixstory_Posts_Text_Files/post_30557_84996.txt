The International Paralympic Committee has decided to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Beijing Winter Paralympics which start tomorrow This is how President Andrew Parsons commented on the Committee&#39;s decision We feel very sorry for the athletes from the excluded countries You are victims of the actions of your governments At the base of the decision the threat of many nations not to participate in the competitions in case of failure to exclude Russians and Belarusians Dmitry Peskov Kremlin spokesman harshly criticized this decision This decidedly monstrous situation This is obviously a shame for the International Paralympic Committee as I cannot find other words to describe it
