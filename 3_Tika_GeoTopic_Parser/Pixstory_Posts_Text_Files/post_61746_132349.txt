 It simply means spending time with yourself and knowing the actual self There is no clear definition of spirituality as I believe Everyone finds his her own meaning to it because it is not about any known God or religion It is about soul the spirit one that is unique to every living being You can only be spiritual when you know yourself And knowing your spirit is a very long journey To me being spiritual is living life to the fullest finding joy in every moment giving respect to every being be it plant animal or human on this planet and spending time knowing yourself your purpose and the meaning of I I feel the most spiritual close to my soul when I feel the sameness of other souls around me when I write poetry when I listen to music when I dance or when I watch stars on clear nights I feel connected from spirit to the larger spirit I feel as a part of this universe which has no end to it These are just my thoughts so please forgive me if you it doesn t help you get the answer
