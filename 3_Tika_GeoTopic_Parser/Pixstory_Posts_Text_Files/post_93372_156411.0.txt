Hey, I Aishwarya
I love to do alot of creative things and strp out to my comfort zone to try innovative things. 
I am a person who believes in karma things alot, like jaisa tum karoge waisa paoge, that's why i don't hurt people even by mistake and just want to do good things to them, to make them happy. 
I still remember, I usually don't help others because of my stubborn behaviour. But one day, when I was in 6th standard, my partner forget her geometry box and she needs a pen.
Without thinking a single minute, I gave her my pen and the feeling which comes after that, it's super amazing. I can't even explain that !
Other than that, when I cut to close to my hard time , rather than thinking about living in the past. I think about how to sort that things. 
I used to respect others feelings first rather than mine.
Last but the most important thing, I believe in god. Whenever I go through with my tough time.
That's a little introduction about me !
