ligter three years at Parc des Princes, the Senegalese midfielder has moved back to his former club in England.
Idrissa Gueye has officially been acquired by Premier League team Everton from Paris Saint-Germain. The two-year deal means the Senegal international will play for the Goodison Park club till the end of June 2024.
According to estimates in French media, PSG might anticipate receiving a price of around 10 million euros ($9.9m). Gueye made his debut for the Toffees in 2016 after moving from Aston Villa, but three years later, for a cost of Â£30 million, he made the transition to Parc de Princes.
The Senegal midfielder returned to Merseyside after three years at Everton, where he made 108 appearances and proved himself as among the Premier League's finest defensive midfielders. Gueye won two league championships, four domestic cups, and lost to Bayern in the 2020 final of the Champions League while playing for Paris Saint-Germain after leaving Goodison Park in July 2019.
The African great says in his first interview that he is happy to be back and that he would offer his "soul" to help Frank Lampard's team succeed. "Returning home is the best feeling there is," the international from Senegal stated on the team's website.
"I'm thrilled to help out and put in a lot of effort once more at Everton. I'll sacrifice my soul for this group. 
"The stadium has a fantastic atmosphere, and each individual is like a family member."
The manager of Everton, Frank Lampard, continued, "We are excited to have a player of Idrissa's caliber and experience join the group. We've been keen to expand our alternatives in the middle of the field, and his skills will unquestionably help the team."
The Toffees haven't done their summer spending, though; a deal for James Garner of Manchester United is also nearly finalized and is anticipated to be confirmed prior to the deadline.
