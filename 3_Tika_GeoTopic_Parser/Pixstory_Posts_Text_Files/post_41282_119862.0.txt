Throughout human history, people and cultures all over the world have celebrated rain and it’s life-giving power. All life is dependent on rain, and rain is what keeps our world green and fresh and beautiful. Rain is no less important today than it has been in the past, and now people around the world have Rain Day, a day to celebrate all things wet and wonderful.

You don’t have to be a farmer with your eye on the latest batch of crops to be concerned with rain, and there are many things the ordinary person can do to celebrate. 

If you’re lucky enough to be somewhere where it rains on Rain Day, you can head outside to dance, sing, or just walk in the rain. If it doesn’t happen to be raining, you can serve up a delicious meal of fresh greens and other things that depend on the rain to grow, and reflect on how lucky we are to live in a rainy world.
