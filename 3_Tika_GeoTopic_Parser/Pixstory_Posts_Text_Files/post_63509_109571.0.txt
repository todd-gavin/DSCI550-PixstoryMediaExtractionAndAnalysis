Hello Everyone!
So here I am today with my next post!
I wanted to share some tips that I learnt about communication. 
1. Don't slouch and make sure to keep eye contact but don't be too intimidating at the same time.
2. Stay confident and express yourself such that they find your conversation important.
3. Focus on Non verbal communication as well. 
4. Be Yourself and speak comfortably.
5. Respect the time of others.
That's all from my side!
I hope it helps.:-))
Bye! ðŸ˜Š
