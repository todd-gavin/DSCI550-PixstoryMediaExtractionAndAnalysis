Cristiano Ronaldo joined Manchester United for £12.24 million from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, a
then-record transfer cost for a youngster. He was also the club's first-ever signing from Portugal.

During his career at Manchester United, he won three Premier League titles and a Champions
League trophy. While at the club, he also earned his first Ballon d'Or award.

Ronaldo debuted for the club against Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League opening on
August 16, 2003. He entered the game as a substitute in the 61st minute, replacing Nicky Butt.

The Red Devils won 4-0 thanks to a brace from Ryan Giggs, as well as goals from Ruud van
Nistelrooy and Paul Scholes.

Let's take a look at the players that were on the pitch with Ronaldo on his Manchester United
debut and where they are now.

Ruud van Nistelrooy – ST

In 2001, the iconic Dutch forward joined the Red Devils from PSV, where he spent five seasons
before moving to Real Madrid in 2006. Ruud van Nistelrooy spent the final two seasons of his
professional career with Hamburg and Malaga, respectively, before retiring in 2012.

Between 2014 and 2016, Nistelrooy served as the Netherlands' assistant coach. In 2018, he
became the head coach of PSV U19, but in 2019 he returned to the national team as an
assistant coach. He was most recently seen as Frank de Boer's assistant on the Dutch bench at
Euro 2020.

Ryan Giggs is the most capped Manchester United player of all time.

After David Moyes was fired, Giggs was named player-cum-interim manager of Manchester
United for the final four games of the 2013-14 season. In addition, it was his final season as a
professional football player. 

Following his retirement, he immediately became Louis van Gaal's
assistant manager, a post he held for the next two seasons.Giggs was named manager of the Wales national team in 2018, a position he left in April 2021
owing to personal circumstances.
