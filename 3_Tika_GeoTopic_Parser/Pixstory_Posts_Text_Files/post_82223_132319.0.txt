Sharad has arrived and the countdown to Maa Durga's arrival has started in my heart. 
When the sky turns a deep azure and cotton-like clouds are floating, when the air is heavy with the fragrant scent of Parijat and lush green fields wear a white cloak of Kans grass, is when you know Sharad has arrived in Bengal. 
Sharad is the autumn season according to the Hindu Calendar and it holds a special place in every Bengali's heart. Owing to the fact that this is the sign that Durga Puja is around the corner and soon we would find ourselves in intense celebration over Goddess Durga's return to the mortal realm. 
The sight of the white feathery tips of Kans over verdant fields and deep blue sky has never once failed to fill my heart with childish delight. As soon as September starts, I always keep an eye out while travelling hoping to catch a glimpse of Kans. Even a single speck would put a smile on my face. As it did today, on the way to my college, St. Xavier's.
