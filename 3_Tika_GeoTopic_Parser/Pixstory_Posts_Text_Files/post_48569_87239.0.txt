Every being deserves to live. It is kind of gross to imply that it is one individual's right to murder a baby. It's saddening and disheartening how many people, especially women, have started falling for this propaganda without seeing the consequences of it. Motherhood is a blessing and to refuse it when God has given us the opportunity to experience it is not only selfish but sinful. How can one advocate for the rights of one individual and say that innocent babies should be killed in the womb, in the same breath? It is hypocritical and shameful. Modern society has gotten an entirely wrong idea of women empowerment and the ones that are paying the cost of it are innocent little babies.

To add to that we cannot advocate for women's rights without taking into consideration the effects that abortion has on the mother. PAS - Post Abortion Syndrome - is one of the many consequences that killing a child in the womb has on a woman. Often times, it leads to depression in women and sometimes even suicide. It is ignorant and insensitive to call for abortion laws despite all these ill effects that they can have on the society. Instead, what we should be focusing on is better healthcare and childcare which do not force mothers to commit this heartbreaking sin. Women should be educated more about their roots and roles to keep the balance in society.
