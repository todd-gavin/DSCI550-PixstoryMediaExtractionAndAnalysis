The USA faces Morocco today in the last game in Group A. The is at Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Goa. It will be refereed by Uruguayan referee Anahi Fernandez. Team USA have not yet mathematically secured qualification even after a resounding victory against India was followed by a score draw with Brazil. After an 8-0 demolition of India on opening day, the USA braved a rough battle against Brazil where their only goal came from debutant Nicollete Kiorpes. Brazilian keeper Leilane was instrumental in the game and USA might have won but for her efforts. The USA have a 7-goal advantage over Brazil so a victory today will most likely secure the top place in the group and firmly establish their title credentials in the World Cup. Brazil face India in the other game in the group today. 
The USA are currently the top scorers at the World Cup with nine goals. Germany have the second most with eight. Group A has relatively little potential for an upset on Matchday 3 but if Morocco are able to secure a win, they would be able to qualify in USA’s place. 
Morocco have 3 points after a 3-0 defeat of India on Matchday 2. They retain a faint hope of qualification to the quarterfinals if India is able to defeat Brazil in the other game. This is somewhat unlikely so Morocco will be playing for pride in this match which will probably be their last at their first ever world cup at this level.  In group B it looks like that Germany will finish first and Nigeria will finish second. Team USA will face Nigeria in the quarterfinals if they are able to secure the top spot today.
