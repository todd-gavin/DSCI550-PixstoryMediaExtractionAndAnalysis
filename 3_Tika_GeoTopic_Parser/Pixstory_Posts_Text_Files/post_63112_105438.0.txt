"India is a critical market for us, and our local team has done a fantastic job establishing Puma as the country's leading sports brand." We decided to launch the app initially in India because it is a very digitally savvy region with strong eCommerce penetration. "During the year, it will be rolled out globally," stated PUMA CEO Bjrn Gulden. 

With this decision, the corporation stated that it has restarted its investment in India as a high-priority market. Puma's revenue in India for the fiscal year ending December 2021 was Rs 2,044 crore, up 68.2 percent from the previous year. Last year, the brand launched 51 new locations, bringing the total number of locations to 450.
