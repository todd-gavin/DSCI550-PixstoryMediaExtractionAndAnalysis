I want to start off by looking at Marty of what we see from him in the first few episodes. He looks like  just a regular type dude. He's hard-working loves his wife, is at times overprotective of his daughters, is religious and hates the way the world is. He tries to help an underage prostitute by giving her money to start a new life, do something else even though he does all these good things he still does his fair share of bad things. He's an adulterer, he doesn't pay his wife and daughters the attention they need or deserve and can be a violent alcoholic. He is someone who doesn't have a full understanding of the world around him nor does he understand who he really is, despite both of these he still tries to change the world and to make it a better place when he really should at least at first be focusing on himself and his family and what is really important. In one scene he walks in on his daughters playing with dolls in a rather suggestive way instead of confronting the problem he chooses to walk away, later after his daughter Audrey draws a series of sexual pictures in school he again chooses not to confront the problem. Soon this problem starts to escalate and years later when Audrey has a less than ideal sexual encounter, a deputy found her parked in a car with two boys, he becomes violent and upset with her. Even though he's part of the problem for not doing anything earlier, this storyline with his daughter acts as a great microcosm of his entire character. He's willing to do the least amount of work required to get something done. He never looks closer into anything, he just accepts what is presented to him, that changes when he is taken out of his comfort zone once his wife leaves him and once he leaves the force he stops seeing everything so cut and dry he starts to look closer and explores more but most importantly he finds out who he really is.
