Climate Change has been plaguing the environment for a long time now. The effects of climate change are very clearly visible around us.The ocean level is rising, glaciers are melting, CO2 in the air is increasing, forested areas are reducing, and the water cycle is getting extensively disrupted. Moreover, it is estimated that if this change keeps on going then many species of plants and animals will get extinct. In the absence of immediate and solid action, the loss to the environment will be irreparable.
