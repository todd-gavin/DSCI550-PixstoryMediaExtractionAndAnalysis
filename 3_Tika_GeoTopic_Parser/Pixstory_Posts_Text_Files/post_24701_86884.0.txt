Lewandowski scores his 29th goal in 26 games. The lead reduces to 10 points between second placed Dortmund after consecutive draws. 



GOAL MACHINE CONTINUES TO FIRE


Against the run of play, Hoffenheim took the lead in the 32nd minute. Raum set up the chance with an excellent cross, which Baumgartner scored with an acrobatically stretched tap. This was Austrian's 6th goal of the season in 22 matches. As usual, Bayern's reply was Lewandowski, as he rose up high in front of the goal, near the 6 yard mark for a Kimmich corner just before the half time break.


In the match, Bayern had at least 10 chances to score. Hoffenheim goalkeeper Boumann had a big role in denying on many occasions (6 saves) and Gnabry hitting the post. This was Hoffenheim's 5th match without a loss, winning 4 of them. They are 5th in the table with 44 points from 26 games. 



THE NEW FORMATION


In the last 2 matches, Bayern have been using a new 1-3-2-4-1, a more attacking version of their previous formation 1-4-2-3-1. They thrashed Salzburg 7-1 using the formation, which gives more options in attacking third. 


3-2-4-1 is a very unusual formation, where Bayern Uses Sule, Pavard and Hernandez at the back and Musiala and Kimmich as central defensive midfielders. Nagelsmann believes he can use the brilliant individual talent he has to keep the ball and defend using the back 5 to attack more. They will be hoping to use this in the champions league more and clinch the title again.
