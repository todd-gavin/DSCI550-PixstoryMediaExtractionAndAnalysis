Styled to resemble a Chinese imperial palace, Hong Kong’s boat-like Jumbo Floating Restaurant has been towed away by the pandemic, leaving a legacy of hosting unnecessarily idolized figures like Tom Cruise and Queen Elizabeth II.

In the 46 years of its establishment at the Aberdeen Harbour, Jumbo Floating Restaurant has welcomed over 30 million guests, filling their cravings of Cantonese cuisine and seafood dishes.

“The history of Hong Kong’s floating restaurants can be traced back to the 1920s. These restaurants, which were mainly near Wu Nam Street in Aberdeen Harbour before land reclamation in 1978, were initially run by boat-dwelling Tanka people. They served Chinese and seafood dishes mainly for rich businessmen, and occasionally for Tanka’s birthdays and wedding banquets. You needed a reservation in those days, and no walk-ins were entertained,” South China Morning Post reports.

Jumbo Floating Restaurant is a pop culture icon appearing in several films including The James Bond’s Man With the Golden Gun (1974), Jackie Chan's The Protector (1985), The God of Cookery (1996), Godzilla vs Destroyah, Infernal Affairs II, Contagion (2011) and many others.

I’ve never eaten at the Jumbo Floating Restaurant, but still feel the loss of a future that can no longer be made. Farewell, Jumbo Floating Restaurant. I will remember you for reminding me to live through every moment, rather than letting it pass by the way I do now.
