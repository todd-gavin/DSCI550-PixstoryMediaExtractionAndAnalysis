Paul Brunton's journey in quest of serenity; the inner silence of a higher state of meditation is chronicled in this book. It's a book full of wisdom and insight, as he combines stunning, evocative descriptions of a period spent surrounded by breathtaking beauty with his daily observations on life and Nature. a journey taken by a guy in search of spiritual serenity, which he eventually obtains. The book's insights on isolation, nature, meditation, and the importance of seclusion in self-discovery were all quite interesting.

I wouldn't particularly call it Brunton's best but it is a good read. There were parts where I was uncomfortable as a reader because his beliefs on a lot of things are dated and are problematic in today's world but if we can look past that, it's a good book and if you wanna know about ths Himalayas, it might be the one for you.
