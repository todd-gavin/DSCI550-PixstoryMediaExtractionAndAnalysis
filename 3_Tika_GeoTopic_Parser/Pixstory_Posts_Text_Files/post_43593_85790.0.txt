Sweet Home was one of the most popular Korean shows to premiere on Netflix in 2020. Combining a horror theme with a somewhat timely premise, the Webtoon adaptation was noted for its incredible special effects, which pushed the series to become the first South Korean TV show to break into Netflix's Top 10.
Based on the Korean Webtoon by Kim Kan-bi and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home is based around the life of Cha Hyun-soo. Having recently lost his family in a tragic accident, Cha moves into an apartment in an attempt to begin a new life. This is all quickly upended, however, following the announcement of a mysterious virus.

This virus is revealed to be turning people into monsters based on their desires, with even the most unassuming people being monstrous beasts in disguise. Cha and those stuck with him in his apartment complex must soon learn who among them is a monster, and survive when they make their discovery. Likewise, many of them begin exhibiting incredible powers of their own, which aid them against the monsters and make others convinced that they are the enemy.
