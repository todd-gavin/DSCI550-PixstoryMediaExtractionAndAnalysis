An avid reader, a good listener and a creative soul overall. But, if I've to describe myself in just one word - It'll be a Nature lover . That's right, the amount of peace and solace I get when I'm amidst the lush-green nature can't be described in some mere words. I even love capturing the nature either in the form of photographs or in the form of paintings. Apart from that , I'm an ambivert person, implying it takes time for me to get comfortable with a person I've met for the first time and on the same hand I'm the life of the group of people I'm comfortable with. I play ukulele , can sing bearable enough and love to paint !
