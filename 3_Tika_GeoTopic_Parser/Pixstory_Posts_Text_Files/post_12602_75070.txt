Four points to bear in mind when looking into the link between social media and mental health Follow trustworthy sources academic journals or trusted outlets You shouldn t have to play the detective every time you see a scientific claim Fortunately if your sources are reputable most of the work is being done for you Avoid clickbait sounding headlines Good reporting would never trade accuracy for the prospect of attracting your attention Also be cautious if an article uses words that a scientist especially one in the social or clinical sciences would never use such as that something is a fact or that they proved something Be wary of ideological content and your own biases Ask yourself Do I want this to be true or the opposite If so then be extra careful when assessing the information Ask an expert friend if you have one If you re in doubt about the scientific aspects of a claim and you re not sure how to assess it think of someone you know that might be able to help such as someone that majored in that field in college e g biosciences for COVID studies or psychology for mental health studies
