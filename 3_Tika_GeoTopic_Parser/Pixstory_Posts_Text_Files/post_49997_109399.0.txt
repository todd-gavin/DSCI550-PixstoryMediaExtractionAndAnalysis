since the feeling is first by 
e.e Cummings

since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world
my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don’t cry
– the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids’ flutter which says
we are for each other; then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life’s not a paragraph
And death i think is no parenthesis

It is a love poem that commemorates the joys of romance. The speaker also demonstrates that emotions tend to outweigh thoughts and it doesn't need any logic or reason. 

The poem exemplifies Cummings's poetic style, which often plays with standard grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. Interestingly enough, the poem's speaker claims that analyzing life like a piece of syntax—breaking down its grammar and rules—keeps people from being present in life and fully understanding things like love.

He questions whether people feel emotions before anything else then why would anyone bother to fixate on small, insignificant rules and details that will pale in comparison to the feeling of a good kiss? He says a life of love is better than one of knowledge. He also signifies that unlike a parenthesis death lasts forever. He hence advises living life to the fullest.
