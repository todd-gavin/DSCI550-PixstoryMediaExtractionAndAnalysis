Putting an end to all the rumours, BJP led NDA has finally chosen former Jharkhand governor Draupadi Murmu as the partyâ€™s pick for the upcoming Presidential elections on a day when the Opposition also chose Yashwant Sinha as its candidate. 

The decision was taken at the BJP's parliamentary board meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi.

Addressing the press conference, BJP president JP Nadda said that "After extensive discussions with the NDA allies, it was felt that the Presidential candidate should come from the eastern part of India and should be a woman tribal candidate".

If elected, the 64- year old will be the first tribal woman to become the President of India.

It is worth noting that, Ms Murmu, 64, was a strong contender for the post before the 2017 presidential elections. But on the occasion, then Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind, a Dalit, was named as the government's candidate for the post.

The first woman Governor of Jharkhand, Draupadi Murmu started her political career as a councilor, later becoming the Vice-Chairperson of Rairangpur National Advisory Council.

A two-time BJP legislator from Odisha, Ms Murmu was a minister in the Naveen Patnaik cabinet when the Biju Janata Dal or BJD ruled the state with the support of BJP.
