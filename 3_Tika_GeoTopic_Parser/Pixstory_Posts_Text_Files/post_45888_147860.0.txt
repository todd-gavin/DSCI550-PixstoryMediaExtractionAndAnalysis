Around the world, hunting has led to the extinction of several animal species, including the great auk and the Tasmanian tiger. Even though hunting is legal in many wildlife refuges, national forests, state parks, and other public lands, less than 4% of Americans—or 13.7 million people—hunt. Every year, about 40% of hunters kill and injure millions of animals on public lands, and according to some estimates, poachers also kill an equal number of creatures. When animals are hurt by hunters but not killed, they frequently die slowly and in agony. Of the 22 deer that had been shot using "conventional archery equipment," according to a study of 80 radio-collared white-tailed deer, 11 were injured but were not found by hunters. Twenty percent of injured foxes by hunters are shot once again. Only 10% of them succeed in escaping, but one veterinarian claims that "starvation is a likely end" for them. Moreover, hunting damages families and throws off migratory and hibernation cycles. Hunting may completely destroy communities for creatures like wolves, who form close-knit family groupings and mate for life. Hunted animals' normal eating habits are severely compromised by the stress they experience, which makes it difficult for them to store the fat and energy they need to survive the winter. This stress is brought on by fear, as well as the unavoidable loud noises and other commotion that hunters cause.Source: PETA
