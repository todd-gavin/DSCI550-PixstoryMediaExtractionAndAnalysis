The historic town of Bijbehara, raised on the banks of the Jhelum, is 49 kilometres from Srinagar and is renowned for the intricate trellis work and blanket making. It was formerly known as Vijaya Para, the City of Victory. This city is covered in several ziarats and temples. The burial and pond of Lal Ded, the most renowned Kashmiri mystic poetess, is located near this town. Both Hindus and Muslims honour her by pouring the first milk of their cows into the pond. The pond's water then retains the shape of the pitcher from which the milk was poured, as if in response to the offering. Bijbehara is also known as the town of Chinars; during the Mughal era, trees were specially transported from Iran to mark this town as the entrance to the Kashmir Valley.
