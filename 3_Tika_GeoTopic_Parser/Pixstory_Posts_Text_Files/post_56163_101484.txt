 Monkeypox is spreading in Europe and in the UK had a sudden increase Now the total number of cases in the UK is excluded the ones that went undetected Health Secretary Sajid Javid said This morning I updated G health ministers on what we know so far Most cases are mild and I can confirm we have procured further doses of vaccines that are effective against monkeypox This viral infection is very similar to smallpox and causes mild illness people tend to recover within a few weeks and the risk is considered low Dr Susan Hopkins the UKHSA s chief medical adviser said We anticipated that further cases would be detected through our active case finding with NHS services and heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals We expect this increase to continue in the coming days and for more cases to be identified in the wider community Alongside this we are receiving reports of further cases being identified in other countries globally The similarities with smallpox help it to be treated with smallpox data suggest that the vaccine is at least effective in preventing the virus It is spread by rodents and gets easily transmitted when a person comes into contact with the virus from an animal human or materials contaminated with the virus The virus enters the body through cuts and mucous membrane human to human transmission is thought to occur primarily through large respiratory droplets Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet so prolonged face to face contact is required Other human to human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material and indirect contact with lesion material such as through contaminated clothing or linens Initial symptoms constitute fever headache muscle aches backache swollen lymph nodes chills and exhaustion A rash can develop often starting on the face and then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals The rash undergoes modifications in different stages and can look like chickenpox or syphilis before finally forming a scab which later falls off It is said to be non lethal still take necessary precautions as prevention is always better than cure Sources Sky News CDC
