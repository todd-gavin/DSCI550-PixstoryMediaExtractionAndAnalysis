Leander Dendoncker has joined Aston Villa from Premier League outfit Wolverhampton Wanderers. 

On deadline day, a price was agreed upon for the footballer to go across the Midlands. Aston Villa has not verified its price, despite prior rumors that said it was for Â£13 million. The duration of Dendoncker's contract has not yet been announced by Aston Villa. But it is certain that he will don the club's number 32 jersey. Dendoncker joins Aston Villa after playing for Wolves more than 150 times over the course of four whole seasons and the current campaign.

Dendoncker emphasized that playing at Villa Park always has a positive vibe. Of course, I've scored versus you guys before, and perhaps now I can score for us. Dendoncker, who had previously been a consistent starter for Wolves under the former manager Nuno Espirito Santo, has slipped down the hierarchy pyramid under Bruno Lage.

Dendoncker, who can also line up in a back three, started Wolves' opening two Premier League contests before coming off the bench for their following two games. He transferred from Belgian club Anderlecht to Wolves in August 2018 and has since made 159 appearances across all competitions, scoring 12 goals. This summer, Dendoncker has also been linked to Everton and Newcastle United. He will, however, be pursuing a Premier League career at Aston Villa.

After Wolves and Anderlecht in his home country before them, Dendoncker will represent Aston Villa as the third club in his career. He joins Boubacar Kamara as Steven Gerrard's second new midfielder in the current transfer window. Kamara was acquired earlier in the summer. Dendoncker can, of course, also play defense, which is another position Aston Villa has been wanting to bolster after Diego Carlos, a recent addition, sustained an injury. He should thus offer them top-notch coverage in a few crucial positions on their team.
