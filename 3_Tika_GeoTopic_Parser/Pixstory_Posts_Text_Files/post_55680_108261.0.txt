The Victorian government has announced the expansion of Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital, which will cost millions of dollars. 

As per Guardian, Health Minister Martin Foley announced the expansion earlier this morning at a news conference, which will include an expanded emergency department and a new 30-bed inpatient facility. 

The Andrews government's roughly $50 million investment is meant to boost the hospital's capacity, which is now seeing over 300 presentations every day. 

The investment, according to Foley, is to ensure that children and their parents can rely on the hospital in an emergency.

“A bigger and better Royal Children’s hospital will ensure Victorian kids continue to receive the world-class healthcare they deserve when they get sick or an emergency strikes.”
