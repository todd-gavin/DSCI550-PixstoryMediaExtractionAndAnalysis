Dear Valentine to be,

I hope you know that the love is so in the air right now. Soon you will know how I used to imagine myself in all the cute situations with you, without even knowing how you look or where you are. You will know that I used to sit and think to myself about how life will be when I will have the love of your life standing next to me and enjoying all the little things I love, together. 

And I know, one day, you are going to come into my life and adore me for everything that I am. The way I speak, the way I eat, the way my stomach folds when I sit, and even the way I laugh obnoxiously at little things. It will happen, for everybody has a soulmate. 

I know I will have someone so pure in my life that just being around you will automatically make me feel a million times better. When I will be in a relationship I will want to be comfortable enough, to be honest, and talk about everything, even the things that will make us uncomfortable or we will feel like it will hurt the other's feelings. Because nothing can be fixed if no one is aware there's a problem. So, we will communicate it all with each other.

But I also know that the man I will choose to be my partner will affect everything in My life: my mental health, my peace of mind, the love inside of me, my happiness, how I get through tragedies, my success, how my children will be raised, and so much more. So I will never step into a situation that will give me temporary happiness, so, I continue to choose to wait❤️
