By NewsDrum Desk Lucknow: India fell short by just two big hits in the first ODI against South Africa, said wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson who made an unbeaten 86 in a losing cause here.Chasing a stiff 250-run target in 40 overs in a rain-truncated game, the hosts lost by nine runs.Besides Samson, Shreyas Iyer (50) and Shardul Thakur (33) also played good hands but couldn't take India over the finishing line."I love spending time at the wicket, especially in India colours. We play to win the match. I fell short by just two shots -- one four and a six. I will try to make up for that in the next match but I am happy with my contribution," Samson said in the post-match press conference.Needing 30 runs off the last over, Samson hit Tabraiz Shamsi for one and three boundaries to garner 20 runs but it was not enough. He did not play a single ball in the 19th over, potentially proving to be the difference in the game."South Africa bowlers were bowling really well but Shamsi was going a little expensive so we thought we can target him. I knew he had one over left so if we needed 24 runs, I was confident that I could hit four sixes. So I was taking it deep. That was our plan," Samson said.With the city witnessing persistent rains for the last three days, the pitch was damp initially and offered movement for the bowlers."If you have noticed South Africa innings, you could see it was difficult to make runs with the new ball. After 15 overs (David) Miller and (Heinrich) Klaasen batted really well, it became easy."The ball wasn't moving. Batting became easy after 15-20 overs," Samson said.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/sports/fell-short-just-by-two-strokes-says-sanju-samson-98936.html
