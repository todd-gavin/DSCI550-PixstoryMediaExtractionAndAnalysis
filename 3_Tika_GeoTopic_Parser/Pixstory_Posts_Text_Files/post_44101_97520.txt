Mikel Arteta has hailed England boss Gareth Southgate for assisting Bukayo Saka in his recovery from his Euro penalty heartbreak After seeing his decisive kick saved in last summer s final against Italy Saka has stepped up to take and score crucial penalties in Arsenal s last two games an incident that resulted in the Arsenal star Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford who were also unsuccessful from the spot at Wembley receiving sickening online racist abuse Saka s willingness to put himself back on the situation reveals a lot about the year mental old s toughness according to Arteta The first two conversations I had with him were straight after the incident but I must say that Gareth Southgate was really helpful as well because he had Bukayo in his hands in that moment and they were really caring and really supportive of him so by the time he joined us he was already in a really good place and obviously he got his whole support and love and help in any way that he needed it to overcome that situation and then it is down to him his family and the people around him I think they were very important as well In the absence of Alexandre Lacazette Saka took over as Arsenal s most recent penalty taker placing himself in pole position to continue If someone has to take a penalty tomorrow Arteta believes Saka will do it again although it happened pretty organically in the Chelsea game Saka took it then Arsenal had another one the next game so hopefully Saka can keep putting the ball in the net
