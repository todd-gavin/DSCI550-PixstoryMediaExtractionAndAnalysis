The Congress is in the midst of a major problem about who would be the next chief minister of Rajasthan. In a display of protest, more than 90 Ashok Gehlot camp MLAs went to meet the Speaker and announced their intention to resign.
When asked whether their action might bring down the government, an MLA responded, "We want Ashok Gehlot as the Chief Minister," making it clear that they are hoping for either concessions from the Central leadership on the "one man, one post" issue or a Gehlot supporter to replace Sachin Pilot as the top position.
At a meeting earlier this evening, the 80+ Ashok Gehlot supporters brought up the subject of Sachin Pilot's uprising in 2020 and demanded that the Chief Minister come from people who had supported the administration at the time. After the meeting in MLA Shanti Dhariwal's house, they even adopted a resolution on that subject.
Sanyam Lodha, an independent MLA who was present at the meeting, asked how the government would function if the decision was not made in accordance with their preferences. Government will be overthrown.
After Rahul Gandhi urged that the one man, one post rule be followed, which would require Mr. Gehlot to quit his position as Chief Minister, Gehlot's supporters began to put pressure on him. He is the front-runner for the position of national president of the party, which is up for election on October 17.
Mr. Gehlot had resisted leaving the top position in Rajasthan for a very long time in order to keep his bitter rival Sachin Pilot out.
