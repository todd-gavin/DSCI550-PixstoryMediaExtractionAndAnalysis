One of the biggest confusions faced by college students is whether to go for higher studies or sit for campus placements. Honestly, this question will also have the most generic answer - "that it depends."

Admit it or not, but we all know that we all forci ourselves to go to college daily just to obtain that one degree which will land us a decent job. Now, if you are able to get such a job in your campus placement, then surely you should go for that. And, if you are really dying to get another degree, then you can certainly do that after 2-3 years- after you have gained a little corporate experience. (Here, I'm specifically talking about MBA- since a little experience does help to make the entrance smoother)

Now, if you aren't confident about placements yet and feel the need to get another degree, I believe you should go for higher studies. Some people pursue higher studies because they feel that they're not yet ready to take the responsibility of working 9-5, and that's alright. In the final days of college it's pretty normal to feel overwhelmed by the life that's waiting outside college. Pursuing higher studies serves like a gap year for job and gives one a chance to explore other fields too. 

Thus, there's nothing as "which is better among these two". It's just that you should do what you think is right.
