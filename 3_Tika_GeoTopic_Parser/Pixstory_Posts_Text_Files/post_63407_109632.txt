After the third wave driven by the omicron sub lineage BA peaked in end of January this year with over million cases per day there has been a small bump in the number of daily cases reported in the first fortnight of June and a slightly bigger increase in the last one week to touch over cases on June but the rate of increase has been small and restricted to a few states and some Major cities The rate of growth of active cases has also been low While the sun lineage BA is still the dominant strain in India BA and BA seem to be causing the new cases The small increase in testing in the past week could be a reason for the more cases reported The seven day average test positivity rate doubled from less than in early June to over by mid June and has been increasing incrementally since then to on June Increasing the number of daily tests will result in more detected But with a large percentage of the adult population fully vaccinated and a sizable percentage also infected the focus should be more on hospitalisation and deaths are not daily infections There has been a slight increase in hospitalisation in a few states but there is no cause for alarm However there has not been any increase in daily deaths The small bump in daily cases seen in a few states for the last three weeks therefore does not appear to mark the beginning of a new wave
