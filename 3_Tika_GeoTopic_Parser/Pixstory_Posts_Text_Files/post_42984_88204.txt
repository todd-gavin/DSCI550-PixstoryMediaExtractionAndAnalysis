My son Dr Abhijeet Barse had left India to work in USA He didn t understand what I was trying to do at first and went away to do his job because at that time our financial conditions weren t that good He got to know about the All India Rajiv Gandhi Memorial Jhopadpatti football tournament from the news our administration and management had been praised in the news He didn t know it was me who organised it he just knew it was someone from Maharashtra Later my daughter who was also in USA showed him an article in the news which mentioned me as the founder It was at this time he called me up and said that he wants to leave his job He wanted to work with me for some years and come back to India Currently he is the CEO of Slum Soccer He was the one that suggested this name One of the first things he did was develop a website of the organization He was the one who told me about the Homeless World Cup It was started in Europe the founders had started to help the street paper vendors who had drug addiction and from there it had grew to what it was It was just like our Jhopadh Pati football tournaments but on an international levels They had proper rules and had a shortened the playing field Only four players played on the ground at a time In Abhijeet told me that the organizers of the Homeless World Cup had invited me to attend the tournament in South Africa When I went there and talked to the founders they told me how I had formed this idea before them They told me that India s team should participate every year through Slum Soccer in the Homeless World Cup Since we have participated in every single Homeless World Cup It has helped the kids develop a lot These kids have never even been to big cities and through this tournament they have the opportunity to go abroad It completely changes their outlook about life
