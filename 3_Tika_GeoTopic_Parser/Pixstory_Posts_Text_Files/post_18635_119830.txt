The Rome derby will only be on the November weekend but the barbs have already begun between the Giallorossi and the Biancocelesti. If on the one hand Roma made a presentation in grand style for the new signing Dybala on an evening in which the favorite target was the Lazio on the other hand, President Lotito spoke outside the FIGC offices I didn&#39;t see Dybala&#39;s presentation and it didn&#39;t affect me I&#39;m used to dealing with facts I don&#39;t sell dreams but solid realities We don&#39;t collect Panini stickers we are not interested In the newspapers there has been a lot of talk about the presentation of Dybala at the Square Colosseum but Lotito also talks about the market for his Lazio Roma market from the front page Lazio have signed six players and maybe we will do other things on entry I am not a fan president but I am a fan president and I have to create the conditions for the club to have an increasingly rosy future Lotito brings results Lazio after Juve the club that has won the most
