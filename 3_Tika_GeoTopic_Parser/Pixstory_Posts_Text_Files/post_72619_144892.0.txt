Law must encourage inclusion and pluralism, and respect dissent for the society to survive and be stable, said Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud on Saturday.
The senior Supreme Court judge also said that technology is not just for the elite, but for all those for whom the delivery of justice is intended.
"Law is a very vital element in our society because our society can survive and be stable so long as law encourages inclusion and pluralism," said Justice Chandrachud, while speaking at the convocation ceremony of the National Law University, Odisha.
Addressing young lawyers and law students during the event, which was presided over by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Uday Umesh Lalit, justice Chandrachud spoke about how law "teaches us to reason and respect persons who do not agree with us".
"When we respect the fact that each of us has differing views, we respect those views. Law as a discipline brings us reason. We reason with each other, we don't physically wrestle with each other and we don't offload firearms when we are in conflict with each other," said the senior judge who is next in line to become CJI in November.
