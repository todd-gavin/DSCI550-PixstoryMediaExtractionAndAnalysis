How has Sports changed my life I am a better person today because sports have played such an important role in my life On and off the field I am stronger more disciplined and respectful and a better leader I have had so many great experiences through sports which have taught me life lessons and prepared me for the future I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet so many friends coaches and families that will forever have an impact on my life The memories of all the awesome trips and different experiences I have had will be with me for a lifetime Sports can help people aim for a better condition than the one they had during their childhood they can provide a path of growth where alternatives are not seen instilling purpose accomplishment and self esteem For me besides being a real life savior basketball was the first influencing factor that helped me grow my self confidence both on the courtand in real life
