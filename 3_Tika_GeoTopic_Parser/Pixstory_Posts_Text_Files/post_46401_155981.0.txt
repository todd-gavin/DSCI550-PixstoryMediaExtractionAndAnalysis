Even wondered why ? You crave for desserts-lose control - and eat more than you planned ? I’ll tell you why does that happen to you . Because sugar fuels every cell in the brain . Your brain also sees sugar as a reward , which makes you keep wanting more of it ! Why do you think you get the rush or kick after eating a simple bar of candy or chocolate ? Simple carbohydrate in it is quickly turned into glucose in your blood stream . Now your body needs to move glucose out of thes bloodstream and into your cells for energy . To do this , your pancreas make insulin , a hormone ! As a result the blood sugar level may drop suddenly leaving you searching for more sweets to regain the sugar high . This is how and why it exactly happens ! Tell me in notes what is the one thing you crave a lot and can’t eat just one ??
