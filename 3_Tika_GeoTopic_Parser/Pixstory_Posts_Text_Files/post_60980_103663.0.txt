No, I will not give an introduction of myself. What I do, What I am studying, my likes and dislikes, or any other questions. Because these are all a given, I could state them, and you would believe that all these attributes are 'me.' 
However, it won't be fun if I directly describe myself. Instead, I want people to guess and interpret who I am and what I do. So that explains the illustrations on the post.
But what I do like to point out is the 50% opacity background of a storybook. I guess what I'm trying to point out is my fondness for storytelling and my aim on this page: To listen and share stories.
