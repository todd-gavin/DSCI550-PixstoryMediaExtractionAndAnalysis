The cyclist Alejandro Valverde was discharged from hospital and returned home almost hours after the accident in Murcia The doctors found nothing serious, no bleeding or fractures but only several bruises that healed in a few days A lucky thing given what happened and that the police succeeded to reconstruct thanks to a motorcyclist who was passing by at that moment Thanks to the witness and the license plate of the car that he managed to capture, the forces of order stopped the hit-and-run driver who had fled after purposely running over the group of cyclists in which Valverde was there From what has been reconstructed it seems that the motorist overtook the cyclists in a dangerous way and when they complained he turned back, running over them and fleeing The police intercepted him and he could do nothing but confess As for Valverde how said he is fortunately well For years something like this could have made him stop instead he has already made it known that he wants to take part in the Vuelta of Spain which will start on August Then before hanging up his bike there is still the Giro di Lombardia
