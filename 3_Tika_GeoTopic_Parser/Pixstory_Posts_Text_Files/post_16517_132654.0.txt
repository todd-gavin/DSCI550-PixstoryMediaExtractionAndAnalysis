Worldwide the film has opened to 24.5 crore which wasn't expected reportedly. However, the trade analyst had predicted a much higher number, while it's a good slow start and one never knows if the film will show improvement on the second day 👍🏻

Liger is counted as a 'paisa vasool film' well some call it a disaster, the audience has mixed response and it is too soon to announce if the film has become the saviour of Bollywood or not? 
While there were trade experts that predicted the film will open at 35 crore but nothing sort of that happened❌❌
