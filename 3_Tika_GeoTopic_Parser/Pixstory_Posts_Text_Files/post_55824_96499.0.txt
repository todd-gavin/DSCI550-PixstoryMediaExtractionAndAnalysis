Despite fierce criticism from many staff, Australia's controversial Western civilisation classes are proving popular with students, according to research. 

InsideHigherEd reported that the University of Queensland's (UQ) extended majors in Western civilisation have among of the toughest undergraduate entry requirements in the country. Depending on whether the major is part of an honours or double degree, students must have an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) of 95.85 or 98.5 (on a scale of 0 to 99.5). 

These standards are higher than those set for the prestigious courses that top students normally pursue. 

However, The Ramsay Centre for Western Civilization has offered each university more than 50 million Australian dollars ($37 million) over five years to fund the courses and related scholarships. UoW and UQ were the first schools to sign agreements with the Ramsay Centre for Western Civilization.

At both schools, as well as the University of Sydney and the Australian National University, where negotiations with the Ramsay Centre fell through, Western civilisation courses have been met with vehement opposition. Staff claimed that the programmes would jeopardise institutional autonomy and promote triumphalist views of Western civilization to privileged white studentsâ€”claims that the colleges refute.
