Every continent is dotted with giant cities. Some are known for their scenic beauty, and some for their historic importance. A city like Rome tells its captivating history through many of its ancient structures like the Colosseum. On the other hand, Amsterdam, grabs ones eyeballs with its attractive canals.

Cities have been the hubs of activity through centuries. Each city has its own distinct character. Some, like Jerusalem and Lhasa, are religious centres. Other cities, like Washington D. C ., and Beijing are centres of power. In short, every city has its own unique story.

The city of Qufu is the legendary birthplace of many Chinese sages, such as Confucius and Mendus.

Many temples and cemeteries have been built in their honour, and these have become important tourist destinations.

The most famous of these are the Temple of Confucius, the Cemetery of Confucius, and the kong Family Mansion. Together, they are known as the 'San Kong' and they are listed UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The Qufu Confucius festival is a grand cultural event held every year, celebrating the wisdom of China's greatest philosopher Confucius.
