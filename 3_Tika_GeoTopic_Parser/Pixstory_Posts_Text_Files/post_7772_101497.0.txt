Borussia Dortmund have sacked their manager Marco Rose, the team finished second and were eight points behind The Bundesliga Champions, Bayern Munich. Many fans have questioned the movie and have said that if the board really wants the team to win some titles they shouldn't sell all of their best players. In almost every season Dortmund sell their best players to other clubs recently they sold Sancho, Haaland and now might sell Bellingham.
