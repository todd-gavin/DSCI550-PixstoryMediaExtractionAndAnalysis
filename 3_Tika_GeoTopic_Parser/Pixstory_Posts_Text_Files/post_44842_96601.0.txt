The Saints midfielder has been demonstrating his dead-ball skills once again, and he now has a Manchester United icon on his radar.

Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse is largely considered one of the best free-kick takers in the Premier League, and he is closing in on a Premier League record held by Manchester United icon David Beckham for numerous years.

As things stand, no one has scored more goals from dead-ball situations than the former England captain, who graduated from Old Trafford's illustrious Class of '92.
On the other hand, Beckham, 

on the other hand, is in jeopardy of losing his place at the top of a prominent leaderboard as Saints star Ward-Prowse approaches him.
When he graced the Premier League stage, Beckham, who spent more than a decade as a first-team star for United until moving to Real Madrid in 2003, converted 18 direct free-kicks.

Ward-Prowse now has 14 goals after scoring another fantastic goal for Southampton in their match against Brighton.

In second place, the 27-year-old suddenly has breathing room, with a trio of famous forwards trailing in his wake.
Ward-Prowse said of breaking Beckham's record: "My major motivation is to finally meet my childhood hero. If I acquire that album, I'm hoping he'll contact me, but there's still a long way to go.

Cristiano Ronaldo, who is in his second term at United, might yet catch up with him this season, although the Portuguese striker now has 12 free-kick goals to his name.

Former Chelsea striker Gianfranco Zola and ex-Arsenal striker Thierry Henry are both on the same mark.

Ward-Prowse is closing up on Beckham in terms of free-kick goals, but he still trails the legendary former United No. 7 in the overall standings.

The Saints captain has 39 Premier League goals to his name, accumulated across 301 
appearances.

On the other hand, Beckham found the target 65 times in 265 games with the Red Devils.

He also won six Premier League titles, two FA Cup victories, and a Champions League title.
