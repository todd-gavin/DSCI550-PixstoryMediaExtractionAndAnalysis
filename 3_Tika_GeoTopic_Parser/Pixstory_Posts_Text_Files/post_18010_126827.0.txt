The fall festival season is just around the corner, and we'll get our first look at "The Whale" starring Brendan Fraser, "The Son" starring Hugh Jackman, and "White Noise" starring Adam Driver. Pundits and analysts are already aware that Austin Butler from "Elvis," Bill Nighy from "Living," and possibly even Tom Cruise from "Top Gun: Maverick" will be mentioned.
Transformational performances, such as those of Butler and Fraser from their films, might take centre stage when they play real-life characters. "The Inspection" has been designated the closing film for the New York Film Festival, and it has an award-worthy performance from Jeremy Pope, as well as a probable double dosage of Christian Bale this year with Scott.
