HBO, The network has entered into early development on its first sequel to its blockbuster fantasy drama: A live-action spinoff series centered on the fan-favorite character Jon Snow, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter

Kit Harington, the decorated GoT veteran is attached to reprise the role should a series move forward. The actor was twice nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of The Badtarr of Winterfell who struggles to uphold his family’s noble values in a brutal world.

In Thrones’ eighth-and-final season, Jon Snow discovered his true name was Aegon Targaryen, and that he was the living heir to the Iron Throne. In the series finale, he was exiled from Westeros and journeyed North of the Wall with the Wildlings to leave his old life behind, an ending which is publicly hated and frowned upon. 

This news comes as nectar being poured down fans's ears, as everyone collectively hated the ending to GoT, and this can finally mean that there can be meaningful payoff to character arcs.
