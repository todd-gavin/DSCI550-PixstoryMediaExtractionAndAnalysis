Many of them are homeless on purpose How do people not realize this Many of them are homeless because they don t want to be responsible for paying their bills they don t want to work You cannot provide them free housing They wreck it they just don t know how to live People who are refusing to work should not get the luxury of the things others are breaking their backs to get People work tirelessly their entire life to be able to afford a good house and those people just want it for free How fair is that It s great that you want to support the homeless but do your research first If they refuse a job when you give them one that is the first sign that they are trying to escape the obligations of being a member of society
