Following their nominations for the same awards at the Grammys which neither artist attended a Twitter feud erupted between Swift and Grande s fans The two stars have remained silent about any rumoured rivalry between their fan bases I was scrolling through my twitter last night and saw yet another fanwar between the two fandoms Thought why shouldn t I give my opinion on this I mean don t get me wrong I love both the ladies However I like one better in most departments Taylor Swift takes the lead as the best singer for me because her songs are always so amazing and profound and she is so gifted that she can sing pop country and folk songs While Ariana has better vocals I think Taylor s songs are impossible to not like which I ve observed is not always the case with Ari Ariana is also more of a collab artist than solo and most of her hits come from that only Taylor on the other hand is conquering the industry all by herself especially with her Taylor s versions I also feel Ariana as a performer is pretty monotonous on the other hand Taylor is a very engaging performer She s more expressive than the former While Ariana is a great vocalist that s all she has to offer On the other hand Taytay can also play multiple instruments like the piano guitar and a few other instruments I think in the end I enjoy listening to Swift s songs more than Grande so she takes the cake for me
