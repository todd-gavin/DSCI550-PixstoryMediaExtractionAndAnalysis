So while I was travelling I came across this interesting yet very thoughtful radio program where if one vents out their anger on air they get to win some exciting prizes.

At first it sounded strange but this is something that we need to give much of thought into it. You can vent about anything, and literally anything. 

Like when we vent out ourselves it's just like releasing the pressure from the pressure cooker. And this definitely sets an example, this shows that being angry is not something negative but its rather an emotion and we all need to accept it as it is one. We often associate being or getting angry as something aggressive but don't we all need to take this pressure out at some point? 

Venting just don't make people think about various aspects and experiences of life but also just makes our mind free and makes us more calm and get in peace with our situation. 

Now in our day to day lives we depend on someone to vent out our feelings and problems and it is essential to get their consent on listening to our vent because they maybe or maybe not in a state of listening to you and doing so will only make the process more better. 

Venting just don't always happen the same way like maybe needing a person to hear. You can practice emotional ventilation through meditation, going for a walk, reciting a mantra, changing your surroundings and so on. 

So keep note of the venting methods and try them out when you reach your points of emotional ventilation.
