Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema has won the prestigious Ballon d’Or award for the first time in his career, edging out Robert Lewandowski, Sadio Mane and Kevin De Bruyne for the top football prize.
Benzema, who played a pivotal role in Real’s run to the Champions League title last season, is the first French player to win the trophy since Zinedine Zidane in 1998.
At 34, Benzema also became the oldest winner since the first recipient in 1956, Stanley Matthews.
“I’m really proud, it’s a lot of work and a kid’s dream come true,” Benzema said as he received the award during a ceremony in Paris on Monday.
“There were much more difficult moments for me, when I was not selected [with France] and I did not give up,” Benzema said after Zidane, his former coach at Madrid, handed him the trophy.
“I am really proud of my career. This is the Golden Ball of the people.”
Benzema had a stellar season with Real, scoring 44 goals in 46 games in all competitions as he helped guide them to a LaLiga and Champions League double. His 15 goals in the Champions League guided Real to a record-extending 14th title.
Real made remarkable comebacks from losing positions in the last-16, quarter-finals and semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), Chelsea and Manchester City, respectively — with Benzema scoring in each of the second legs.
The highlight of their European campaign was the 3-1 win in the second leg against PSG when the Spanish club were 2-0 down on aggregate, with Benzema grabbing a 17-minute hat-trick in the second half to stun the Ligue 1 side.
Benzema succeeded Lionel Messi, who won the Ballon d’Or for a record-extending seventh time last year but was not among the nominees this time after his first season with PSG.
