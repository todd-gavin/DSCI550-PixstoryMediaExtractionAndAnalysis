An NYPD officer was shot in the arm by a man with nine prior arrests Notably he was just arrested for unlawfully carrying a handgun in a New York City subway when this occurred however he walked free since the crime he committed qualified him for release without bail The bail reform laws of New York have permitted numerous individuals to roam the streets immediately after committing crimes for which they would otherwise be jailed while awaiting trial Critics of bail reform often highlight instances of criminality that arise from offenders being released without bail as as this one However proponents of bail reform often assert that these examples reflect just a small number of cases Obviously proponents of bail reform also cite racial justice What are your thoughts Do you support states reforming bail to make less crimes eligible for bail
