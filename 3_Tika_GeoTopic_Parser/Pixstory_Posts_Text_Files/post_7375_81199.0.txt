Then-President Donald Trump used a Secret Service agent's phone in an attempt to reach his wife, then-first lady Melania Trump, after the story on his affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels broke in 2018, CNN reported on Sunday.

Trump was not keen on anyone listening to his calls — a difficult proposition in the highly-secure White House — so he would often utilize the phone of a close aide or Secret Service agent if he needed to make calls, CNN reported. 

After the Daniels news hit the media, Trump was on a golf course and called his wife from his phone, but she did not pick up, according to a source who spoke with the network.

The then-president reportedly used a Secret Service agent's phone in a renewed attempt to contact his wife.

Melania Trump answered the call that came from the agent's phone, per the report.

However, the Secret Service agent whose phone was used by Trump was not thrilled with the manner in which his device was used, according to CNN.

The Wall Street Journal in January 2018 first reported that Trump had arranged a $130,000 hush-money payment to stop Daniels — an adult-film actress whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford — from disclosing her accusations of an affair with Trump before the 2016 presidential election.

Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleged that she and Trump had sex in 2006 — a year after Trump and Melania wed and following the recent birth of their son, Barron.
