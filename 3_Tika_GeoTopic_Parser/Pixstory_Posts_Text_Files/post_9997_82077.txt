I can remember the smile on my lips the happiness and the wishes covering my small heart Dad bought us new clothes I loved to go shopping and buy my favorite dress I wanted my Eid dress or pants to have more pockets so that I could put my Eidi money in it We have a tradition where children receive a small amount of money from our parents older brothers or sisters and guests I loved Eid because my pockets were full of money and I felt rich It was wonderful to think and wait for Eid days the days full of happiness and joy Days when we would eat dried fruit with our tea and cookies and cakes I remember the special time the day and the night before It was hard to wait twenty four hours more dreaming about what to do tomorrow where to go and who to visit who will give me more Eidi What to eat and how to spend my Eidi These were all the plans that filled my heart s diary Early morning of Eid we wore our new nice clothes put on perfume and greeted each other with Eid Mubarak The smiling face of my father greeted us first he kissed us kindly His face his kiss his hugs were not important for me at that time I was just waiting for him to give me Eidi Then he smiled and asked us all to gather When it was my turn he knew I expected more so he gave me more money The first day of Eid with Eid tea and lunch and dinner with all family members was wonderful and special If a guest joined us the day was more beautiful I always knew which guest would give me Eidi Some people would pretend they were broke I didn t like those guests and I wouldn t let them to kiss my face But when the nice guests visited I sat in the corner of the guest room like a hungry cat watching a sparrow I watched them eat chocolates and cookies
