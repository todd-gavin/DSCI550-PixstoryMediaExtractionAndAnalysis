Jennifer Coolidge s agency approached her in with an offer a London theatre was putting on a production of the musical Legally Blonde based on the film in which Coolidge starred as the lovably dizzy manicurist Paulette Remember Paulette s sensual bend and snap motion from the film It s a whole number in the show And the theatre urged her to try out What do you mean audition she recalls asking her agent It s not a firm offer He asked again Would she be willing to come to London to try out for a role she d already played I suppose they just want to see if you can sing and dance my agent remarked Look if I got up onstage and farted and that s all I did it would still be the lady from the movie We re a short flight from the West End here on the coast of Sicily where Coolidge is filming Season of HBO s The White Lotus which Variety can exclusively report will premiere in October But the financial crisis she s recalling I m still outraged about this she continues that s why I brought it up couldn t be more distant And she is no longer represented by that agent Coolidge who spent decades in film and television as a secret weapon the industry didn t know how to wield has recently received her first Emmy nomination for her work in the anthology series inaugural season She played childlike heiress Tanya McQuoid shrouding wounded humanity in bad behavior and big appetites The role ended a dry spell for Coolidge one that crystallized her thinking about Hollywood The actress has earned a reputation for being willing to go anywhere for a joke on screen Even between lines she keeps viewers guessing and watching Director Christopher Guest If someone doesn t speak the audience will naturally be riveted to that person She says she would wish the same success for every actor even if they fail because we all want a challenge Source variety
