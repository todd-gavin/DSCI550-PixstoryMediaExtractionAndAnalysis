I was really very lucky today because I played one of my worst matches of the year I&#39;m sorry for Korda because if there was one who deserved to win this match it was him Rafa Nadal&#39;s words at the end of the match with Sebastian Korda in which he won in comeback after having a bad time The match valid for the second round of the ATP in Indian Wells demonstrated once again how the Majorcan tennis player manages to bring out impressive strength when things go badly Yet the match started well for Nadal, who won in the first set for Terrible the second in which instead he does not win more than one game leaving the set to Korda for Decisive the third set which starts as worse it could not have been for Nadal Below by and therefore close to a sensational elimination he manages to recover and overturn taking himself to the per then win at tie break
