My dream to play for Barcelona Messi is my idol even now that at Psg He has made so many sacrifices since he started his family has always supported him even if he wasn&#39;t in the best economic conditions And then he does things on the pitch like no one else These are the words by Wilfried Gnonto in the interview with Sportweek where he recounted every single nuance of his football life from his idol Messi to his support for Inter Once Messi scored at Bayern with a shot after feinting the shot At the oratory alone on the pitch I think I&#39;ve done it again I don&#39;t know how many times And every time the ball went in I screamed Messiiii Messiiiii On the Nerazzurri Inter Juve in April the match of Pjani&#39;s failure to be sent off for a foul on Rafinha For them Higua n scored almost in the last minute and with that victory they got their hands on the scudetto I was at San Siro with my friend Elio and we burst into tears That evening I truly became an Inter fan Finally the class also opened up on the subject of young people in Italy and abroad In Italy for a more difficult youngster With the national team I played against England c they were guys a little older than me who go on the pitch with Arsenal Tottenham Chelsea I didn&#39;t see this big difference between us and them but they have more chances In England or Germany if a good one they let him play they don&#39;t look at the identity card mentality courage
