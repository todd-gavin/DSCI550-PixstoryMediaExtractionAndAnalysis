According to the official website of Guinness World Records, “A family in Esko, Minnesota, USA, has achieved a record that not many can measure up to - quite literally! Meet the Trapp family of five; Scott, Krissy, Savanna, Molly, and Adam.”

On 6 December 2020, the Trapps were confirmed as the tallest family in the world with an average height of 203.29 cm (6 ft 8.03 in). The family's combined height is equal to the length of half a tennis court! (...) Unsurprisingly, all three Trapp kids played sports throughout their lives and were recruited by colleges for either basketball or volleyball.”
