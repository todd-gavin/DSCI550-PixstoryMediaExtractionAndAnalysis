Actor Kareena Kapoor Khan welcomed a new all-white Mercedes Benz car on Sunday. 🔥We recently came across a video where Kareena is seen unveiling her new car by removing the cover. Her new car looks pretty classy yet sexy. ✅As she brings the new Baby home, her own son Jeh goes out for a ride with the nanny. 🔥In the video, we also see the little munchkin who is wearing a blue t-shirt with shorts waving to the paparazzi. It is just too cute for words. If you’re wondering about the new car and its cost, well, reportedly, the Mercedes Benz S 350D can cost around Rs 1.90 Crore in India, as per Carwale.com. The couple also bought a Jeep Wrangler (over Rs 60 lakh) a couple of days ago.😍😱😱😱😱😱
