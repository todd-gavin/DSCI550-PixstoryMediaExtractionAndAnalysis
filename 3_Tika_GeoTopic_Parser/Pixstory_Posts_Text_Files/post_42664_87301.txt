The driver known as Wasta saab in Kashmiri lived somewhere in Nehru Park area and wore the huge Kashmiri sa afa headgear Extremely moralistic he was more of a caretaker than a driver He behaved as the patron of the children He would make choices for us whether to go slow or fast He would at times admonish those who came in late or those creating disturbances and handling them in his own way and it was more of a grandfather doing it I can say that very very clear because now I have grown up enough to be mature and make these distinctions But that s what he was Our Bedford bus also had our school badge with Industria Floremus inscribed which meant In toil we flourish in Scottish language Obviously the school was run by Scottish group and later on the Keralite Christians came in and took over the school management We also saw the old rivalry between Irish and Scottish people being played out in our school Our vice principal was an Irishman named John Farrow while the principal was Father Farrow a Scottish The two hated each other I couldn t understand this rivalry at that point of time because for me both were from England They would talk against each other behind their backs People heard them criticise each other Later on in life I learnt about this rivalry because when you go to a pub you see them getting drunk and fight and everything comes out I have personally witnessed this rivalry now in life I can see where it came from So my childhood in every way was very very beautiful To be continued
