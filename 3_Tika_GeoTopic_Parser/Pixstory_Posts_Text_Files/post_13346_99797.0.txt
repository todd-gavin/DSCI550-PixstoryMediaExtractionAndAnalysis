US Congressman Michael Waltz on Wednesday criticized Biden's silence on the Taliban's crackdown on women, calling it disgusting and shameful.

 US officials have said the Taliban have changed and are helping the United States fight ISIS.

In an interview with Fox News, the Republican envoy noted the plight of Afghan women under Taliban rule and that there was no authority to support them.

"Afghan women must cover their faces and not leave their homes. "They can no longer work anywhere."

"On behalf of these American women and soldiers who must go there to repel terrorism in the future, I will hold Biden and those around him accountable," she said, sharply criticizing Biden.

Representatives of the US government have expressed concern about the Taliban's recent orders to cover and house women. The State Department has said that if the Taliban does not reconsider its policies, the United States will increase international pressure on the group.

However, Thomas West, the US special representative to Afghanistan, said on May 10 that although he did not like the Taliban, he saw the interaction with the group as beneficial to the US and Afghans.

The congressman accused the Biden government of making false statements about the Taliban. "We remember that we were promised that we would face a new Taliban; The Taliban are moderate. "They are good terrorists who are supposed to help us fight bad terrorists."

Criticizing the Taliban, US officials say they have broken their promises to the international community and the Afghan people. They specifically refer to previous statements by Taliban officials and spokespersons that they did not prevent women from studying and working.
