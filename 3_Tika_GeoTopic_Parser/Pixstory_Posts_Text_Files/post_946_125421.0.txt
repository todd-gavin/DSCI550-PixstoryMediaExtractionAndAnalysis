"Anne Heche was a wildly talented actress who endured more horror than anyone should have to,” wrote film historian Mark Harris. 

Harris linked to a 2009 profile of the actor, which detailed her traumatic childhood. “She deserves to be remembered with compassion.”
The 53-year-old star of films including Donnie Brasco, Catfight and the remake of Psycho, did not regain consciousness after a car crash on 5 August.
