National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Chinese Communist Party Politburo Member and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission Yang Jiechi met in Rome, Italy to discuss U.S.-China relations, Russia's war against Ukraine and others. 

International media has said that the talks were "intense," but the Chinese media has gone a step accused the US of "constantly spreading disinformation" about China's role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and also trying "to mix the Ukraine crisis with the Taiwan question." The talks didn't go according to the plan was clear from Yang's statement after the talks in which he said, "The Chinese side resolutely opposes any words and deeds that spread false information, or distort and discredit China's position."

China is also miffed about the "hype" by Western media outlets about China's offer of "military assistance to Russia." China says that Sullivan "warned" China about the consequences of it supporting Russia.

Chinese experts have been quoted in the media as saying that the US "laid a trap" for China on picking a side in this war and didn't fall for it. 

The state-controlled media has also commented heavily on the US Air Force General Kenneth Wilsbach "blatantly" threatening to teach China a lesson over Ukraine. Wilsbach had said that Chinese are taking from the Ukraine situation is the "solidarity of the global community," and that if China behaves in a similar way against the island or another neighbor, "something more robust will happen."

Realizing that the US could be winning the 'propaganda war' on Ukraine, the Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post. He reiterated China's stance on Ukraine and called it "rumors and disinformation" on his country's tilt towards Russia and that the conflict "does no good for China."
