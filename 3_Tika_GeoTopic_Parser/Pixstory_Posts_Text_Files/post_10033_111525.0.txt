The more you travel, the more creative you become and, the more passionate you become about your work. 

Qutab Minar is a picnic spot for most of the people where they come to spend time with their families. Some people come for research, while others come to take photographs. 

I get happy when I see people enjoying themselves and spending time with their friends and families. 
When I go to park to take pictures, everyone always greets me with a beautiful smile on their faces. And it makes me extremely happy.
