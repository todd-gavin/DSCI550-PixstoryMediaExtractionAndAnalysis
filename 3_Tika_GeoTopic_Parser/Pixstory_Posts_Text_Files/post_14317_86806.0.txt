NEW YEAR CHEER - No team can match Juve’s 19 points collected in Serie A in 2022. Five wins and four draws in nine games make the Bianconeri one of five clubs from Europe’s five major leagues still unbeaten this calendar year (along with Sevilla, Liverpool, Barcelona and Newcastle United).

GOAL GRABBERS - Juventus have netted at least two goals in each of the last six games in both league and cup against Sampdoria, scoring 16 in total. Included in the positive run are wins in each of the last five Serie A meetings between the two teams.

STOP SIGN - Matthijs de Ligt is the defender with more than 15 appearances this season that has succeeded most in stopping take-ons, being dribbled just twice in 23 matches.

RUNNING AWAY - Since defeat at Verona on 30 October, Juventus have remained unbeaten in their last eight league away games (five wins and three draws) - the best run for the Bianconeri since the period December 2017-March 2019 when, under Massimiliano Allegri, the sequence without loss away reached 26 games.

SPOT ON - Juventus and Sampdoria are two of the three teams (with Napoli) to have conceded the fewest goals from penalties this season. Only Udinese’s Roberto Pereyra has converted a spot kick against the Bianconeri, while the scorer of the one penalty against Samp was Leonardo Bonucci in the reverse fixture in Turin.
