Substitute Gemstones for Diamond
The best alternative for diamond is unheated white sapphire with no tints. 

White opals also have Venus powers but should be worn only after the age of 42 after a thorough astrological analysis. It is believed that the opal can take an individual to the height of material success and once after achievement of that take away all the pleasures, interests and highs of material success.

Opal is a “phenomenal gemstone” that shows the phenomena of “play of colour.” It is the gemstone in which all seven colours of nature are visible. Certain astrologers prescribe opal as a substitute for Venus but opal is not suitable for all.

One should be very careful before prescribing opal because it is a very spiritual gemstone and represents vairagya- Detachment.

It has the capacity of fulfilling all material needs and then taking all interest from the material to the spiritual. Hence good astrologers judge the age and maturity of the person before prescribing opal. In general, it should be prescribed after the individual has reached 42 years or more. It has been noticed that a reckless recommendation of opal sometimes makes one lose interest totally in domestic and family life. Hence one should be very cautious and check with an expert before wearing this gemstone.
