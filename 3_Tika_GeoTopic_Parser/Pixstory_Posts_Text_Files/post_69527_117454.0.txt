The National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) has submitted a proposal with reference to the implementation of computer-based courses from Class VI to XII, according to Principal Secretary, School Education Department, B K Singh.
Additionally, it stated that the JKBOSE's suggestion for this course must be followed, in order for it to be regarded a computer course for Class 11 and Class 12's fifth subject, on par with computer science, IT, and IP.
