It is clear that Graham Potter is the main reason Brighton have been consistently punching well above their weight it is only normal to expect a drop in their quality now that he s gone And not just him Brighton have suffered significant loss to Chelsea in the form of five key personnel who formed Potter s and the club s backroom staff Assistant manager Billy Reid first team coaches Bjorn Hamberg and Bruno goalkeeping coach Ben Roberts and assistant head of recruitment Kyle Macaulay all followed Potter out of the club Macaulay s departure is probably the most damaging after Potter as he was responsible for talent identification bringing gems like Moises Caicedo and the Marc Cucurella to the club amongst others Losing their best player highly rated head coach and five key members of staff to the same club within a month could not have been prepared for especially as the season is already in full swing The abrupt nature of the departures have left Brighton with little to no time to seek a managerial replacement exactly why they have had to promote Andrew Crofts from his role as the u manager to interim head coach of the first team Crofts is not the only one who got an unexpected promotion in the wake of the exodus to Chelsea Brighton u s assistant manager Shannon Ruth will now perform the same duties for the first team and former assistant goalkeeping coach Jack Stern becomes the new goalkeeping coach Perhaps more interestingly year old midfielder Adam Lallana has now been given the responsibility of a player coach as he is named of Crofts hastily assembled backroom staff It s been five days since Potter joined Chelsea and Brighton haven t even been strongly linked with a replacement which says a lot because four days is a long time in football especially with a Premier League job vacant It shows how deeply Brighton have been affected by Chelsea and it wouldn t be a surprise if their season takes a turn for the worse from here on out
