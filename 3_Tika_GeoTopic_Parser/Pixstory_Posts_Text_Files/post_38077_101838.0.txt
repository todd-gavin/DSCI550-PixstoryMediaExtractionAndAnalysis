Real Madrid suffered a massive setback over the weekend as Kylian Mbappe extended his contract with Paris Saint Germain. This effectively ends his chances of joining Real Madrid in the Summer. 

Los Blancos were being considered the favourites to sign Mbappe. The Spanish giants had been keeping in touch with Mbappe since last season. Hence many had expected Mbappe to make the switch this season. 

Owing to the Kylian Mbappe transfer saga, Real Madrid had also cooled off their interest on Erling Haaland. Hence, they ended up losing the striker to Manchester City. 

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez would certainly not sit down after losing out on Kylian Mbappe. The Spaniard is expected to make multiple new acquisations especially in the right wing.

The Spanish giants are set to part ways with Gareth Bale, Isco, and maybe even Marco Asensio in the summer. Hence, signing a right-winger would be a necessity for the club before the next season. 

Florentino Perez is set to spend the big bucks and two of his biggest targets are reportedly Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane at the moment. Both the Liverpool players are set to go out of contract in 2023. To add to this, Raheem Sterling, Serge Gnabry, Riyad Mahrez, and a few other players are also being linked to the club. 

Hence it has to be seen whom Florentino Perez and his team would target next to fill up their right wing along with Rodrygo!
