Alia Bhatt is celebrating one month of marriage with Ranbir Kapoor. The actor on Saturday shared a new set of photos from her mehendi function and the post-wedding party. While in one photo the two are dancing with their arms around each other, in another, they are happily posing as a couple for the photographers present at the event. Alia Bhatt‘s mother Soni Razdan was all hearts in the comments section of the post. Saba Pataudi, Varun Sharma and others also dropped comments on the post.

The mushy photos also received a lot of love from their fans. A fan of the couple called the two the “best jodi in the world,” while another comment read, “Romeo and Juliet.”
