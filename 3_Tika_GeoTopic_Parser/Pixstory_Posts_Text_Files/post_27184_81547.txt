This is what I found yesterday in Milan Blue sky and bright sun If it hadn&#39;t been for the cold of a day when winter hasn&#39;t gone yet I would have really thought I was in Sicily Instead I was in the center of Milan in the wonderful context of Villa Necchi Campiglio for the 10th edition of Citrus A rich exhibition where I went to discover the Sorrento lemon, the Savona chinotto, the Caribbean lime, the delicious Sicilian hybrid tacle which, as the name suggests, comes from the tarot and the clementine of the sweet Foglia Allegra composed of a brittle on a lemon leaf, in short, of the most varied species of citrus fruits of their aromas, colors and flavors A heritage of biodiversity typical of Mediterranean landscapes for in the heart of the city and then honeys flavored beers perfumes cosmetics refined decorations and other products selected on the basis of their quality and particularity I liked it very much and will go back again next year
