Arsenal vs Spurs combined XIGoalkeeper: Aaron Ramsdale- Lloris has had a very good career but as football has evolved, the need for a ball playing keeper has as well. So in that aspect, this isn’t even a debate. Right Back: Ben White- Could have easily have been Tomiyasu. For Spurs? Emerson Royal? Let’s not be silly. RCB: Cristian Romero- Even as a Arsenal, there is no denying Cristian Romero is a excellent CB. LCB: William Saliba- His ball playing excellence alongside Romero would form quite the partnership. Left Back: Kieran Tierney- Spurs do have a good LWB in Perisic but in a back 4, Kieran Tierney was a easy one. Zinchenko is unlucky to miss out.CDM: Thomas Partey- Playing as a lone number 6 in a 4-3-3, Partey is the only player that’s proven he can do it. Hojberg is good but for me more of a pivot player. RCM: Martin Ødegaard- Adding some creativity to the midfield, there’s no denying Ødegaard’s quality on his day. Spurs lack of number 8 profiles make this pretty easy. LCM: Granit Xhaka- What a turnaround in fortunes. Xhaka on his current form is up there with the best & is evolving game by game. In what looked like a unnatural fit, he’s proven many wrong. Right Wing: Bukayo Saka- Kulusevki is a top potential player & it’s hard to leave him out. But when a ‘out of form’ Saka has the 2nd most assists in the league, then that tells you about his standard. Centre Forward: Harry Kane- Gabriel Jesus has been on fire this season & if he can sustain that form then we’ve got something special. But Harry Kane is a proven world class player.Left Winger: Heung-Min Son- His form this season may not be the Son we know, but his last game was a reminder of his quality. His ball striking is sensational.
