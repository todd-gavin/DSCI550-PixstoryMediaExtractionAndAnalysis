Juventus have reportedly joined the race to poach Youri Tielemans from Leicester City next year. But the Serie A giants are set to face stern competition as other European heavyweights, Real Madrid and Liverpool are among the clubs vying for the midfielder. 
As per reports, the Bianconeri are looking at multiple free agents to bolster their squad and Leicester midfielder Youri Tielemans has risen as one of the big names. The report also suggests that the Serie A giants have already made contact with Tielemans' agent but talks are still in the preliminary stage. 
Youri Tielemans' contract with Leicester City expires next summer. The midfielder would likely not sign a new deal as he wants to move on and play in the Champions League. Arsenal and Manchester United were interested in signing the Belgian midfielder this summer. However, a lack of Champions League football was one of the reasons why the deal did not go through.
Liverpool and Real Madrid are also interested in signing the talented midfielder and hence Juventus would face a stern test in getting their man. The Serie A giants are currently outside the top four, hence if they miss out on the Champions League, their chances of signing the midfielder would get severely hit. It has to be seen what Tielemans decides to do regarding his future next season.
