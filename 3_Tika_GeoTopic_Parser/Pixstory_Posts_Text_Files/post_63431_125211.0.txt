Arsenal defender Pablo Mari is set to join Serie A club AC Monza on a season-long loan with an option of a permanent transfer provided that the newly promoted Italian outfit avoid relegation this season, per transfer football expert Fabrizio Romano.

The 28-year-old had a successful loan spell in Italy last season having spent the remainder of the season with Udinese and he his now set to return to Italy in a bid to complete a move to AC Monza for a fee in the region of €7m should the club remain in Serie A next season and sign him on permanent transfer. 

The spaniard became Mikel Arteta’s first signing when he arrived from Flamengo in January 2020 featuring 22 times for the Gunners with a goal to show off. 

He was earlier a key part of Arsenal squad during the 2020/21 season and started both legs of the club's Europa League semi-final defeat to Villarreal. However, the arrival of Ben White coupled with recurrent injuries saw him fall badly in the pecking orders at Arsenal’s defensive department. Hence, the reason for his loan move to Udinese for the second half of the campaign last season.  

Thus, Mari becomes the latest exit from the Emirate stadium after Bernd Leno and Folarin Balogun recent departures as Arsenal intensify effort to downsize their team for the ongoing campaign.
