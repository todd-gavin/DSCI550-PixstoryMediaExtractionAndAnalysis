They deface websites belonging to Russian or Ukrainian governments with messages abusing each other or even try to disable the computer systems of banks and other institutions. And they do it sitting hundreds of miles away from the conflict that has the attention of the world.

Welcome to the cyber world of hackers fighting a battle away from the death and destruction on the ground. Soon after the invasion by Russia, a group calling itself Anonymous (@YourAnonOne) declared war against Russia, saying that it would target the Vladimir Putin regime as part of its cyber war. 

In fact, the Ukrainian government had asked cyber volunteers to help protect its infrastructure and spy and if possible, even attack Russian troops. Russia, on its part also shut down several websites vital to Ukraine just days before it launched the invasion.

Russian hackers hit ukrainian banks and other institutions with distributed-denial-of-service attacks taking websites offline. According to experts, the 'data wiper' malware that could destroy data on a device to wipe the data from the systems was launched from different locations in Russia. The Ukrainian government had said that various government departments were affected by the virus. Symantec, the cyber security software maker, said that these attacks were launched in Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania.

The Wall Street Journal quotes Ukrainian officials as saying that its "IT Army" could number more than 400,000 people inside and outside the country.

While Russia is known for its ability to attack computer systems across the world, Ukraine has been able to gain a lot of sympathy, and several thousand cyber warriors have responded to its call to take on Russia for invading Ukraine.
