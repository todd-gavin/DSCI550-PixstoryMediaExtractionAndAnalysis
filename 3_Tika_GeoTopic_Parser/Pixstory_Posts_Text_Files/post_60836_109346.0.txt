I have missed eating good street food in Bangalore. No matter how many great cafes and restaurants Bangalore boasts, Kolkata street food is a different kind of delight. Maybe that's the reason I couldn't help myself in Kolkata. There's so much they offer, from kebabs to momos and biryani to lassi. 

This was my first time going out to get some street food after the pandemic. I have to admit that I had been wary for the longest time about hygiene and safety. Things are getting better now and having been fully vaccinated, I thought it'd be fine to get some street food.

The pandemic has been difficult for most of us. Perhaps, the hardest hit have been these street vendors who relied on regular customers for their livelihood. Hopefully things will normalize soon (at least the new normal) and we'll get to enjoy good food as long as they maintain proper safety and hygiene measures.

In any case, it was worth it to walk a long distance, change buses and metros, and get to this kebab stall for some of the best kebabs I have had in awhile.
