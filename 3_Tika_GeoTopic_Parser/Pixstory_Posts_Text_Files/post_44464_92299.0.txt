Volker Struth, Timo Werner's advisor, travelled to Italy this week to meet with Juventus, AC Milan, and Atalanta in the hopes of finding new clubs for two of his key clients. 

Following his Â£47.5 million move from RB Leipzig in June 2020, Chelsea's German international is poised to leave Stamford Bridge after two seasons in west London, where things have just not worked out for the 26-year-old.

Werner's future could be determined by the sanctions imposed on Chelsea as a result of the club's previous ties to former owner Roman Abramovich.

However, there is confidence that the Blues' new owners will be finalised and in place before the transfer window reopens in a few months. After yet another poor performance, Werner's 4-1 defeat to Brentford on Saturday promises to be the final straw at Chelsea.

Struth, his agent, is already aggressively looking for a way out for the underperforming, self-conscious forward. Struth has been linked with a return to Germany with Borussia Dortmund, but he is also ready to look into other European leagues.

Serie A is one of them, having visited Italy this week to meet with executives from Juventus, AC Milan, and Atalanta. Despite the fact that Werner was one of the topics of conversation, Express Sport believes he was not the only one. Struth also represents Julian Weigl of Benfica, who appears to be dissatisfied in Lisbon.

Werner seemed to prefer a return to the Bundesliga, where he scored 91 goals in 222 games with Stuttgart and RB Leipzig. 

Werner was regarded as one of the division's best exporters at the time of his departure at the end of the 2019/20 season, having scored 28 goals in 34 games.

When he appeared to suggest that he was better suited to international football, the striker threatened to upset the apple cart at Chelsea.
