India lost the toss in the final T20 against Sri Lanka in the three match T20 series. Sri Lanka opted to bat first even though most would've opted to bowl first considering the HCPA stadium's pitch dew factor. 

India registered their 12th consecutive T20I victory and fourth clean sweep under Rohit. India on Saturday had defeated the visitors to gain an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-game series.

Shreyas Iyer hit third consecutive fifty to steady the run-chase after India lost Rohit Sharma & Sanju Samson early in the third and final T20I at Dharamsala. Shreyas scored an unbeaten 73 to help India register 12th consecutive win in the format and clinch series 3-0. Earlier, India were off to an impressive start with Avesh Khan and Mohammed Siraj taking three wickets in the first six overs. Ravi Bishnoi piled further misery by taking a wicket, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 29/4. Harshal then removed Chandimal to inflict further damage.
Sri Lankan captain Shanaka was the only one who fought hard scoring yet another impressive 74 off 38 balls. The Sri Lankan opening batsmen failed to perform well yet again and that may be alarming with the T20 World Cup coming soon. 

Rohit Sharma went with a rejigged starting eleven and named four changes from the previous T20I. The win in the third and final T20I also helped India extend their winning streak in T20Is to 12 as they equalled the world record for the most successive victories. 

Shreyas Iyer scored three half centuries in the 3 match series and remained unbeaten in the last two scoring 70+. He earned the Man of the series award for his spectacular performance scoring 204 runs. He was also named man of the match in the final T20.
