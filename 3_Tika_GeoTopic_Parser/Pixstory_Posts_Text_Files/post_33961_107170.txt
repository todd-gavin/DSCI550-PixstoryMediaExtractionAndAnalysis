A new incredible story comes from Italian amateur football This time we go to Piedmont where in the final playoff of the Second Category between Atletico Acqui and Sale the unthinkable really happened The regulation played a bad joke on the hosts Atletico Acqui had finished the regular season in a better position than his opponents and therefore a draw was enough for him to be promoted But in the last minute of the game everything changed The referee awarded a penalty to Atletico kicked by Viazzi his spoon slammed against the crossbar before being repeated header from the same striker Clearly the goal would have been canceled since the penalty taker cannot touch the ball twice without another player touching it in the middle but the referee did not notice and validated the goal despite the protests After celebrating their promotion for two days, Atletico awoke to bad news, Sale&#39;s appeal was accepted and the game had to be replayed Adding to the insult was the fact that the penalty missed and then bagged was completely superfluous for the promotion if Atletico had made a mistake he would still have reached the First Category In addition to the damage then the final insult in the replay of the match Sale beat Atletico Acqui and thus won the promotion
