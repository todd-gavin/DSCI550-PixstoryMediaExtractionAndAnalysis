On January 28, 1896, Walter Arnold of the United Kingdom recklessly travelled at 8 mph in his "horse-less carriage" through the Kent village of Paddock Wood. Using a locomotive without a horse on a public road, allowing it to be operated by fewer than three people, travelling at a speed greater than two miles per hour, and failing to clearly display his name and address on the locomotive were all charges against him by the police officer pursuing him on a bicycle. On January 30, he appeared before a local magistrate, who found him guilty on all four charges. He was fined Â£4 7s in total of which 10 shillings was for the speeding charge.
