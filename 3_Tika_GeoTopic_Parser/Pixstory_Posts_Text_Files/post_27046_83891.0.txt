Chak De India

In the category of the greatest sports films ever created in the Indian Cinema, Chak De India stands at the top, whether it is the absolute electrifying performance of Shah Rukh Khan or the plot that kept you hooked to the screen like a flame to a moth, Chak De India emerges as a clear winner in all aspects. 

When talking about its elements, Kabir Khan’s portrayal of Shah Rukh Khan is something to behold. SRK was certainly at the pinnacle of his acting in this movie as every single scene with him is a breath of fresh air. Srk owned the movie all in all. 

But the movie isn’t just about Srk being at his prime, it is about the talk about the national sport of India, Hockey and how the terminology of playing hockey and having a successful career in Hockey is different for men and women. There are several moments in the film that not only show the prevalence of struggle in Hockey as a sport but a even greater struggle in Women’s hockey as they have to rise up the ranks in a society dominated by sports being played by men and men only. 

During the course of the movie, the women who portrayed each and every character to perfection overcame many challenges to rise up and win the world cup, against all odds. 

Chak De India provides a breath of fresh air and unmatched motivation to this day, after more than a decade of its release. It is brilliant and outstanding and definitely worth a watch.
