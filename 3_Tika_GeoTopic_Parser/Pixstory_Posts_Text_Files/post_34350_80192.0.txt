As Khan stepped on the stage along with his manager Pooja Dadlani to bid a final goodbye to the legend, he raised his hands in dua and then took off his mask to blow air. He then folded his hands and encircled her body to pay respects.

The act of blowing air after the dua has been falsely interpreted as him “spitting”.

According to Professor Akhtarul Wasey, Board of Studies, Department of Islamic Studies, Maulana Azad National Urdu University in Jodhpur, while he can’t comment on specifically which prayer Khan recited, the gesture of blowing air after reading a dua is a traditional Islamic practice during funerals.
