 Kashmir Walnut growers seek govt s help The Walnut growers claim that the production of Walnut in Kashmir Valley has been considerably decreased this year due to climate change This year the harvesting of the dry fruit began a fortnight earlier and the production is less due to the unseasonal hot weather conditions and rainfall Danish Choudhary who is a law student and whose forefathers were associated with the Walnut business at village Branwar said Branwar village in Chadoora tehsil of Budgam district is known for producing best quality and high quantity of Walnut across the Kashmir valley every year However unfavorable weather conditions this year scuttled the production to a great extent Danish complained that the growers are not getting good prices for the Walnuts in the market due to non availability of a Dry Fruit Zone or Mandi in Kashmir Valley He said that the growers after packing the Walnuts in boxes and sending them to Jammu Mandi where a kilogram is sold for just Rs and the buyers export the same product for Rs Last year some exporters from other states visited Branwar and purchased the walnuts at the orchards which enabled us to get a good price But selling in Jammu Mandi is only profitable for the purchasers he added He said the exporters from outside purchase Walnuts according to their need and requirements and this process does not help the growers of the valley He urged the government to set up a dry fruit zone or Mandi in Kashmir Valley so that Walnut and Almond growers could get the best price for their production If we could have a dry fruit zone or mandi here in Kashmir valley the dealers can directly come and purchase and one could get a good price like other fruit growers he said
