The Story of Rohtas

An Insider Account

Joining Rohtas from Bagaha

Transport from Himalayan Jungle to the Forests of the Kaimur Ranges

Away from Delhi, in Kolkata while on tour during conducting an investigation, I received a phone call from a number in Bihar. The person on the other side was the son of a renowned politician from Rohtas district of Bihar. I immediately remembered that this was the same person I had sent to jail once in connection with an old case of disruption of law and order.

 For a while, I became quite defensive and I did not know why had this person called me after more than a year since I had left Rohtas, and had already completed my tenure in another district before moving to Delhi on central deputation. But then as one works as the SP of a district, one does make several contacts, some of which are lost the moment one gets transferred out, while many others remain in touch with whom it is more of a personal relation and mutual sort of admiration. 

Getting a call from someone after a long time is indeed something that makes one suspicious of the intent, especially when it comes from someone of the type one seems to have harmed. But this call was not the one that I expected from this person,  I was being thanked for something which had begun as a dream.
