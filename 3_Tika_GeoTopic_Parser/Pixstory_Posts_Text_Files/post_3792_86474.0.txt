In the other seat, Mr Channi got some 50,000 votes, while his nearest rival from the Aam Aadmi Party who has a similar name - Charanjit Singh - got over 54,000 votes.

Bhadaur in Barnala district comes under Malwa region of Punjab. This region houses 69 Assembly constituencies. The Opposition Aam Aadmi Party is considered dominant in Malwa region. In 2017, 18 AAP MLAs came from the Malwa belt.

Of the 69 seats in Malwa, 18 are reserved. Both the Congress and AAP bagged nine reserved seats each in Malwa in the 2017 polls.

â€œI humbly accept the verdict of the people of Punjab and Congratulate Aam Aadmi Party and their elected Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann Ji for the victory. I hope they will deliver on the expectations of people," Mr Channi tweeted.
