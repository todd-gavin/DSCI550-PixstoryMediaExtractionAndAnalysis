Women's Equality Day, observed on August 26, raises awareness of equality. It reaches out through the oppressive and unfair haze, saying, "We are here, and you are not alone in this fight." In the midst of our tragic past, it is a glimmer of optimism. Despite the fact that the long-fought battle for women's equality is still very much far from being over, this day represents a big step toward a more inclusive society where men and women can stand as equals, as we were intended to be.
