Woman when I behold thee flippant vain Inconstant childish proud and full of fancies Without that modest softening that enhances The downcast eye repentant of the pain That its mild light creates to heal again E en then elate my spirit leaps and prances E en then my soul with exultation dances For that to love so long I ve dormant lain But when I see thee meek and kind and tender Heavens how desperately do I adore Thy winning graces to be thy defender I hotly burn to be a Calidore A very Red Cross Knight a stout Leander Might I be loved by thee like these of yore Light feet dark violet eyes and parted hair Soft dimpled hands white neck and creamy breast Are things on which the dazzled senses rest Till the fond fixed eyes forget they stare From such fine pictures heavens I cannot dare To turn my admiration though unpossess d They be of what is worthy though not drest In lovely modesty and virtues rare Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark These lures I straight forget e en ere I dine Or thrice my palate moisten but when I mark Such charms with mild intelligences shine My ear is open like a greedy shark To catch the tunings of a voice divine John Keats
