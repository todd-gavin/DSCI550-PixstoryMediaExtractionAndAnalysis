Sadio Mane and Mo Salah of Liverpool are nearing the end of their Anfield contracts, with 'little or no sign of progress toward a renewal in either case.'

According to GOAL, our No. 10 is "relaxed" about his current contract situation.

Both players are now 29 years old, and the next contract they sign, whether at Anfield or elsewhere, will most likely be their final 'big' contract.

Our most recent attacking additions, Diogo Jota and Luiz Diaz, suggest that Jurgen Klopp is thinking ahead, despite the fact that both are only 25, but losing Mane or Salah, or potentially both, at the end of next season would be devastating.

Liverpool's owners, FSG, are thought to be willing to make the Egyptian King the highest-paid player in club history, but if Mo's wages rise significantly, Mane may expect a similar raise.

The situation is complicated; we can't simply give the players whatever they want because it goes against the club's financial structure and has ramifications for our other big players and potential new arrivals.

It's not ideal right now, but we need to stay focused on achieving as much success as possible this season before resolving the pair's contract issues in the summer.

Salah would be nearly irreplacable at LFC, but Osimhen appears to be another superb attacking talent who could at least mitigate the damage if the former Roma man were to depart.

Osimhen, a strong, quick, and skilful attacking player, appears to be a good fit for Jurgen Klopp's style of play, and he is still young enough to improve and add more goals to his game.

The 23-year-old has 25 goals in two seasons for Napoli, but it's worth noting that Salah had similar numbers at Roma before becoming an absolute goal machine at Liverpool.
