Privilege is one of those things You are more inclined to deny it if you were born into it if you have benefitted from it if you are wittingly or unintentionally reproducing it You may even claim the contrary on rare occasions as the most ungracious type of indulgence As a victim card use the bully For example being born into a wealthy family Being a man comes with its own set of privileges While the absolute and extreme version of this privilege is unmistakable and easy to identify a milder variant affects a large number of otherwise well intentioned decent individuals One that makes men appear defensive tiny and petulant to put it bluntly It s what s known as the not all men syndrome Not all men are sexist as women are aware And yet this coexists with the fact that every single day of their existence all women without exception must navigate a world that seems feels and is perceived as a devil s obstacle course of the actual sort One that is at the very least distinct and challenging from what men go through That s the shambles they re in That s the problem they re dealing with The problem is that no one is immune to the patriarchy and sexism that are ingrained into us The kind that was left to us as a legacy when we were young and careless The kind that is present in the air we breathe the systems with which we engage and the institutions to which we belong Take a look around A man or any role he performs is never the target of any slang or slur worth its salt Whether she is a mother sister or daughter terrible language is always about mutilating the woman s genitals in every language It won t suffice if you aren t discriminatory yourself You are a part of the problem if you do nothing to address its presence The argument is that while we may not be sexist in some areas we are still sexist in many others For example you can be overtly sexist covertly sexist or subliminally sexist
