Every time we change, we become a better person than we were before, but the process of changing requires you to go through something so horrible and toxic for you that you had no choice but to change in order to survive such situations in the future. 

People say things like "It's fantastic that you changed after that happened," but I just want to say "I'm sorry you had to go through it, and I'm sad no one witnessed it." 

Small mistakes are overlooked because individuals are unwilling to change, but when they become something beyond your control, you must adapt to the situation. 

blessings for those who will be affected by this shift and power to those who are going through it.
