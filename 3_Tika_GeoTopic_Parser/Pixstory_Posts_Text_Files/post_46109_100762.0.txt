I used To think " Friendship Was Sleepovers and Play dates " ! ❤️

Now I know It's Not ! ❌

Friendship is Three in the morning when i talk about what happened the day before and why the hell I'm still awake . 🤔😍

Friendship Is three in the afternoon Laughing soo hard on the floor at a corny joke for the third time of the day . 😂🤞

Friendship Is Sitting on the couch for hours talking through anything and everything without a time limit .❤️

Friendship is Love in the strangest Ways when all else is lost ❤️🤞
