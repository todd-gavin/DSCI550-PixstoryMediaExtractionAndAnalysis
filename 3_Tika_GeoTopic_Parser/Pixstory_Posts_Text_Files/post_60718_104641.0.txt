I like to read, and i take it as a hobby. 
I think books are best material to gain information, by reading you understand the mindset of the writer so its a good way to improve your ability to understand people (At least i think that).

Here are some book that i like and you can try:

1. What it Takes to Be Free
This book is for people who believe personal freedom is the most important thing in life. This book is absolutely made for all those who feel caged in their lives. This book enables us to find our own way of living in accordance with who we are.

2. Do Epic Shit
Do Epic Shit is a reminder to keep experiences fun and try things that push you outside your comfort zone. Doing Epic Shit can be as simple as going for a ride you've never ridden.

3. Deep Work
Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction a cognitively demanding task. Its a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time.
