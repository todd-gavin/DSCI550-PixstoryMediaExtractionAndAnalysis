Pollution have a major impact on one health and all of us are aware about this fact and so we work towards reducing the pollution. 

New reports from  American Lung Association (ALA) states that more than 40 percent of the American are living in a place where there are unhealthy levels of particle pollution or ozone. 

The reports on "State of the Air" shows how air pollution is becoming a huge concern and is turning into problem for many Americans. 

It's estimated that two million more people are breathing unhealthy air in their community while checking with the last year reports. 

The report adds in that during the last three years Americans experienced "very unhealthy" and "hazardous" quality of air when compared to the previous reports taken during the two decades. 

Dr. Meredith McCormack, an ALA national spokesperson and a pulmonary and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said that, “The fact that we see an increase in the number of Americans that are impacted by particulate pollution compared to last year really demonstrates that air quality remains an important concern for the public." 

Climate change canceling out gains in other areas 

The reports of this year involves data from 2018 till 2020. It looks into two most common types of air pollution which are fine particle pollution and ozone pollution. 

According to the reports in the recent years emissions from transportation, power plants and manufacturing have gone down. 

Even though emissions related to fossil fuels have reduced in US, climate change leads to lack of good quality of air.
