Isn't it beautiful ? You must have definitely seen something like these before? It's nothing extraordinary for sure.  But for me, who wanted to run away from the humdrum of a busy city life, a city like Kolkata, just for a day atleast, were absolutely breathtaking .  On a sultry summer day I had nothing more to ask for. A clear blue sky, patches of " puffy" cotton like clouds floating by and a serene atmosphere made me forget what I left behind.
Located amidst beautiful natural displays, "Breathing Earth"  pampered my soul with awe-inspiring memories that will last a lifetime. This resort is blessed with its rustic magic.  "Breathing Earth" is one of the top weekend resorts near Kolkata and not a single second spent here is devoid of fun. A pristine retreat located far away from the claustrophobic rush of the metro city. A perfect respite from the mundane city life. The vibrant colours and peaceful ambience made my stay there so refreshing and rejuvenating. It surely has become one of the most sought-after destinations for me, especially whenever the heart desires to 'breathe' embracing the cycle of giving and receiving.
