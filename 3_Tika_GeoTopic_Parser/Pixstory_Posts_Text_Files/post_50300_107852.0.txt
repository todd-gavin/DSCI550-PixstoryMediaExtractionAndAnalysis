After joining as SP, Bagaha, I was pleased to find myself in the lap of nature. I had an opportunity to see the birds about which I used to read in books. I was now very close to the famous Valmikinagar National Park famous for its tigers, leopards and other wildlife and felt like reliving the adventures of jungle lovers like Corbett and others. I had never liked city life fully and had always wanted to live in a peaceful and picturesque surrounding. The opportunity for all that I once visualized was seen right there in Bagaha. The IG and DIG camped with me in Bagaha for the next 3 days and I was gradually getting familiarized with the place which would be my home and workplace in the following months. During the first week I almost had no contact with the outside world remaining away from TV or internet. I was busy transforming myself for the challenging days ahead and was interacting with local people and police officers, making efforts to understand the reasons behind the turmoil the place was faced with.

Bagaha had 17 Police Stations with 2 police subdivisions headed by DSP’s along with a DSP at the headquarters.  A senior IPS officer who was then leading the police at Muzzafarpur was called to Bagaha to brief me for the responsibility. He had been very successful in Bagaha with people still remembering him like a hero. He had worked very effectively in Bagaha in very turbulent times. I learnt a lot from his experiences and through him also got connected to several informers and good citizens. He left after a night stay by the next evening train. When I had gone to drop him to the Railway Station, the scenes of the quite dark station reminded me of R.K. Narayan’s Malgudi Days. Something was very peculiar about Bagaha, its people, its characteristic lifestyle and over all ambience, which I had then felt would make a great book if properly catalogued.
