The "dizzying" new design of Liverpool FC's new away kit for the upcoming 2022–23 season will be worn against Man United in today's first preseason friendly. According to the design's 
description, "the city's dynamic music environment, and in particular, the pioneering role it played in the 90s dance music scene," served as inspiration.

The club stated: Playing to its own beat, Liverpool FC’s away shirt harps back to a time when its clubs ruled the world, with an iridescent, multi-coloured marbled pattern over a white base colour.”

The back of the garment is primarily white, with black sleeve cuffs and a central "dizzying design."

The 97 insignia, which is encircled by the eternal flames and is proudly displayed at the nape of the neck in honour of those who died at Hillsborough, is also featured on the reverse of the shirt.

The number this season has been changed from 96 to 97 in honour of Andrew Stanley Devine, who was the 97th person to die inexplicably as a result of the Hillsborough disaster.

The kit will be on general sale on August 19 along with new training gear, however it is now only available online through the official LFC site. According to Nike, the kit is created sustainably, with replica and on-pitch jerseys made of 100% recycled polyester fabric made from recycled plastic bottles.

There are currently no official pictures of the away goalie uniform, which will be entirely black. At 2:00 p.m. (BST), when Liverpool takes on Man United in Bangkok, Jurgen Klopp's team will debut the new uniform.
