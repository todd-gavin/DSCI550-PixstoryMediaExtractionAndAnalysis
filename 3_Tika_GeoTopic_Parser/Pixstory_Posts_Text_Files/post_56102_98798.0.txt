Hyperbole and Understatement are two literary devices that confuse people. Hyperbole mostly emphasizes, evokes powerful feelings, and creates sharp impressions. As a figure of speech, it is usually not meant to be taken literally.



Heroic dramas, which are dramas with an emphasis on grandeur often make use of hyperbole for the effect and epic nature of the genre. Modern tall tales also make use of hyperbole to exaggerate the conquests and characteristics of their protagonists.

Examples: She had a thousand missed calls.
I have told you a million times not to lie.
I am so hungry, I could eat a horse.

Understatement is almost the opposite of hyperbole. It represents something as very much less in importance than it is normally considered to be. It is often ironic an equally intense response is expected in severe situations, but the statement in response is the opposite of what was expected.
Examples“It was O.K.” – Said by the student who got the highest score on the test.
“It is a bit nippy today.” – Describing the temperature, which is 5 degrees below freezing.
