Subhadra and her daughter Tanvi live in the labour camp of a Gurgaon site Since the childcare centre at the construction site was closed due to pandemic Subhadra took upon the role of being Tanvi s educator along with being her main caregiver I have learnt the activities from the cr che Didi When the lockdown started we had to save every penny to make sure we had food Tanvi was very irritable and restless Now she forces me and her father to spend time with her floating pieces of paper in the water jumping in and out of the circle reciting poems and listening to stories Playing with her has allowed us moments of peace during this very difficult time shared Subhadra During pandemic conditions it was easy to overlook the needs of young children But with a little help and a lot of resilience parents like Subhadra are making sure their children are happy healthy and intellectually stimulated
