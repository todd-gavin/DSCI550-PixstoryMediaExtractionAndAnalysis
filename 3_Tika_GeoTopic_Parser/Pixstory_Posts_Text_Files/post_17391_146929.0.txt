Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) midfielder Carlos Soler has claimed that Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are quite approachable despite their esteemed stature in the sport.
Soler, 25, arrived at the Parc des Princes from Valencia in a deal worth up to â‚¬21 million on the deadline day of the summer transfer window. He made his debut for the Parisians during his team's 2-1 win over Juventus in the UEFA Champions League on September 6.
Overall, the midfielder has featured in just 10 minutes of action for his new club across all competitions, making three substitute appearances.
In an interview with AS, Soler was asked if his friends in Spain have inquired about his experience of sharing a dressing room with superstars like Messi, Mbappe and Neymar.
