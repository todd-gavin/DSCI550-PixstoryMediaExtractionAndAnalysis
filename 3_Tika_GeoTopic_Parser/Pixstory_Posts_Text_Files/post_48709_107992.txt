Around a week ago Rebel Wilson came out as lesbian who s in a relationship with fashion designer Ramona Agruma Soon later it was revealed that the actress had only been allowed two days by the Sydney Morning Herald to make a public announcement about her new relationship before they d publish it themselves Wilson was forced to come out before she was intending to IF she was intending to Outing celebrity is one dark part of journalism that has existed here for long enough to do significant harm But why is outing a person wrong Isn t it something that gives them courage to come clean and in fact a favor on them No One the world is not entitled to their identity or sexuality And two they don t owe you their life When a person isn t ready for others to know it can be difficult to tell They may not be totally certain of who they are and do not want others to know until they are Doing such things could put them in danger with their family They could be thrown out forced to do something they don t want to do physically mentally or even sexually harmed and a variety of other things It takes a lot of trust and courage to come out If someone comes out to you and just you they most likely have a lot of faith in you And if you accidentally found out this scoop it s putting them in a stressful position too Either ways it s not your secret to tell
