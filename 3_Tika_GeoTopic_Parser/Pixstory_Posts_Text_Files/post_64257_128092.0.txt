I. it is an honor that we exist in the same
space and time didn't choose to separate us
by eons.
2. the world is a better place with your soul
in it.
3. laughing with you plucks anxiety out of
my heart, you are a gift to my lungs.
4. your past is not a threat, it's what brought
you to me.
5. i pray about you, still.
