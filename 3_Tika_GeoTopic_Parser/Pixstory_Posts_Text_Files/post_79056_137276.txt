It s the day I can t lie to you I am very very nervous Not necessarily because I am not confident in the team but more because of the magnitude of the game Last night I was thinking of teams that Arsenal have massive rivalries with and for me only Tottenham is more fierce that Manchester United Historically this game means lots and today it s just as important Win and we continue our streak make it points from and create a four point gap between us and second place Manchester City Lose and we re still first but our great momentum in the first five games this season will be over points and as always bragging rights on the line I would love nothing more than to see those United content creators who have been talking about humbling Arsenal all week watch their club lose That s why this game means so much Emotion aside this is going to be a very tough fixture I like Eric Ten Haag He s clearly a great manager He s finally stopped persisting with his system of playing out of the back which is unfeasible with the likes of De Gea and Varane and adopted a more pragmatic approach suited to his players Casemiro is undeniably a huge acquisition for their midfield a maestro in duels and screening the back four but again a player who could be susceptible to press For this very reason I think today s game will be won in the midfield Odegaard has to start if fit he leads the press Xhaka I have no doubt will excel as he always does So then it comes down to Sambi Lokonga I for one thought he was exceptional vs Villa but this game is a different kettle of fish On paper his job is simple keep the ball moving don t get caught in possession and screen that back four No denying it this will be a tough day for Sambi With all that said and possibly thinking with my heart not my head I ll say Arsenal
