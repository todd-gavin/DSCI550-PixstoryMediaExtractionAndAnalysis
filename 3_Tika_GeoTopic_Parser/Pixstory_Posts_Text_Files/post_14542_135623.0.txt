Sleep is an important aspect of our life  it is through this process our body renews its energy and recharges us. Now according to new studies if a teenager doesn't get a sufficient amount of sleep then they maybe at risk for increased health problems like obesity and high blood pressure. 
The research presented at the ESC Congress 2022 states that those adolescents who sleep for less than eight hours a night is more likely to be at risk for these health conditions. 
As per the study it found only 34 percent of 12 years old got eight hours of sleep. And the percentage dropped down to 24 percent and to 19 percent at 14 and 16 years. 
Children who got less than 7 hours of sleep were 21% more likely to have obesity at age 12 and 72% more likely age age 14, compared to children who got over 8 hours of sleep. 
Dr. Louis Morledge, an internist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said that, “Sleep should be regarded as a pillar of comprehensive healthcare, complementing nutrition and physical activity on a daily basis in order to maintain optimal health". "Americans young and old would benefit from a good night’s sleep in addition to eating a healthy diet and regularly engaging in physical activity for overall health.” 
Now what's the connection between sleep and health issues like these? Let's find it out. 
So by missing out sleep can cause an imbalance in the hormones which regulates appetite and metabolism. Studies have proven that with sleep restriction there is an increased rate of hunger and appetite, especially for foods that's high in calories. 
Heather Turgeon and Julie Wright, psychotherapists, authors, and sleep experts, said that, “Being sleep deprived makes you feel like you’re hungry, and makes you crave and reach for unhealthy foods". 
“Sleep loss can also cause chronic inflammation because the brain and body are left in a continual state of stress. That has a direct impact on immediate and long-term health.”
