One of the gaming s most beloved and dreaded titles Dark Souls franchise is renowned for its extreme difficulty unforgiving attitude and great level design Dark Souls upon its release was hailed as a masterpiece which spawned two more sequels three different inspired titles and one remake These include Dark Souls Dark Souls Bloodborne Sekiro Demon Souls remade and Elden Ring Traversing Lordran for the first time gives you such a sense of awe that exploration comes naturally and that is something that FromSoftware rewards greatly The design of the worlds in Dark Souls and all its other subsequent titles is both visually astonishing and mind blowing when you come to realize just how detailed and intricate the worlds of Lordran Drangleic and Lothric are The whole series is morose and the mood is always dark In each of the Dark Souls titles you watch helplessly as everyone you encounter is slowly driven mad by their lack of humanity in this cesspool of a world plagued by the curse of undeath something you too are afflicted with Dark Souls is notorious for its incredibly difficult and challenging gameplay Each time you die you lose all your accumulated souls which act as both skill points and currency and are presented with only a single chance to retrieve it again without dying This is by far what certainly gave it the reputation it has to this day In Dark Souls you are never safe unless in front of a bonfire which is your only real friend in the game as you can encounter dangers from any corner and enemies can kill you within moments To many the game was a breath of fresh air in the way of difficulty as most games have their own difficulty setting where you can adjust the difficulty according to your preference Well Darks Souls is having none of this nonsense In Yoda s wise words Do Or do not There is no try You can only fight struggle and win You cannot try to fight and struggle to win So you best bring you re A game or else prepare to die
