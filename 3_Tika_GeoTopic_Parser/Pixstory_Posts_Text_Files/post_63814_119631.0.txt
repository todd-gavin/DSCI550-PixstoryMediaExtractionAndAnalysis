In a new development for Grand Theft Auto, the sixth installment of the game will feature a playable female protagonist for the first time. Rockstar apparently plans to launch the game with a single city, but add more locations over time through updates.
 
According to a Bloomberg report, the woman character is a Latina, and will be one of a pair of leading characters in a story influenced by the bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde. Female protagonists have previously only been available as custom characters in GTA Online, never in the game's single player campaigns. 
 
 The launch version of GTA 6 will begin with a fictionalized Miami and surrounding areas (presumably a return for Vice City). It will later be updated with "new missions and cities on a regular basis".
 
  Developers have so far been skeptical about predictions for a launch between April 2023 and March 2024 due to multiple changes on the team and bottlenecks in production. 

Some developers are even said to have quit due to a lack of progress on the game recently.

 Developers on the team reportedly expect the game to be at least two years away, with no concrete release date established as of yet.
