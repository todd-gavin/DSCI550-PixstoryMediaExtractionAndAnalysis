Stray Kids‘ official YouTube channel recently dropped a trailer for a new series the group filmed, “2 Kids Room.” The YouTube series will start to air on January 24th, 2022. This means that excited fans will only have to wait less than a week.

The trailer is very short, showing each of the members individually, talking while seated in front of a plain backdrop. But since Stray Kids have filmed multiple series like this before, it is easy to guess the concept.

In the past, Stray Kids has shown fans their personalities in unscripted conversations between members.

“Kids Room” was almost like a dating-style game in which each member took a turn sitting in a room by themselves and asking two alternating members questions.

Not only was this series entertaining, but it gave some unique insight into the members’ personalities.

Another similar series they filmed was “One Kid’s Room,” in which a member sat by themselves, talking to the camera. All the other members were seated together, listening and chiming in with their own personal stories and thoughts.

And with the introduction of this new series, “2 Kids Room,” it looks like Stays will probably get to see a similar variety of conversations with the members throughout the 28 planned episodes.

“2 Kids Room” will undoubtedly show new sides of the members and will definitely be a must-watch for Stays.
