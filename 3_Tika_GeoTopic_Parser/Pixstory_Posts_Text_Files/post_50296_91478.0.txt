Tourism at the historically famous fort suffered earlier due to the fear of dacoit gangs, and presently it was due to the presence of Maoists who had reportedly also used the Fort Premises occasionally to impart training to newly recruited cadres. The senior cop mentioned that if something could be done which would restore the semblance of Rohtas, it would be great. With these words in mind and with a long cherished dream of seeing the fort in all its majesty, I joined Rohtas.

Prior to joining at Rohtas, I had been closely following the news from Rohtas in the media and was aware that owing to the escalated Maoist activities in the region and owing to the tough terrain it was not going to be easy. The Maoists had been on the offensive in Rohtas where only in the preceding July of 2007, the Police Stations of Rajpur and Baghela in the plains of Rohtas had been attacked by the Maoists, resulting in severe damage to the buildings and in heavy casualties. 2 CRPF personnel had also been killed in a landmine blast near Dhansa in the first week of the preceding June during the ascent uphill. The Rohtas Police had lost the DSP of Bikramganj in April, 2006 in an encounter with the Maoists in the plains of Rohtas.  The Story in Rohtas so far had been one tilted heavily in favour of the Maoists who were using the hilly and difficult terrain to their advantage. The Maoists had been using the Hills as a stronghold to launch attacks on the police in the plains.
