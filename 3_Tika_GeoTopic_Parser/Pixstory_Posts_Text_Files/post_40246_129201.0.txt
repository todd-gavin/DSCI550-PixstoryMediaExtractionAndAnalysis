In the past couple of years this potato which is a Portuguese-import has got itself a ‘not-so-amazing’ reputation in the world of fitness and nutrition. And for valid reasons! 

Potatoes should simply not be a part of your diet!

As per Harvard Edu, in the United States, 126 pounds of potatoes are consumed annually per person. However, because they include a lot of the sort of carbohydrate that the body digests quickly and sends blood sugar and insulin on a spike and then a dip, potatoes aren't considered a vegetable on Harvard's Healthy Eating Plate (in scientific terms, they have a high glycemic load). 

For instance, a cup of potatoes and a can of cola or a handful of jelly beans both have a similar impact on blood sugar levels. A high dietary glycemic load can have a roller-coaster-like impact that makes people feel hungry again quickly after eating, which may subsequently cause them to overeat. 

In the long run, diets rich in potatoes and other foods that digest quickly, high carbohydrate foods can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Therefore, stay away from those potatoes!
