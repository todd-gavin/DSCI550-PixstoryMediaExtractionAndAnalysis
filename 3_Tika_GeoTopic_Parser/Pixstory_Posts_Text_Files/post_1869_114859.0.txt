Given the kind of films popular in late-1960s & early-1970s, it would have been very hard for Bachchan to get a break as a hero in those days. He was tall, gangly, awkward while dancing, and singularly unsuited to mouthing romantic dialogues. 

Anand 1971 was his first major break, but it was a hit because of Rajesh Khanna. 

1971-72 were the hardest years for Bachchan. The films he got in the wake of Anand, films like Pyaar Ki Kahaani, Sanjog, Bansi Birju, Bandhe Haath all tanked, and some of them so badly that it was hard to see where Bachchan would go from there. Bachchan once told his father that he saw himself in the Balraj Sahni mode, doing serious character roles. The producers of the era (including Manmohan Desai who dismissed him off as a "Lambu") did not quite see it that way. He was ousted from a couple of films & asked to return the signing money. 

How did Bachchan keep going in those dark days? How did he keep himself motivated? How did he stay financially afloat? All one knows is that his intimate circle of friends - Mehmood, Shatrughan Sinha, Jaya Bhadhuri & Hrishikesh Mukherjee - somehow kept him going. Shashi Kapoor once said that sometime in 1972. he saw Bachchan, with tears in his eyes, standing in a queue to be hired as an extra. He was in dire straits, emotionally as well as financially. Shashi Kapoor persuaded him to go home. Kapoor was convinced that Bachchan was a good actor & that he would make it big one day.
