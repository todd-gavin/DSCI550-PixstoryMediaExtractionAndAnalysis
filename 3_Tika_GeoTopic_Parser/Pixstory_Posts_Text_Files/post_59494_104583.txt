One of the best films produced by Bollywood in recent years The casting direction music war scenes cinematography dialogues acting historical sets and so on are all incredibly well executed The total weight of the film is raised to spine chilling proportions by the theatre experience Manushi Chikar and Akshay Kumar particularly Akshay Kumar have provided outstanding performances He looks and acts exactly like Prithviraj Chauhan One of Bollywood s most aesthetically appealing creations In the first half the grip is fantastic It loses a little momentum in the second half but it reclaims it near the conclusion Finally a fantastic historical film that every Indian should see in a theatre
