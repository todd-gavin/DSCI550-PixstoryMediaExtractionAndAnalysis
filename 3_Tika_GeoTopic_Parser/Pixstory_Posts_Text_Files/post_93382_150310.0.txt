Haryana rugby team won 2 matches in 36th National Games Gujarat.
On 28 September Haryana men Rugby team won two matches beating Gujarat by 28–00 points and Services by 15–00 points.
This is not the first time that the team has started off with a thumping victory, Haryana men's rugby football team has a distinct identity in rugby.  If we talk about national Championships, the men's rugby team of Haryana is the national champion for the last 6 consecutive times.  In the 34th National Games, the team had stood Runner Up, while in the 35th National Games held in Kerala, the team won the champion trophy.  Behind this success of Haryana Rugby is the hard work of former rugby player and coach Sarvinder Dabas.  According to Sarvinder Rugby is not only his passion but also in his veins.  If could he, would not leave the rugby field.  On a regular basis, Sarvinder keeps in touch with every player and checks that the player is completely fit and practices regularly in the playground.  Haryana Rugby Football Association secretary general Narender Mor says that Sarvinder's hard work and constant practice of almost the entire team on the same ground is the main reason for the team's success.  It is rare that your entire team practices on the same ground continuously.  With the help of the players in Nangal Kalan, the Association has prepared its ground, which gives the biggest advantage to the team.
Sarvinder is also the President of Haryana State Rugby Football Association and having fine tuning with Secretary General Narendra Mor, moreover both are having fine tuning with team members. This mutual respect and tuning between players and officer bearers  is going well and Haryana Men team is excelling.  
Now it's the time to think ahead of the men's team.  Where the men's team performs best at the National level, the women's and junior team are still negligible in Haryana.
