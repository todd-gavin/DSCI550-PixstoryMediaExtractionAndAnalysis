 Each game is a different story If I d started with Rodrygo and Camavinga we might not have had so much control in the first minutes If Kroos and Modric had come on instead we might not have had that energy that we had But choosing is like betting Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose Today the Real Madrid coach made a good bet ABOUT THE COMBINATION OF ALABA AND RUDIGER I wanted to have more aerial presence and R diger perhaps has more than Alaba But Alaba is incredible going forward ON THE SQUAD S CONTRIBUTION AND THE ROLE OF CERTAIN PLAYERS If I wanted to protect a player I d leave them at home I made four changes and it could ve been five But I could ve used any player and I decided to send on Dani for the last change because he s got more experience ON THE GAME INTENSITY We had a very good start We controlled the game well and struck early We then dropped our intensity a bit we weren t effective up front and it became more difficult after they equalised because there were a lot of stoppages The game became end to end and that suited us We were very slow We weren t able to transition well at the start of the second half and they set up well defensively We were struggling so I decided to change the intensity of the game
