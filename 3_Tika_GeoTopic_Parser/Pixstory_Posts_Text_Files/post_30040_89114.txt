Suddenly the number one in women&#39;s tennis announces her retirement from the circuit Ashleigh Barry said she has nothing left to give to tennis after winning Wimbledon and the Australian Open I am so grateful to tennis that it has made all my dreams come true but I know that the time has come to hang up the racket and pursue other dreams The victory at Wimbledon last year changed me a lot as a person and as an athlete I thought about it a lot after Wimbledon Then came the challenge of the Australian Open and I think it was the way more perfect to celebrate the wonderful journey of my tennis career There was a change of perspective in this second part of my career My happiness was no longer dependent on results Success as I define it knowing that I gave all I could give I am satisfied I&#39;m happy Physically I have nothing left to give I gave everything to tennis Barty won Grand Slams in her career and was number one for weeks
