People love their pets and dogs are the most loved animals around the world. Those who have one, cherish them and others, dream of having one someday. 

They are adorable, loyal and brave. But sometimes, people blow it while choosing their pups or they fail to train them right. This could lead to macabre circumstances. If the dog isn't trained properly or isn't one to be domesticated, they become a danger to everyone around them.

As Dr. Vinod Sharma of DCC Animal Hospital quoted in Indian Express "I do believe certain breeds should be banned in India, which are not appropriate for people here — especially those that are high in energy and strength. At the same time, a good training [of the pet] is needed. Some breeds require more exercise, attention and care. It is not appropriate to randomly pick dogs from anywhere, when there is no proper record of their nature and breed.”

He added that it all depends on how the puppies are looked after with and without their mother, and what kind of treatment they are receiving in their human home. “Many people chain them up and not feed them properly, and that can make them turn ferocious. Many pets are beaten, too. Dogs [like pitbull] must always be supervised, and not left alone at home,” he said.

Hence, it is extremely important to choose the correct breed of dog and it depends on many factors, such as, the size of your house, climate of your city, your lifestyle or whether you'll be able to provide your pet with the required amount of exercise.
