The World Cup final will take place in the Lusail Stadium on 18 December and for a few hours on Tuesday, Google revealed which sides would be competing in the showpiece.
In a strange mistake, the search engine claimed that Brazil would be playing France in the decider of the 2022 World Cup, with the two nations down to face off against each other at the Lusail Stadium on that date.
The match was listed under 'Lusail Stadium events' on Google, alongside the six group stage ties that the stadium is due to host alongside one game at each stage of the knockout rounds.
It is unclear why Brazil and France were generated to appear in the final match.
It is normal that Google shows teams as 'TBC' (to be confirmed) for matches that are not yet definitive, such as in football knockout tournaments. The same is true if the date of a match or venue has yet to be decided.
Google corrected the error hours later with the search results for 'Lusail Stadium events' no longer showing Brazil and France as finalists.
