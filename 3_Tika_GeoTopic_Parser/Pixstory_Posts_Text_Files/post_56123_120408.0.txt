Women are appreciated for the achievements they have and are made the epitome of feminism! What about the women who make small life changes? What about women ranting about an ex-who possibly has affected her mental health? 

She is being trolled and made fun of and even portrayed as a really bad person. When it comes to men-y'all are like- yo bro I feel the same, lol! Feminist women come in the opposition! I don't understand these dynamics. 

Look at the number of memes-disregarding women- stereotyping women as the destroyers-house wreckers in a relationship! Why does there have to be so much drama when one doesn't even want it? Doesn't imperfect women want to survive in this world?
