The US secretaries of state and defence met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday night, the highest-level visit by an American team to the war-torn country's capital since Russia's invasion began. 

US News reported that in an interview with Ukrainian television, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych confirmed the meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 

It occurred as Ukraine lobbied the West for more strong weapons to counter Russia's operation in eastern Ukraine's Donbas area, where Moscow's forces were attempting to drive the last Ukrainian troops out of the damaged port of Mariupol.

“Yes, they’re meeting with the president. Let’s hope something will be decided on further help,” Arestovych said in an interview on Ukrainian TV.

Before the meeting, Zelenskyy stated that he expected the Americans to deliver results in terms of armaments and security guarantees. 

"You can't come to us empty-handed today, and we're expecting certain items and particular weaponry, not just presents or some kind of cake," he stated.

Let’s see if anything fruitful comes out of this!
