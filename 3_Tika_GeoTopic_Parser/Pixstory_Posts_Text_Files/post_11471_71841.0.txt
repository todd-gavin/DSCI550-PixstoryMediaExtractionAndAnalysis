Most of the health concerns involving energy drinks center on their caffeine content. Importantly, it is generally recommended that adults consume no more than 400 mg of caffeine per day. Energy drinks typically only contain around 80 mg of caffeine per 8 ounces (237 ml), which is pretty close to an average cup of coffee.

The problem is that many energy drinks are sold in containers larger than 8 ounces (237 ml). On top of that, several energy drinks also contain herbal extracts like guarana, a natural source of caffeine that contains around 40 mg of caffeine per gram. 

Energy drink manufacturers are not required to include this in the caffeine content listed on the product label, which means the total caffeine content of many beverages can be drastically underestimated.

Depending on the type and size of the energy drink you consume, it is not hard to exceed the recommended amount of caffeine if you consume multiple energy drinks in one day.

Although occasionally drinking one energy drink is unlikely to cause any harm, it is probably wise to avoid consuming energy drinks as a part of your daily routine.

If you decide to consume energy drinks, limit them to no more than 16 ounces (473 ml) of a standard energy drink per day and try to limit all other caffeinated beverages to avoid excessive intake of caffeine. Pregnant and nursing women, children and teenagers should avoid energy drinks altogether.
