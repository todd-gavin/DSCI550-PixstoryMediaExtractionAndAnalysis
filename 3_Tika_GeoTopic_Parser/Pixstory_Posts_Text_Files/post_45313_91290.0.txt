According to rumours in his hometown, Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea was furious with Luis Enrique after learning that he had been left out of Spain's recent friendlies. 

The 31-year-old goalkeeper has 45 appearances for La Roja, the most recent of which was in October 2020. De Gea has struggled for consistency at club level in recent seasons, but he has recently returned to form, strengthening his prospects of regaining international recognition. 

Enrique, however, chose Athletic Bilbao's Unai Simon, Brighton's Robert Sanchez, and Brentford's David Raya over the former Atletico Madrid man for the recent matches against Albania and Iceland. 

De Gea has been a regular in the squad for many years, despite his United form fluctuating, so he was shocked to learn he would not be joining his countrymen for the last fortnight. According to Sport Witness, the shot-stopper was particularly enraged with Enrique since he did not agree with the logic behind his exclusion from the squad. After the 5-0 win over Iceland on Tuesday, 

the 51-year-old referenced De Gea briefly, adding, "David, I want to try other goalkeepers."

Enrique has been the manager of Spain since 2019, taking them to the Euro 2020 semi-finals last summer. Meanwhile, De Gea has not played for his country since making a costly error that allowed Ukraine to win a Nations League match. If rumours in Spain are to be believed, tensions between players and managers are rising, which will not auger well for United if 
Enrique is hired as their next manager. 

Enrique did not rule out managing Manchester United, but he stated that he will lead Spain in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar this winter, precluding him from joining the Premier League this summer, when Ralf Rangnick's interim spell ends. In June, Spain will play Portugal, the Czech 
Republic, and Switzerland in the Nations League, giving De Gea the opportunity to earn a recall.
