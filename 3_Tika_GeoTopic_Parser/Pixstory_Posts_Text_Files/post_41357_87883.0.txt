President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" on Wednesday, but he refused to accede to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's passionate request for a no-fly zone in a tearful video address before Congress. 

U.S News reported that Biden's remark comes three weeks after Russia launched an internationally criticised invasion of Ukraine, and it's the first time the American president has used the harsh term to describe Putin. The US has a formal mechanism in place to declare Putin a war criminal, which White House press secretary Jen Psaki said was ongoing at the State Department on Wednesday.

But Biden's remark, "I think he's a war criminal," in answer to a direct question from a reporter after an event the president held to commemorate the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, marks a diplomatic watershed. 

Psaki told reporters, "The president's statements speak for themselves." "He was speaking from his heart and from what you've seen on television, which is a horrific deed by a brutal dictator invading a foreign country," she said. 

"There is a legal process that is continuing," Psaki stated. The State Department is in charge of that."

Putin's invasion has resulted in numerous civilian losses, including more than 100 children, according to Zelenskyy, as well as attacks on civilian targets. Russia seized control of a Mariupol hospital on Tuesday, taking both physicians and patients hostage, according to Ukraine. 

The Senate unanimously declared Putin a war criminal on Tuesday. Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, said that he will launch an investigation into suspected war crimes committed by Putin.
