 You want to make the computer out of one piece of metal and you want it to be as thin as possible Norman said So you had to make the battery with no case so it gets really hard to get to You use glue instead of screws Yet the idea of a longer lasting phone needn t be a fantasy One already exists the Fairphone made by a startup Fairphone in Amsterdam The Fairphone which is sold only in Europe has a plastic cover that can be easily removed to expose its innards Its components can be swapped out in minutes by removing a few ordinary screws The idea behind the Fairphone is that if you want a phone with new technology you can get it without having to replace your current device entirely and if something goes wrong with the phone like you drop it it can be easily fixed That makes the Fairphone the antithesis of most smartphones today and shows how tech companies can design the gadgets differently for durability and sustainability How it could be with the hardware Take your iPhone or Android phone and look at it closely Notice how it is shut tight with unique screws that require special screwdrivers Apple even invented its own screw The following is a narration of the experience of one user But the Fairphone comes with a small screwdriver that invites you to open up the phone So when I began testing it that was the first thing I did Taking the Fairphone apart turned out to be a breeze Removing its plastic cover revealed its camera battery speakers and other components They were held in place with ordinary screws that could be quickly taken out with the screwdriver In less than five minutes I removed all of those parts In about the same amount of time I reassembled the phone The experience of taking the phone apart was empowering I had the confidence that if I had to do a repair or some basic maintenance like swapping in a new camera or battery I could do so in minutes and for cheap
