On the first day of Commonwealth Games 2022 (CWG 2022) in Birmingham, the Indian badminton team started their mixed team championship defence on a strong note by defeating Pakistan 5-0. In peak form, players like Kidambi Srikanth and PV Sindhu defeated their opponents with ease. At the quadrennial competition, women's cricket made its debut. Team India started their campaign with a heartbreaking three-wicket loss against archrivals Pakistan. The Indian women's table tennis team had a successful outing, winning 3-0 against South Africa and 3-0 against Fiji, respectively. Shiva Thapa's victory over Suleman Baloch of Pakistan in the men's 63.5kg Round of 32 boxing match raised the fever.
