All of Queen Elizabeth's family members, including Prince Harry, rushed to Scotland to be by her side after she was placed under medical monitoring at Balmoral Castle (her castle there) before her death! 

As Cosmopolitan reported, while Meghan Markle remained in the nation, Harry cancelled a previously scheduled engagement in England on Thursday to join his family at Balmoral. 

Omid Scobie, a royal correspondent, tweeted "According to a recent update from a source, only Prince Harry has travelled to Balmoral. The Duchess of Sussex is remaining in England, much like the Duchess of Cambridge, who is in Windsor with their three children (although she will not be present at tonight's WellChild Awards)."

Some are saying that this is because of the ongoing family feud while some maintain that this was done just for practical reasons. What do you think? 

For Kate it is being said that she stayed behind, and merely Prince William joined the rest of the royal family in Balmoral—including Prince Charles, Duchess Camilla, The Earl and Countess of Wessex, Prince Andrew and Prince Anne. 

Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, the children of Prince William and Kate Middleton, started school at Lambrook School in Windsor today.

Wonder what was Meghan’s reason!
