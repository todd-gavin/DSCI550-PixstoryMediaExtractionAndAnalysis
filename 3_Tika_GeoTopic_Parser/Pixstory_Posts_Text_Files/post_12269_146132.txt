My first time in Starbucks Couldn t resist the cost prices at first coz it was way to expensive for a newbie like me I ordered one cappuccino and one javachip Frappuccino it was delicious Simply amazing and was one of the bet coffee I ever experienced As a desert I ordered a red velvet cheese cake which was very expensive but decent in taste I would consider trying new coffee flavors
