Yet another day yet another instance of gun violence SWS shot and killed an year old black kid in Florence SC The Suspect shot over rounds at cars passing Local authorities are hiding the identity of the victims shot killed several vehicles hit and all of them are black Another racially motivated act So one question plain and simple when will all of this stop I am appalled how so many people are STILL constantly defending gun ownership as if their life depends on it Like what goes on in that mind of yours Do you not feel any empathy for innocent children that are killed Or the families that are destroyed Does all your empathy show up only when women want abortions How ironic is that the states with the strictest abortion laws are also the states with the loosest gun laws Gun related deaths total number of gun related deaths suicides mass shootings mass murders children killed yrs old Do not tell me it s a sacrifice we as a country are willing to make to protect our right to second ammendment as if our right to life does not matter at all This is ridiculous The Tulsa shooter bought his weapon of mass murder from a gun shop legally just a few short hours before the shooting Just a few hours Do you see how easy it is to commit mass murders in our country Unlike what Ted Cruz believes we DO NOT have enough laws
