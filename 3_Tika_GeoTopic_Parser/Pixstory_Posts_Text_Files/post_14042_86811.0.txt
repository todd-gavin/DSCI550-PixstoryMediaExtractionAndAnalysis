Addressing rumours about Rashford, Manchester Uniten Interim Manager Ralf Rangnick has said that supposedly if Marcus Rashford wants to leave in the summer he can and not now becuase the transfer window is closed. It has been clear cut from Rangnick who'll probably be in a consultant role in the next season that if you want to play for United you can but if not you're free to go. This comes some time after there were rumours that Rashford has been demanding more game time even after giving some weak performances.
