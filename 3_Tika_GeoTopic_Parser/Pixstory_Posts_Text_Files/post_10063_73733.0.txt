Gosh-e Fil is a traditional crumbly pastry originating from Afghanistan.

This sweet is mainly served with tea, especially during Eids and Nowroz.

It's usually made with a combination of oil, flour, baking powder, eggs, milk, icing sugar, cardamom, and pistachios. The dough is kneaded until smooth and firm, and it's then rolled out to a thin sheet of pastry.

Circles are cut out of the dough with a cookie cutter, and each circle is pinched at one point in order to form a fanned ear shape (gosh-e fil means elephant ears). The pastries are fried in oil until golden and then sprinkled with icing sugar, cardamom, and ground pistachios.
