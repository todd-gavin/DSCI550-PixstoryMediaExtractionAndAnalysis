We ve been talking about Texas messed up abortion and gun laws how women s bodies are more regulated than firearms that are being constantly used to kill people Because well its bizarre Why is a woman s body being made everybody s business while something that s actually being used to commit mass murders is not only legal but encouraged Turns out it isn t the most bizarre thing about Texas attitude towards women after all According to Section of the Texas penal code although it doesn t clearly state dildos the law still regulates the possession of obscene devices It states A person commits an offense if knowing its content and character he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device Meanwhile another section clearly prohibits the number of sex toys a person can own A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same This isn t one of those clickbait stories it was actually enforced within the last years when undercover cops used it to arrest someone throwing one of those MLM y passion parties in Burleston Texas in The woman arrested a former schoolteacher and mother of three was only arrested when she urged the device be used for improved sex rather than merely as a novelty gag gift and she faced a year in prison and a heavy fine at trial though the judge dismissed the case Honestly what are we doing
