I always call myself a Happy Miracle, a girl who is multitasking and passionate about whatever I do. I love to explore opportunities and the corporate world around me. I am a professional Dancer and had always been the topper of my school. A girl who loves traveling,dancing,singing, acting, fashion and everything that exists on this planet. I am happiness and want to spread happiness everywhere!! A girl who is strong at heart and had always followed her heart.
Thankyou
