I have been researching about the mental health of pregnant women for this article, and I'm surprised I haven't found any articles that talks about women's mental health for them. All of them are about "How stress affects the baby?" "how to not overeat or put on weight during pregnancy because of stress?" and even something as audacious as "What amount of depression is normal in pregnancy and at what point you should see a therapist?"

I am absolutely appalled how these articles have been talking about women as if we are some sort of baby making machine who should only focus on its product. It's kind of funny and sad at the same time how these articles completely neglected that women's mental health matters on its own too and shouldn't have to have an effect on other people to be taken care of. The article that talked about when you should see a therapist especially baffled me. Is this even real? A woman is carrying another human being in her body which is taking an incredibly huge amount of toll on her physical health, and you still expect her to simply keep it all in until she just can't take it anymore?

Pregnancy is an extremely taxing experience, it's not just another stage in a human's life. And it people bearing a baby need extra care and attention – they deserve it. But not only they're not given that care, they are expected to just be silent about it in order to not spoil other people's mood, otherwise the wife jokes are just on the line. Mental health problems aren't some side effect of the pregnancy, it's a part of the process and deserves the same attention as other aspects of that stage does. Women are not obligated to give you a child, and if she's doing that – be very ready to take the responsibility of making it as easy for her as possible.
