Anyone in need of medical attention should be able to get it without fear of maltreatment, harassment, or outright denial. Despite current laws, LGBTQ people continue to encounter alarmingly high rates of discrimination in health care, ranging from provider harassment and humiliation to hospital, pharmacist, and doctor rejection. It's considerably worse for LGBTQIA individuals who aren't white. The LGBTQ community has historically and continues to be neglected by the US health-care system, with major gaps in sexual and reproductive healthcare and poorer health results than the overall population. These inequities are the result of a number of roadblocks in the health-care system, including service fragmentation, provider prejudice, and insurance concerns, all of which can be exacerbated by racism and intersecting oppressions.

Many employers do not give health insurance coverage for their employees' same-sex domestic partners. Many LGBT people are forced to go without insurance due to the high cost of private individual health insurance and administrative impediments to obtaining coverage.

Which is unfortunate to say the least. People are being denied basic treatment for their identity and others are just unaware of it â€“ or more accurately, ignorant about it. The only way to equality is if the privileged sects of the society gives the same attention to these issues as they give to issues concerning them. The treatment of the LGBTQ+ community as second class citizens, consciously or subconsciously, is leading to thousands of them living in fear and pain. There's an immediate need to close the healthcare disparities gap.
