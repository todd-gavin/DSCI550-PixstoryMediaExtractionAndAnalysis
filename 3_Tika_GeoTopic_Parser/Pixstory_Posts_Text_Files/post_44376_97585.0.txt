Jody Morris

Morris appeared in the Premier League more over 100 times, largely for Chelsea and a few
times for Leeds United, and won the FA Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup during his tenure at
Stamford Bridge.

He had a successful coaching stint in charge of the Blues' all-conquering youth team after
retiring in 2013, working with Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount, among others.

In 2018, he moved to Derby County with Frank Lampard before returning to Chelsea after
Lampard was named manager. Morris is now a free agent after Lampard was fired in January
2021, but he keeps his media profile high by criticising Thomas Tuchel, the current manager.

Dennis Wise

Wise, the original furious ant, is revered at Stamford Bridge for his leadership abilities and
dedication to the cause. Wise captained Chelsea for 11 years, winning two FA Cups, a League
Cup, and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and is the club's second most successful captain.

The midfielder was moved to Leicester in 2001 and relegated from the Premier League before
leading Millwall to the FA Cup final in 2004. After spells with Southampton and Coventry, he
retired two years later.

Before an ill-fated stint as Executive Director at Newcastle, Wise was a successful manager of
Swindon and, temporarily, Leeds. In Italy, he now serves as the sole administrator for Serie B
club Como 1907.

Celestine Babayaro

Babayaro spent eight seasons at Stamford Bridge, making 132 Premier League games before
moving to Newcastle in 2005. He'll always be remembered as an underappreciated element of
Chelsea's history. In Nigeria, the 43-year-old became a brand ambassador and is now a football
agent.
