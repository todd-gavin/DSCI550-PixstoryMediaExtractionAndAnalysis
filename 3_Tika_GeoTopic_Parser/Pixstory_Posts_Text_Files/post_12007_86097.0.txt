The first foreign tourists were welcomed to Indonesia's resort island of Bali on Monday. After the corona virus rules were relaxed, the quarantine requirement rule after the arrival has also been removed. The rules are being eased down as a decline of the infection was seen in the Southeast Asian country. 

Bali which have attracted 6.2 million foreign visitors in 2019, pre covid. Bali is known for its surfing, temples, waterfalls and nightlife. 

Only few visitors have come back to Bali after the restrictions were relaxed as many were discouraged by the quarantine and other rules. 

Under a pilot programme, fully vaccinated tourists now can skip a mandatory three-day quarantine, though they need to remain on the island for four days. 

"I think it's good for the island," said Jesse Rayman, 22, a Dutch tourist arriving at Bali's airport on Monday. "I hope everyone is able to travel safely in the future, and coronavirus wouldn't be much an issue anymore." 

With tourism normally making up over 50% of Bali's economy, many on the island have been desperate to see a faster return of tourists, particularly as some neighbouring countries moved faster. 

Thailand and the Philippines already have similar quarantine-free programmes in place for foreign tourists. 

Luhut Pandjaitan, a minister overseeing the COVID-19 response in Java and Bali, told a news conference on Monday that if the Bali pilot programme went well, all foreign visitors entering Indonesia would no longer be required to quarantine from April 1 or earlier.
