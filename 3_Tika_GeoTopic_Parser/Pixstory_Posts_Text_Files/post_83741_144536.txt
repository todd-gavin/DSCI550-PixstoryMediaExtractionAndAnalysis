There s something that I ve used in my own life that really really genuinely makes me a lot happier and I think more well adjusted and it s a rule that comes from the french author Voltaire and it s all about appreciation He says appreciation is a beautiful thing It makes what belongs to somebody else also belong to you And ever since I read that I ve been trying to apply it Like if I see someone who has like a great outfit I ll say hey I relish that outfit and in a weird way then the beauty of their fit also belongs to me And presumably if they feel happy about it then I also feel happier So I try to basically appreciate things like not just things that I have but things that others have that I think I don t because by appreciating them in a small little way I feel like I ve gained it as well because when somebody makes an effort it s a gift to you and you should appreciate that appreciate people for making an effort
