Sporting CP prodigy Rodrigo Ribeiro has become the youngest player in UEFA Champions League knockout history after becoming the youngest player in UEFA Champions League knockout history in Wednesday's last-16 clash against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.

The Portuguese team was eliminated from Europe's top division in the return match in England, but they were able to keep their dignity after a goalless draw with the Premier League champions after a 5-0 loss in the first leg.

Rodrigo, on the other hand, etched his name into history, giving the guests something else to rejoice about on the way home.

What progress has been made?
Rodrigo, who is 16 years and 315 days old, has become the Champions League's youngest player in the knockout stages, and the first to do it before turning 17.

Youssoufa Moukoko, who made his group-stage debut for Dortmund in 2020 at the age of 16 years and 18 days, is not the competition's youngest player.

In stark contrast, he was less than half the age of City goalkeeper Scott Carson, who, during a second-half cameo off the bench, became the player with the longest gap between Champions League appearances on the opposing side.

Sporting now has two home games left before the international break, trailing league leaders Porto by four points.

They'll also meet their title opponents in the second leg of the Taca de Portugal next month, after falling behind 2-1 in the first match.
Meanwhile, City will shift their focus to the Premier League, with one eye on who they might face in the Champions League quarter-finals when the draw is made.
Manchester City suffered a rare home blank against Sporting CP on Wednesday, but they had already done enough to qualify for the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals.
