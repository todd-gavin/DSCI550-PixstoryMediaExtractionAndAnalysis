A circular issued by the Directorate of Education regarding the reimbursement of tuition fees to minority students of classes 1 to 12 is widely being shared on social media with the claim that the Kejriwal-led AAP government in Delhi is trying to appease Muslims through such policies. It is alleged that the order is only applicable to Muslims.

BJP Delhi spokesperson and media in-charge, Harish Khurana, tweeted a screenshot of this circular saying that it is not wrong to accuse Kejriwal of indulging in Muslim appeasement as this circular is an example.

Another BJP spokesperson, Vikram Bidhuri, tweeted a screengrab of this circular asking whether being a Hindu is a crime. He further alleged that after the salary of maulvis (Muslim priests), the Kejriwal government will refund two-year fees of Muslim children studying in private schools.

Fact-check
We performed a keyword search and found a copy of the order on the website of the education department. Nowhere does the order state that the reimbursement of tuition fees is only applicable to Muslim minority students.

According to various news reports, the Delhi government has issued instructions to refund the tuition fees of eligible minority students of all private schools in Delhi. The Directorate of Education of Delhi in its instructions has asked the education officers to ensure the completion of the tuition fee refund process for minority students for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22. None of the news reports mentions that the policy is applicable to students of a particular religion only.

As per the website of the Delhi Minority Commission, “The Delhi Minorities Commission was set up under the Delhi Minorities Commission Act, 1999 passed by the Delhi Legislative Assembly on 24.12.99. The notified Minority Communities, as per the Act, are Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Parsis.” Evidently, the reimbursement of fees is applicable to all these minority groups present in the national capital.
