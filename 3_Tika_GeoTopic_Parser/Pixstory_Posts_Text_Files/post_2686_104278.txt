Shakuntala is an epic painting by celebrated Indian painter Raja Ravi Varma Ravi Varma depicts Shakuntala an important character of Mahabaratha pretending to remove a thorn from her foot while actually looking for her husband lover Dushyantha while her friends call her bluff Tapati Guha Thakurta an art historian wrote This very gesture the twist and turn of head and body draws the viewer into the narrative inviting one to place this scene within an imagined sequence of images and events On its own the painting stands like a frozen tableau like a still from a moving film plucked out of an on running spectacle of episodes
