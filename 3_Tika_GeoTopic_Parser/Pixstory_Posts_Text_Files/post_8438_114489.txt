India has to start their campaign in Pool B by playing England in this World Cup but unfortunately our team did not get a chance to assess their strength in the Pro League In fact at the time of the match due to the spread of covid and injuries to many England players it was not in a position to land the team Therefore in early April this year both these matches were cancelled and India was given the full points According to the format of this World Cup if the Indian team wants to make it directly to the quarter finals then it will have to beat China and New Zealand to get first place in their pool India has beaten China many times but its record against New Zealand is not quite promising However it s also a fact that New Zealand s team has played less in the last years due to covid and this time it did not even play in the FIH Pro League Indian team can get the advantage of this Till almost a decade ago the Indian women s team was grappling with a lack of facilities Because of this it could hardly get international experience Before the Olympics and the World Cup they used to meet for a couple of foreign tours but the situation has improved in the last few years Savita Poonia who has been leading the team for the last year due to Rani Rampal s injury says Participating in the Pro League giving players international experience and playing against top teams helped us prepare well for the World Cup and perform better The morale of the players to do it is also high We still regret being denied a medal by finishing fourth in the Tokyo Olympics We have learned a lot from this mistake of ours and we are eager to rectify it Her words have merit that s why there is hope for this team in the upcoming World Cup
