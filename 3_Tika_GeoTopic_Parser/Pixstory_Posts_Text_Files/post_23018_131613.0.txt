UEFA Euro 2022 champions England have announced a 23-player squad for their upcoming qualifiers against Austria and Luxembourg as Sarina Weigman’s Lionesses look to secure a spot in next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup which will take place in Australia and New Zealand. 
Chloe Kelly, who scored the winner against Germany in the final of the European Championship has been ruled out after picking up an injury with Manchester City in their Champions League qualifier loss against Real Madrid. Chelsea’s Fran Kirby also misses out due to a foot injury. Aston Villa goalkeeper Hannah Hampton is not a part of the squad due to ‘personal issues’. Hampton is replaced by Sandy MacIver who has joined Manchester City this summer. 
Chelsea’s Lauren James and Houston Dash’s Ebony Salmon have been received a call-up to the national team. 
The most notable absentees seem to be the duo of Ellen White and Jill Scott. The veterans, who lifted the Euros trophy this year have announced their retirement from football this week. 
Jordan Nobbs comes back into the squad after missing out on the Euros squad due to a knee injury. Manchester United captain Katie Zelem is also a part of the squad. 
Sarina Weigman: “We have lost four players in midfield and forward positions so I am pleased we can turn to experience in Katie and Jordan along with two for the future in Lauren and Ebony.”
