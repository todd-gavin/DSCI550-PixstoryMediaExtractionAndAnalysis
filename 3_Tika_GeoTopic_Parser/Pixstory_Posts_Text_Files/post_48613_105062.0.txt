“I love basketball more than I ever have right now,’’ Jimmy Boeheim said. “I’m so into it, there’s no way I can give it up right now. Whatever basketball throws at me, I’m ready and will attack it with all I got and continue to have fun and love the game.”

Buddy and Jimmy Boeheim have worked out for the Knicks as they chase their NBA draft dream. The NY Post reported that they have just one goal in mind: NBA.

“Buddy can shoot the ball,’’ Jim Boeheim said. “That’s always something people look at in today’s world. It’s a shooters game. He can at least get an opportunity whether it works or not.

The Boeheim brothers have a strong sibling rivalry, but if it comes to it, they would contemplate travelling to the same country together.

“Jimmy does more things, at 6-8. He’s a good team player, can help a team anywhere. He knows how to play and can shoot, too.’’

However, some people have doubts about them.

“Buddy has a good IQ, good handle, is a very good shooter but still not elite,’’ one NBA personnel director said. “And his athleticism is average. Jimmy has very good size, is tough, competitive — a good shooter whose size helps his NBA chances.’’
