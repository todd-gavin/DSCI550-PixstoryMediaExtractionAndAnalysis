The Indian women's hockey team will be up against Ghana on the opening day of the Commonwealth Games. As they enter the field, they would hope to leave the disappointment of the recently concluded World Cup behind them. They finished 9th in the competition. 

It wasn't that they were outplayed in any of the games, they just couldn't convert the numerous chances they created in every game. Be it circle penetrations or short-corners they were up at it. But those efforts didn't materialise in goals for the team. 

The 2002 champions will look to start their campaign at the best note possible. India and Ghana have faced each other only once. It was in 2014-15 when they beat them 13-0. The Savita Punia led side even in the absence of their regular skipper Rani Rampal will start as overwhelming favourites. 

Indian forwards, Vandana and Lalremsiami were in terrific form in the WC and at the CWG the team would once again expect them to deliver for them. While the team would wish that drag-flickers Gurjit Kaur and Deep Grace Ekka can convert short-corners into goals. If these two perform at their potential, India can be assured of a good outing. 

It's been a long wait for a medal at the CWG for women's hockey. They won a silver last time in 2006. They came close to winning a medal in Gold Coast in the last edition. But were beaten 6-0 by England to finish 4th.
