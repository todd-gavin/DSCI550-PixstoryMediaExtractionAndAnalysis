One of the most respected bands in the underground metal scene and one of the pioneers of the extreme metal genre Meshuggah are one of the biggest most powerful forces in metal to reckon with The Swedish metallers don t make music for causal listeners in fact it can almost sound like a strong sensory assault but given time and patience it really opens up to you and you just begin to see just how layered and dynamic their sound really is Starting out as an extreme thrash groove metal band on their debut their style has evolved significantly over the years and they have torched all the rules of music since then Meshuggah essentially invented their own style of music and have continuously redefined it with every idea they have ever had on their albums If Death was a pioneer in the death metal movement then Meshuggah grabbed metal by the horns and took it years into the future into unexplored territory Meshuggah are technical metal but they re insanely heavy as well Their riffs are like being buried under a building Meshuggah can also get a groove on like no other They take their unique guitar tone and they use it to craft some of the most amazing riffs and grooves you are ever likely to hear from a metal band The riffs can range from relatively simple to complex but it is the execution that really matters Meshuggah s music plays with such mechanical precision that it is hypnotic it is like a clock perfectly in sync with all its parts Ultimately virtuosity technicality and speed doesn t equal musical genius creativity does and Meshuggah is one of the most creative of them all From the methodical technical and calculated mayhem of Chaosphere to the full on raw vicious aggressive and intense metal masterpiece that is Obzen From the dark tribal monster grooves and heaviness of Koloss or the apocalyptic deconstruction of sound in The Violent Sleep Of Reason Meshuggah are a cornerstone in progressive metal and an institution in of itself which is consistent in defying expectations building a sound that no one else can create
