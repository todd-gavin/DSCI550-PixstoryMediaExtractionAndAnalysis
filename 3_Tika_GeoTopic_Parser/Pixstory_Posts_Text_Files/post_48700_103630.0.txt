In 2019, 15 states decided to include a question about transgender people in their YRBS (with Massachusetts not making its data publicly available). In these states, transgender children are more than twice as likely than cisgender students to report being bullied at school (43 percent vs. 17 percent) and online (34 percent vs. 14 percent) in the previous year. Over a third of students said they didn't attend to school at least once in the prior 30 days because they felt uncomfortable, and nearly as many (28 percent) said they were forced to have sex in the previous year. A majority of transgender students (61%) said they had felt unhappy or hopeless for two weeks, and alarmingly high numbers said they had pondered (45%) or tried (29%) suicide at least once in the previous year.

The 20 states that filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration are not among the states that included this question. As a reason, the voices of trans children from the states that are the most hostile towards them are remain unheard. (Source: Brookings.edu)

Now with such heartbreaking stats, whatever makes cisgender men think they can, or should be able to, decide whether trans rights should be taught in schools. And for how privileged they are, they sure have the audacity to think that their opinion on this count.

Transgender kids are living a nightmare in America every single day, and it seems like with each passing day we seem to fail them even more. It is important to educate kids about transgender people and their rights in schools so to prevent the discrimination. Trans people should not have to suffer the way they do just because some old white man said they should.
