American Scottie Scheffler has proved his rise to men's golfing world number one was no fluke, with a nerveless final round to win The Masters by three shots at Augusta National.

Australia's Cameron Smith started the day three shots behind Scheffler and maintained his challenge through the front nine, but a disastrous triple-bogey on the 12th ended his chances of victory.

Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy produced a stunning final round of 64 – one off the course record —to finish runner-up.

Scheffler, who took the world top ranking earlier this year, has now won his first major title – he has four Tour victories since February.

He took a three-shot lead into the final round, setting the stage for an Augusta shootout with Smith.

The Australian started brilliantly, with birdies on the first two holes to cut the lead down to one.

But with both players short of the green on the third, two chips would change the direction of the tournament.

Scheffler chipped in for birdie, Smith sent his long and made bogey. The American never looked back from there.

A steady front nine kept the lead at four, but a rare Smith birdie at the 11th took it back to three shots and set the stage for a closing showdown.

But the 12th, as it has so many times in Masters history, was decisive. Smith attempted an ambitious shot at the right-placed pin, but made one of his worst swings of the week.

The tee shot found Rae's Creek, and Smith was unable to recover. A triple-bogey six ended his charge.

From there, Scheffler was unflappable even as the roars echoed from around Augusta.

McIlroy drew the biggest of the day with an incredible holed bunker shot on 18 to complete his round, but even his presence at 7-under was not enough to spook Scheffler.
