The evolution of Granit XhakaHe wanted to leave in 2019. The fans had given up & his walk off against Crystal Palace was the final straw. Stripped of the captaincy, surely Xhaka’s Arsenal career was over? But then enter Mikel Arteta…Arteta has revived the Swiss international & more importantly found his ideal role. You see for so long Xhaka had been shoehorned as a defensive midfielder. While able to do a job, it always felt unnatural. Fast forward to 2022 & Xhaka has found his role. The number 8 or more specifically as a 2nd phase defensive midfielder. Playing higher up the pitch utilises Xhaka’s elite passing range much better, while also allowing him to take more risks. No surprise to hear then he’s made the joint most shot creating actions in the league this season. He provides the perfect balance to Arteta’s midfield 3, especially in the defensive phase. With his years of experience playing in a midfield pivot coming in clutch. Xhaka has already beaten his personal best in terms of goal involvements & we’re only 7 games in. What once looked like a error prone defensive midfielder, now looks like a top number 8. Granit Xhaka has evolved.
