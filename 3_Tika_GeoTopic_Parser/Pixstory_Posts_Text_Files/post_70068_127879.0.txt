In a thrilling and exquisite final of the State Basketball Championship, in the womenâ€™s category, it was a close neck to neck fight between Sonics and YMCA Infiknights. Sonics had a slender lead on 1pt in the first quarter, which the Infiknights managed to gain in their favour in the second and third quarter. And with scores level in the last 20 seconds to full time, it was the basket of Sarah Hussain (10) that swung the odds in Infiknights favour to be declared as Basketball champs. Amisha Lotlikar (18) was declared the MVP of the match. Shimei Nathan (12) played well for Sonics.
