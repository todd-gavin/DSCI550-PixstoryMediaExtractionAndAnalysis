His best performance came against Liverpool where he was fantastic. He began the game by flying into a challenge with Mo Salah, which caught the attention of the Old Trafford faithful. Martinez was comfortable defensively and played his part in United’s first goal by playing a good ball into Anthony Elanga, which eventually led to the first goal. 
The Argentinian was impressive again on the weekend against Southampton where he was rewarded with man-of-the-match for his performance. The 24-year-old seems to be Ten Hag’s preferred choice at left centre back and has made a good start to life in the Premier League.
#2. Christian Eriksen
Christian Eriksen joined Manchester United on a free transfer this summer and has featured in all of United’s games this month. The Dane International has operated in a slightly deeper role in midfield by playing in the double pivot after the experiment of utilising him at false nine against Brighton failed. The Brentford game was also a disaster for Eriksen however against Brighton in the second half, he was United’s most influential player who looked like he could create openings for the team.
The 30-year-old has fitted into Ten Hag’s system well and adds a sense of calmness to United’s midfield. He does not give the ball away and has the ability to find United’s attackers with his brilliant passing range.
