The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) issued guidelines on Monday to protect consumer interest related to the levy of service charges in restaurants and hotels. The authority has issued five major guidelines regarding this. It added that no hotel or restaurant can force any consumer to pay a service charge. They also have to tell the consumer that the service charge is voluntary. The guidelines have also said that hotels and restaurants also cannot collect service charges by adding it alongside bills and levying GST on the total amount.
However, consumers too have a number of options in case they find service charge in the bill. Among the first things, they can request the hotel or restaurant to remove the service charge from the bill.

They can also lodge a complaint with the National Consumer Helpline (NCH) by dialling in 1915 or on the NCH app.
