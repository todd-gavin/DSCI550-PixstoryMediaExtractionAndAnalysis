With the war on, Ukrainians are fleeing their homeland, in search of safety. But even Russians are quitting their homeland, fearing the rising authoritarianism and the possible re-emergence of the Iron Curtain. Estimates of their numbers differ, but several media reports indicate Russia is staring at a great brain drain as President Putin’s aggression is arguably putting his country in a difficult situation.

One report says the trend has been on for a year now, with the number of Russians seeking asylum on the southern border of the US is creating a new record: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/russians-ukrainians-us-border.html

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, 200,000 Russians have left their country, according to an economist: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60697763

As the EU, US, UK and Canada have closed their airspace for flights from Russia and as many do not have visas for Europe, their preferred destinations closer home are Georgia, Armenia and Turkey: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/8/we-are-refugees-russians-flee-rising-authoritarianism

Masha Gessen, a Russian-American journalist who reported in late January and February from Ukraine and then moved to Moscow after invasion, says an exodus from Russia has been on. “It's a sudden and drastic descent into a sense of having no country”: https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1085699224/thousands-of-russians-have-fled-afraid-a-new-iron-curtain-will-fall

Initial batches of refugees were people who were not comfortable with the Putin regime – supporters of the opposition leader Navalny, LGBTQ people and religious minorities who faced harassment. Once the war began, others also joined them, fearing life in Russia is bound to get difficult with unprecedented sanctions from the West. Some are opposed to Putin’s invasion and are responding to the call of conscience.  

Anaida Zadykyan, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who’s been helping Russians file asylum claims, says “Politically, the times in Russia are worse than during Stalin; people are living in terror. Economically, there is no money. People feel they can’t survive”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/russians-ukrainians-us-border.html

Gessen offers a similar explanation: “They're running from the fear of ending up behind the Iron Curtain as the Iron Curtain gets restored very rapidly. But also, they don't want to be a part of an invading country. They don't see themselves living in that country anymore”: https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1085699224/thousands-of-russians-have-fled-afraid-a-new-iron-curtain-will-fall
