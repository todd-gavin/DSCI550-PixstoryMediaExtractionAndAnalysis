Dieting and maintaining a fit body is a common goal for everyone.
But blinded by the sight of getting a perfect body and weight, many people don't give much thought to what diet would benefit them and not impact them negatively.

A red flag in the context of diets is "an aspect of the meal plan that signals you should stay away from it for any number of reasons â€” whether it's unhealthy, lacking in proper nutrition, unlikely to be sustainable in the long run or harming your health in some way."

Most people avoid or ignore these red flags and follow a diet regime that can harm their bodies and health in various ways. 
So for choosing a good diet plan, one should not avoid these red flags:
-Promises of a specific outcome.
-Requires a drastic cut in caloric intake.
-Makes you feel wrong or shameful about what you usually eat.
-Promises quick weight loss.
-Touts claims of a "scientific breakthrough."
-Includes food products that you have to purchase.
-Calls for consuming excessive amounts of a specific food or food group and avoiding other types of foods.
-Lacks variety.
- Backed by celebrities who aren't medical professionals or diet and nutrition experts.
-Having to buy all your food from one source.
-Having to eat differently from others.
-Causes "restaurant anxiety."
-Presence of multiple red flags.
