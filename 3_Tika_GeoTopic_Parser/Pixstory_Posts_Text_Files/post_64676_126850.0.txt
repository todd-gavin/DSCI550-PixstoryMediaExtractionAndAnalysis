We are celebrating 76th Independence Day on 15 August 2022. This day is celebrated to remember the struggle that the freedom fighters fought to achieve the independence of our country. 🇮🇳💯

Due to this long struggle by our ancestors, India became a sovereign and democratic nation. The Government of India aims to hoist more than twenty crore Indian flags across the country on this occasion.🇮🇳🇮🇳✅✅

Independence Day has always been special for all Indians and on this day the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort in Delhi.🇮🇳❤️
