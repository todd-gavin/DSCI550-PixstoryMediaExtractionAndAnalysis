Dr Poonam Ketrapsl Singh, WHO Regional Director 
South-East Asia said 2 million blood units are urgently required from voluntary unpaid blood donors to save lives . 
According to her an estimated 118.5
million blood donations are collected
worldwide, of which around 40 per
cent are collected from high-income
countries, home to just 16 per cent of
the world's population. In low-income
countries, a majority of blood
transfusions are given to children
under 5 years of age and to manage
pregnancy-related complications,
making regular donations by
voluntary unpaid donors a critical tool
in the fight against maternal,
neonatal and child mortality."
"An estimated 2 million more units of
blood are urgently required from
voluntary unpaid donors in the
Region to help patients of all ages live
longer and with a higher quality of
life, to support complex medical and
surgical procedures, and to accelerate
progress towards universal health
