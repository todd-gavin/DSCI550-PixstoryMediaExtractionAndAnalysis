Brahmastra has been grabbing headlines and how! The film has crossed the 350 crore mark worldwide and so far the film has collected 225-225.80 crore in all languages. The film received a mixed response from fans and critics.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥A clip of Ayan, Ranbir, and Alia from a recent interview with trade ananlyst Komal Nahta has surfaced online where the director is seen addressing the rumour about Ranbir and Alia not charging anything for Brahmastra😱😱. Ayan revealed that RK did not charge money for the making of Brahmastra. He said, “Yeh film hamari bohut hi zid aur personal sacrifices se bani hai. So yes, yeh Sach hai ki jo Ranbir ki price as a star, actor it is on a film, he did not take anything for the making of Brahmastra. Aur main manta hoon ke iske baigaar hum yeh film ko bana nahi paate. It is a very very big thing kyuki it would not have been possible without this kind of support and I don’t know how many other people would have done this.” ✅✅✅✅✅✅Coming to Alia, Ayan Mukerji said that her fees was not too high to begin with, given that they started working on the film 8 years ago, when she was not the star that she is today. He further added that by the time the film was completed, whatever amount she earned went into the making of the movie as well.✔️👍
