Everyone loves to travel. But have you thought about making your own aeroplane to fulfil your aspirations? Ashok Aliseril Thamarakshan, a native of the Southern Indian State of Kerala, built a four-seater aircraft for family vacations. London-based Ashok Aliseril Thamarakshan, a native of Alappuzha in the Southern Indian State of Kerala, has successfully constructed a four-seater aeroplane in a project that took close to 18 months to complete.

At a time when the aviation industry is recovering from the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, a man from Kerala, Ashok, is travelling through Europe with his family on a home-built plane. 

The four-seater aircraft model 'Sling TSI' has been named 'G-Diya', with Diya being the name of his younger daughter. Mr Thamarakshan moved to the UK in 2006 to pursue his Masters's degree and he currently works for Ford Motor Company.
