An Overview of the 1962 War continues....
Two Western authors produced studies of the 1962 Sino-Indian war that were significantly biased in favour of China. The first of these was by the Anglo-Australian journalist Neville Maxwell, whose book 
‘India’s China War’ (1971) posited that though China attacked on 20th 
October 1962, it was India that had provoked the war, apparently 
because of India’s ‘Forward Policy’. This was formally adopted only on 
2nd November 1961. The British academic Alastair Lamb’s scholarly 
work of 1964, had attempted to show that the disputed areas in the east 
should belong the China.
However, it had been decided by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping 
at a eating as early as 25th March 1959 that ‘. . . action had to be taken 
against Nehru’ well before his decision of 2nd November 1961. This 
has been adequately brought by the Swedish journalist-researcher based 
in east Asia, Bert Lintner, in his ‘China’s India War’ (2018).
