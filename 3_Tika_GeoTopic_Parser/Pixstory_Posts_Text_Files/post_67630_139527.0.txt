Juventus returned to training following PSG defeat
Juventus already got themselves back in the training ground on Wednesday morning following their UCL defeat against PSG.
The Bianconeri didn’t have a good start on their Champions League campaign after suffering a 2-1 loss against the Ligue  1 champion. Weston McKennie’s second-half header was not enough to even rescue a point for Massimiliano Allegri’s side.
Although the defeat was disappointing, Juve don’t have enough time to feel upset with that result. After returning from Paris last night, the Bianconeri players immediately get back to work again.
As reported by TuttoJuve, the Old Lady already start training again this morning as they’re preparing for another game this weekend.
