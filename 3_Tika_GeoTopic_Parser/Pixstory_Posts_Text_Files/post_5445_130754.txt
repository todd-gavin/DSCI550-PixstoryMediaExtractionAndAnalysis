The lost love yes it was love and one of the most precious ones to me We were always together even tho it was a long distance It felt like a day never went by without him But everything which feels too good to be true falls apart at least in my case it always does fall apart We are not together anymore and someday s it feels horrible but other day s it doesn t the last time we talked to each other was the most painful to pass by and now that I m through it I would never go back but my heart still feels incomplete my mind knows that it wasn t meant to be but my body aches when something reminds me of him One day it ll all go away and I ll learn more and more about who I m and what I deserve
