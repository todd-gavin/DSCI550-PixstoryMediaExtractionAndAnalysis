Still, you probably knew all of this- and, yet, you continued buying the Hogwarts LEGO sets for your kids or cousins. You included the movie in trivia night. You endorsed celebrities in Hollywood as they discussed in length that reading the book at such an impressionable young age was what guided their careers forward. And, come on, we’ve all been 13- clenching our teeth, waiting with baited breath for one of the most formative moment of our life- the results of the Pottermore House Quiz( a close competitor would only be the “Am I gay?” quiz). So what exactly is it that is preventing you from doing what’s right- disengaging from this phenomenon?

Really, is it deep-rooted nostalgia in the franchise or undercurrents of misogyny that have managed to enwrap you ? After all, even with most video essays that I have watched- there's almost an undercurrent of sympathy with JK Rowling, even from trans victims, who perceive her to be some misguided damsel in distress. She has a platform with a following of 14 million, she has authored the most-sold book in history- it really shouldn't be that hard to realise that women are capable of independent thinking and further acknowledge how actively she has been harming the community by both using her undeniable influence( over politics, especially, and her fans) and the considerable wealth she has amassed.

If you’re not convinced by how potentially trans people might lose all autonomy over their own bodies, I don’t know what to tell you- she fired Johnny Depp? That should bring you to the conclusion, I hope.

And on a larger scale, it's time for all of us to realise that gender is not a category we can be just sorted into or assigned( in fact, the sorting hat had its shortcomings, too).
In the end, my heart reaches out to Harry- it's okay to be a Slytherdor !
