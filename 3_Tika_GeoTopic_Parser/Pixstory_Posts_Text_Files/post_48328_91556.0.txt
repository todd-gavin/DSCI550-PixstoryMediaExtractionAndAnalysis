Trump was a big deal on social media platforms like Twitter. His following was immense and every word he said had great impact. He was basically a social media star and his influence through this medium was widespread but ever since he has been removed from the popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter Trump has been searching for ways to get his word to the public through the online medium. In this quest his latest experiment was new social media app Truth Social. However just a month since it's release the downloads of the app have plummeted by more than 95% in the recent days. 

Trump has so far made only one post on his Truth Social account and that was in mid February. This was before the platform had left the beta phase and went live all of the public.
Truth Social has a waitlist for new users, meaning there is a delay in people downloading the app and then actually being welcomed aboard to use it.

When Truth Social first debuted in the Apple App Store, it stated that it would be available on February 21. When President's Day rolled around, however, potential customers were issued queue numbers that, for the most part, had not altered. Truth Social has a waiting list for new members, which means that it takes time for people to download the app and then be invited to use it.

According to experts the things holding back the platform currently are tech issues. The platform so far has 800,000 users and not even the Trump loyalists seem intrested in the platform and are preferring to promote their own networks. The network has to do something to boost its user base or it will soon end up becoming irrelevant. The reason for many people being on the platform was Trump but he himself seems to be absent from it. This failure of the app could have big implications as this was Trump's last bet on social media.
