Music has been known to have a variety of health benefits one of which is that it helps infants sleep better A study published in the journal Pediatrics found that mothers who listened to music while their infants slept scored higher on measures of infant mental development than those who did not listen to music The study also found that infants who heard music during the first six months of life were much more likely to score high on measures of cognitive development at age three than those who did not hear music Music has been found to have a range of benefits for infants including helping them to develop motor skills language skills and social skills In fact some researchers even believe that music training may be more effective than traditional childcare in helping infants learn and develop properly One study found that babies who were regularly exposed to music during infancy were more likely to show positive personality traits such as being open minded imaginative and cooperative as adults They also tended to be better at problem solving and coping with stress than those who didn t receive musical education during infancy The reason why music may help infants sleep better is still unknown but it may be due to its ability to create a calming atmosphere It has been shown time and time again that babies tend to settle down faster when they re around people or things that make them feel relaxed By playing music for your infant you can help them get the relaxation they need in order to fall asleep quickly and peacefully
