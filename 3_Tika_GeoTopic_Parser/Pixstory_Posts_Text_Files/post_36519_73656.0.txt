Volleyball is a sport played by two teams of six players on a court separated by a net, in which each team tries to score by causing the ball to land on the opposite team's court. It is a very interesting game. Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan on February 9th, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
