#5. Paul Gascoigne
Paul Gascoigne won the hearts of England supporters after his heroic performances in the1990 World Cup. He also won many neutral admirers after his brilliant display. ‘Gazza’possessed terrific ability and was a talented midfielder in his prime. He was appointedmanager of Kettering United but his time at the club lasted only 39 days after a combinationof poor results and discipline issues. Staff complained he turned up to the club drunk andGascoigne did suffer from discipline issues throughout his playing career.
#4. Hristo Stoichkov
Stoichkov was an integral part of Johan Cruyff’s dream team at Barcelona which achievedhuge success in the early 1990s. Stoichkov produced brilliant performances at the 1994World Cup where he won the Golden Boot and later the Ballon d’Or. Stoichkov took chargeof the Bulgarian national team in 2004 but the results were poor and the relationships withmany of their best players and Stoichkov was bad. He then resigned from the post and never
really achieved success as a manager.
#3. Clarence Seedorf
Clarence Seedorf holds the impressive record of winning the Champions League with threedifferent clubs. Seedorf was a powerhouse in midfield and is regarded as one of the greatestmidfielders. The Dutch legend was unable to carry his great legacy into management. ACMilan appointed Seedorf as a manager in 2014 after they endured a poor start to the seasonunder Massimiliano Allegri. Given Seedorf had no experience in management, this was destined to be a failure. His tenure proved to be exactly that after he mustered 35 points outof a possible 57 which led to his eventual sacking.
