When you get out of bed each morning, ask yourself which way of thinking aligns with how you feel.

Based on your mindset, are you ready to love your physical appearance? Or do you feel like being positive is too much to ask at the moment, so you'd rather focus on being neutral and appreciating what your body can do?

Find things you love about your physical appearance and say them out loud, such as "I love my long legs" or "My shoulders look great in this sleeveless shirt."

Repeat positive affirmations throughout the day, like "I am happy the way I am."

Stop your mind when it starts to make comparisons between your body and someone else's as there is no one "perfect" body type.

Watch online videos focused on promoting body positivity and self-love.
