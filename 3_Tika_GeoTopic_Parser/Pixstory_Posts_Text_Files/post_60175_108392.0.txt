After the deciding fifth and final match in Bengaluru was called out due to rain, India and South Africa shared the Twenty20 International series. The visiting team won the first two matches before India came back to tie the series at 2-2, forcing the series to a Sunday final. Rain forced the players off the field at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium just as play was set to begin, and South African fast bowler Lungi Ngidi dismissed the hosts' opening batsmen to reduce India to 28-2 after the restart. However, with only 3.3 overs bowled, it began to rain again, and no further play was possible.
