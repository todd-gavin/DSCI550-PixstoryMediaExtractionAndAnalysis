As Erik ten Hag’s move to Manchester United as their new manager nears completion, Ajax’s
technical director Gerry Hamstra spoke about the efforts taken by the club to tie down their
manager with the club.

Gerry Hamstra said that Ajax’s board has put whatever possible from its end to convince Erik
ten Hag to stay instead of moving to Old Trafford and that while they are hopeful they are also
working on alternatives should the need arise.

“"I can be very succinct about that," Hamstra stated. "We have done everything we can and are
doing everything we can to keep him on board. Contract extension offered? Yes. More money?

Everything that comes with it, without going into detail. Erik can ultimately determine his own
future, he is old and wise enough for that. We have two scenarios: we really hope he stays, it
makes sense that there is interest in him. And if he doesn't stay, we have to be ready for the
second scenario." he said.

Erik ten Hag’s stint with Ajax has been largely successful and the club have made their desire to
hold on to their manager very clear. The manager however has chosen not to publicly discuss
his links with Manchester United and has stressed that he remains focused on helping Ajax win
the Eredivisie title and the Dutch Cup.

Answering an incoming question on why he always put away a question about Manchester
United the Dutchman said “Because I serve Ajax. We need to win the two remaining trophies.'

He later told ESPN: 'We are busy with training and with the matches. 'That way you keep the
focus on it. I want to talk about the game and not about other things and whether or not I've had
conversations. I won't comment on rumors. Questions about the game or I am going inside.”
