Engineers may have given us world changing technical breakthroughs but they are taking us back to the dark ages when it comes to governance.
Engineers have a very limited, if any, understanding of civics or history.
Look at the mess that they have made of the internet. Every decision is reduced to data analysis with zero understanding of the human factor. 
This flawed approach has led to the breakdown in civic discourse online. It has led to mass online surveillance where your every move is tracked and privacy has become a tradable commodity.
The polarization, the hate speech, the trolling, and the misinformation epidemic is all the result of giving the internet's reins to engineers.
Engineers are leading us to the abyss. They must be stopped. Strip them of their hubris. And, more importantly, educate them.
