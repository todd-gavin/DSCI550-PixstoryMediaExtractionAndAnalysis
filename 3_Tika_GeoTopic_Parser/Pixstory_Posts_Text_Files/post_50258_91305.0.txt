Peace in Bagaha was the result of sustained action against the criminal gangs with the illegal cultivation of sugarcane over captured lands in the diara having been brought to a halt. A police campaign of cutting of illegal cane which lay as unclaimed property in the diara, by labourers under police presence and subsequent deposition of the money obtained into the government treasury shook the economic backbone of the criminals active in the diaras of Bagaha. Regular raids on the hideouts of criminals and the promotion of the surrender policy of the government in the diara by involving the community led to the surrender of about 25 dreaded criminals in a series which became akin to a movement, resulting in creating an atmosphere of peace in the crime affected areas. Promotion of surrender policy in the naxal affected forest areas led to the surrender of several Maoists, which led to reduction in naxal activity in the police district. Efforts were made for the rehabilitation of surrendered criminals and naxals and thus as the image of the Police increased extensively between the community, at the completion of the tenure, I was leaving on a high note.

As I left my charge as the Superintendent of Police of Bagaha on the Nepal border for joining duties in Rohtas, on the way I met several senior officers who had earlier worked in the district and discussed trying to understand the nature of problems in the district. I was particularly inspired by the words of a senior police officer at Muzaffarpur, who made a mention of the famous Rohtas Fort, which had almost been forgotten for quite some time and was lying neglected and lost not being on the tourist map. The neglect of the Historic Fort was such that even field officers posted in Rohtas did not care to visit a Fort which gave its name to the region. After a murder in the 1980’s of a person who was on a visit to the Fort, it had remained obscure for general visitors.
