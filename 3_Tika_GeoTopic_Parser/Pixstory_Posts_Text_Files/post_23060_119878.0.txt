Although I started applying to the universities at the end of last year, 2021, the idea to study abroad has always been there for more than four blessed years. This plan was in the works since October of 2017 and everything in terms of energy and focus was towards making Mission Study abroad a reality.

No parties, no outing with friends and no chill-outs for four years. Just plain, simple and boring hard work as I am not someone who oozes talent. I had to work really hard, for whatever I had achieved. I worked extra hard for things that other people could do it in their sleep—but despite my effort, it does not appear flawlees and I embrace it.

My 4.5 years comprised of AIESEC, an exchange programme to Europe, working as a research intern at an NGO, pursuing a foreign language, intensive hustling—be it for assignments submission on time or just three years of professional experience—I had to ensure that I was ‘good enough’ to be considered. But believe me, that feeling would only come when you yourself know that you are good enough to apply.

As for my ‘excitement’, well, things haven’t sunk in yet as much still. It still feels like a dream. I am exhausted as well. It takes a toll on you especially when you are juggling fulltime jobs but I am not complaining. You have to do it as nobody will do it for you. But I am certain that once I depart on September 20, the excitement will be there. It is after all a new life—a new beginning.

I have learnt that friends are pivotal if you are taking up something like I have. They know a side of you that your family might not know. As long as you have good friends in your corner, things get a little easier. Your friends are…everything. They’re your family outside of your family as it is the one you have created for yourself. Man…this process sucks the life right out of you. Have someone to talk to always during and after the process. Trust me, you need them.
