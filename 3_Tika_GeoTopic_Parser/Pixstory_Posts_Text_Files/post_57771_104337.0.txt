Accents are interesting and funny no matter where you're from and which places accept you're hearing 😂
Though I think some prominent ones include the British accent that is hard to get if you're not used to hearing it or as it's the case with movies and TV shows, without subtitles its like a different language at times, depending on the person. 
Now, their slangs and swears are a bit different and unique too, add that with the accent, I mean that's like the cherry on top😂
Bloody hell, mate😂

P.S.: Harry Potter fans might hear Ron😏😂
