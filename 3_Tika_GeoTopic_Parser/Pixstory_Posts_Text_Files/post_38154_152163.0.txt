Lionel Messi could be returning to his boyhood club as per reports that have surfaced in Europe. According to Argentine reporter Veronica Brunati, the former Barça number 10 is expected to come back home just two years after his departure. 
The Argentinian left Barcelona in 2021 after talks of a contract extension fell apart due to the Spanish club's financial struggles. However, with Xavi returning to the club as a manager, Messi's chances of coming back have significantly improved.
As per the Daily Mail, "It is believed Messi will return to the club after 'making peace' with Barcelona president Joan Laporta - who was at the centre of the controversy two years ago." 
Messi's PSG contract expires at the end of the 2022/23 season. Though the Argentine has the option to extend his stay by another year, Xavi and Joan Laporta have constantly stated that they would like to see Messi returning to the Camp Nou once again. 
Xavi is said to be the major part of Messi's decision if he does decide to return 'home'. Inter Miami are also said to be in the fray to bring Lionel Messi out to the USA. However, it looks unlikely at this point in time. 
PSG are also looking to extend Messi's contract and hence they would be hoping to sway his decision as well. It has to be seen what the Argentine decides to do next summer.
