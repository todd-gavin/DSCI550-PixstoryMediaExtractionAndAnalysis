Weekends give you the special vibe of chilling down and going slow for the day. So this day is perfect for some hot pancakes before your coffee and you can enjoy your breakfast meal with these pancakes that are super easy and delicious which you can give it a try. 

Ingredients 

• Bananas 

• All-purpose flour 

• Baking powder 

• Baking soda 

• Egg  

• Cane sugar 

• Almond milk  

• Avocado oil 

• Cinnamon, 

• Nutmeg 

• Vanilla extract 

• And sea salt  

Directions 

First let's go for the batter 

Combine together all the wet ingredients in one bowl and mix all the dry ingredients in other bowl. And now mix both the wet and dry ingredients together and combine them. Don't overmix them, if that happens the pancakes could be dense. 

Let's cook them up 

First heat the non stick pan over medium low heat and pour 1/3 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook each side for 1 to 2 minutes and flip to the other side. The pancakes are ready to go from the pans when they get a golden brown colour, that's puffed and cooked through. 
And now make a set of them and drizzle them some maple syrup and enjoy your start 🤤✨️ 

Happy Sunday ❤️
