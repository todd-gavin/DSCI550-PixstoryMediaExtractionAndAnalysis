He may not have scored many goals, but what Origi has done for Liverpool will be recalled for the rest of his life, as his many notable goals have benefited Liverpool escape from the clutches of defeat. His famous goal against Barcelona, when the Reds came from behind to win the game, as well as his last-minute goal against Everton.

1 Luiz Suarez
Suarez is the most relentless striker Liverpool has ever seen, and it will take many more players to reach his threshold. Suarez was a threat to defenders because he was a complete goal-scorer who could find the net from anywhere, and the Reds were privileged to have him.
The striker was signed from Ajax at the same time Andy Carroll joined, and the media predicted Suarez would crumble, but it was the Uruguayan who made an immediate impact at Anfield. Suarez scored 31 goals in 37 matches in 2013 to prove how dominant he was, and the goals he scored wowed fans. Before joining Barcelona, the former Ajax striker scored 82 goals in 133 games.
