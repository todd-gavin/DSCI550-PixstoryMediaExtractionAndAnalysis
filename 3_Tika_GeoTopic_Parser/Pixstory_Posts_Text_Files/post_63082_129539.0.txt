The prisoners were released under the Gujarat Government’s remission policy after they completed more than 15 years in jail.

The former MP Kavitha said releasing rapists must be withdrawn immediately so that citizens don't lose their faith in law and appealed to the Supreme Court to intervene in the issue.

TRS MLC Kavitha Kalvakuntla tweeted "My letter to Hon’ble #CJI regarding the release of the 11 convicts in the #BilkisBanoCase of 2002. Bilkis was 21 years old & 5 months pregnant at the time when this heinous crime took place. I implore the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India to save the nation’s faith in our laws."

Back story 
On February 28, 2002, Bilkis fled her village, Radhikpur in Dahod district, after violence erupted in the state in the aftermath of the previous day’s incident at Godhra station, in which the Sabarmati Express was set on fire, resulting in the deaths of dozens of pilgrims and Kar seeks to return from Ayodhya.
Bilkis was accompanied by her daughter Saleha, who was three-and-a-half years old at the time, and 15 other members of her family. They fled fearing a re-run of the arson and looting that had taken place in their village on the occasion of Bakr-Id a few days previously.

On March 3, 2002, the family reached Chapparwad village. According to the charge sheet, they were attacked by about 20-30 people armed with sickles, swords, and sticks. Among the attackers were the 11 accused men.

Bilkis, her mother, and three other women were raped and brutally assaulted. Of the 17-member group of Muslims from Radhikpur village, eight were found dead, six were missing. Only Bilkis, a man, and a three-year-old survived the attack.
