It’s Adrien Rabiot’s first birthday in black and white, and he turns 25 today. The Frenchman arrived in Turin from PSG in July, where he has, so far, made 24 appearances in our jersey between the league, the Champions League and the Italian Cup.

If Adrien’s first few months at Juve were to be described, growth would be the perfect word. He has grown and improved since his first day at the club last summer, and in every training session and in every game, his development has become more and more evident.

His will is reflected on the field, where he always made himself available upon Mister Sarri request, featuring in every position, makeing him a complete midfielder.

We are sure that the best is yet to come! Happy birthday, Adrien!
