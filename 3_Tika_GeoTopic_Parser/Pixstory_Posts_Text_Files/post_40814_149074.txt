Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun rise would kill me If I could not now and always send sun rise out of me We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds Speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself It provokes me forever it says sarcastically Walt you contain enough why don t you let it out then Come now I will not be tantalized you conceive too much of articulation Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded Waiting in gloom protected by frost The dirt receding before my prophetical screams I underlying causes to balance them at last My knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things Happiness which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day Walt Whitman
