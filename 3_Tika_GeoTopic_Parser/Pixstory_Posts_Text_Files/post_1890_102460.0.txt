Speed Breeding is a new and exciting approach to breeding originally inspired by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that promises to develop new crop varieties faster, offering hope for food security. Breeding a new crop variety via conventional approach requires selection of complementary parental genotypes with desired traits, followed by crosses and a series of selection and advancement of superior progenies to release candidate cultivars that meet market demands. The conventional breeding procedures can take more than 10 years to develop and release an improved variety in the absence of an integrated pre-breeding programme.

Speed breeding is a suite of techniques that involves the manipulation of environmental conditions under which crop genotypes are grown, aiming to accelerate flowering and seed set, to advance to the next breeding generation as quickly as possible.
