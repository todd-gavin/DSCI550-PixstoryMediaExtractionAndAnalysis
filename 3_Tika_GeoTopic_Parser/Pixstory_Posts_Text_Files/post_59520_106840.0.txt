As the Congress party's workers and leaders protested in the Capital on Monday, Rahul Gandhi appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case involving the National Herald newspaper. The Delhi Police had detained Congress workers earlier in the day when they demonstrated outside the AICC offices in support of Rahul Gandhi. Almost the entire top leadership of the Congress, as well as the party's two Chief Ministers, Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Baghel, and its Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs, staged a protest from the AICC headquarters to the ED office, holding placards and shouting slogans.
