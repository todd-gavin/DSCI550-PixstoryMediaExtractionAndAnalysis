On the drive back towards Khalatse we crossed the other village of the Brokpas, Hanu. 

Got a fleeting glimpse of the most startling pair of green eyes  full of mischief on this tiny tot running to these village elders sitting along the road. 

The drive back  to Leh along the Indus out of Batalik was, thankfully, less vertigo-inducing than our route in & we saw a massive rock in the river which, according to the driver, has Buddha’s ear carved into it. 

Our driver being a local of this valley had turned his nose up at the dried apricots available in Kargil. 

He insisted that the Batalik ones were the melt – in -the -mouth kind, which they were. We also picked up some ‘shilajit’ which is found in the upper regions of the valley. 

I couldn’t get myself to have it finally, having heard so much of its …ahem, uses. I had visions of myself running around with either topped up testosterone levels or/and hot flushes!! 

Some aspects of the human ‘spirit’ are valued only in the mountains I guess!
