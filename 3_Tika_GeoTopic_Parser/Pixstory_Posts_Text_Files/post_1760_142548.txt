There was a classroom In that classroom was a scholarship assigned for a mistake for questioning the syllabus There was sitting a year old youth in that classroom till this morning There wil be written on the door of that closed classroom You have left courage has left From Breathless to Image Book six decades of cinema life Greater than a whole lifetime The best soldier of the French Nouvelle Vague Just a memorial on the streets of Paris from today Not Hitopadesha the work of cinema is to raise questions felt Godard And till the last day of his life he fed that feeling His agenda was to break the golden shackles of Hollywood The wall writing of that classroom remains as a movie title Farewell in courage sir
