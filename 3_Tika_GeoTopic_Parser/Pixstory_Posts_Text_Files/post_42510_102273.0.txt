When it comes to mental health, many Hollywood movies explored mental health through the characters in the particular movie.

And today I am going to talk about those movies which I think are the best movies based on mental health issues.

1. Silver Linings Playbook

Silver linings playbook is a movie based on the story of Pat (player by Bradley Kooper), who is sent to a mental health facility after brutally attacking his wife’s lover, and after eight months, when he walked out of the centre, Pat and his wife, Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence) decided to part their ways.

2. Joker

Joker is one of the most famous movies which showed the consequences of mental illness and why mental health should be taken seriously by the family of the person, who is suffering from the mental illness.

3. Beautiful Boy

Beautiful Boy’s story is based on the character of Nicolas Sheff (played by Timothee Chalamet) and his addiction to meth (kind of a drug) which threatens to destroy him. When Nic got addicted, his father, David (played by Steve Carell) helped Nic to save his life.

4. Little Miss Sunshine 

Little miss sunshine is a movie based on the story of a family who decides to travel across the country when their daughter wants to participate in a beauty pageant and the whole family is unaware of the fact of what the journey has in store for them.

5. Uncut Gems

Uncut Gems is one of the best movies on this list. Uncut Gems’ story revolves around the character of Howard Ratner (played by Adam Sandler) who is suffering from the BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder)  and because of that he went through many emotions that create so much chaos in his life as well as everyone around him.
