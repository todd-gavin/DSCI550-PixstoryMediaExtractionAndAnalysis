Djibril Sidibe

The 29-year-old central defender has run down his contract and will leave Monaco. Sidibe 
featured over 174 games for Monaco in multiple positions in defense and even played as a central defensive midfielder. The talented defender is linked with multiple French as well as English clubs. At the moment, the player is available on a Bosman transfer.

Andreas Christensen

The Chelsea defense is going to have huge trouble if they fail to land on any defensive target.

The club has an inexperienced defense and with Christensen leaving the club for free, they are
in a deep mess. On the other hand, Andreas Christensen is a free agent and is in talks with 
Barcelona. It remains interesting to see if the Camp Nou outfit will be able to register the player.

Midfielders:

Juan Mata

After spending close to a decade in England, the Spanish international is set to return to his 
homeland as a free agent. With much football left in him, the creative playmaker is one of the 
hottest properties available for the Spanish clubs. Juan Mata left Manchester United on a free transfer after declining a reported contract extension by Manchester United. He featured over 283 games for MUFC and had 91 G/A to his name.

Christian Eriksen

We all know what happened to the player in the Euro 2020. After succumbing to a heart attack, 
the player was rarely considered to be fit to play ever again. However, the player showed his 
mettle and is back in the best shape. Brentford signed Christian Eriksen on a free transfer and 
helped them to secure a mid-table finish.

However, Denmark international is available on a free transfer. Manchester United and Brentford are fighting for his signature with multiple clubs keeping an eye on the possible 
transfer.
