Asian American and Pacific Islander LGBTQ youth are experiencing significant mental health distress linked to discrimination, according to a national sample of nearly 3,600 AAPI LGBTQ released yesterday by Trevor Project.

Compared to the 40 percent of all respondents who were at risk of suicide in the past year, 49 percent of Pacific Islander respondents and 50 percent of trans AAPI respondents have been at risk of suicide in the past year.

More than half of AAPI LGBTQ youth have experienced discrimination based on their race and ethnicity in the past year, and those who experienced race or immigration-based discrimination are at significantly higher risk of attempting suicide than those who don’t.

“These findings shine a light on the unique mental health outcomes and suicide risk of AAPI LGBTQ youth — a demographic that has largely been overlooked by the research world,” Myeshia Price, Senior Research Scientist at The Trevor Project said in a statement. “This research points to the unmistakable need to invest in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts for AAPI LGBTQ youth that are culturally salient, reflective of their diverse identities, and equip parents, other family members, and communities to better support them.”

Key Findings From The Report:

🟠 40% of AAPI LGBTQ youth were at risk of suicide

🟠 16% of AAPI LGBTQ youth have attempted suicide in the past year

🟠 41% of AAPI LGBTQ youth were not out to at least one parent — compared to 29% of all LGBTQ youth

🟠 AAPI transgender and nonbinary youth were at significantly higher rates of suicide risk, with more than 1 in 5 attempting suicide in the past year.

🟠 “Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian LGBTQ youth were more out to others about their sexual orientation and reported higher rates of discrimination and physical harm based on their sexual orientation or gender identity and poorer mental health indicators compared to the other AAPI ethnicities,” Trevor Project reports.
