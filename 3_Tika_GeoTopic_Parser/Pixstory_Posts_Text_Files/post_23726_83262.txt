The BA variant of the Omicron coronavirus strain is not more severe than the original the World Health Organization said on Tuesday Based on a sample of people from various countries we are not seeing a difference in severity of BA compared to BA Maria Van Kerkhove a senior WHO official said in an online question and answer session So this is a similar level of severity as it relates to risk of hospitalisation And this is really important because in many countries they ve had a substantial amount of circulation both of BA and BA she said Van Kerkhove who leads the technical side of the WHO s Covid response team was reporting the findings of a committee of experts tracking the evolution of the virus Their conclusions will come as a relief to countries such as Denmark where the BA variant of Omicron has circulated widely The WHO said in a statement that initial data suggests the new BA variant appears inherently more transmissible than BA and that further studies are ongoing to discover why this is the case Source
