We all make mistakes and face the consequences It is a part and parcel of being a human being But when you are a celebrity and your mistake was live telecasted during Academy Awards the consequences might look a bit different Yes I am talking about the Will Smith incident I accept that in the heat of the moment Will may not have made a sound decision But we must not forget that the cause behind it was justified I am not defending Smith but it was a error in judgement at the end of the day for which he has apologised profusely Moreover in his April statement resigning from the Academy Smith said Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason Apparently not everyone is ready to forget the incident as a mistake Hollywood Reporter said that director David Leitch quit as the director of the planned Netflix film Fast and Loose starring Will Smith a week before the Oscar ceremony in an inadvertent stroke of excellent timing Instead he moved on to Universal s Fall Guy starring Ryan Gosling which is set to begin filming in August According to a source Netflix was competing with Universal for Leitch s next movie but Universal won out Netflix put out an urgent request for another filmmaker to take over a movie starring the star who was strongly favoured to win best actor at the Academy Awards according to sources However following Smith s on stage attack on Chris Rock at the Oscars Netflix discreetly shelved the project This in my opinion is taking it too far Just one moment of unprofessionalism does not wipe out the years of hardwork Smith has put into his profession
