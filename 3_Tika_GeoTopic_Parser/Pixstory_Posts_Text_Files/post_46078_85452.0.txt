The White House announced on Friday that US Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Poland and Romania next week to engage with officials about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the regional impact of the conflict. 

Marcia reported that the Vice President's travel to Warsaw and Bucharest from March 9 to 11 is likely to focus on economic, security, and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. 

"The Vice President's discussions will also focus on how the US can help Ukraine's neighbours welcome and care for refugees escaping violence," said Sabrina Singh, the vice president's deputy press secretary. 

"The Vice President emphasised the Alliance's strength and solidarity, praising each of her counterparts' leadership and coordination on a vigorous response."

About 700,000 Ukrainians and others have fled the violence so far, and Poland is supporting them. In recent weeks, the US military presence in Poland, which is a member of NATO, has more than doubled to 9,000 personnel. 

"US support for the international standards and norms that have provided peace and security to Europe since World War II and have served as the foundation of the NATO Alliance," Kamala Harris said.
