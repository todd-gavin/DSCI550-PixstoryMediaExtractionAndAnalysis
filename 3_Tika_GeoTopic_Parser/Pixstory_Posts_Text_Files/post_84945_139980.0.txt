Samuel Etoâ€™o
Samuel Eto'o, who emerged through Real Madrid's junior program, was one player who escaped. Despite being elevated to the senior team, he was deemed insufficient and was subsequently transferred to Mallorca. The Cameroonian, who later went on to develop into one of most crucial players for both Barca and Inter Milan, where he won back-to-back trebles, proved his old employers wrong.
Fabio Capello provided the self-described "greatest African footballer in history" with a unique chance to demonstrate his talent. The 38-year-old was at his finest from 2004 to 2010, scoring a total of 183 goals in 301 appearances while playing for Spain and Italy at various times. Eto'o has since crossed the globe and was most recently spotted competing for Qatar SC in the Mid East.
Claude Makelele
The Real Madrid team's engine room from 2000 to 2003, when Claude Makele led the team to seven titles, was so effective that a position on the field is sometimes named after him.
Makelele thrived on the fact that the "Galacticos" at the club were unaware of him, but Florentino Perez thought he was too unambitious for the Los Blancos brand. Zidane and Hierro both questioned Perez's choice to sell him, and it quickly became apparent that it marked the end of the club's successful run at that period.
Since leaving, the Frenchman has become a star for Chelsea, serving as the foundation for the group that Jose Mourinho led to victory. Makelele was rightfully missed by the team and is widely regarded as possibly the finest holding midfielder ever since the dawn of the millennium.
