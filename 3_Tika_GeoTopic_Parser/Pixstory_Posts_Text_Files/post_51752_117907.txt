How to Play against Technical Players It doesn t matter what position do you play There comes a time in the field when every player have to Defend their Goal against their opponents Technical players who have good Touches on the ball and they are very sharp dribblers with good passing are the toughest to play against The way these players moves and keeps the ball with them sometimes makes them untouchable as it is hard to catch their moves This is how you can compete against these magical footed players PHYSICAL PRESENCE Their is nothing wrong with a firm and fair tackle challenge on these players If you always go in diving hard everytime they get the ball they will sense it that you will commit so early hence they will be more focused and aware of the surrounding while having the ball TAKE THEIR TIME AWAY No players likes to be get man marked like being so close to the defender and forced backwards You have to force them into areas where they does not feel comfortable to dribble around This will create a lot of pressure over them PLAYING SMART Use the field as your advantage the side lines can act as an extra player or force them into areas where you have more number of players This will force them to give up the ball else they will try to beat multiple players at once and mostly not all the players can do this This will create man advantages on the field and will help in stopping the attack DON T DIVE IN A technically gifted player will wait for you to dive in before quickly making their way around you and forcing them to beat you Taking your time and not diving in early will will make your players to come back and will create pressure on the attacker Hence gaining position on the ball will be more easy Don t tell this to anyone Cause these are the only ways to stop me from dribbling past you and eventually from scoring GOALS THANKYOU
