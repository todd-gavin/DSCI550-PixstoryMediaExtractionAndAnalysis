Last season, declining hitting averages panicked baseball, prompting a midseason modification in the enforcement of regulations prohibiting pitchers from using sticky stuff. 

As US News reminds us, remember Gerrit Cole stuttering over a question on Spider Tack during the crackdown? Or Max Scherzer defiantly starting to undress during an umpires' in-game check? Surprisingly, it worked, as the batting average rose from.232 through April 30 to.244 by the end of the season. 

Even with the addition of the designated hitter to the National League in 2022, the hits are disappearing once more â€” and the power has gone out as well. This time, the perpetrator does not appear to be so obvious.

This April, the major league batting average was a dismal.231, on pace to break the record low of.237 set in The Year of the Pitcher in 1968. Batters are slugging just.369 and averaging 4.03 runs per game, both lows for baseball since the strike-shortened 1981 season. 

The offensive drop this year is thought to be caused by ripple effects from labour unrest. Of course, there are limitations concerning cold weather and tiny samples, as well as baseball. 

Don Mattingly, manager of the Miami Marlins, observed, "It's hard to claim anything is a pattern yet." 

There is one point on which everyone agrees.
