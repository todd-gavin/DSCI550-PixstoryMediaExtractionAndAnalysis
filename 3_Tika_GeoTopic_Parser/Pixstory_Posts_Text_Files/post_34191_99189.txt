Salernitana spoils the first match point in terms of salvation by making a comeback in recovery from a never tame Cagliari This is the comment of Campania&#39;s sports director Walter Sabatini It was a very strong disappointment but we survived We were relegated by all accounts but instead we had the privilege of being able play this match And we could have ended the story Now we will play against Empoli the team that plays the best football in the Serie A We are worried but we are not discouraged We have been fighting for three months no problem happened just another small accident We are recovering from something much more serious than a goal conceded at the end of a relegation full-blown and declared by everyone And instead we are still here and we will make it I want Salerno to save this is the goal of my life
