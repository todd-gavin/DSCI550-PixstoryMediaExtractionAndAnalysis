If I had to pick my favourite athlete representing our country in the ongoing commonwealth games, it will have to be Jeremy Lalrinnunga. 

The 19-year-old from Aizawl created the Games snatch (140kg) and overall lift (300kg) records but not before an injury scare as twice he grimaced in pain during the clean and jerk attempts.

He winced in pain and was attended to by the physios, but came back smiling to podium to receive his gold medal. 

Once he received his medal, he congratulated the silver and bronze winners and hugged them both. And posed happily with them. 

The smile never leaves his boyish face. He has nice streaked hair that give him a nice, genial college student appearance. But this belies his fierce resolve. After receiving the gold medal he said he was happy but still not satisfied with his performance.

Before his turn, he was seen lustily cheering for his fellow weightlifters. 

Watching athletes like Jeremy Lalrinnunga is therapeutic. You forget things like religion, region, caste and creed. And politics. You only take in the sheer beauty of their performance and the tremendous joy it brings you. Nothing else. 

And you also appreciate what it takes to win at the international levl. 

Jeremy has now been away from home for the last 6 years. The whole weightlifting team has been practicing relentlessly. And now, after the games, they will get a short break to visit their families and rejoice with them. 

Looking at Jeremy Lalrinnunga and his childlike enthusiasm, one feels that we have a genuine superstar and a role-model in our midst.
