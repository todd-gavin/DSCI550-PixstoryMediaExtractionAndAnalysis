Micah Richards

Richards, like Hart, was regarded as one of England's brightest promising prospects when
Kompany made his debut when he was just 20 years old.

The defender was a significant role in City's first Premier League title win alongside Kompany,
earning him a nomination for the club's Player of the Year award, but injury plagued his late
career after joining Aston Villa in 2015.

Although Richards did not leave Villa Park until 2019, he last played for the club in October of
2016. Since hanging up his boots, the former England international has established himself as
one of television's most popular pundits.

Tal Ben-Haim

At the age of 39, he is still playing for Beitar Jerusalem. He is, without a doubt.

Michael Ball

Ball, who was awarded an OBE in 2015 for his contributions to musical theatre, is presently
promoting his new album, 'Coming Home To You,' which he calls his "most personal yet."

Oh, you mean that one? He's mostly talking to us about his one England cap, how City targeted
Rio Ferdinand to win the derby in 2008, and how Thaksin Shinawatra's tenure at the club was a
shambles. He's a great guy.
