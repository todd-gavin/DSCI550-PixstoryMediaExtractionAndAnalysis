Goalkeepers play an extremely important role in a football team and it can be argued that in the modern era, it is imperative for clubs to have a quality keeper in their side as the profile of keepers has changed. Playing out from the back is an element that keepers have introduced in their game as sides who play possession-based football like to play out from the back.
Most of the teams in the Premier League attempt to play this brand of progressive football therefore there are terrific goalkeepers in the League. We will look at 5 contenders for the EPL golden glove.
#5. Dean Henderson
Dean Henderson is currently on loan at Nottingham Forest from Manchester United this season. The 25-year-old expressed frustration at the fact he was not getting regular game-time at United last season. Henderson has proved already he is a quality keeper and it will be interesting to see how his future plays out beyond the season. The keeper has good technical abilities to play put from the back and is an excellent shot-stopper. Henderson is also prolific at saving penalties and has already saved 2 so far this campaign. The England international will be keen to break into the England side and is definitely a contender for the EPL Golden Glove.
#4. David De Gea
David De Gea has been at Manchester United for over a decade now and holds the record for winning the highest amount of Player of the Year awards at the club. The Spaniard has built his reputation on brilliant shot-stopping and acrobatic reflexes. One deficiency in his game is the ability to play out from the back and we have seen him struggle to do this for United this season as manager Erik Ten Hag demands his side to play progressive attacking football. De Gea has made key saves this season in games for United and it is expected he will improve his ball-playing abilities under Ten Hag.
