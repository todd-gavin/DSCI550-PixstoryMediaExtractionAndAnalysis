BTS’s RM has made another meaningful donation!

On September 15, the Cultural Heritage Administration and the Overseas Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation announced that RM had recently donated 100 million won (approximately $71,800) to the foundation for the preservation, restoration, and utilization of cultural assets overseas.

In September 2021, RM quietly donated 100 million won to the Overseas Korean Cultural Heritage Foundation. According to the foundation, the donations were used for conservation work of the Joseon Dynasty hwarots—traditional Korean clothing worn during the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty by only royal women for ceremonial occasion—at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). The additional 100 million won that RM donated this year will be used to create a catalog introducing Korean paintings.

RM was also recognized as one of the 2020 Patrons of the Art after loaning a piece of his sculpture collection, “Horse” by sculptor Kwon Jin Gyu, to the Seoul Museum of Art and donating 100 million won to the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. The artist has shown his special affection for Korean art by participating in the Korean and English exhibition commentary for “The Space Between: Modern Korean Art Exhibition,” which is on display at LACMA starting from September 11, 2022.

In addition, RM has posted photos of him visiting art museums and galleries across the country on his Instagram. The museums that RM visited are gaining popularity by becoming known as part of the “RM Tour,” proving RM’s influence within the Korean art industry.
