From insomnia to sleep apnea to narcolepsy to sleepwalking. Some make it difficult to fall asleep and sleep through the night. Others make it tough to feel numb after waking up at night. Aside from making you (and the family members you may be keeping awake) feel exhausted, a lack of sleep can negatively impact your energy, mood, concentration and overall health. So taking treatment is essential.

-An assistive breathing device or surgery (usually for sleep apnea).
-A dental guard (usually for teeth grinding).
-Increasing vegetables and fish in your diet while reducing sugar intake.
-Exercising to reduce stress and anxiety.
-Establishing a regular sleeping schedule and sticking to it.
-Drinking less water before bedtime.
-Limit caffeine intake, especially in the late afternoon or evening.
-Cutting back on tobacco and alcohol use.
-Eating smaller, low-carbohydrate meals before bedtime.
