After a legal battle over the state's political maps opened up a seat in Brooklyn, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he's considering a run for Congress. 

US News reported that the two-term Democrat announced Wednesday that he has formed an exploratory committee for New York's 10th Congressional District. He left office at the end of 2021. His home in western Brooklyn will be included in the Democratic-leaning district. 

Although Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler represents New York's 10th District, the state's electoral maps are being redone under the supervision of a New York judge after a court ruled them to be unlawful and gerrymandered in favour of Democrats.

The court released fresh draught maps this week that dramatically alter the boundaries of a number of New York City-based districts. Nadler believes the designs have been changed so significantly that they are unlawful, but if the proposed districts are finalised by the end of the week, he plans to run for the 12th District, which includes Manhattan.
