Humans are social beings, and they need different ways of mixing up situations that can make them learn to acclimatize themselves to any circumstances of life.
So for social development, school is necessary.
But the core point of schooling is education, and there's a difference between education and formal schooling.
Education is needed because we require basic knowledge to understand the world and life, but the question arises, are schools doing it?
The school doesn't always offer everything that education entails. As a result, school fails to provide a clear and complete picture of the natural world; there are just selected perspectives around it.
I think education is not confined to schools; anyone who believes in enlightenment can seek knowledge from anywhere. Instead, parents themselves should do it for their children.
Yes, their chaotic life won't allow them to do it, and that's one of the other reasons why parents enrol their children in schools, but still, it should be their duty to teach children what school is unable to; entirely relying on a school won't be so favourable.
