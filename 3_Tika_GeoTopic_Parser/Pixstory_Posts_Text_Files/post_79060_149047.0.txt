It is the international break. Like all of you, I am incredibly bored. Every international break reminds me that I simply cannot comprehend what non football fans spend their time doing.Here’s some (slightly sarcastic) things we’ve learnt in the international break so far…1. Sidemen FC are better at football than England National TeamI watched about twenty minutes of Italy vs England and I had to turn it off. We’re clearly on a bad streak right now. Sidemen FC though, that game was absolutely brilliant. Over £1M for charity, that’s amazing work. Inspirational for a content creator like myself.2. Granit Xhaka is still unbelievableSaw some of his game for Switzerland against Spain last night, and my god… he was spectacular. Granit Xhaka stats vs Spain:- 90 mins played- 84% passing accuracy- 5/6 long passes completed- 100% tackles won- 4 clearances - 2 headed clearances- 3 interceptions- 4 duels won- 10 recoveries3. IShowSpeed is the “mystery winger” we neededPassion for the Youtube All Stars, insane pace and very good at slide tackles. Denied a beautiful goal, too. Corruption. The perfect Bukayo Saka backup.4. Bukayo Saka should never play left wing backYou shouldn’t start your best right winger at left wing back. Let Bukayo do his work where he’s best.5. I miss Arteta ballWe’ve been on fire so far this season, and I miss watching Mikel Arteta’s Red and White Army on my screen. Still ages to go until the North London Derby..6. The Women’s Team Breaking Records53,737 tickets were sold for the Arsenal Women team’s North London clash with Tottenham on Saturday - new WSL record. You love to see it.As you can probably tell from this post, I’m incredibly bored. Get Artetaball back on my screen ASAP.
