Striker: Ian Wright

Wright did not stay at the club under Arsene for very long, despite becoming the day's match-winner for Arsenal at Ewood Park with a pair of typically brilliant goals. He was permitted to join West Ham after losing his spot to Nicolas Anelka throughout the duration of the 1997â€“1998 season.

After working as a journeyman for a few years, Wright transitioned into broadcasting, spending time with teams like Celtic and Burnley. He currently makes frequent appearances as a commentator, where he makes an effort to be objective despite his clear preference for Arsenal. Wright briefly served as the first-team coach at MK Dons, but it seems like he prefers to watch television instead of coaching.
Striker: John Hartson

Under Wenger, Hartson was never going to flourish. His muscular approach did not fit the technological game the new manager hoped to develop. He was transferred to West Ham for a club-record sum in February 1997.

He continued to have a great career, especially at Celtic and for Wales at international level. His most notable victory was perhaps beating cancer in 2009; he went on to found the John Hartson Foundation to assist in spreading information about testicular cancer.

Nobody will be surprised to learn that Hartson, like many of his teammates, has found success as a television commentator.
