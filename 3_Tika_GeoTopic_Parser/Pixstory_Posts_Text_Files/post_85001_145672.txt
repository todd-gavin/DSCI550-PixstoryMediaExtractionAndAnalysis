Weaknesses The team despite being spot on in the majority of the aspects of their game have been filled with flaws in several moments The team has been at fault when the opposition team has been attacking too much Xavi s men haven t been able to prevent the opposition from creating loads of chances for themselves The team has also failed to convert several quality chances into goals on several occasions under pressure This is exactly what was seen in their recent UCL match against Bayern Munich In form players like Robert Lewandowski and Pedri Gonzalez missed clear chances to find the back of the net and capitalise on the opportunities which cost their team the game Bayern in response played fearless football and blew them apart with two goals after exposing the team s defence and marking Opportunities Barcelona under the coaching duties of Xavi has been much more impressive than expected by the fans and experts previously The team certainly has provided quality performances to everyone s surprise under tough circumstances Particularly banking on the new signings of star players like Jules Kunde Robert Lewandowski Franck Kessie Andreas Christensen and others the team can certainly aim to reach greater heights this season The team firstly will be looking to reach the summit of the league and lift the La Liga title after long years having last done so back in the season The team s eyes will also be on the prestigious Champion s league trophy after having failed to win it in the last years In addition to this the Spanish super cup and the Copa del Rey will definitely be something which the Catalans will be eyeing for this season
