According to Jack Monroe's book 'Vegan(ish)', eating vegan for one day a week saves 40 pounds of grain—talk of starvation around the world, 1100 gallons of water, 30 square feet of forest, and one animal. To put that in perspective, 1100 gallons is nearly four months' worth of showers—saved in just ONE day, by one person. Plant-based eating takes only 20 square meters of land every day, compared to 358 square meters for meat eaters, and 1.5 acres of land generates only 375 pounds of meat, compared to 37000 pounds of plant-based food.

What is the significance of land? Livestock now covers 45 percent of the total land area on our world, resulting in the desertification of one-third of the planet. Animal agriculture is the major source of ocean dead zones, with an estimated 110 animal and insect species being lost every day. Furthermore, a vegan's carbon footprint is 50% lower than a non- vegan's.

According to a Harvard study published in 2019, consuming a vegan diet can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by roughly a fifth (23 percent ). Another study found that consuming largely plant-based foods reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 32%.

So perhaps, veganism does make some difference. Even just one person.
