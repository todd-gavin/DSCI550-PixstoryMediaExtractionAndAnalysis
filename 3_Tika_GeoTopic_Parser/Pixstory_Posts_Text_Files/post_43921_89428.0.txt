Judging by the results of the Bahrain GP, the current season of F1 promises to be one of the most hotly contested editions in recent times. If Ferrari’s impressive race pace continues to pick up and Mercedes pull up their socks and get to work, we could have a three-way fight to the championship. You wouldn’t want to miss a single race as like the last season proved, every single point counts. So, if you’re wondering where you can watch all the races live in the country you reside and make a racing weekend out of it, here’s a short guide to help you get started.
