Finally justice is served and Johnny Depp wins the defamation case against his ex wife Amber Heard The jury also awarded Johnny Depp million as compensatory damages and million as punitive damages After winning the case Johnny Depp released a statement which said Six years ago my life the life of my children the lives of those closest to me and also the lives of the people who for many many years have supported and believed in me were forever changed All in the blink of an eye False very serious and criminal allegations were levied at me via the media which triggered an endless barrage of hateful content although no charges were ever brought against me It had already travelled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a seismic impact on my life and my career And six years later the jury gave me my life back I am truly humbled Truth never perishes On the other hand after losing their case against her ex husband Amber Heard also releases a statement which said The disappointment I feel today is beyond words I m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power influence and sway my ex husband I m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women It is a setback It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously I believe Johnny s attorneys succeeded in getting the jury to overlook the key issue of Freedom of Speech and ignore evidence that was so conclusive that we won in the UK I m sad I lost this case But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American to speak freely and openly
