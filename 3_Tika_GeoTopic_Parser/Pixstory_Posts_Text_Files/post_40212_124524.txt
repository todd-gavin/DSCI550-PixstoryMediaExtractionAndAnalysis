The loss from ice shelves is now estimated to be twice as great as it was previously and new research on Antarctica including the first map of iceberg calving shows how the continent is changing as per NASA gov It further states how quickly Antarctica s ice will melt as the planet warms is the biggest unknown in predictions of sea level rise Unexpected new information about how the Antarctic Ice Sheet has been losing mass over the past few decades is revealed in two studies that were published on August and were led by scientists at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California A study that was published in the journal Nature illustrates how the Antarctic shoreline has evolved over the past years as a result of iceberg calving or the breaking off of ice from a glacier front The scientists discovered that the ice sheet s edge had been releasing icebergs This surprise finding doubles previous estimates of ice loss from Antarctic s floating ice shelves since from trillion to trillion metric tons Ice loss from calving has weakened the ice shelves and allowed Antarctic glaciers to flow more rapidly to the ocean accelerating the rate of global sea level rise
