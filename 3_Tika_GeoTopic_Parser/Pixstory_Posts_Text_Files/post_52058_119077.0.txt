If you’re travelling to Queenstown, New Zealand, anytime soon, I have three words of advice - visit Milford Sound!

It’s a four-hour drive which, in my humble opinion, is a contender for the greatest and most beautiful road trip in the world.

The section between Te Anau and the fiord, in particular, doesn’t disappoint.

Confession time - despite living in Australia for most of my life, I was born in New Zealand so you could say I’m a teeny bit biased.

But when you’re confronted with such natural beauty, it’s hard not to fall in love.

“It is so special as you get to truly experience world-class scenery with many changes varying from open farmland to high mountains and bush clad hills,” he tells me.

“The end destination is like a journey into Middle Earth and something so different from anywhere else in the world”.

Te Anau

This trip begins in Te Anau which is two hours from Queenstown, so most people stay overnight to get picked up in the morning around 7.30am.

From here the landscape just gets better and better as you go deeper into the Fiordland National Park.

Eglington Valley

The first key stop is Eglinton Valley which is a popular spot for photos.

There is a beautiful contrast between the flat floor covered in golden fronds of tussock grasses and the backdrop of steep, dark, green mountains.

When you travel with Envy the great thing is you have more flexibility stopping at different locations as opposed to a bus tour, but you’re also not driving so you can soak in more of the scenery.

There are several key locations to note on this journey but the biggest highlight for me was Mirror Lakes.

The name really says it all as the water reflects the Earl Mountains opposite.
