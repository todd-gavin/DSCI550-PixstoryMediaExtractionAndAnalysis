Arsenal failed to sign Dusan Vlahovic in the 2022 January transfer window as the Serbian striker chose to sign for Juventus instead. However, The Gunners are now looking to have another shot at the Serbian striker in the upcoming Summer transfer window. 
As per The Sun, Mikel Arteta is still high on Dusan Vlahovic. The Arsenal manager is reportedly pushing the club's board to attempt and sign the Serbian superstar once again. The move could see the Gunners splash out more than Â£100 million for the Juventus duo of Dusan Vlahovic and midfield maestro Fabio Miretti. 
However, Juventus would not be too keen to let Dusan Vlahovic leave. The Serbian striker had signed a long-term contract that would keep him employed with the Serie A giants until 2026. However, the UEFA Champions League could be the trump card that Mikel Arteta could utilize. 
Juventus have lost their first two UCL games against PSG and Benfica this season. Owing to this, the Serie A giants could be knocked out of the competition in the group stage itself. The club is not doing well in the Serie A as well. This could mean missing out on the UCL altogether next season. 
On the other hand, Arsenal are currently on top of the Premier League table. If they maintain their position in the top four until January, there is a chance that the Gunners could attract Vlahovic to North London this time around.
