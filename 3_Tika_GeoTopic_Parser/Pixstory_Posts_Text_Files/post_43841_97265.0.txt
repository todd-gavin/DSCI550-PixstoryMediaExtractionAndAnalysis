Following the approval of their development permission, the Spanish giants will begin revamping their home stadium next summer. Barcelona will play their 2023-24 season at the Olympic Stadium after the club announced that Camp Nou will be renovated.

The Catalan club's home stadium, was opened in 1957 and has a total capacity of 99,354, is the largest in Europe. The historic stadium, which will be called the Spotify Camp Nou from 2022-23 after the team signed a lucrative sponsorship deal with the streaming giant in March, is due for a major overhaul, with the third deck slated for demolition next summer.

The club has issued a statement confirming the news, which reads as follows:

"Renovation work on the Camp Nou, the epicentre of the Espai Barça project, will begin this June, as soon as the football season has ended, and in accordance with the building permit approved this morning.”

As President Joan Laporta said a few weeks ago, given the uncertainties generated by the war in Ukraine, especially with regard to the cost and availability of materials, a precautionary principle is to be observed in order to minimise risks and protect next season's revenue, but with the least possible impact on the works schedule.

Camp Nou will be under construction for the 2023-24 season, with the goal of reopening at half-capacity the following season. Barcelona has secured a temporary home while repairs are carried out, with the Olympic Stadium in Spain, better known as the Llus Companys Stadium, slated to host their matches.

The stadium, which is located in Montjuc, has a seating capacity of 55,926, and served as the major site during the 1992 Olympic Games. The Liga giants have also announced that improvements to Camp Nou are expected to be finished in 2025-26, with a new 360-degree screen being included in the final design.
