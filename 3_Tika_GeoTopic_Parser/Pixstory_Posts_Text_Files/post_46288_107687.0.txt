I like to think that in another life we might have met under different circumstances . ‚ù§Ô∏è

Imagine something like this üí≠ : A crowded cafe downtown , where the rich smell of freshly brewed coffee hits you the moment you open the door . People are tripping over one another in their haste to become someone worthwhile and their chatter drowns out your favourite part of your current favourite song . You take out your phone and replay it , and that is when you see me . Doesn't it always go like this ? In movies and books and songs ? Eyes meet across the room and the whole world stops . It's different for us , though , because you told me you didn't believe in love at first sight . 

So maybe you wouldn't fall in love right away . Maybe you wouldn't even notice me . But perhaps you'd start visiting that busy caf√© more frequently . Not in hopes of seeing me again , but because of that unexplainable pull you feel toward that place . Toward me , even if you aren't aware of it yet . Because if there is one thing I'm certain of , it's that we'd find a way to meet even in another life , again and again . Never the same way but always with the same outcome . If there's one thing I want to believe in , it's that my soul would reach out and find yours through the years , different lives , across universes and mountains and the sea . And that your response would always be the same : come find me , I'm dying to meet you . ‚ù§Ô∏è
