With the help of the German Peace Village Foundation, 80 children with severe fractures and severe burns will soon be transferred to Germany for treatment. The children will be treated and cared for in Germany for six months and then return to Afghanistan.

The Afghan Red Crescent Society has said that it is not possible to treat these children inside the country.
Under a 1989 agreement with Afghanistan, the German Peace Village transfers a number of Afghan children to Germany for free treatment each year.

Nearly 5,000 Afghan children have reportedly been treated in Germany so far.
