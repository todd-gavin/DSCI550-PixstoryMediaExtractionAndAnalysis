Ruslan Malinovskyi is the undisputed star of Atalanta&#39;s European evening The Nerazzurri false nueve in fact scored a splendid personal brace that allowed the Bergamo players to go through and qualify for the round of 16 All this on the most difficult day for him Already in the morning he spent his time together with his wife on appeals against the war that had broken out between Russia and Ukraine Even his presence on the pitch this evening was uncertain Here are the words of the Nerazzurri coach Gian Piero Gasperini who explained what he and Malinovskyi said before the match I had asked if he felt like playing before the match I&#39;m happy for him for this brace football sometimes doesn&#39;t solve problems but it can make a small contribution to bring everyone closer
