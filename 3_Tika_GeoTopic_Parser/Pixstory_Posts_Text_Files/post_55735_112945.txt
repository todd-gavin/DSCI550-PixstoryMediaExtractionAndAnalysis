These little chocolate frogs and koalas are made from the best of the best Cadbury s Milk Chocolate They come in a range of delish flavours like strawberry peppermint pineapple and popping candy too though the plain Freddo Frog and gooey caramel Caramello Koalas are the most iconic I prefer them over Pods honestly Pods are crunchy yet gooey bites of heaven with Mars Bar Snickers or Twix filling Shockingly you ll only find them in Australia and New Zealand
