Manchester United are in all sorts of misery at the moment. The Red Devils were handed a 3-1 away defeat by Arsenal, which put an end to their top four aspirations. Over the midweek, Ralf Ragnick's men were rattled by Liverpool, who thrashed them by a score-line of 4-0. Manchester United have now lost three of their last four Premier League games, all coming away from home.

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has sympathized with fellow German, Ralf Rangnick following a 4-0 defeat at Anfield. Ralf Ragnick also stated that the visitors were handed a blow, as Fred was injured for the meeting against Liverpool. Meanwhile, Scott McTominay's injury meant he could start only from the bench.

"You go to Liverpool, they are really good, and you go 'we have no defensive midfielder', that's not good news. It's just not cool, and that's the situation they're in," said Klopp as quoted by Daily Mail UK.

However, Jurgen Klopp expressed caution, as he believes that Manchester United will certainly rebuild, starting next season. Moreover, the Red Devils will seek to claim vengeance against Liverpool, for handing them two heavy defeats this season. Hence, the German manager is not getting too carried away by the gulf between the two sides.

"I'm not interested in gulfs or distances between us and them. I know we'll go there next year and they'll have the results from last year in mind, and it makes it even more difficult when we arrive there," Klopp added.

Next up for Liverpool is a Champions League semifinal clash against Villareal over the midweek. The Reds will look to reach their third Cup Final this season, and continue their quest for a quadruple. As for Manchester United, they welcome Chelsea at home on Thursday evening. The Red Devils are now more or less out of the top four race, and the focus now will be on winning the remaining four games.
