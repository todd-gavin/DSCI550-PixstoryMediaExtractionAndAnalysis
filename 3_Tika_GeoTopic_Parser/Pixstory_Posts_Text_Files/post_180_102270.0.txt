The word ‘cloister’ as a place of religious seclusion, traces its root to the Old French cloistre, from the Latin claustrum (a lock, enclosed place) from claudere, ‘to close’.

In ‘On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister’, Walter Horn describes cloisters as large square yards surrounded by galleried porches, typically attached to a church and enclosed by double storied buildings that form a “continuous and solid architectural barrier” separating the ‘world of monks from serfs and workmen.’
