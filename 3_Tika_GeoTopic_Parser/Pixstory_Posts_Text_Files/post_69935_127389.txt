The Indian cricket team has not lost a Test match at home in the last four years with their last defeat coming way back in to England Undefeated since India have played matches on their soil Ten of them have resulted in victories while one ended in a draw The draw in Bengaluru versus South Africa came not due to any resistance from the Proteas but due to rain Gods After Day the other four days were simply washed out During this period of four years India whitewashed Australia cleansweeped the West Indies Sachin Tendulkar s farewell series polished off South Africa in a four match series Proteas lost their No ranking during this series and are comfortably leading in the ongoing three match Test series against New Zealand Two key words Application and Skill It s not that the teams that have travelled to India have lacked any preparation Australians and South Africans are known for their meticulous planning and preparation before any tour It s simply the alien conditions that these teams face when they play on turning tracks Having been born and brought up with pace and bounce on their home pitches to see a spinner bowling the first over of the match is something that is unimaginable for these players On the dusty and worn pitches of India the ball spins jumps keeps low or in some cases simple goes straight Even the bowler is not aware of what the ball will do after pitching Legendary Australia pacer Glenn McGrath feels that test series in India will be the next big challenge for Patt Cummins and Co McGrath was also appreciative of Australia s Recent Performance in Test Trips to Pakistan and Sri Lanka saying that the side has potential to break the record nobody except India had managed to pull out Till then lots of love and stay healthy and stay safe
