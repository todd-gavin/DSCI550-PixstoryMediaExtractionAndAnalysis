In the Shangus region of south Kashmir, Chatpal, which is one of Kashmir's Unexplored Places, is without a doubt a place to disconnect and get lost among mountains and lush green meadows covered in wildflowers. 

The perfect place seems to be a great escape from the noise and bustle of the city, with only the sounds of trickling brooks and birds chirping. With its natural splendour and serene surrounds, this place has the power to astonish you. Undeveloped and removed from civilization, Chatpal is surrounded by intriguing tourist destinations including Sonamarg, Martand Temple, Aharbal Falls, Gulmarg, Lolab Valley, and Kishtwar National Park.
Chatpal is not a typical tourist destination. Actually, there isn't a place called Chatpal that is a hamlet or town. The Jammu & Kashmir Tourism organisation owns the two-bedroom cottage, which is located next to the Chatpal Waterfall, hence the name of the location. However, Chatpal is a truly undiscovered gem in Kashmir, located a far way from the usual tourist attractions and absolutely suitable if you're hoping to spend some time in solitude with nature. The last settlement before reaching the mountains, Thimran, can be visited during the day, and at night, you can sleep while listening to the sound of the river stream flowing.


Accessibility:
Chatpal is approximately 85 kms from Srinagar and a cab can take almost 2.5 hours to reach their.
