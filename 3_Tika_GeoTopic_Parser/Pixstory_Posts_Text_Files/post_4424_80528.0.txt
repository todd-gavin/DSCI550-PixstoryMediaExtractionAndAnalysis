Do you remember the days back in school where we would queue up in temples for food, empty Eid's biryani from friends tiffin and share Christmas cakes to the whole class. While doing all this we never thought about which religion we all belonged to.

Life was good back then isn't it? üòá

Do not turn up against your own friends and post provocative messages only to hurt them. The purpose of education is lost if you do this. 

Unity in diversity is the beauty of our country. Let us see each others as human beings and not as religious symbols. ü§ùü§≤

[ PS: The social media will very soon pick its next hot topic, the politicians will get busy with their parties and the society at large will move on like it has always done.

But, friends who have now turned into hijabs, saffron shawls and blue shawls won't go back to who they were after all the damage we humans have done, in the past and now.

We've killed friendship bonds, let that guilt sink in! ]
