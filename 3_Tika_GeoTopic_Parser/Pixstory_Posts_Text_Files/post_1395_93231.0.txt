My grilled cheese trick - I coat the outsides of the sandwich with mayo instead of butter! I don’t even like mayo, but this makes for a perfect sandwich. 

But don’t just take my word for it…Taste of Home says this "creates a crispy flavorful crust almost reminiscent of garlic bread." Alison Roman over at Bon Appétit says: “To ensure golden (not burned) toastiness, the exterior of the sandwich should be slicked with mayo, which has a higher smoke point than butter and possesses the combined browning power of oil and egg yolks. When mayo-slicked bread meets buttered pan, that’s when the magic truly begins." 

Tasty.co says "it makes the outside crispier and tangier." 

RECIPE: 

Spread butter on one side of each bread slice and mayo on the other. Sandwich the cheddar slices between the buttered sides, leaving the mayo sides on the outside. Fry for a few minutes until golden.
