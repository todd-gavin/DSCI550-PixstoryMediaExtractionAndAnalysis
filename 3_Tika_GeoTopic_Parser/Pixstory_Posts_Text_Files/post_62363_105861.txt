For me home is not just a house It is not bricks and stones and walls and paints Home can also be a human Home can also be someone you trust and feel comfortable with Home doesn t just have to be a house it can also be a place where you feel alive and be yourself Where you feel the safest Home is about safety about love Home can be anywhere even in your heart
