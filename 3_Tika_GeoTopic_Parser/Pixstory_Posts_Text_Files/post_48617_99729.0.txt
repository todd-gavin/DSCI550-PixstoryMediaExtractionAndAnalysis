All the arguments you made are interesting and completely valid. Human cloning is a dangerous experiment. And the results could be irreversibly damaging to humanity and the world.

But here's the thing, there's a lot more perks to this idea than you've put some thought into. I mean, how is human cloning any different from human birthing? Disabilities and chronic illnesses are a part of normal people's lives too. The ones that are born from the "traditional" process of reproduction. What changes?

Human cloning gives more scope to helping humanity. For example cloning organs and using them for transplant in humans. An extremely big and helpful initiative in medicine. Organ failure is nothing out of the ordinary for humans. With this technique, so many lives can be saved.

People who can't reproduce can have a chance at having their own child. Homosexual couples, childless couples, single parents, people that do not want to be pregnant but want kids. It can be life changing for them. Pregnancy comes with a threat to life, and if people choose some alternative over risking their lives, where's the wrong?

You talk about using the funds and time to eradicate diseases. But these two don't have to be mutually exclusive. Therapeutic cloning is a way to do that. It's done with the intention to destroy existing cells to produce the same DNA stem cells. It can be used in the studies of those cells and diseases.

I think there are a lot of perks to cloning. While it's definitely a risk, it can be worth taking if handled carefully.
