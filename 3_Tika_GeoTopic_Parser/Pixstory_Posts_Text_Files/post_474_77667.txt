An editorial in British Medical Journal by Victoria Male lecturer in reproductive immunology Imperial College London London Vaccination against covid provides protection against the potentially serious consequences of SARS CoV infection but as the vaccines were rolled out into younger age groups clinicians were increasingly approached by patients worried that the vaccine had caused a change to their periods More than reports of menstrual changes or unexpected vaginal bleeding following covid vaccination have so far been made to the yellow card surveillance scheme run by the UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency MHRA no data for unvaccinated A similar signal appeared in the US vaccine adverse event reporting system VAERS The authors took advantage of an existing dataset from a menstrual cycle tracking app Americans logged at least six consecutive cycles of them were vaccinated and the remainder acted as a control group In adjusted models the first dose of vaccine had no effect on timing of the subsequent period while the second dose was associated with a delay of days confidence interval to Most affected were the individuals who received both doses of the vaccine in the same cycle experiencing a day CI to delay to their next period Among this group experienced a change in cycle length of more than days which is considered clinically significant compared with in the unvaccinated cohort P In all groups cycle lengths returned to normal by two cycles after vaccination A study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health showed The high level of variation in normal cycles is underlined by the finding that of participants reported at least one change from normal even in pre vaccination cycles The study identified heavier than normal bleeding as the change most associated with vaccination first dose relative risk confidence interval to second dose to The findings from both these studies are reassuring changes to the menstrual cycle do occur following vaccination but they are small compared with natural variation and quickly reverse
