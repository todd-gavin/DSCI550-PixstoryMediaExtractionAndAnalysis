When your child falls, is upset about losing a friend, or loses a favorite toy, his or her first reaction is usually to cry, and your first reaction is to say things like, "Nothing, don't cry," "How many do you have like that doll?"  "It really does not matter so much that you cry for him like this."

 You look at it from years of experience and think it's "nothing" but your child is in trouble, something that's important in his or her childish world.  In these circumstances, underestimating his feelings of sadness and grief has devastating effects.  In such situations, we need to help children recognize, understand, and cope with their feelings.  Embrace them, acknowledge their feelings by saying things like "I know it hurts to fall from a height" or "I want my friends to be with me."  Then suggest solutions to improve the situation;  Say, for example, "Ice makes the pain less, do you want to try it?"  Or "Now that your friend is gone, do you want to read a book together?"  Or "If we wanted to buy a doll that looks like your lost doll, what color would you like it to be?"  At first, the child's voice may become louder and more impatient, but after a while, the practice calms down and teaches him how to find solutions to calm himself in critical situations.
