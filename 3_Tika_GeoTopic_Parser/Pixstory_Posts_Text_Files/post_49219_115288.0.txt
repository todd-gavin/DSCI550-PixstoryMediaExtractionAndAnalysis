Many of Harry Styles' friends have remarked that he has a wide range of skills and that there doesn't seem to be anything he can't do. And that isn't far from the truth. He is incredibly versatile. His vocal range and versatility are quite astonishing.

From all his amazing songs, it's quite hard to pick a most favorite one on the basis of its quality alone. In my opinion, that's impossible. All of his songs just sound like the best song ever.

How do I happen to have a favorite song is because I have personal memories attached to it.

Sign Of The Times

When I first heard this song, I had no idea why Styles sang it and honestly, I didn't care? It just resonated so strongly with me that I gave it a meaning for myself.

Despite the fact that you are in the worst circumstance possible, you must remain tough, stop crying, and push through. Just remember to give it your all, even when things are bad! Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that tough times come and go but do recur. We attempt to flee from it but fail. Because we have no choice but to face them. No matter how much we want to run away, eventually we will have to deal with them.

And just like that, it became a song that I latched onto.

Harry, in an interview, did speak about how it's about childbearing and the complications a mother goes through during it. And that's kind of beautiful.
