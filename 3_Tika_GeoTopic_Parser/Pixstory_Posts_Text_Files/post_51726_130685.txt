UNION FOOTBALL CLUB DELHI Throwback to the good old days when i played my first professional league matches The Union Football Club squad Match day picture clicked at the JawaharLal Nehru Stadium Delhi on th November All the players reached the stadium as our coach always announce the starting team just before the match We were in the changing room and the coach was telling us about how we have to play and the tactics Before I use to play as a Left winger in my former club Hindustan F C But according to the coach tactics and teams needs the manager appointed me as a Center Forward maybe just because of my offensive awareness and finishing abilities All Goal scoring responsibility were now in my checklist As before i was a winger it was not my duty to score Playing as a center forward was bit challenging for me I was never afraid of this responsibility of being the main man After i got to know my new position i went back home from training and i started surfing internet to get educated about how to play as a center forward I started Center forward specific trainings after the clubs training sessions My shooting was so weak at that time but as for a striker shooting is the most important attribute I trained for days and i got a good command in shooting the ball Present day We were goal down after few minutes of the kick off I still remember i dribbled the defender and just saw the ball once and took a view of the goal post and i just shooted the ball The ball went like a rocket straight inside the net and we leveled with a equalizer To be honest i just kicked the ball and luckily it went inside the net The Full time whistle blows and the score was After the match the Coach praised me for that Goal Maybe it was a fluke or maybe it was the muscle memory but yes that goal was match saving Thank you
