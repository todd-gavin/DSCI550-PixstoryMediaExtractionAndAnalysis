Liverpool fans can start to rejoice after they have almost sealed the deal to sign Darwin Nunez
from the Portuguese outfit. The Premier League side is splashing upwards of €80 million to
secure the services of Darwin Nunez.

As per Fabrizio Romano, the deal would cost Liverpool
close to €100 million including add-ons. They have sneaked ahead of Manchester United to win
the race.

On his Twitter handle, the transfer news specialist posted:

Benfica have received Liverpool bid for Darwin Núñez, formal proposal after verbal talks - €80m
plus bonuses. #LFC Discussions ongoing on €15/20m add-ons, LFC want installments.

Potential five year deal. Man United in contact with agent & denying any meeting with ten Hag.

Though it is beyond their principles of not spending huge on a single player, Darwin Nunez is a
shrewd buy for the style of game that Liverpool plays. Let us look at how Darwin Nunez can
