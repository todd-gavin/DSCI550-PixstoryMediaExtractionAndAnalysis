I was about years old when the family series Once upon a time there was a bride started broadcasting on the non governmental television Tolo Afghanistan which attracted many viewers and fans among Afghan families The Indian series which had more than a thousand episodes was composed by Ekta Kapoor the daughter of the famous Indian actress Jeetendra The broadcast of Zhamo mother in law was both a bride first started in India and aired on the Indian television network Star Plus The Persian version of the series Khashoo who was also a bride at the time was very popular on Tolo TV Khosho was once a bride depicting the story and daily events that take place in an Indian family and sharing the sorrows and joys of this family with the viewer Smriti Irani the actress in the role of Tulsi Virani and Amr Apadehi in the role of Mehir Virani were the main actors in this series That an Iranian smithy was paid a thousand dollars for each episode of the series From the very first day that Mehir Virani wants to marry Tulsi he faces opposition from his family members and except for his grandparents Gorden Virani and grandmother Amba Virani everyone especially his mother opposes this decision But Mahir with the support of her grandparents eventually marries Tulsi in a shrine and unexpectedly brings the new bride of the large Virani family home This is where the mother in law s quarrel with her bride begins It was one of the most watched TV series in Afghanistan Many viewers believe that what makes this series attractive to Afghan audiences is the similarities between the story of this series and the lives of Afghan families The animosity of the mother in law with the bride and the bride with the mother in law the usual rivalries between brother in law women sister in law rivalries jealousy of uncle s wives and the like which are depicted in this series can be seen in most Afghan families On the other hand the fluent and accurate translation of this series into Persian and the use of common terms in Afghan society had added to its appeal
