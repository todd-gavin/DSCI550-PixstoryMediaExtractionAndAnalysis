Children's health and the vaccines given to them at each age is believed to increase the immunity of kids. Now a new study has found a possible link that's between aluminum that's used in early childhood vaccines and the risks of children developing asthma at or before the age of 5. 
But the authors of the study had cautioned on the results which are not robust enough to suggest “questioning the safety of aluminum in vaccines.” 
The study demands for additional research to have a clear understanding on the risks. It could also include using other large vaccine safety data and laboratory studies that looks into children's immune responses post vaccination. 
Dr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, who was a part of the new research, said that it is important to reassure parents on the safety of the vaccines. 
“There is absolutely no indication at this point [that we should] change our vaccine formulations or recommendations on routine childhood vaccinations” she said. 
Like asthma, eczema is a kind of allergic disease where children are prone to develop persistent asthma. And so if there are any associations between aluminum in vaccines and the risk of developing asthma, it would show up differently.
