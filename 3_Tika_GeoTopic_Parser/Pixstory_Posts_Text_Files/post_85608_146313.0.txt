It was the first time for a bunch of awkward geeks and a literally “girl next door” girl to get along and form a very strong bond.
It took me a while to start to like it, since then I watched the whole series several times. Not all episodes are of the same quality, of course, but I still find the show fun, and I feel that somehow, it manages to find the right balance. 
In a nutshell, the show is about a woman who moves into an apartment across the hall from two brilliant but socially awkward physicists shows them how little they know about life outside of the laboratory.
But let me tell you one thing, you will feel how scientific comedy looks like or how intelligent people can be so good in comedy. Maybe its not because of their knowledge but of their habits. If you love Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Marvel, DC Universe and you are science geek then you’re gonna love this show and just FYI Guest appearance in this show will freak you out:- Stephen Hawking, Stan Lee, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Adam West and the list goes on.
