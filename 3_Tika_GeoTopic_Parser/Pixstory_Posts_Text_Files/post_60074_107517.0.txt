Strawberry Moon gets its name from the rosy, pink hues of this particular full moon in June.
It's also called so because of a link to Native American history, when this time of year was traditionally the start of strawberry picking season.

Because it is the first supermoon of the year, this Strawberry Moon is larger and brighter than usual. The only other supermoon of this type occurs a month later.

Because full moons occur every 30 days throughout the year, the Strawberry Moon never occurs on the same day.

Because the moon's changing phases were easy to track, ancient tribes in North America and Europe utilised it as a calendar. Each full moon was given a name throughout the year to help them keep track of the seasons and all of the expected natural and human activities at any particular time.

It's also a supermoon this time, which means it's full during its elliptical orbit's closest point, making it appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter.
