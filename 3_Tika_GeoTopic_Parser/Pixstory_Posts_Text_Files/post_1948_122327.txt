The jury in the defamation trial between the parents of the Sandy Hook massacre victims and the notorious personality Alex Jones has returned a judgment of million in favor of the parents The jury s verdict of million was far less than the million sought by the plaintiffs nonetheless a second trial will be held to decide whether he would be responsible for punitive damages for his actions Alex Jones said that the Sandy Hook tragedy was faked after it occurred However he claimed in court that he considered the slaughter to be real Although million is a substantial amount of money Alex Jones accountant said in bankruptcy court that Jones earned around million after taxes and got million in direct contributions through cryptocurrency It goes without saying that Alex Jones s comments along with the many others he makes everyday that are so devoid of fact that they are vile Nobody especially someone with his level of influence should make nasty things as he often does especially in relation to school shootings involving children Alex Jones is getting a just punishment but it is insufficient to repay these victims for the devastation he did and for the conspiracy theories he propagated which will endure as long as people continue to believe them
