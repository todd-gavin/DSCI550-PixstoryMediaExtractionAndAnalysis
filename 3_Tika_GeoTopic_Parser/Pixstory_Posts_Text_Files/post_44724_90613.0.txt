Fundamentals of Vedic Astrology continues...

There are many classifications and categories of houses in Vedic Astrology. The basic matrix given below will give good results overall for judgement of strength and degree of auspiciousness or lack of it in a house. 

This should be analysed along with the information given earlier—How the Planets behave in each sign-Impact of Placement. Trine houses also called as the trikona houses 1, 5 and 9 are the most auspicious houses.Quadrant houses also called as Kendra House(1, 4, 7 and 10) houses.

ASPECTS OF PLANETS ON HOUSES

All planets exert their influence on the planets and houses they aspect. All 9 planets aspect the 7th house and the planet/planets posited therein from their own position. The outer planets Jupiter, Mars and Saturn also have special additional aspects in addition to the 7th aspect. Jupiter: Also aspects houses 5 and 9 from where it is located in the chart. Mars: Also aspects houses 4 and 8 from where it is located in the chart. Saturn: Also aspects houses 3 and 10 from where it is located in the chart.

COMBUSTION OF PLANETS

When a planet comes too close to the Sun it looses its lustre/brightness and is 
said to be combust. A combust planet is weak and we should keep this factor in 
mind also when analysing the horoscope for correct and effective gem 
recommendation. 

For example if a planet is good for the chart and owns good auspicious houses but gets combust by the Sun then we should consider giving it strength by wearing its gemstone. The degree of proximity from the Sun to become 
combust varies from planet to planet. Here is the list of planet with the degrees 
from within the Sun that they become combust:
l Moon – 12 degrees
l Mars – 17 degrees
l Mercury – 14 degrees (12 degrees when retrograde)
l Venus – 10 degrees (8 degrees when retrograde)
l Jupiter – 11 degrees
l Saturn – 15 degrees
