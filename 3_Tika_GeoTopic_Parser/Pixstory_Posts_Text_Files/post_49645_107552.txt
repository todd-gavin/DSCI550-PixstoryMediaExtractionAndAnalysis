Why do you want to stick on to things that you don t want Society conditions you to stick on to things that you might not be interested in just because a majority does it Following the crowd sometimes estranges some people and calls their sense weird If you aren t satisfied at the gym work out at home If you are uncomfortable in denim were something else If you re happy at your job don t let society define your ambitions If you don t want a grand life choose a simple one Don t have children if you don t want them If If you don t want to live on a larger grander scale live simply If you don t want children If you don t know what you want try figuring it out Take your own time It s not a race its your life As long as you are ready to face the consequences you have to make your decisions according to your will Don t let anyone convince you that your story has to be composed in any way that doesn t feel good for you If anything in your life makes you unhappy find a new alternative Inspired by Alisha Waghorn
