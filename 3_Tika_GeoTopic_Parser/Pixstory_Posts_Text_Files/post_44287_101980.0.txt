Andre Brietenreiter returns to the Bundesliga according to BILD and Sport BILD information! He will be the new head coach at Bundesliga club TSG Hoffenheim.

As the German media unanimously reported, the move from Swiss champion coach Brietenreiter to Kraichgau is a done deal. The official announcement will follow next week.

The former Schalke and Hanover coach went to Zurich FC in 2021 and just became a sensational champion there. He still has a contract there until 2023, but it includes an exit clause of around 300,000 euros.

The return to the Bundesliga was the goal of the native of Langenhagen - however, the former Bundesliga player did not want to switch to just any club. It should be a club, with Champions League prospects and Brietenreiter would like to work in peace.

Background

During his time at Schalke, he experienced what it was like to have to work in an extremely turbulent environment. At that time, he was shaved by ex-manager Christian Heidel, although Brietenreiter reached the fifth place and the Euro League and produced talents like Leon Goretzka and Leroy Sane.

Borussia Monchengladbach and Hertha BSC are also said to be interested in the 48-year-old.

The coach recently stated that a return to Germany will always be “attractive,” but also 
stressed that “the Bundesliga is not the only priority for him.”

It would be a fourth commitment for the 48-year-old German in Bundesliga. Both with 
SC Paderborn and Hanover 96, he managed to get promoted to the German upper house.

Hoffenheim finished the last Bundesliga season in the ninth place after coach Sebastian Hoene had to resign. With Christopher Baumgartner and Stefan Posch, two OFB legionnaires are under contract with the Kraichgauers next season.
