I am given up by traitors,I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch!Did it make you ache so, leaving me?Parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.Walt Whitman
