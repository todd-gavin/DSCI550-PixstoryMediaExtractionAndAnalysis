Soft, chewy, crispy, you won't believe it, but this cookie has it all! 

Loaded with chocolate and easily customisable, this chocolate chip cookie recipe is my absolute favourite out there! And believe me, I've tried a lot of recipes. 

You can make lots of variations to this cookie, and it'll always turn out amazing. My top variants are browned butter cookies, toffee chip, and double chocolate. I'll tell you how to make these variations to the recipe later. But first, the best chocolate chip cookie recipe: 

Butter 125g
Brown Sugar 100g
Grain Sugar 75g
Vanilla Essence A few drops
Eggs 1 no.
Refined Flour 190g
Baking Soda 1/2 tsp. 
Chocolate Chips 200g

Method: 
Cream butter and sugars. Add egg and vanilla. Beat till smooth. 
Fold in flour and baking soda, then chocolate chips. Chill dough for at least 1 hour. 
Roll into balls and bake at 175°C for 12-15mins. Let the cookies cool on the tray for 5 mins before transferring to a cooling rack. 

Yes, it's that easy! 

And now, the variations: 
For browned butter cookies, cook the butter on a low flame until the milk solids brown, then cool the butter. This adds a deliciously warm and nutty flavour to the cookies. 

For toffee chip, combine equal parts of sugar and butter in a pan. On low heat, mix well until fully combined, then cook to hard crack stage. You'll know it's there when you drop a drop of the toffee into cold water and it hardens immediately. It should be brittle and crack when you bite into it. Pour the toffee on silicone sheet or parchment paper and let it cool fully. Break the toffee and mix it into the cookie dough. 

For double chocolate cookies, replace 40g of flour with cocoa powder.
