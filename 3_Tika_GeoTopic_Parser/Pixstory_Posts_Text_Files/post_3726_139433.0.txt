Former chief client officer at dentsu, Narayan Devanathan has joined National Foundation for India as its Chief Strategy Officer (CSO).
Talking to BestMediaInfo.com, Devanathan asserted that his appointment is effective immediately and he will be based out of Delhi for this new role.
“Civil society plays an extraordinarily important role in the smooth functioning of a democracy and I feel incredibly lucky to get this opportunity to be a part of it. I am hoping to rope in as many of my colleagues from advertising and the industry in this journey together,” said Devanathan.
On the reason behind joining NFI instead of another agency, he said, “I had wanted to move into the social sector eventually in my career at some point. And as I had said when I announced my moving on from dentsu after 11 years, it was after a very fulfilling stint. I had no reason to leave dentsu for another agency or industry. This is what I wanted to do and the right opportunity worked out with NFI.”
Before joining NFI, Devanathan had been associated with dentsu India for over 11 years and had spent over 25 years in the advertising industry cumulatively wherein he was associated with several agencies such as Euro RSCG, Ogilvy, BBDO among others.
Devanathan’s stint at dentsu began in 2011, wherein he was the SVP- National Planning Head at dentsu Marcom, followed by EVP- National Planning Director at dentsu India Group and CEO at dentsu Creative Impact Group.
