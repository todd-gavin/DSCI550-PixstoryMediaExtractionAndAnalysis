Galette is a French free-formed crusty cake. It resembles a pie made without a pie tin. A common form of galette resembles a type of single crust, free-form pie with a fruit filling and the crust folded partway over the top of the filling.

The apples have been oven roasted with honey, cinnamon, and butter until softened and browned. Then carefully placed in a homemade pie crust, the crust is partially folded over the apples, brushed with an egg wash, and baked until golden. 
The flaky buttery crust compliments the sweet and crisp apples perfectly. The warmth of the cinnamon adds a layer of depth. The apples on top got crisp while the slices below remained soft and almost gooey. The variety in texture was a true delight. 

I'll definitely be making this once again.
