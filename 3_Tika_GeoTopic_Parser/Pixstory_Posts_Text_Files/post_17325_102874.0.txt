According to GOAL (h/t Football.London), Chelsea could be in for a transfer boost with PSG said to be willing to sell Brazilian superstar Neymar in the summer if the right offer comes.

PSG are fresh off renewing Kylian Mbappe’s lucrative new contract and have successfully prevented their young sensation from joining Real Madrid. The repercussions however could impact Neymar with the club supposedly willing to part ways with him and balance the books.

Having played 28 games for the Parisiens this season, the former Barcelona man has scored 13 goals and provided eight assists across all competitions. Injury-plagued for most of the campaign, the 30-year-old has still produced decent numbers.

Despite Neymar’s admission as quoted by Fabrizio Romano that he wants to stay at PSG, there appears to be some belief that the club could choose to do otherwise. Whether this will encourage Chelsea to make a move remains to be seen.
