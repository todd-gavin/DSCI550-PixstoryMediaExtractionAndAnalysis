Epic Poetic All credits to Director Hanu for brilliant execution of a not an ordinary love story in an unimaginable way As the script is the core of every movie especially in this genre he did commendable job though the storyline is somewhat predictable the storytelling was unique I can t remember any other love story said in an investigative triller way with twist and turns The screenplay was compact and engaging The subplot in the beginning to introduce the character of Ram initially felt like a jis joy movie but later it unravels the same subplot has more to add in this amazing love story Even the opening shot which I thought just for the sake of it had more meanings later It makes you fall in love with love The innocence and purity of love which is missing in now a days romance movies is brought back You feel joyous elated sad and at times you are blushing as well while watching it Imagine that pure and sweet feeling of love that makes you feel your heart is full to overflowing with the effervescent emotions it evokes The movie is about that love It also shows that when you have your heart and soul filled with that love and those memories your life still goes on as that is what your love wants for you How ever far they are Raam and Seetha will always unite as only they can complete each other Rather than becoming decrepit she celebrates her love along with fulfilling her goals and duties No love story is complete without soulful music and eternal lyrics which was abundantly present and such perfect rendition of the songs by the singers that all the songs are going to become melodies Overall it made my weekend one of the best on the recent weeks Kudos to Dulquer Salmaan for showing why Raam will always be the ideal choice when choosing a husband Mrunal is ok but Seetha still needed to be played with more conviction as Seetha is beauty with brains Rashmika was a perfect brat
