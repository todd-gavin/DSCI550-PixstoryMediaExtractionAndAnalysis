Paris Saint-Germain made the announcement that they had fired manager Mauricio Pochettino
on Tuesday. In recent weeks, Pochettino's role as PSG's manager came under intense
examination. While the former Spurs player was able to lead the French powerhouses to the
Ligue 1 championship, his downfall was caused by his team's failure in other tournaments,
particularly the Champions League.

Many believed that the team failed last season despite having a star-studded lineup that
included players like Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr., and Kylian Mbappe, even though they won the
league title with a comfortable lead of 15 points.

The Argentine manager suffered a severe setback when Real Madrid, the eventual champions,
eliminated him from Europe's top championship. Pochettino has resigned as PSG's manager,
the club announced on their official website on July 5th.

Even after PSG won their 10th Ligue 1 championship in May, the celebration with the team's
players was disrupted by a protest by the club's supporters, who left the game with 15 minutes
left to play.

Despite having a star-studded team at his disposal at PSG, with Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, and
Lionel Messi spearheading the attack, Pochettino was only able to claim the league title last
season, failing to capture any of the other domestic trophies on the table.

After 84 competitive games in charge of PSG, Pochettino steps down with a record of 55 wins,
15 ties, and 14 defeats. In the end, Manchester United chose to appoint Erik ten Hag from Ajax
over Pochettino to fill the managerial vacancy left by interim Ralf Rangnick.
