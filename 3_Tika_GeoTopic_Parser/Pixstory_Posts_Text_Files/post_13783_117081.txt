Is there a new revolution in the offing in Indian football At least it appears to after going through the draft constitution of the All India Football Federation AIFF which has been prepared by the Supreme Court appointed Committee of Administrators CoA and submitted to the apex court for approval In the draft constitution the CoA has gone all out the break the monopoly of a handful of people who have been controlling the Indian football federation for decades If the new constitution is approved by the Supreme Court then all of who are in the federation for more than years as office bearers or executive committee members will have to say good bye to the AIFF Anyone who stays more than years in the federation is bound to develop vested interest So we have decided to put a cap on the tenure said a CoA member If implemented this definitely going to set a new trend in Indian football administration Going by the history football officials in India are mostly reluctant to leave their positions As per the National Sports Code no president or secretary of a national sports federation NSF is eligible to stay in their posts beyond years in a row but the ousted AIFF president Praful Patel tried to hold on to his chair beyond the period He cited several legal reasons to justify his action but was finally thrown out by the Supreme Court Patel s predecessor Priyaranjan Dasmunshi was president for years there was no sports code those days before he fell terminally ill And before Dasmunshi people like Khalifa Ziauddin M Dutta Ray or Pankaj Gupta held on to power throughout their lifetime All the power in Indian football remained confined in the hands of a selected few since the Independence The proposed constitution hasn t stopped here It has decided to handover huge power to former footballers who remained sidelined all these years If the constitution is approved by the Supreme Court then half of the AIFF executive committee of members from now on will have to be filled by former players
