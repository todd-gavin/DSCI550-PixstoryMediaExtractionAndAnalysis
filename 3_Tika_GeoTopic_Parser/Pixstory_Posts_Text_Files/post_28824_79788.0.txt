Education is a constitutional right in India, but its provision falls well below an adequate standard. Lack of education is a fundamental problem in India, and the state of the Indian government schools is a clear illustration of this. The Government of India is well aware of the problems in the Indian education system, but has been slow in responding to them. Schools are not properly qualified, with 31% of them not having a degree.
These failures of the Indian education system push people into working poorly remunerated and unsecure jobs, where they are exploited and trapped in a state of deprivation. A vicious cycle is created across generations. Education is important because it allows people to live fulfilled and dignified lives. States have an obligation to provide education to their citizens, however unfortunately, in India, that obligation is not being fulfilled.
