A pioneering, entertaining, ground breaking, philosophical Science Fiction classic. 
As we follow Neo’s journey (anagram for One as in ‘the one’) from a computer programmer at a respectable software company (he also is a hacker in his free time and uses the alias of Neo) he is discovered by both agents of the machines system of control but also by free people from this control and is first contacted by Morpheus who becomes Neo’s mentor and introduces him to The Matrix.
From start to finish you are taken on what feels like a true journey which includes lots of action and cool special effects which at the time were ground breaking and new and copied afterwards but never quite matched.
It has bags of style and coolness and uses a green tint when the actors are in the matrix and blue tint when they are in the real world.
So what is the matrix? 
The matrix is a virtual reality created by advanced intelligent machines to keep humanity in control whilst using them for energy to power themselves. This all occurred after man created AI and lost a war with them.
I’ll be Joe’s the, it took me a very long time (and I mean years) to understand the matrix as I thought it was very complicated and full of philosophical ideas which it is but essentially the story is very simple to grasp a so explained above. Morpheus also explains the story to Neo which he rejects at first and causes him to vomit.
It’s such a cooly executed piece of sci fi cinema by the Wachowskis who directed and wrote it. 
Influences from the Japanese manga series: ‘ghost in the shell’ is shown in the form of the mechanical tubes and holes used to plug the humans into the matrix and also sustain them.
If I recall correctly i didn’t even like it that much for many years but then again I was a lot younger back then.
Great science fiction movie and a must see!
