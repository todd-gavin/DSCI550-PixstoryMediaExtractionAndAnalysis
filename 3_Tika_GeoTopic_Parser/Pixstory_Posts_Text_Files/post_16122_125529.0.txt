Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha has landed in legal trouble just a day after its theatrical release. Delhi-based advocate Vineet Jindal has submitted a complaint to Delhi Police commissioner Sanjay Arora on Friday, seeking to file an FIR against Aamir Khan, Paramount Pictures, director Advait Chandan, and several others for allegedly ‘disrespecting the Indian Army and hurting Hindu Sentiments’ in his recently released film ‘Laal Singh Chaddha’.❌❌❌

Advocate Vineet Jindal has alleged in his complaint that there was objectionable content in the movie. He also sought registration of an FIR under sections 153 ,298 and 505 of the IPC against Khan, director Advait Chandan and Paramount Pictures🥲❌👎🏻

A part of Jindal’s complaint read, “In the movie, the makers have depicted that a mentally challenged person was allowed to join Army to fight in the Kargil War. It is a well-known fact that the best army personnel were sent to fight the Kargil war and rigorously trained army personnel fought the war but the movie makers intentionally depicted the said situation to demoralise and defame the Indian army.” In the film, Aamir is seen playing an Army official, among many other professions. 🤔🤔
