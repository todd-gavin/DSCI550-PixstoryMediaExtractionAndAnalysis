After ten brilliant years with Manchester City, where he won every domestic trophy on offer,
including five Premier League titles, and scored 184 goals, he joined the Catalan giants in the
summer of 2021.

Aguero arrived from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2011 and immediately made an impact,
scoring two goals on his debut and 23 goals in his first season, including a last-minute winner
against QPR to give City their first Premier League title.

City were assembling a team of superstars who would eventually fire them to victory at the time
of his arrival, and they began off the season with a 4-0 win over Swansea City under Roberto
Mancini.

Let's take a look at the players who played alongside Sergio Aguero in his Man City debut and
see where they are now.

Joe Hart

Joe Hart, who was once Manchester City's and England's unchallenged first-choice goalkeeper,
has struggled since leaving the Etihad. Following Pep Guardiola's appointment in 2016 and his
desire for a sweeper-keeper, Hart was loaned out to Torino and West Ham before joining
Burnley on a permanent basis in 2018.

He also lost his England place due to his bad form, and after warming the bench at Burnley and
Tottenham, he is now a first-choice 'keeper again, this time with Celtic north of the border.

Hartjoined City from Shrewsbury Town in 2006, trading League Two for the Premier League as a
highly-rated youth, and he struggled at times throughout his time with the club.

Micah Richards

Injury prevented Richards from realising his full potential as a Manchester City youth product,
and he was finally leased to Fiorentina in Italy before a catastrophic spell with Aston Villa.

Richards made his first-team debut in 2005 and stayed with the club for nine years until being
loaned to Serie A. The former right-back, now a Sky Sports pundit, is frequently seen attempting
to wound up Roy Keane.
