Football Australia will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Australian men's national team, currently known as the Socceroos, on June 17, 2022. 

Socceroos reported that this year marks the 100th anniversary of the Socceroos' inaugural match, which took place in Dunedin on June 17, 1922, with a team coached by Alf Morgan and captained by Alex Gibb. 

The tour included fourteen games, including three 'Tests' against New Zealand, and was made up of players from New South Wales and Queensland. New Zealand won the first game of the series 3-1, with William Maunder becoming the first Australian to score when he scored shortly before halftime.

Football Australia will commemorate this historic milestone in Australian sport with a series of activities, events, and initiatives throughout the rest of 2022, including the prospect of hosting a commemorative match between the Socceroos and New Zealand's All Whites later that year.

“The Socceroos are arguably Australia’s most identifiable and popular national sporting team, both at home and abroad, uniting the nation like no other sporting team,” said Football Australia Chief Executive Officer, James Johnson.
