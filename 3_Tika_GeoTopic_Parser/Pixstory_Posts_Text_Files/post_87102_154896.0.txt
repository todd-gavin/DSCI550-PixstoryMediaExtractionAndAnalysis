Chelsea and AC Milan squared off for the second time in a week’s span in the UEFA Champions League last night at the San Siro stadium and just like in the previous match, the Premier League side ended up victorious, this time by a slightly lower margin. 
Ever since taking up the managerial position, Graham Potter has been spot-on in his job and Chelsea has been unbeaten under his management so far. However, that might be because the team is under the hands of a new manager and the players want to impress him as much as they can to make a place in his favourite playing XI. 
Whatever be the case, Graham Potter’s tactics have worked so far. Chelsea totally dominated the entirety of the game last night. They maintained a crazy 71% possession throughout the game, attempted 15 shots and had 4 shots on target. They did not have to defend much however as AC Milan never really looked like a threat to begin with. 
However, we can not blame the Italian side much for that as one of their main defenders Fikoyo Tomori was sent off in the 18th minute in a controversial decision by the referee. Many fans think that it was too harsh a decision and that in no way did he deserve a red card. 
Chelsea’s first goal came from a neatly converted penalty by Jorginho and they doubled the lead soon after that via a Pierre Aubameyang goal. 
With this victory, Chelsea have almost confirmed their place in the Round of 16 of UEFA Champions League 2022/23. AC Milan, on the other hand, are currently on the 3rd position in Group E’s table and would have to perform extraordinarily in their remaining games to win a knockout qualification. To do that, they will have to defeat RB Salzburg who have not lost a single game in the UCL so far this season.
