Fire Safety Tips continues

Do you feel safe? Does the building appear to be overcrowded? Are there fire sources such as candles burning, cigarettes or cigars burning, pyrotechnics, or other heat sources that may make you feel unsafe? Are there safety systems in place such as alternative exits, sprinklers, smoke alarms, emergency lights and public address system? Ask the management for clarification about your concerns. If you do not feel safe in the building, leave immediately.
During an emergency

React immediately. If an alarm sounds, you see smoke or fire, or other unusual disturbance, immediately exit the building in an orderly fashion.

Get out, stay out! Once you have escaped, stay out. Under no circumstances should you ever go back into a burning building. Let trained fire fighters conduct rescue operations.
