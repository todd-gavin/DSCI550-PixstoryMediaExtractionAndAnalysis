Initially I thought it was scripted, googled immediately and found out it was real. Not the one to keep up with everything Hollywood so was shocked to find out that Will Smith who stormed the Oscars stage and struck comedian Chris Rock across the face for joking about his wife, didn’t do it for nothing . 
Jada Pinkett Smith, didn’t wear her bald look as a fashion statement, she was struggling with Alopecia, a health condition where u lose hair in patches and had gone public with her health condition. 
While initially it looked like a joke and people were laughing Jada didn’t like it from word go.
While we have seen many such scripted moments in such gala’s than have left stunned viewers, this one went too far. The joke must have been part of the comedians script but Will’s reaction was genuine . 
He was right when he said he needs to protect people. While Smith’s apology won’t harm as Violence is unacceptable, the academy should also apologise. 
Sometimes these jokes leave a bad taste in peoples mind. Like calling a guest a seat filler, making her stand while the host finishes her act on the seat. 
Rock, presenting the best documentary prize with a short comedy routine, cracked a joke comparing Jada to Demi Moore's appearance in the film "G.I. Jane" and suggesting she appear in a sequel. You can’t joke about this sorry, this is a no go area. 

In December, Pinkett Smith discussed her experience with the condition in an Instagram video, in which she pointed out a line that developed around her scalp due to the disorder.

Now at this point, I can only laugh,” the actor said. “Y’all know I’ve been struggling with alopecia and just all of a sudden one day, look at this line right here. Look at that. So it just showed up like that and this is going to be a little bit more difficult for me to hide.”
At the time, Pinkett Smith said that she had decided to speak about the condition “so y’all are not asking any questions”.
