First interview as a Milan footballer for Charles De Ketelaere awaiting the official presentation scheduled for Friday The Belgian explained that he strongly wanted a move to the Rossoneri I spoke to Maldini and Massara they told me they believed in me and wanted me at Milan I I&#39;ve had talks with them and my agents have been in contact with them since the beginning of the year When the transfer market starts there&#39;s always a bit of confusion Then I got to talk to the managers and the coach I absolutely wanted to come to Milan It took a while time but now I&#39;m happy Space for curiosity too with an explanation of why his shirt number is I have it as a kid it was assigned to me I received that number and started playing well so I never left it
