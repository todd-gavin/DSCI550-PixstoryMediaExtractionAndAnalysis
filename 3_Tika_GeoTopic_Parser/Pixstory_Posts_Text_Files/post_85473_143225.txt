Todd Boehly s appearance at a recent SALT conference has sparked an interesting debate in the last hours in football The idea of an all star Premier League game consisting of players from the north part of the England against a mixture of the southern Premier League clubs including London This has drawn criticism amongst journalists and some individuals support the idea but can it truly work One of the comments Boehly raised was the benefit of the game raising funds for the lower ranked clubs but credible writers have dismissed this claim stating the elite English clubs could do this without the need for such an event the idea is considered as another money generator On the other hand the game itself may draw eyes and bums on seats bring in broadcasters and external parties but where in the fixture list would this match fit in The Premier League season is already congested and one suggestion that has been placed is the replacement of the FA Community Shield The idea itself is so complex that it will require unpacking methodically The match itself looks do able and would be a sporting landmark in English history the appeal is definitely there The NBA division in the USA host a similar event entertaining a large audience However the game is considered to be mere dunk fest for the highlight reel with no effort in the defence therefore minimal contact and no injuries The NFL and MLB have a place in their own history but English fans in football may not want something forced on them considering they heckled Camilla Cabello off the stage during last seasons Champions League final Entertainment in the middle of any English sport is born out of Americanism and the way sport in the US is driven Is there a scenario where a game like this could work
