Arsenal have had its fair share of defensive problems in its history, but they have yielded many top-class defenders who earned the adoration of Arsenal's faithful and established themselves at Emirates Stadium.Â  
There are plenty of defenders Arsenal have unearthed and forged great chemistry on the pitch. At some point where Arsenal barely conceded any goals, thanks to their robust defense. 
In this article, we have ranked the top 10 best defenders in Arsenal history, let's have a look at them.
#10 William Saliba 
Saliba might have been at Arsenal for a long period of time, but the player did not get any game time. However, the new season 2022 was a changing time for the payer as he quickly earned Arteta's trust and has become an indispensable part of the squad. 
The 20-year-old has a great career ahead of him to maintain consistency and not succumb to pressure. The Frenchman has started six games for Arsenal this season.
#9 Sokratis
Sokratis was an absolute beast for the Gunners, as whenever he was on the pitch, Arsenal got a clean sheet in the match. He always put up an honest performance and was a key player under Arteta. 
But the 32-year-old became a peripheral figure as he aged and was later sold to Olympiacos as he fell down the pecking order. Sokratis had made 69 appearances during his time at Arsenal.
