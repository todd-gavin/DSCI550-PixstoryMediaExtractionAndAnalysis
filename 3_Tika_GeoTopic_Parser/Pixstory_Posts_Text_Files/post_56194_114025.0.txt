Two of the senior cabinet member of Boris Johnson resigns leaving the PM in huge distress. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and UK health secretary Sajid Javid resigned and affirmed their loss of confidence in his leadership.

The 42-year-old British Indian minister posted his resignation letter on Twitter soon after another senior Cabinet colleague, UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid, resigned.

The ministerial exits will come as a big disaster to Johnson's leadership and follow a day of high political drama since a former civil servant spoke out about Downing Street's handling of announcements against recently suspended MP Chris Pincher.

The public rightly expects the government to be administered properly, competently, and seriously," Sunak tweeted.

"I recognize this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning," he said.

It came soon after Johnson said he "bitterly regrets" giving Pincher a government role as Deputy Chief Whip after being made conscious of a misconduct complaint against him.

"In hindsight, it was the wrong thing to do and I apologize to everyone who has been badly affected by it. I just want to make clear that there's no place in this government for anybody who is predatory or abuses their position of power," he said.

Sajid Javid, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, in his resignation letter said, "We (Conservative party)Â may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public is concluding that we are now neither.

"The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree.

"I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership and you have therefore lost my confidence too," Javid, 52, said.
