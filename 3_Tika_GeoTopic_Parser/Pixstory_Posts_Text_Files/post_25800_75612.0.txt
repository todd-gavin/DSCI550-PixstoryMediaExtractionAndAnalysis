When i hear the word Srirangam the 1st thing comes to my mind is Hall of a Thousand Pillars . It is one of the remarkable feature and also this temple has four ways from all the directions ( east west north and south). The temple and the 1,000-pillared hall were constructed in theÂ VijayanagarÂ period (1336â€“1565) on the site of an older temple.
If anyone get the chance to visit Tamilnadu then they should surely visit this temple and it's located in Tiruchirappalli .
