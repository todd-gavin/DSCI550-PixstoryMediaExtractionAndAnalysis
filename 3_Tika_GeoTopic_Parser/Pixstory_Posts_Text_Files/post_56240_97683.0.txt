With the age being 21 for drinking many states have laws on drinking for age below 21 under the supervision of adults or at home. Drinking is a choice. It helps many people to enjoy subtle moments in life. Moreover, 18 is the age of adulthood and as adults, they should be able to make decisions on alcohol consumption. Restrictions could only make things worse. Lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18 would lessen the thrill of breaking the law to get a drink. It is largely ineffective as most of them make decisions at the age of 18 whether they have to choose to drink or not. Even law enforcement agencies don't prioritize the Minimum Legal Drinking Age(MLDA) as they have more important aspects to check upon. Rather when it comes to entrapping someone this law is often used. 

Many people below MLDA are afraid to approach doctors when they are hurt from alcohol-related injuries or accidents due to fear of Lowering MLDA 21 would reduce the legal consequences.

State governments should be given the right to establish a lower legal drinking age that reflects their unique demographics, legal context, and history. Lowering MLDA 21 would be good for the economy. As the revenue from alcohol is very important for the country.
