I mean, that is kind of a great idea, considering no babies die, less unwanted but innocent kids who go through abuse, neglect of thrown off in uncaring foster homes and less femicides that men commit because they don't wanna provide child support or be fathers already, lot less killing of women for honor. It is kind of an amazing way to go. But does that word "mandatory" gives you icks and tingles? Does it sound out of place? Does it feel scary that someone who has absolutely no right on your body will have enough power to decide for your body? That someone else is deciding your future for you â€“ even though, unlike birthing kids, it's reversible?

So probably, mind your own business instead of trying to make laws against women's bodily autonomy.
