Since he and Abdullah were in contact with both the Americans and Taliban, they had a plan," said Ali Akbar Khan, a Peshawar-based journalist who had closely monitored last year’s events in Kabul. "They were the ones who engaged with the Taliban and Haqqani Network leaders after the fall of Kabul. They had the Taliban's ear and their emphasis on forming an 'inclusive government' was highlighted by media. They thought that their guidance and advice was unavoidable for the Taliban."


Karzai and Abdullah were further emboldened by the secret visit of CIA director William Burns to Kabul and his meeting with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the current Afghan deputy prime minister. A role in the future Afghan government for both was allegedly discussed in that meeting.


The Taliban's plan, which was kept a secret until the announcement of their government, turned out to be completely the opposite of what Karzai and Abdullah had expected. The new Afghan government was neither inclusive, nor did it have any representation for women. Another move that surprised many within and outside the country was 

Mullah Baradar, till then believed to be the prime candidate for head of government, being made deputy PM along with Abdul Salam Hanafi, another Taliban leader.


Both Karzai and Abdullah are, however, still considered valuable by the Taliban. "The regime realises that both are prominent Afghan figures having global acceptance and recognition. Instead of allowing them to leave the country, they think their stay in the country would be more beneficial," said 

Syed Waqas Shah, a Pakistani journalist who covered the war against terror in Afghanistan for over a decade.

According to him, the Taliban believes that Karzai or Abdullah living abroad and being openly critical of the government would be more harmful. "For the Taliban, the better option is to keep them under check and strict surveillance in Kabul."
