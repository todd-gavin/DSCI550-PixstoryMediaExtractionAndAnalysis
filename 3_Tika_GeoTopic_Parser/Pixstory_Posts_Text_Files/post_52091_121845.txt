The Taj Mahal is still the most stunning man made tourist destination in the world despite having been constructed centuries ago One of the greatest wonders I had always been very intrigued by this majesty And there was no way I could have stopped myself from learning more With the Taj Mahal India s Mughal emperor Shah Jahan pays tribute to his devoted wife Arjumand Banu Begum also known historically as Mumtaz Mahal or the jewel of the palace Mumtaz was selling silks and beads when Jahan came across her in the Agra bazaar and the young prince instantly fell in love with the Persian aristocrat After pursuing Mumtaz for five years Jahan wed her in Mumtaz gave birth to fourteen children for Jahan however she passed away after her final delivery from complications following childbirth As a result of his distress Jahan announced an exceptional two year period of mourning and summoned craftsmen from all over the Muslim world to start creating an unparalleled monument to honour his enduring love for Mumtaz The result was the Taj Mahal the most well known landmark in India The spectacular building took years and artisans and elephants to complete Many people believe Shah Jahan chopped off his artisans hands so they couldn t make another Taj Mahal again Yikes Another belief is that it was actually built over an invaded Shiva Temple of the Hindus during the Mughal Regime
