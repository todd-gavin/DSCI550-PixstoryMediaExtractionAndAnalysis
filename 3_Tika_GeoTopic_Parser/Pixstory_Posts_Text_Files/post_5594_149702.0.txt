14-year-old Parvati is not in school. She is at work. â€¨Adivasi families like hers depend on the forest for seasonal work, including the collection and sale of the tendu leaf. Depending on its final use, the steps in the process vary. The tendu season in Chitrakoot district is over. Parvati and her family have moved on to other seasonal jobs. The women of the household will take on the burden of housework as well as the running of the household. Parvati is the only member of her family who has gone to school, and she also has stopped after Class 8 due to the lack of money. Around 10 million people (mostly tribals) across India are involved in the beedi industry, cigarettes made of the tendu leaf. As Parvati says, a bundle fetches 5 rupees and a gaddi fetches 1 rupee. How many bundles will Parvati have to make to make minimum wage?
