you place the order in the most unique manner — using only sign language. And in no time you are served sandwiches, momos and other snacks. The cafeteria also serves 150 brews of tea sourced from various countries. 

What sets this cafe apart from all the other restaurants in the industrial town is that it is mainly staffed with cooks and waiters who are hearing and speech impaired. Duggar has trained them all to run the cafe and serve the customers with a smile. ☺
