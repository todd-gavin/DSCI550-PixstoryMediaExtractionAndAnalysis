When you re stressed it can be hard to know where to start so i have crowdsourced a list of affirmations Here are positive affirmations Delegation isn t failure It s okay to ask for help My worth is not defined by my to do list This job is what I do and I do it well But it does not define who I am I can do anything but I can t do everything My well being is my top priority Taking an hour to unplug and recharge my batteries will help me go more Rest is work too It s a job that needs to be done It s okay to work hard but it s not okay to work so hard that my work is no longer effective It s okay to pause and take a break but don t give up This is not the end of the world Start again tomorrow Inhale and exhale when you re stressed it really works
