Gennaro Gattuso:

the most difficult of them all. Gennaro Gattuso had no qualms about confronting his opponents,
and occasionally, he would let his wrath spill over into his contacts with the referee as well.

Gattuso was a great player for Italy and AC Milan, so don't let the violence detract from his
talent.

Thanks to the effort Gattuso was doing behind the scenes, Andrea Pirlo developed into one of
the finest midfielders of his generation. "Rino" vigorously defended his defence, and it was always a pleasure to watch him perform.

Gattuso's hard ethic and love for the game more than made up for his lack of showy abilities. He
will be remembered as one of the greatest defensive midfielders of all time after winning two
Scudettos, one Champions League, and a World Cup throughout his career.
