As per The Hard Tackle, The Blues are looking at possible replacements for Antonio Rudiger. Hence, they have shortlisted Leicester City's Wesley Fofana as a possible option. 

Thomas Tuchel has reportedly been impressed by Wesley Fofana's performances in recent seasons. Owing to this, the German has included him in his two-man shortlist that also includes Jules Kounde. 

The centre-back played a key part in the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Leicester City last season. Fofana played the entire 90 minutes as the Foxes beat the Blues and secured the first FA Cup title in their history. 

But the Leicester City defender has been very unlucky with injury. Wesley Fofana broke his leg in a preseason game last summer and has not played since. But even then, Thomas Tuchel would love to bring the player to Chelsea in the summer. 

The 21-year old Frenchman is a product of St. Etienne's academy. He played a season with the French club before joining Leicester City in October 2020. With the Foxes, Wesley Fofana has made 38 appearances as of now. 

Without Fofana, Leicester City have struggled for form this season. The defensive pairing of Jonny Evans and Caglar Soyuncu have been error-prone. Owing to this, the Foxes find themselves in 12th position. 



Potential suitors for Rudiger


As stated earlier, Antonio Rudiger is expected to leave at the end of the season. Real Madrid have emerged as the favourites to sign the German. But their initial salary offer of €175,000-per-week has been rejected by the centre-back. 

Other European giants have also taken note of Rudiger's prowess. Hence Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are also looking to capitalize on the German if he decides to leave Chelsea in the summer. It has to be seen what Rudiger decides to do at the end of the season.
