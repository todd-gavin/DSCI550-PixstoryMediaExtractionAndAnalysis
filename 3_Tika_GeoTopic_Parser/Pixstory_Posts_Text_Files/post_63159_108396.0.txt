According to a senior government source, a Delhi-bound SpiceJet plane carrying 185 passengers and six crew members made an emergency landing in Patna on Sunday afternoon, minutes after take-off, after the cabin crew noticed sparks coming from an engine. According to a SpiceJet statement, all passengers on the Boeing 737-800 aircraft were safely deboarded. 
"The cockpit crew suspected a bird impacted on engine No. 1 during rotation (takeoff)" (left engine). The aeroplane continued to climb because the crew did not notice anything unusual,"
