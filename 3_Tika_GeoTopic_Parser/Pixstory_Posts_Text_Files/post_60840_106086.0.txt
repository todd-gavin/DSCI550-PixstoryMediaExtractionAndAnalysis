I adore Kolkata for several reasons. The city has its charm steeped in history and culture.

Whenever I visit this historic city buzzing with life, I make pilgrimages to historical places. Today I visited the famous Coffee House which has been immortalized in Manna Dey's song 'Coffee House er shei adda...'.

What might appear to be just another coffee house is mostly known for being the hub of cultural and intellectual movements in Kolkata. It was once a hangout (adda in Bengali) for famous artists like Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen. It still is a adda for the students of Presidency University and artists of the city. I even ran into a famous Bengali soap drama artist today!!

There's just something so nostalgic about this place that I love visiting it whenever I'm in the city. Even though I had to get drenched in the summer rains to get to the coffee house today, it was worth the trouble. If you ever find yourself in Kolkata, then definitely visit the coffee house and spend some time looking around.
