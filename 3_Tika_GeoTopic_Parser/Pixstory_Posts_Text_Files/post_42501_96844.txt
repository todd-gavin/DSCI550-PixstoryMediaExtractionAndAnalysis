The semifinals of the UEFA Champions League will start tonight and Manchester City will play against Real Madrid at Etihad Stadium As a Real Madrid fan it s difficult to say but Manchester City is the clear favorite for the semifinals over the two legs but it will be silly if we underestimate Real Madrid because in the round of and quarter finals Real Madrid successfully beat PSG and Chelsea But in both the rounds Real Madrid was trailing at one moment and after that they made a historic comeback and Manchester City will not give any chance to Real Madrid to make a comeback like that Both teams will not be able to start their best playing because of injuries and suspension Casemiro is very doubtful to play for Real Madrid and Mendy Alaba are not fit to start the match against Manchester City On the other hand Cancelo will not play the first leg against Real Madrid because of suspension and Kyle Walker John Stones are doubtful to play because of injuries Manchester City will look forward to taking as much advantage of the home situation and want to score at least two goals against Real Madrid so that they will feel relaxed before the second leg of the semifinal which will be played at Real Madrid s home Santiago Bernabeu On the other hand Real Madrid will look forward to keeping a clean sheet against Manchester City which is very difficult and Carlo Ancelotti will want his team to score at least a goal So they go back home with a little bit of an advantage This match will not be easy for both the teams Peo Guardiola wants to win UCL desperately with Manchester City and one wrong move can destroy his dream and on the other hand the Real Madrid team doesn t want to put a dent in their King of Europe image and will fight till the end to reach into finals of UEFA Champions League May the best team win but I wish Real Madrid emerges as a winner in the semifinals
