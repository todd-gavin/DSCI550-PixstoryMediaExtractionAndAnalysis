Earlier festive season was just a nice long holiday for me toh finally take a break from school and relax but now that I am living alone I realise how important festive season is for me.I have so many memories of me and my family dressing up and going to pandal hoping, eat some delicious prashad , and see the decorations on different temples .How my neighbours used to visit each other house to wish us and see the Ravan Dahan that used to happen in my colony.I love how people celebrate Navratri with so much joy and harmony and that is my favourite thing about festive season.
Happy Dusshera everyone.
