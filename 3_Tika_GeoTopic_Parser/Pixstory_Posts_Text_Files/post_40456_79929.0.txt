Saying smoothies are the component to help you gain weight is not 100% accurate.
Rather smoothies are the rightmost way to overcome the craving of shakes, sweetness and chemicals replaced by natural fruits, curd, milk, honey and nuts.

There are various ways to make different types of smoothies to add healthy, nutritious and tastiest lifestyle to your daily routine.

1. Guava-black grape smoothie
1 choped guava+ 4-5 black grapes+ 3 spoons of curd+ half a cup of soy milk+ 1 table spoon of honey + handful of nuts

2. Pomegranate-black grape smoothie
9-10 strawberry+ 5-6 black grapes+ 1-2 spoons of curd+ 1 a cup of soy milk+ 1 table spoon of honey + handful of nuts

Choosing a heathy lifestyle is in our hands by replacing the chemicals, sugar with raw and organic fruits and vegetables.

So it is in our hands whether to chose a healthy-nutritional over chemical based drinks.
