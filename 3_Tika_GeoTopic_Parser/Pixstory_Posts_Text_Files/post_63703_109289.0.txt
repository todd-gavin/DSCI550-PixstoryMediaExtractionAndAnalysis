Obi Wan Kenobi episode 6 is by far the best episode in the entire show, as it really does justice to the character of both Obi Wan and Vader and made their final encounter before A New Hope an extremely emotional one, making it just the way it was supposed to feel.

Plus it made up for the bad banter they had in episode 3, further remedying that.

The show’s biggest problems in total have been Reva, shoddy direction, lazy writing, way too short episodes and lack of focus, which made the show greatly mess with the continuity and the overall lore. 

All the episodes except 1 and 6 were far too short, with plot details having little room to breathe and many finer details having no space to develop. 

Nonetheless, the show’s main point is to show the transition of Obi Wan from sassy, wisecracking ROTS Ewan McGregor to the wise hermit Jedi Master, Alen Guiness from A New Hope, and it does that very well here. 

While episode 6 is not flawless it is legitimately very good and far surpassed any expectations that I might have had making it a more than worthy finale where almost everything fits, even if the problems of earlier episodes tend to leave their mark here.

Overall, Obi Wan Kenobi is plagued by mistakes, but has genuine respect for Star Wars and delivers far more than any Disney Star Wars sequel has ever been able to.

Score: 9/10
