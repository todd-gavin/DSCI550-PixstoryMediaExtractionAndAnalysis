Just when you thought the Rock-Smith drama was over, Chris Rock brings it all back at a stand-up show with Kevin Hart.


During the gig, Chris Rock joked about getting smacked by Will Smith at the Oscars in 2022.

Chris Rock took the traditional comic approach, leveraging his pain to create a humorous stand-up routine! While co-headlining a gig with Kevin Hart, the 57-year-old comedian-actor addressed Will Smith's reported strike at him at the Oscars 2022. If you don't remember what happened, Chris made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's bald head during her alopecia diagnosis, which led to the confrontation. As a consequence, the Oscar winner stormed the stage, striking Rock and verbally attacking him, shouting, "Keep my wife's name out of your f*****g mouth."

Chris discussed cancel culture during his stand-up set, saying, "Anyone who thinks words hurt has never been hit in the face." Chris also referred to the 53-year-old actor as "Suge Smith," which might be a reference to the jailed Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight.

Later in the sketch, Chris Rock remarked, "Motherf****r, I'm not a victim. Yes, motherf****r, that s**t hurt. But I shrugged it off and went back to work the next day... I don't go to the hospital because I have a papercut."
