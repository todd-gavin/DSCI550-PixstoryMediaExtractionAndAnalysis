Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea)

Graeme Le Saux is someone Lukaku should look to for inspiration as he prepares to return to Chelsea. The full-back, who rose through the ranks at Stamford Bridge, stayed with the club for four years before joining Blackburn Rovers.

Le Saux's value rose even further when he was a constant presence for Blackburn, who finished second in his first season and went on to win the Premier League the following year. In 1997, Chelsea came calling for his talents, making Le Saux the most expensive defender in English football at the time.

Le Saux lived up to his £5 million price tag by adding multiple trophies to his cabinet after returning to familiar surroundings in a record trade. In 1998, he was unlucky to miss the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final, and two years later, the FA Cup final.


Don Hutchinson (West Ham United)

Don Hutchinson joined West Ham for the first time in 1994 as one of Harry Redknapp's new acquisitions. Due to his bad disciplinary record and questionable off-field attitude, the midfielder failed not establish himself as a regular with the Hammers.

Hutchinson was moved away to Sheffield United after only two seasons in east London. After that, the former Scotland international resurrected his career, spending time with Everton and Sunderland.

Although Hutchinson's achievements enticed West Ham to re-sign him for a then-club-record cost of £5 million, he was unable to replicate his previous success upon his return.

 Hutchinson suffered an ACL injury six months after the move in 2001, and his career was cut short.
