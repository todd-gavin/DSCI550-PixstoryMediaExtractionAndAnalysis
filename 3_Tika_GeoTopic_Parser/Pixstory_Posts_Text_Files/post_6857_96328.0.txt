Condragulations to Willow Pill, for taking home the Rupaul’s Drag Race Season 14 crown 👑

“I've gained and lost a lot in the last year, but one of the most valuable parts I didn't expect was being able to fall in love with myself again,” Willow Pill posted on Instagram before the series finale.

From cooking up a spaghetti bath to honoring mushrooms and critiquing botox, Willow Pill’s looks are bound to make you re-invent and rediscover your true self.

Willow’s name comes from her Cystinosis, that requires frequent blood draws and medication, and from Buffy the Vampire Slayer character -“I'm an adorably twisted little doll" with a different story behind every look and a sense of humor that comes from darkness. 

Willow has won one maxi challenge, one mini challenge, and has been in the bottom twice.
