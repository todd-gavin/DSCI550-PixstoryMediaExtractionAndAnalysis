This could be the game that defines where both sides finish in the league season. Last seasons top four race came down to 2 points, and there’s enough evidence to suggest these two sides are competing for a finish somewhere in the top 3-4 places, maybe even a league title at a stretch.PROGRESSThe last time these two sides faced each other in the league, Tottenham swung a Champions League ticket entry in their favour. Since then, they have recruited well and started strongly without playing well, in typical Conte style. For Arsenal, they’ve arguably made the biggest progress in terms of the squad recruitment and style of play deployed so far. RESULTSTypically, the pattern of results is Arsenal win the home games, and Spurs win their home game in the reserve fixture but there’s every chance Spurs make this fixture difficult for the home side.Arsenal need a statement win, putting to bed the debate around whether Arsenal can win against the top sides, referencing the United loss last month. Winning breeds more confidence, and continues the fight at the top.For Spurs, Conte can further emphasise why he was appointed. The barrier to a trophy remains for them, but a strong league finish is another step for them. Both sides aren’t expected to win the title, but Conte’s background spells ‘winning’ wherever he goes in terms of trophy success, albeit however ugly.Another spectacular game awaits us as the first league game of the weekend. Who bleeds first?
