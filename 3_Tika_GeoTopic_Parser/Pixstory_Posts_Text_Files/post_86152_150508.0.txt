I think its wrong to target celebrities for wearing clothes of their choice. Afterall everyday so many women are trolled for wearing clothes they feel like. Double standards of the partraichy- Its fine if a man walks around bare tshirt whereas a woman is exploited for wearing body tight dresses stating them as schlumpy and nkt fit for the society.
Therefore I think this kind of content is toxic and shouldn't really be there on social media. It really spreads wrong attitude amongst the youth of the country.
