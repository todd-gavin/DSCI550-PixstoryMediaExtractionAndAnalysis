Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, recently announced on Twitter, that the film, “The Kashmir Files”, will be exempt from taxes in Uttar Pradesh. The release of the film has kicked up a storm, and social media is divided on the issue. While the Prime Minister and multiple BJP leaders and ministers have praised the film, many have also expressed concerns regarding the polarising impact of the movie. Incidents of incendiary speeches were seen in multiple theatres that were showing this movie.

Against the backdrop of this controversy, a video of UP CM, Yogi Adityanath has gone viral on social media where he can be seen crying at an event. The video is accompanied by a Hindi caption that claims that Adityanath broke into tears during a screening of “The Kashmir Files”. It also urges users to go and see the film.

The video has also been shared widely on Facebook with similar claims.

We performed a keyword search on YouTube and came across a video report by ABP news, published in October 2017. The report states that Yogi Adityanath broke into tears during an event for martyrs in Gorakhpur. Parts of the viral video matches the visuals in ABP News’ report.

In addition to this, we also found a report by Zee News published on October 21, 2017. The report confirms that Yogi Adityanath was present for an event commemorating martyrs and he broke into tears when a song from the film Border (1997) was being played.

To conclude, the viral video is old, unrelated, and not from a screening of The Kashmir Files.
