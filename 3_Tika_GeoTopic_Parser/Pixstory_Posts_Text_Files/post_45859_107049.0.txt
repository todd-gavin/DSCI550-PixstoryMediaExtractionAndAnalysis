Melania Trump gave her first interview since leaving the White House in January 2021 last week, and she labelled Vogue Magazine "biassed" for not including her on the cover during her time as First Lady. 

As per shefinds, In the interview, Fox Nation anchor Pete Hegseth stated that Trump had "never" featured on the cover of the magazine and questioned her why she believed other First Ladies (such as Dr. Jill Biden, Michelle Obama, and Hillary Clinton) had. 

Trump, 52, did, as many may recall, grace the cover of Vogue in February 2005 while wearing her wedding gown, but she appeared irritated that she did not do so during her time as First Lady.

Speaking about the legendary fashion publication, Trump said, “They are biased, and they have likes and dislikes, and it’s so obvious.” She continued, “And I think American people and everyone see it, and I have much more important things to do — and I did in the White House — than being on the cover of Vogue.”

But but, the drama doesn’t end here!

Stephanie Winston-Wolkoff, a former unpaid senior assistant to the first lady, disclosed to The Daily Beast that Vogue requested a picture shoot with Trump after her husband took office in early 2017. 

Trump, according to the adviser, declined because the magazine did not guarantee her a spot on the cover. Trump's accusation that Vogue is prejudiced comes just months after First Lady Dr. Jill Biden was featured on the cover of the magazine's August 2021 issue.

So, whom do you believe?
