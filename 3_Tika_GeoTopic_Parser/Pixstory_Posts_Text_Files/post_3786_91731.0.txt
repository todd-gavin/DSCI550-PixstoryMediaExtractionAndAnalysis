We all know how hard women had to work to be included in sports. Historically, sports are not considered “appropriate” for a girl. Why? 
Because playing in the sun can affect her complexion which will make her undesirable to guys, training can alter her physique and make her masculine, and women are supposed to handle the household and should rather focus on learning cooking and cleaning. Every girl I know with a passion for sports has heard one or more of the above arguments in her life. 

But now, as some people say, times are changed. Women are equally represented in sports and excel in the field. It is true that participation of women in sports has grown substantially over the years but the inherent bias which is rooted in age old mentality is still present; and this bias presents itself in wage gaps. 

Whether professional players receive salaries or individual prize money from competitions, male athletes in basketball, golf, soccer, baseball and tennis make anywhere from 15% to nearly 100% more than female athletes. While compensation for women has improved over the past decade, the gap still extends to even the world’s highest-paid players. (Source: Adelphiedu)

This begs the question that how can people say that women in sports are excelling when statistics tell a different story. Male players are able to afford every luxury there is while female players struggle to make ends meet. 

Why do these excellent girls who represent the country on an international level have to struggle so much to get their much deserved pay? It is all the more alarming how conveniently this issue is never raised or talked about enough by authorities. 
This is also reflective of a gender bias wherein the issues or women are never addressed. 

In theory, sports is an honourable profession but is this ideology true when this “honourable” profession is smeared with sexism?
