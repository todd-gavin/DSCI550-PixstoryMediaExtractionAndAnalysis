Jake Gyllenhall is a genius I always love to start my reviews of movies involving Jake in this way I still think Jake is under appreciated when it comes to his acting We tend to forget how really solid Jake is as an actor The Guilty is a shining example of that we know Jake s talent and we know how he can absolutely shine in any movie he stars in The Guilty is high octane and thrilling story where Jake Gyllenhall works as a officer From the beginning of the movie we see Jake struggling with some sort of anxiety and trying to make his way into his job where he seemingly does not want to fit in Apart from its thrill and incredible storytelling The Guilty tackles a lot of issues according to me Not only does the twist at the end seems amazing as you just do not see it coming it is incredibly heartbreaking as well The whole story is incredibly heartbreaking The movie shows anxiety of the job of a police officer in its rawest form even though the case of Jake is very different the movie does show a fragment of the anxiety and struggle of mental health related to a police officer s job This movie is an experience everyone should have it s bold and its brilliant Watch it on your quest for discovering Netflix originals
