Paul Rusesabagina director of the H tel des Mille Collines in Kigali hid moderate Tutsi and Hutus in the rooms of his hotel In that genocide that cost the lives of a thousand people from April to July Paul earned the fame of African Schindler His story inspired the film Hotel Rwanda And he really could not have imagined that years later he would have ended up in prison on terrorism charges for having supported the heirs of the Hutu genocides precisely in Kagame&#39;s new Rwanda The story involving this man is not entirely clear The director of the HÃ´tel des Mille Collines managed to escape life imprisonment but there are many unresolved issues His supporters claim that the accusations about his past have a political motivation And they criticize the process that led to his conviction Rights of defense trampled on fabricated evidence and pre-packaged judgments led to the conviction they say And even the US State Department agrees that the trial was not fair History will clarify doubts If we follow the film that made him known to the world at the time of the massacres Paul chose neither ferocity nor indifference Help the tutsi despite being a hutu When the world closed its eyes it opened its arms reads the tag line of the film
