"Happy Earth Day!

EarthDay.org is delighted to announce that we have partnered with Earth Warriors Global to bring an amazing global competition to schools to celebrate their love of their planet. We hope to spark their creative minds by using their planet as their muse - join us for a climate led poetry competition; there are 3 different age categories (aged 3-16) and the option to submit your student on an individual basis or as part of a group or whole class.
