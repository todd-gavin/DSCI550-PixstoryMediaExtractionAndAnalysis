What is the use of forgiving someone who actually doesn't care much about his apology?
Obviously, this will just give them another chance to misuse or misbehave.
I think forgiveness should have some limits; one cannot forgive anyone or everyone for the sake of feeling good; honestly, forgiveness does not always ease your pain; instead, it aggravates.
Forgiving someone who doesn't deserve your forgiveness is unfair.
It is unfair not for anyone else but, most importantly, for you.
For someone who has done something inappropriate and unacceptable doesn't deserve a forgiveness.
