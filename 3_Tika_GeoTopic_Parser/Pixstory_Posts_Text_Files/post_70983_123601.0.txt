Britney Spears makes her comeback to the music industry with a bang! This time, as a free woman. 

Britney Spears will will collaborate on the song "Hold Me Closer," a duet of "Tiny Dancer," from Sir Elton John's 1972 blockbuster album. Sir Elton John announced the same with an Instagram post: a rose and a rocket emote under the words "Hold Me Closer". 

Since the pop diva' 13-year conservatorship came to an end in November, the song will be her first to be released, which has Billboard speculating who she would want to work with next. Selena Gomez or Madonna, guests at her wedding? Or how about a Beyonc√© remix of "Break My Soul"?
