As the sound of bullets silenced, a hurried search was conducted in the school premises from where about a tractor trolley load of items was seized which included 2 looted 0.303 Police Rifles, other weapons, lot of ammunition, medicines, syringes and documents. I ensured that we did not stay at the school for more than 15 minutes after the seizure since our surprise had been lost after the close encounter, and since staying for longer would have given the fleeing Maoists an opportunity to regroup and lay ambush at another place in the probable direction of our retreat. Thus by around 5.40 am we left the place and started for Adhaura, cautious all the way and with full speed possible in the terrain. We reached the village of Lohra at a distance of about 25 kms from Soli where the mobile towers were accessible and I could inform the Police Headquarters about the recent developments. 

I was glad that all my forces were safe and that we had actually returned with a booty after attacking one of the safest dens of the Maoists in what they understood as their liberated zone. All the while during the encounter as we could hear bullets speeding away inches from us, we had been continuously looking at our bodies to see that no damage had been done as yet. Miraculously enough, despite the flow of hundreds of bullets at close quarters none of the about 60 men accompanying me had been injured. The surprise had ensured safety and the Maoists who could have damaged us at close quarters were forced to retreat in their own stronghold suffering huge losses in terms of both resources as well as psychology. After all in such hostile territory, the war is fought not just physically but is also a game of mind and wits. We had won this round for sure as we safely arrived at Adhaura at about 8 am accomplishing the Mission of Visiting Soli.
