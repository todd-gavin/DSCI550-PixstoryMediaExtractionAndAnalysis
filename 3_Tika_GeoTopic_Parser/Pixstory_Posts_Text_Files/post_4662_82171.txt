Cod supergenes have shed light on how they respond to overfishing and these supergenes could make them more resilient to other environmental changes That s according to a new study published by scientists in Norway This could be good news in that cod have genetic architecture in place that will permit them to respond to climate change but for now this is rather speculative For those of us who study how fish species evolve under strong selective pressure from commercial fishing cod has been a poster species For instance scientists have previously found that cod in the north west Atlantic showed signs of reproducing at a smaller size or younger age before numbers collapsed The latest study examined the current and historical genome the complete set of genetic instructions contained in an organism s DNA of cod The scientists were particularly interested in areas of highly conserved supergenes and what they can tell us about these ecologically critical but heavily exploited marine predators Supergenes are not extra individual genes as such Rather they are combinations of genetic material that are more conserved through the generations Often they are strongly coupled or linked and are responsible for a set of traits in an organism that are very important such as linking growth rates with reproduction capacity The authors found three supergenes conserved in the cod off Norwegian shores And the three supergenes were found in different relative abundance in two distinct cod populations inshore and offshore This reinforces what we know about cod in the north east Atlantic and is a good thing since if the cod were all one breeding population they would be more vulnerable to overexploitation An interesting consequence of this research is that the scientists can combine their genomics approaches with knowledge from old stories and pictures and records of fish bones and fishing equipment found at archeological sites in order to reconstruct the likely population sizes of cod through history Read more at The Conversation Imagery Travel Faery shutterstock
