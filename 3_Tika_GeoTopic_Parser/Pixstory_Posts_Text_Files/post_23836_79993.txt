I was on my way back home from a long and exhausting day at college when I stopped for a second looked up from my phone and noticed this Made me realise how many gorgeous sunsets I ve missed out on because I never bothered to look around taking the beauty around me for granted assuming its always going to be there How the only sunsets I had actually seen were on Instagram Now I take moment as often as I can to look at the beauty in the sky and the beauty around me
