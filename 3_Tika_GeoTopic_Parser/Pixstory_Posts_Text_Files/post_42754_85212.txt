I as a kid always wished to have a mentor like that of John Keeting from the movie Dead Poets Society And in search of this I got lost No other came this close except one who became my business teacher Not just a business teacher but also a mentor through two years of my high schooling It s true that some people really mold us into our best selves and that teacher was one of them I remember having mentorship programs under her where I told her the reason of my hindering grades might be exhaustion To which she replied saying I m paraphrasing Would you maybe wanna go out for a movie and some snacks to chill down after school hours or so And I was completely taken aback as no teacher s ever shown that amount of interest in me Even though it couldn t happen since the pandemic began right away I do wish it to happen one day It s on my bucket list and I m gonna tick it Also I remember her on her birthdays and pretty much quite often when I hear the word business which is like almost every day She truly is the best teacher for me like ever
