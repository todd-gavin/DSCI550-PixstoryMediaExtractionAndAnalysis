Academic pressure is taking a toll on children's mental health, and it's something that we need to start addressing now.

The younger generation is particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of academic pressure, because they're still growing and developing emotionally. This means that they're not as capable of handling stress and stress-related situations as well as us. In fact, research has shown that students who experience high levels of academic stress are more likely to have low self-esteem and feelings of insecurity.

Furthermore, academic stress can also lead to depression and other mental health problems. It can cause kids to become too stressed or overloaded to focus properly on their studies, which can eventually lead to them dropping out of school or having difficulties in future careers. We need to do whatever we can to help our children cope with the competitive world they're living in, and one of the best ways to do this is by providing them with a supportive environment as individuals and revolutionary changes as a community. We can't let capitalism suck the childhood out of our kids. It is unfair and cruel.
