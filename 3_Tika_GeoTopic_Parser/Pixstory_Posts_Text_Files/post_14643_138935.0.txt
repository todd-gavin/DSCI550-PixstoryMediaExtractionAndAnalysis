ðŸ‘‰Clean high-touch surfaces using soap and water, or another detergent if it is dirty. Follow this up by a household disinfectant.
Use disinfectant products containing alcohol (ensure that it is around 70 per cent) or diluted bleach. Vinegar and other natural products are not recommended.
ðŸ‘‰Ensure that you follow the directions on the cleaning products to make sure that they are being used as recommended and to avoid any potential damage to your surfaces.
ðŸ‘‰It is important not to wipe off or remove disinfectants as soon as they have been applied to a surface. Disinfectant products, such as wipes and sprays, need to remain on a surface for several minutes in order to be effective.
ðŸ‘‰Consider using wipeable covers for electronics such as laptops and remotes.
ðŸ‘‰Floors should be cleaned and disinfected with a household cleaner. Pay special attention to floor surfaces that receive a high traffic on a daily basis. If shoes are not removed, or if you share your home with pets, there is the added risk of bringing in bacteria and viruses from the outside.
ðŸ‘‰For soft surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces.
