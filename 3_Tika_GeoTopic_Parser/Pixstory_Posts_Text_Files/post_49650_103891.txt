Lia Thomas is an American swimmer and student at the University of Pennsylvania In March she became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I national championship in any sport after winning the women s yard freestyle event She was kn headlines since then and now she has reacted to the critics who said she gained an unfair advantage competing against women According to ABC News she said The biggest misconception I think is the reason I transitioned People will say Oh she just transitioned so she would have an advantage so she could win I transitioned to be happy to be true to myself It is very harsh to comment on an individual who chose to be herself Thomas won the freestyle at the NCAA swimming and diving championships in March just a month after of her teammates wrote a letter to the school and the Ivy League saying that Thomas should not be competing against women Thomas placed fifth in the freestyle and eighth in the freestyle at the championships and added she was desperate while putting up good swimming times competing against men Trans women competing in women s sports does not threaten women s sports as a whole Thomas said Trans women are a very small minority of all athletes The NCAA rules regarding trans women competing in women s sports have been around for plus years And we haven t seen any massive wave of trans women dominating Trans people don t transition for athletics We transition to be happy and authentic and our true selves Transitioning to get an advantage is not something that ever factors into our decisions Many states in the USA prohibit transgender students from partaking in sports that are consistent with their gender identity when Pennsylvania took a step people are protesting against it which only makes the situation worse for other states Her critics say that Thomas made an unfair advantage in the women s field and utilized her low rankings as a male competitor to her being at the top in her field as a female as evidence This is defaming an individual All she wanted was to do something she love by being her true self
