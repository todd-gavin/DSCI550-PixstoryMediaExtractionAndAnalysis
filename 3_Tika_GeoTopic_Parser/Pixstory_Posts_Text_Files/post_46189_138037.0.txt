Teachers seem to have memorized some kind of dialogue handbook , because almost EVERY teacher , be it someone from Kashmir or Kanyakumari , says these dialogues at least once , and almost EVERY student can identify with it !😂 
Here are some dialogue i remember when i was in school , followed by how i would like to answer them , but don’t ! 
1 Keep silence ! The principal is taking rounds and will pass away soon .🤫 
- Pass away ? Really ? That’s some fatal round the principal is taking !
2 Be quiet ! Is this a fish market ?😐
- This is what a fish market sounds like ? What is this , a classroom ? 
3 If you want to talk , please get out of the class and talk ! 
- Gladly . Let’s leave the classroom and talk , WITH PERMISSION !
4 Don't enter my class if you haven't done my homework .📒
- Wow , teachers are really bent on making sure kids don’t enter the classroom !
5 Don't try to 'oversmart' me ! Yes you ! I'm talking to you only . 
- You’re talking to us , and you don’t want us to talk back , and yet you want us to respond .. how ?
6 Stand up ! Why are you laughing ? Come to the front and tell us all . Let us also laugh !
- I’m not sure you’ll want to know why we’re laughing . It’s probably best if we keep it to ourselves .
7 Do you think teachers are fools ?
- Do you really expect us to answer that ?
8 In my 10 years of teaching , I have never seen this type of class .
- Well , I’m going to take it as a compliment .
9 Tell me when you all have finished talking . 

- Yep , will let you know !
But keeping all the jokes aside - Teachers , we love you , for all you do , especially tolerating us !❤️
Happy Teacher's Day ❤️👩‍🏫
