Faroe Islands vs Lithuania: Prediction

With both sides missing a significant amount of skill and confidence coming into their game on
Saturday, there are unlikely to be many goals .

However, we believe the Faroe Islands will beat
over their visitors by a razor-thin margin, owing to home advantage.

Prediction: Faroe Islands 1-0 Lithuania
