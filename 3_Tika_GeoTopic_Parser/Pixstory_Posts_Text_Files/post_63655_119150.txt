Rush are a landmark name in rock and metal Known for their exceptional musicianship thought provoking lyrics and creativity while they may have started out as Led Zeppelin clones they evolved a lot over the years becoming something of their own The band changed their sound a great deal from simplistic hard rock heavy metal to more complex and hard edged progressive rock to embracing a New Wave sound in the s to eventually going back to their old metal tinged progressive rock sound They are also often credited as forebears of progressive metal and math rock These were three guys who dedicated themselves into making quality rock music not caring a bit about what was trending they just did what they wanted to What made Rush so amazing was that while individually each member was a virtuoso at their instrument and was incredible the band was a product of all its members not just one person There was no pretentiousness only genuine emotion This is very difficult to attain in most groups for even the good ones end up being defined by one or two individuals such as in the case of Black Sabbath which was defined more by guitarist Tony Iommi than anyone else They had complex arrangements but still managed to write great melodies Rush s sound has evolved a great deal over the years but they ve always been a rock band that focuses a great deal on developing complex intricate music Whether it is Farewell To Kings Hemispheres Permanent Waves Signals or even Clockwork of Angels Rush always had something up their sleeves Those who can t stand the band typically stand vocalist and bassist Geddy Lee s high pitched vocals but the man is a legit bass god influencing legends like Steve Harris and John Myung Alex Lifeson is a guitar monster Being the band s rhythm and lead guitarist his riffs are various and vary from simply awesome to bizarre ranging from deep heavy colourful etc Neil Peart on the other hand is a great lyricist and monster drummer who has only ever been criticized for playing too perfect
