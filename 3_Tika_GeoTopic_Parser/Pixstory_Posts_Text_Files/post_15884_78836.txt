G FriskH Diderholm Considerable differences in antibody responses measured by capture IgM RIA and neutralization tests NT were seen in children with newly diagnosed type I insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM when five different strains of Coxsackie B virus CBV were used The IgM positivity of the patients varied between and P and with the use of all strains IgM was found in Matched controls showed a significantly lower frequency P but there were no apparent differences between the strains although no IgM was found against two strains In the NT different results were also obtained in the IDDM children with use of the five strains However these results differed considerably from those of the RIA indicating that different epitopes on the virus were involved Serum specimens from patients with aseptic meningitis from whom enteroviruses had been isolated also showed varying IgM frequencies ranging from to but the differences between the strains were different to those found in the IDDM patients We speculate that only certain strains of a serotype of CBV may be used to distinguish IDDM pathogenesis from that of other diseases Sources
