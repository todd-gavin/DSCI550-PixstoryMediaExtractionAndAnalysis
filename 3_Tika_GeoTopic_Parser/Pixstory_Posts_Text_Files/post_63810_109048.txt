Machine Head had quite a downfall after Catharsis They lost two of their oldest members and not to mention Catharsis s experimentation with nu metal and hardcore just did not suit Machine Head Well it seems that the latest Machine Head album is really going to remedy all of that After being greatly disappointed by Catharsis and with Phil Demmel and Dave McClain leaving the band I stopped having any faith in the group fearing they would forget who they were and give us more nu metal While Machine Head have done rapping before when I listen to them I imagine Unto The Locust Imperium and The Blackening not Limp Bizkit Well I couldn t be any more wrong I finally decided to listen to the new singles of Machine Head which I had been purposefully ignoring It was a real slap in the face Choke On The Ashes Of Your Hate Unhallowed and My Hands Are Empty are some of the best songs Machine Head has ever composed And even though it has not been released yet I feel that Of Kingdom And Crown is going to be a giant punch in the face Furthermore it might even feature some of the band s finest work since The Blackening and Bloodstone and Diamonds Musically speaking the band seems to have picked up on a new direction which while similar to the old thrash groove metal style has its own touches of finesse Machine Head is really back on track and about to rock the hardest they have in a while Bottom line really excited for Of Kingdom and Crown and those who have engaged in my foolishness don t you are really missing out
