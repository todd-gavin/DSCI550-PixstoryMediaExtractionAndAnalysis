Delaware lawmakers have introduced a law that would put state law enforcement officials in charge of background checks for gun purchases This bill would resurrect Delaware s Firearm Transaction Approval Program which was abolished more than a decade ago when lawmakers voted to rely on the federal government s National Instant Criminal Background Check System or NICS Re establishing FTAP will help us identify people who would otherwise be prohibited but NICS might have missed such as a person convicted of a misdemeanour domestic violence offence House Majority Whip Larry Mitchell the chief bill sponsor said in a statement It will make our background check system stronger and more thorough and provide more protection for residents Supporters of the bill also note that anyone who is the subject of an outstanding warrant is restricted from buying a gun but NICS identifies only those for whom extradition across state lines is sought excluding the vast majority of misdemeanour warrants FTAP would be able to check local databases to identify those people These kinds of changes are necessary to curb the increasing gun violence in the country Every day new cases of gun violence are reported and it s good to see the states realising the seriousness and bringing laws into action
