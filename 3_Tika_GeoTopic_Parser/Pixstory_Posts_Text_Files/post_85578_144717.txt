I know many girls stole some or the other thing from their sister s or mother s wardrobe but have you guys ever stolen something from your elder brother s wardrobe I did once He used to wear this shirt to his office and as it was giving a sober kinda look it catched my eye Although it was a normal yet basic SHIRT but only my evil mind knew it can be worn as a DRESS Shirts are one of most efforless and priceless piece of cloth that Instantly puts you to a chic side of fashion but when it comes to oversized ones it s quite a task to dress them and appear more presentable There are days you just wanna wear them and they are inherently comfortable and cool Personally the purpose of the above look is to get the NO PANTS look Else one is better off wearing just normal shirt and bottoms And of course one also has to respect public decency So i will pair them with short shorts just enough to almost cover my shorts and wearing an oversized shirt is all about the accessory Depending on the shirt you can never go wrong with a nice waist belt The sling bag really puts the outfit together At last I completed this look with sneakers Tell me in the notes how your EVIL MIND works
