Kaup Beach is one of the famous beaches in Karnataka where tourists enjoy the beauty of the environment, the long stretches of golden sands, and the cool sea breeze. 

The beach is covered by palm groves. There is a lighthouse here, constructed in 1901, which is open every day for an hour from 5.30 AM. The delightful view of the entire seashore and the beach from the lighthouse is every photographer's dream.

Besides the lighthouse, Kaup also has ruins of Jain Basadis that line across the stretch of sand, and these are worth a visit. Kaup is also known for the temple of Goddess Mariamman. There is also an ancient fort located in Kaup which is in ruins now.

Truly a must-visit place!
