Progressive rock has always been the black sheep among rock’n roll, being constantly ostracized for its insistence on change and fascination with sonic experimentation. 

From the 60s up till today, rock bands have tried to reinvent themselves in different ways by making their music more varied in terms of structure, rhythm, style, approach and overall genre. They do this by either being musically more experimental than their peers, leading to a more complex form of music seldom appreciated by most.

Not all experiments pay off and sometimes artists aiming to go prog enter the premium douche club, but overall, prog is not the kind of music you can ever really enjoy if you are looking for background music. Rather than ‘hearing’ you must listen and that can prove to be a bit taxing. 

Nonetheless, if you are willing to dedicate a bit of time you will enter into a whole new world of music which you would have never experienced otherwise. 

Progressive music does not have a standard sound besides artists trying to experiment with various sounds, for example a hard rock band can experiment simultaneously with pop, symphonic music, jazz, arena rock etc. There are far too many great artists and albums to choose from, so:
