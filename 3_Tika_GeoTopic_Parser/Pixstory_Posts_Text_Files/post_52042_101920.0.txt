Holly Hagan has detailed how she managed lost over 8 kilograms in under five months ahead of her wedding – and there wasn’t a diet in sight.

The TV personality and influencer – who rose to fame on MTV’s Geordie Shore – explained she’d managed to lose the weight without dieting by following a few simple steps.

Holly, 29, revealed she’d gained weight after the festive period where she’s enjoyed herself and ate without restriction.

Taking to her Instagram account – on which she boasts 4.1 million followers – Holly posted a story about her weight loss.

Using a graph to demonstrate her weight loss journey in December, Holly showed how she gradually losing 1lb (453grams) a week for a total of 18 weeks.

She wrote: “Today I hit my goal!!! 18lb (8kg) down in 10 weeks!”

Holly explained that whilst on some weeks she lost weight, during others “I didn’t lose at all”, and that “for 4 weeks I stayed the same but I kept going”.

The star explained how she hadn’t been on a special diet, and hadn’t stepped in the gym “more than a handful of times”.

She’d simply stuck to a calorie deficit and “movement that I enjoy and could do daily without giving up”.

Holly wanted to make it clear she doesn’t believe being slimmer and leaner “doesn’t mean I am at my peak health and fitness”.

“I was WAY stronger 18lb (8kg) heavier and I would say I preferred the way I felt in the gym at that time,” she said.

“Thinness/health/fitness they aren’t mutually exclusive.

“There is absolutely no reason for me to be this weight all year round and I’m glad I’ve stopped fighting for that.”
