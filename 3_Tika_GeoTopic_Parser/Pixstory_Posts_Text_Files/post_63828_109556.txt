Getting closer to global release Dragon Ball Super Super Hero finally had its English trailer released some time ago and after a long time we get to see Gohan and Piccolo be the main stars Apart from that Broly Beerus Whis and Frieza are also going to be part of the show as the Z Fighters will take on a new menace a couple of new androids from the once again revived Red Ribbon Army According to the official synopsis The Red Ribbon Army was once destroyed by Son Goku Individuals who carry on its spirit have created the ultimate Androids Gamma and Gamma These two Androids call themselves Super Heroes They start attacking Piccolo and Gohan What is the New Red Ribbon Army s objective In the face of approaching danger it is time to awaken Super Hero The story does not make a whole lot of sense on many levels because after Doctor Gero s death there should be no reason to revive the evil organization not to mention Gero was the brains behind that organization and the technology which birthed the super strong androids like Android and of course Cell Furthermore to add to the layers of inconsistencies we have new androids this time who can rival the energy of Gods now Dragon Ball has never been consistent to begin with but things are getting out of hand now whether it is the manga or the anime Akira Toriama and Toei are just milking the whole Dragon Ball concept now by constantly introducing new transformations or enemies and as much as I love Dragon Ball and Super Saiyan Blue there is a time to end things and Dragon Ball is already past its expiration date The movie was already released in Japan in June and will release globally on August this fall
