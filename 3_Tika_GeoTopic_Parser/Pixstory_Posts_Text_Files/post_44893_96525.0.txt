Aaron Ramsdale spoke to BT Sport before of Arsenal's match against Manchester United in the Premier League. During his conversation with Rob Holding, the £30 million England 
international made an interesting comment about Liverpool and Mohamed Salah.

Well, the 23-year-old revealed just how well-liked Egypt international Mohamed Salah is around the world of football, as well as the impact that has had on his Liverpool teammates.

In an interview with BT Sport, Ramsdale said:

 “When I speak to the Liverpool lads, they’ve got 
about a million followers from Egypt purely from Salah!”

The 29-year-old has established himself as a global celebrity at Liverpool, not only in the 
sporting world. Salah has around 50 million Instagram followers, putting him in the company of some of the world's most powerful people.

Liverpool's No.11 has also graced the cover of Time magazine, so we don't expect him to be 
short on possibilities after he retires.

Arsenal were reportedly interested in signing Salah from Roma in 2017. According to the Times, Liverpool expected a transfer war with Arsenal, but Arsenal decided the Egyptian was too wasteful in front of goal and dropped their interest. That gave Jürgen Klopp free rein with Salah, and a £34 million deal was completed that summer.

The former Chelsea player is now a Liverpool legend, having scored 155 goals in 245 appearances for the Reds. According to the Times, Liverpool were stunned to learn that the 
north Londoners had dropped their interest, and they were astounded by Arsenal's decision.

Salah could have become an Arsenal legend right now if the Gunners had been a little more 
daring. In other news, the following players have 30 goals and 20 assists: The CEO has ruled
