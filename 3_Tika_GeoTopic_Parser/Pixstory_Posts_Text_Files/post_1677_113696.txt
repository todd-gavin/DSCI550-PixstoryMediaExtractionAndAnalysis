Avabai Wadia the first woman from Ceylon to pass the bar exam in UK was a guiding light and pioneer of the sexual and reproductive health and family planning movement She fought for gender equality and reproductive rights in India and across the globe The first time I heard the words birth control I was revolted Wadia noted But she was profoundly affected by a female doctor in Bombay who said that Indian women oscillated between gestation and lactation until death wound up the sorry tale Despite the threat of social ostracism Wadia plunged into the cause In she helped establish the Family Planning Association of India FPAI an organisation she would head for years FPAI s work ranged from promoting contraceptive methods to providing fertility services the latter gave Wadia a real sense of satisfaction since she had suffered miscarriages and had no children It was in large part due to Wadia s efforts that the Indian government became the first in the world to officially promote family planning policies in Under Wadia FPAI adopted a decentralised community based approach working with the urban poor and villagers from some of the most impoverished regions of India Linking family planning with a holistic agenda of education skill development and health Wadia and her team employed creative communication techniques such as singing bhajans devotional songs with social messaging and organising a family planning exhibition which zipped across the country by train FPAI s innovative style of work fostered public confidence and led to marked improvements in development indicators Throwing herself whole heartedly into this new area of work she became something of an unofficial historian of family planning and she was instrumental in ensuring the inclusion of family planning in India s first five year plan In early she returned to London to recuperate after a miscarriage However six months later she was back in Bombay leading the effort to organise the Third International Conference on Planned Parenthood which brought together the eight existing family planning associations and was attended by two luminaries of the family planning world Margaret Sanger and Elise Ottesen Jensen
