These “GAP”s are not easy to close. In a money driven world, where profit is a part of healthcare, it is indeed difficult. With ever increasing cost of research and education, with ever increasing cost of technologies, with ever increasing inequalities of wealth, this sounds utopian idea to me. Yet I want to be hopeful. I wish basic needs of life (like education, health, food) are given more priority than building concrete jungles! I wish more of taxpayer’s money are being spent on healthcare to provide to-some-extent equitable healthcare to close the gap! I wish the billionaires and trillionaires spend some of their wealth to close the inequality gap! I wish industrialists, NGOs and others having money come forward to boost health infrastructure all over the world! I wish people would become truly educated to realize that timely intervention can close the gap between expectation and final outcome of treatment! And lastly, I wish there is a proper “CARE” for everyone reaching the healthcare facility.
And of course, we will be able to “CLOSE THE GAP”.
