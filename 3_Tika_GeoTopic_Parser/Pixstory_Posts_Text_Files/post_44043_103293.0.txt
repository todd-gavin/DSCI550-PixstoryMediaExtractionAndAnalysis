Bournemouth and Rangers are on the lookout for Crystal Palace goalkeeper Jack Butland, who has been linked with a move away from the club.

At the end of the season, he was a member of Patrick Vieira's squad.

Since joining from Stoke in 2020, he has often been second best.

Butland, 29, has been shortlisted by both the promoted Cherries and Scottish heavyweights 
Rangers.

The fates of both the former England international and the Gers' number one are now unknown, with McGregor's contract expiring this summer.

Butland, 29, is generally second choice in south London behind Vicente Guaita, despite playing 
in and out of the lineup in the Premier League towards the end of the season.

Ibrox's interest is predicated on their intention to reach the Championsâ€™ League group stage next season, according to Alan Nixon's report.

If they pursue their interest, they will face competition from Bournemouth, although they are also said to have "other alternatives" for the role.

McGregor was outstanding during the Europa League run, but his league record was patchy, 
and it is still unknown if he will retire.

Butland would be a good acquisition if the organization isn't confident in throwing the gloves to Jon McLaughlin next season. If newly-promoted Bournemouth are serious about pursuing him and offer him a starting spot in their return to the Premier League, the Bears' biggest selling point would be the opportunity to play in Europe.

The former Stoke City goalkeeper was once England's brightest young goalkeeper prospect, but his stock has dropped in the years after the Potters were relegated from the Premier League.

In all competitions this season, he made 15 appearances for the Eagles in all competitions, but he hasn't played much in his two years at Selhurst Park.

If newly-promoted Bournemouth are serious about pursuing him and offer him a starting spot in their return to the Premier League, the Bears' biggest selling point would be the opportunity to play in Europe.
