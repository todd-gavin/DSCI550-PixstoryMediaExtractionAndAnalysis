Sarah Dion Kelly MMSc PA C RDN CDCES Introduction Prediabetes was first described in by the World Health Organization WHO using the term borderline diabetes Prediabetes was formally identified in by WHO by identifying a state of intermediate hyperglycemia marked by both impaired glucose tolerance and fasting glucose Type diabetes T DM is well known as a complex metabolic disease that develops over time The pathophysiology of prediabetes and T DM include the development of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction These hallmark features occur along a spectrum of interrelated deficits of glucose metabolism Diabetes develops when frank hyperglycemia results from pancreatic cell failure Prediabetes represents a timeline of hormonal dysregulation influenced by genetic and environmental factors Environmental and lifestyle influences that are linked to the development of diabetes include but are not limited to age sex dietary intake obesity physical inactivity socioeconomic status and stress level The time leading up to diagnosis of T DM is often marked by no overt symptoms however chronic inflammation and hyperinsulinemia are linked to the development of microvascular complications such as cardiovascular disease and retinopathy Incremental increases in hour post prandial blood glucoses are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease Fifty percent of patients with prediabetes have been estimated to develop diabetes within years of diagnosis In addition those with gestational diabetes GDM also carry elevated risk of the development of T DM in the future Prevalence and economic burden The global prevalence of diabetes among adults increased from in to in and the number of people with diabetes was estimated at million in Roughly of the US population or billion is estimated to have diabetes with an estimated being undiagnosed Approximately one third of the US population is estimated to have prediabetes or roughly million people This percentage has stayed relatively stable between and The total estimated financial burden of diabetes to US health care was estimated to be greater than billion in These statistics continue to support the importance of early detection of prediabetes with the goal of prevention or delay of progression to T DM through lifestyle change Read more
