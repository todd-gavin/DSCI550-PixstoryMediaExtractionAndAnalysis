Simulating violence such as shooting guns and hand-to-hand combat in video games can result in real-life violent behaviour.

Video games mostly require gamers to stimulate violent actions-stabbing, shooting and even dismembering. Virtual reality is in a state right now where the stimulation of these violent acts is very realistic. There have been incidents wherein teenagers were shot inspired by Grand Theft Auto.

Also, psychologists have acknowledged that from a psychological point of view, because they reward players for their behaviour they are great teaching tools. Point is that in most video games this behaviour is often violent.

Kevin McCarthy, US Representative, stated: “But the idea of these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others – I’ve always felt that is a problem for future generations and others. We’ve watched studies showing before what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it [mass shootings] took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.” 

Not to forget that Many mass shootings have been carried out by ardent video game players: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in the Columbine High School shooting (1999); James Holmes in the Aurora, Colorado movie theatre shooting (2012); Jared Lee Loughner in the Arizona shooting that injured Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others (2011) to name a few.

We should not demand the video game industry stop everything altogether but there must be a halt to immense violent themes in the games or missions in the games that promote violence.
