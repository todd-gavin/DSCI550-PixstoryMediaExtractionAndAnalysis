Gallagher has been a standout for Patrick Viera's side this season, earning him an England
call-up for his efforts in midfield. The Epsom native has eight goals and five assists for the
Eagles this season, but he will miss today's match against his parent club as Chelsea refused to
play one of their own players against them.

Gallagher's decision is unfair, according to Wright-Phillips, and he should be permitted to play
against his former team.

Speaking to Metro he said: "I don’t agree with the fact that loan players can’t play against their
parent team. I’ve never agreed with it.

"For me, if you think he’s that good then play him in your team, give him his shot to show what
he’s capable of."

Wright-Phillips added: "You obviously didn’t want to give him his shot, you put him out on loan
and now you turn around and you’re nervous for him to play against you.

"If he’s good enough to play in your team then keep him at your club and play with him.

"They’ve let him go and now he’s missing out on a big occasion just because Chelsea don’t
want to play him.

"I think that’s really unfair on him."

Although Thomas Tuchel has stated that the 22-year-old is in his plans for next season,
Wright-Phillps believes that his future lies outside of Chelsea.

Tuchel believes Conor Gallagher has a lot of potential and that he needs to keep playing as
much as he is right now to advance his career. Even if Gallagher simply returns on a
season-long loan to get another season under his belt rather than being in a rotation system,
because if you look at Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson- Odoi’s situations.

Gallagher's World Cup dreams may influence where he plays next season. In his bid to unseat
England boss Gareth Southgate, he will face stiff opposition from the likes of Jude Bellingham of
Borussia Dortmund, Declan Rice of West Ham United, and Kalvin Phillips of Leeds United.
