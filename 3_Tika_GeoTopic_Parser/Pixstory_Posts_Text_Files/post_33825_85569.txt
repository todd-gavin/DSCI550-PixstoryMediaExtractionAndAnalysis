Genoa coach Alexander Blessin commented on the draw against Empoli on Sky. Creating a lot and not scoring like a story without a happy ending. We played one of the best matches. I will never give up and neither will the boys I want to win every match as long as possible it will be positive The boys follow us we lack victory but we still have enough points to believe in it I believe in my group I don&#39;t play matches I bring emotions into the match I showed up the way I am and so I try to implement this kind of game Every time always the same thing amazing how the fans support us I have never had this feeling before really superb We want to celebrate a win with them and then everything will be better We made six draws in a row and we want to celebrate three points I think the most important thing now is to take this positive moment and think we can do it What we need to win there is a lot of positive things to work on not done yet We have to keep fighting and never give up this is my motto
