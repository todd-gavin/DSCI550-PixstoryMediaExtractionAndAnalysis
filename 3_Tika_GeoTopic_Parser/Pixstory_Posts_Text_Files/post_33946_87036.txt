Napoli win again and do it with a performance of character at Hellas Verona thanks to Victor Osimhen This was the comment of the coach Luciano Spalletti at the end of the match We did everything we had to do We played a match full of attention and continuity then Verona made people talk about themselves through the race the game the quality the technique Today we need to congratulate the players of Napoli they deserved it by adding that extra something I said that a possible defeat would have been fatal Winning anything can still happen we can still fight for the championship Whoever up front can concede something but you&#39;re good good it all depends on you Osimhen can split matches in two The goal is the highest moment the most important thing but there are many others he can put in to help the team team He was devastating today for the goals he scored Sometimes he gets confused about the things he does Even when he decides to aim for five or six defenders and takes them with him a top player who will become very top in a few months when he learns these things someone who interprets things a bit in his own way a bit discontinuous in reading but has a disruptive force Today there were beautiful choirs towards us We must end it all those who try to communicate with hatred will have no future they will be crushed by the same hatred that they use These people must be kicked out of the stadiums, all of us, too, those who chant against the others The stadium must be a meeting place it must be a party Photo credits Twitter UEFA com
