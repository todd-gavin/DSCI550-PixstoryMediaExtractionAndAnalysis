Arsenal's away shirt for the 2022/23 season has been leaked online, with a magnificent black and gold design likely to delight Gunner’s supporters.

While their adidas home kit is expected to have a classic style that pays reference to their 1990s tops, Arsenal's away kit will be more contemporary.

After confirming earlier in 2022 that the Gunners would wear this slick colour scheme next year, kit leak gurus Footy Headlines have published some images of the leaked shirt.
Arsenal will employ a minimalist version of their club crest on this design, similar to their current away jersey, with only the cannon appearing on the chest.

The shirt is dominated by a black abstract pattern, which is complemented with metallic gold embellishments.
Arsenal's outfielders haven't worn a black shirt since the 2017/18 season, when Puma gave them a black and pink third kit that was a fan favourite.

With Mikel Arteta's side on track to return to the Champions League after a five-year absence, Arsenal fans will be hoping to see this clean design on the pitch.

Since returning as Arsenal's uniform maker in 2019, adidas has created some iconic designs, and it appears that they've created another gem.

Arsenal's home shirt for 2022/23 sports a white button-up collar with a red chevron pattern similar to that seen on previous Gunner’s shirts, notably this season's blue third kit. During adidas' previous tenure as Arsenal's kit maker in the 1980s and 1990s, the chevron was a prominent motif on their shirts.
