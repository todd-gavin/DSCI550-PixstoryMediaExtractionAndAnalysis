One thing in the Sue Gray report should give British Prime Minister Boris Johnson some respite. Gray, the Scottish bureaucrat who has been investigating the alleged breaking of the law at 10 Downing Street during the lockdown, says that it is "not for me to make a judgement on whether the criminal law has been broken" and that is properly a matter for the police.

So, the British public have to wait for a full criminal investigation to reveal the alleged violations that took place at the British Prime Minister's office 

But at the same time, Gray says that there was "too little thought given to what was happening across the country" by the 10 Downing Street staff and that there "were failures of leadership." (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sue-gray-report-key-points-b2004216.html)

The report is rather explicit in saying that "a number of gatherings should not have been allowed to take place" and describes them as "difficult to justify." Without coming down heavily any individual in particular, Gary says that leadership in the department is too fragmented to make the Downing Street a smooth running establishment.

Johnson has been under tremendous pressure ever since the alleged gatherings and parties came to light. The scandal has led some of the Prime Minister's own MPs to call for him to quit.

As the gatherings and parties happened at a time when the British public was paying a heavy price in the form of strict lockdowns and personal sacrifices, the fact that these alleged parties took place represented "a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time," the report says.

The report is all of twelve pages while she interviewed several scores of people. As Gary says in the report, she was extremely constricted by the investigation of the police. Many more skeletons can stumble out of the Downing Street once that investigation is complete.
