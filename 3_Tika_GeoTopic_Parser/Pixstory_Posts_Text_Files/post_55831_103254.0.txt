Indigenous writer Melissa Lucaschenko is best known for her YA stories, but she has also written adult fiction and nonfiction. Her first novel, Steam Pigs, was published in 1997 and won the Dobbie Literary Award for Australian Women's Fiction. Her critical acclaim continued with the Miles Franklin Award for Too Much Lip, which she received last year. 

You should read Mullumbimby by her. It is a darkly funny novel of romantic love and cultural warfare. 

As per Booktopia, in the novel, Jo Breen hopes for a tree transformation and a budding connection to the soil of her Aboriginal ancestors when she uses her divorce settlement to purchase a neglected property in the Byron Bay hinterland. 

Instead, she finds her teenage daughter Ellen voicing her displeasure, difficulties brewing from unimpressed white neighbours, and an impending Native Title dispute among the Bundjalung families. 

Told with humour and a sharp satirical eye, Mullumbimby is a modern novel set against an ancient land.
