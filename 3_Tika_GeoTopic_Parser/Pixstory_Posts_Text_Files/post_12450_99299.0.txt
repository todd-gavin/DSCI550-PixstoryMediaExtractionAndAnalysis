Being able to manage our emotions and impulses is an ability that a person will attain eventually through their developmental stages and this is what emotional self regulation means. 

While people experience a range of emotions their body will increase its production of stress hormones that leads to increase of heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and breathing rate. 

It is a learned skill and applying it through a conscious thought to events that promotes strong emotions. When one engages in emotional self regulation their adaptive behaviour will be as follows: 

• They notice the increase in emotional response. 

• They consider the consequences of any response. 

• They go for positive outcome or goal rather than feeling negative emotions. 

When a person lacks emotional self-regulation skills, they may show the following symptoms: 

• overreacting to situations 

• having emotional outbursts and being quick to react 

• experiencing negative emotions that last a long time 

• having mood swings 

Why is it important? 

To manage one's emotions from time to time is not always possible, but for some people who have been continuously facing a drainage and overpowering emotions could lead them to develop unhealthy coping strategies like substance misuse or self injury. 

In order to avoid that we need to develop this skill of emotional self regulation. And for this one can follow the strategies like cognitive reappraisal, where one steps back from a situation that could possibly trigger their emotions. One can also use mindfulness as well.
