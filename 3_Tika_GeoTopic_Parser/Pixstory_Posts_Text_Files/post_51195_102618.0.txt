For those few people that are biologically predetermined early risers, waking up at 5 AM may be natural and helpful. However, the majority of us are built to sleep on a different cycle and trying to change it is like trying to fight gravityâ€¦.

Adequate and consistent sleep improves blood pressure, the immune system, basic brain functions, mood, and gives your body time to repair itself. Waking up early makes going to bed early easier, and keeping consistent sleep and wake times regulates your circadian rhythm and leads to deeper sleep at night.
