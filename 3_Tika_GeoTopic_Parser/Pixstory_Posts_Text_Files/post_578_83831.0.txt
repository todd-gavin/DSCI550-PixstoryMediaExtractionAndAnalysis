I started with Fame game just to check out what the series was all about. 
Madhuri Dixit has been a favourite since childhood, and also I always felt obliged to watch anything she features in not just because she is one of the best female performer of all time, because donâ€™t laugh-I very slyly remark that people used to say I have a striking resemblance. Whether that is true or not but have heard the same during school college days- and who would not be happy with that even if in the hearts of hearts you know itâ€™s as far fetched from reality than anything else. Ok! This is a little story I just mentioned in passing so donâ€™t judge me.ðŸ˜œ
So that was the mix of reasons to start watching. But once u start it, you wonâ€™t stop-so it was an all nighter.
Famegame has a script which matches Madhuriâ€™s acting skills. She is so much the character she plays -beautiful but aging actress who has had stardom forced on her by a manipulating mother. The launch as actress happens only when she sleeps with an old /ugly producer. 
The story which starts with Madhuri aka Anamika Khannaâ€™s disappearance has you gripped as u go back and forth into her life. The loveless/ selfish marriage, an old affair that is rekindled, yearning to be a perfect mother, relationship with children and their complex lives, threat of fading popularity and a movie that can be career make or break. 
The writing of fame game keeps you hooked. The unexpected twists and turns, the unveiling drama supported by great acting skills. 
Never been a fan of Sanjay Kapoor, even at the cost of sounding rude, would rather miss watching his movies but here he is in what can surely be one of his best performances . Manav Kaul not surprising is equally convincing as a superstar, successful, bipolar and helplessly in love with Anamika. 
The actors who play Madhuriâ€™s children Avi and Amara( thatâ€™s my daughters name btw) are equally good. 
Giving no spoilers here but watch the series for itâ€™s ending. Weekend must watch
