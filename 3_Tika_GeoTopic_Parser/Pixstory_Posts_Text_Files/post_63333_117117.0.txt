Here’s to making boring water, exciting!

HOW TO MAKE :
Add 1 tbsp of chia seeds &
1 fully squeezed key lime to 1.5 cups of warm water. Let seeds absorb water for 10 minutes then drink. Drink water throughout the day too.

Drinking this once a week first thing in the morning
helps cleanse the intestines of stagnant waste/toxins,
reduces belly bloat, & balances sugar levels with its high fiber content. It's rich in minerals & immune boosting antioxidants for cellular, heart, & bone nutrition.
