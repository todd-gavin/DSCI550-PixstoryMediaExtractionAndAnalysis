As reaffirmed by the Disney CEO during the recent earnings call, we can finally start getting excited as the Marvel world will finally return to Wakanda thanks to the upcoming Black Panther sequel. The long-awaited project has gone through plenty of changes since its original conception due to various unfortunate reasons, but at the very least, one thing has almost certainly remained the same: Atlantis. 

Its interesting to note that nothing has been confirmed by Marvel Studios themselves regarding this, but if rumors are to be believed the main villain of the long awaited sequel will be none other than Namor, the leader of the iconic underwater city. 

The rumoured casting for playing the famous anti-hero is Tenoch Huerta. Huerto has recently worked on Narcos: Mexico. 

In a new interview with Vice, the actor discussed some struggles he has faced in recent work, while also revealing a curious fact: he learned Mayan for an upcoming role. While he refrained from providing any specifics in regards to the project, as Marvel Studios have also remained to choose silent on topics like these in the past. 

It would certainly be interesting how marvel plays off “Atlantis” and a fan favourite character Namor in the vast spread MCU. It is not difficult to predict that Namor would be pitted against his DCEU counterpart Aquaman.
