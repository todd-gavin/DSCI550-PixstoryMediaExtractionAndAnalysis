Neeraj Chopra won the gold medal in the Kuortane Games in Finland on Saturday, throwing 86.69 metres on his first try. He finished ahead of Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada's world champion Anderson Peters. Chopra, who just set a new national record, got off to a fast start with an 86.69m throw, which was good enough to beat out his opponents. He made two foul shots and skipped the final three. This was only his second competition since winning a gold medal in athletics in the Tokyo Olympics, where he became the first Indian to do so.

Walcott came in second with an 86.64m throw, while Peters came in third with an 84.75m best effort.
He earned silver in the Paavo Nurmi Games earlier this week, breaking his own national mark with a throw of 89.30 metres.

On June 30, he will compete in the Diamond League's Stockholm leg.
