Arsenal endured one of their worst starts in Premier League history last season, after three consecutive defeats. The Gunners failed to score a single goal in the three losses, and it was safe to say that they hit rock bottom. Arsenal fans grew impatient and wanted Mikel Arteta to be sacked with immediate effect. A 5-0 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City just compounded the misery, as the historic club conceded as many as nine goals in the first three games. 

In a trailer of Amazon’s documentary, All or Nothing, Mikel Arteta has revealed what he told his players to overturn a poor start to the campaign. The Spaniard’s magic words did the trick as Arsenal kept getting better as the season progressed. Although they failed to make the cut for Champions League, there were positives to be drawn from the season.

"We were bottom of the league - zero goals, zero points,” Arteta explained. In the trailer, fans are seen blasting their manager for the dismal performances. Mikel Arteta delivered a staunch message to his players: "That is when everyone's against you. You are stronger."

Arsenal have had an exciting transfer window so far, with two big name signings. The North London side completed the signing of Fabio Vieira last week, and also made a successful move for Manchester City striker, Gabriel Jesus. Hence, there is plenty of optimism in the Arsenal supporters camp going into the next season.

Arsenal are still in the hunt for Brazilian starlet, Raphinha as they continue to revamp their squad ahead of another huge season.
