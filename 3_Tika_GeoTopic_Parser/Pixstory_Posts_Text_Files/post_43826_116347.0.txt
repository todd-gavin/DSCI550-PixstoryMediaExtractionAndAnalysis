According to TVI and CNN Portugal, the Saudi Arabian offer would result in Manchester United
receiving an eye-watering transfer fee of roughly £30 million and Cristiano Ronaldo earning an
eye-watering income in the neighbourhood of £105 million per year.

A further £20 million will be allocated for agent fees. The Express cited the £210 million bid, and
this is the first time Ronaldo has been associated with such a bold move.

Cristiano Ronaldo is maybe not willing to entirely give up on his ambitions of playing in the
Champions League by permanently leaving Europa. He is looking forward to competing at the
World Cup in Qatar later this year in a quest to win a world championship with Portugal.

If Ronaldo stays at United, the wait should only be a year at most for him to play in the Champions League. However subpar the Europa League may be, how would you characterise
football in Saudi Arabia today?

They may be testing the waters first to see whether Ronaldo would be interested in a move,
given the Saudi club in question has not been mentioned, which is certain to create some
scepticism about a transaction.

The fact that the Portugal international has told Man United he wants to leave the club this summer in order to join a squad that will contend in the Champions League next season and
that he chose not to go on the preseason tour with the rest of the United team due to personal
matters doesn't bode well for his future in Manchester.

Few clubs have been associated with the celebrity, therefore interest has been subdued.

PSG news comes after the Evening Standard reported that Chelsea had been offered the Man
United striker by his agent Jorge Mendes, but Thomas Tuchel is reportedly ambivalent about the
idea of adding an experienced forward.
