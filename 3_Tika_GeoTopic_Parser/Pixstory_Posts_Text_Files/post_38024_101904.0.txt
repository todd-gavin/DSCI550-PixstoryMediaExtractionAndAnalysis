Tottenham Hotspur had a really bad start to the 2021/22 season. Owing to this, they were stuck in midtable at the end of October. 

Owing to this, the newly appointed manager Nuno Espirito Santo was under heavy pressure. Nuno was eventually sacked after the Spurs lost 3-0 at home to Manchester United on 30th October. 

Qualifying for the Europa League looked a far-fetched cry back then, let alone the UEFA Champions League. The North London club eventually snapped up Antonio Conte as their new manager and the Italian has since transformed the club!

Tottenham Hotspur soon started firing on all cylinders with Heung-Min Son leading from the front. Soon Harry Kane and the summer signing Dejan Kulusevski joined the Korean as Antonio Conte's tactics began to take centre stage. 

The Italian had something special going on and things came to a full turning point on 12th May 2022. The Spurs beat Arsenal 3-0 to open up a chance to finish in the top four. Still, the Gunners had the advantage, but Mikel Arteta's side succumbed to a 2-0 loss at Newcastle United.

Tottenham Hotspur made the most of this as the Spurs lost just 1 of their last 11 Premier League games. Antonio Conte's side beat Norwich City 5-0 away in the last matchday to secure qualification to the UEFA Champions League. Hence, Antonio Conte proved his worth and the fans would only hope that the best is yet to come from their beloved Tottenham Hotspur!
