LeBron James made a couple things very plain Friday night after his eyebrow-raising comments leading up to the trade deadline and going into All-Star Weekend caused the basketball world to speculate about his future with the Lakers. 

ESPN reported that to begin, he wants the Lakers, with whom he has spent the last four seasons of his 19-year career, to be his final franchise. 

"This is a franchise that I can see myself joining. I've arrived. I've arrived "After the Lakers' 105-102 loss to the LA Clippers, James stated. "As long as I can play, I picture myself with the purple and gold." 

Along with that goal, James, who has one more season left on his contract and will be eligible for a two-year extension.

"I also have a goal that, if it's possible -- I don't even know if it's possible -- that if I can play with my son, I would love to do that," said James, 37. 

Bronny would not be allowed to play in the NBA until the 2024-25 season under the conditions of the collective bargaining agreement. 

While it's unclear what the next two years will bring for Bronny's draught prospects, the Lakers have lots of options for positioning themselves to acquire him. This might involve trades or James' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group, informing other clubs that picking Bronny instead of allowing him to join his father in Los Angeles would make doing business with other Klutch clients more difficult.
