The Russian national team and Russian clubs were banned from international competitions earlier this year by UEFA following the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's football federation and UEFA both announced that the country will not be participating in the qualification draw for Euro 2024. 
Following the invasion of Ukraine, UEFA earlier this year banned the Russian national team and Russian clubs from participating in international events.
The ruling body of European football declared in a statement that
 "All Russian teams are currently suspended after the decision of the UEFA Executive Committee on 28 February 2022 which has further been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on 15 July 2022."
"Russia is so excluded from the UEFA European Football Championship qualification draw for 2022–24."
The CAS dismissed Russia's appeal against the embargo in July. The Russian Football Union stated: "The Union is currently awaiting for the entire text of the CAS judgement, following the review of which a decision will be made on subsequent steps."
FIFA also decided to bar Russia from the 2018 World Cup in Qatar. Initially, the team had earned a spot in the European qualification play-offs.
In addition, Portugal took the position of the Russian women's team at this year's Euro in England. Germany will host the 2024 European Championship, and the qualifying draw is scheduled for October 9 in Frankfurt.
Germany's interior minister has also asked for Belarus to be banned from the tournament due to the country's backing of Russia.
