Ahead of the upcoming release of God of War Ragnarok on  November 9th, Sony and Santa Monica Studios have released a seven-minute clip titled the ‘Myths of Midgard’. The new video recaps the story of the prequel, God of War, that launched on PS4 in 2018.
 Narrated by popular gaming icon and actress Felicia Hardy and the Smartest Man Alive, Mimir, the trailer recounts the story of Kratos and Atreus, summarizing the whole story of the game in an old-school bedtime story format, complete with rhyming. 
A new report at WhatIfGaming indicates that according to an insider source named Dusk Golem, “God of War Ragnarok” will be the last first-party cross-gen title that will release on both the PS4 and PS5 and the last first-party title that will allow players to buy the title cross-gen. 
The story of God Of War is far from over, as new challenges, dangers and enemies await the father son duo, as well as the imminent start of Ragnarok, the event which according to Norse legends will lead to the end of the world.
