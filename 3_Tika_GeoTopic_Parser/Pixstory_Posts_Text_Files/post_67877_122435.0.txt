Indian team’s journey in CWEG 2022 started with the Rocket League group stage matches. Sadly, the team that had defeated Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, lost all three of its matches in the group stage and had to exit the championship.

Everyone had high hopes for the Indian contingent, but the three-player team never found footing in the championship. The matches were played in the best of five formats, and India lost all by 3-0

In the match against Canada, after losing the first game, our players upped their game and scored two goals, courtesy of Sandeep Sahani and Rushil Reddy, but still lost the game by 4-2. In the third game of the match, the Indian defence showed what it was capable of doing and did not concede a single goal for three and a half minutes, but at the same time wasn’t able to score either. But in the last minutes, Canada scored four goals and won by 4-0.

The next day India had two matches against Wales and England, respectively. In the day’s first match against Wales, India continued their good defence, but again lack of good offence kept them from scoring goals. They only scored one goal in the second game of the match. In the third game, India did manage to keep the Welsh team from scoring, but in the end, we still lost 2-0.

The day’s final match for India was against England and was a do-or-die match; team England just demolished their rivals and won the first two games by a massive 4-0 margin. The ball barely was in England’s half in the two games. In the third game, India did play better but couldn’t score a single goal, lost by 3-0, and was eliminated.

Indian team, led by skipper Hargun Singh, has a solid defence but has to work on its offence because, in most games, the difference between win and loss was the team’s offence. We hope the Indian team learns from this loss and returns stronger next year.
