Last night i dreamt of us . I dreamt of a world that had stopped for a while . For us to live every second without worrying about time . I dreamt of us holding each other like it's the end of the World . I dreamt of your beautiful eyes that look at me with love , love that demands nothing in return ! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I dreamt . What a delightful dream it was ! I dreamt what I yearn for so deeply that I had tears when I woke up . I broke down at 5 in the morning , realising it was a dream . I wished to call you but to wake you up from your sleep at such an hour felt selfishness !ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è

Loving someone can be hard , isn't it ? You have so much to say sometimes but all you do is keep quiet and bury your feelings in a jar . But sometimes you care for them so much that you wishes not to show your feelings off because if that makes them at peace , it becomes peaceful for you too . Loving you never felt like a chore , something that I had to do . but loving you from distance is a thing I hate . I hate to wait for your hugs . I hate to wait for our dates . However , I am used to it now . But No distance can ever get in the way of the amount of love we have . You teach me to look for the bright places and instead of cribbing about the distance , I imagine of the times we will live together someday because you are not allowed to leave this crazy piece of shit alone in this world ! ‚ù§Ô∏èüåé

So , the next time we meet , get ready to have a little dance and eat unhealthy food and talk about life and most importantly , talk about how much we missed each other . ‚ù§Ô∏èüßø
