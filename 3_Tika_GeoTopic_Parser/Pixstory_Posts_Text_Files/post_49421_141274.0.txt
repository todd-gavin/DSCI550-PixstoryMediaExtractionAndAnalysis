A disclaimer before I start: This is coming from an America who may or may not understand much of the sentiments the British population feels for the Royal Family.
One of my major complaints with the monarchy is that many individuals in the twenty-first century still grovel to these very common and extremely imperfect people as if they were superior to other everyday people. Royal family members have nothing that makes them unique and are not naturally superior to anyone else on the earth. 
Royalists frequently promote the notion that they generate more revenue for the state than they consume. This is not true in the least when all grants, small royal charges, and other expenses are taken into account. I can't help but be irritated when I imagine the royals speaking as though they care about or even understand the commoners, when people talk highly of them and do all that bootlicking when I consider the minimum wage parents who work all hours provide half decent food for their children. All the nurses, workers, and firefighters who work way too more than a human body allows only to barely get paid while the royals, with all the luxuries in the world, are hailed for only existing.
Without taking into account the amount of money we invest in the royal family alone, that money may be distributed to hundreds of sincere, diligent individuals who provide something real and palpable, I have one more question: What integrity do we talk about when we talk about the British royals? The one that comes from looting the wealths of India and Africa and leaving them in the position where they could barely stand up? The racism they still face for being not too advanced AFTER the british stole from them everything they had? The queen, and now the King's crown alone has the power of eliminating an overwhelming amount of hunger that cause people to die like flies.
Not only the British Royalty pretty useless to the UK but is also shamelessly privileged. It's unfair on all accounts!
