I remember how excited was for Stranger Things season but to be honest the trailer was a huge turnoff I just think that Stranger Things has lost its charm While watching S what drew me most towards this show was its retro vibe Everything was so s No cell phones no social media It was just kids being kids with a touch of science fiction It was the perfect recipe The same was true for S but as we progressed to S the kids essentially grew up and the show became a typical teen drama with romance shenanigans happening in malls Yes the latter part was interesting but it could have been better it the foundation for the climax was laid from the beginning Coming to S I was excited to see what s in store for Hooper and Eleven but it seems like the innocence the show had is lot and now the makers are focusing on making it a market oriented series that will essentially bring in the money I am not saying that there is anything wrong with it But it would have been nice if the show stuck to its initial premise of a small town science fiction with kids getting in trouble every other day What do you think about the season trailer
