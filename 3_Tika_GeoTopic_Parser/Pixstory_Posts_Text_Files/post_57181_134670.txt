The melting of ice sheets has been a concern for a long time Studies have found that even an increase in temperature of two or three degrees Celsius would end up melting Greenland s ice completely Greenland ice sheet is present in the Arctic making it more vulnerable to climate change And as global warming and rapid climate change are concerned there would be a massive change in the mass of the ice sheets Although with the past records it is not clear how much the ice would have waned earlier what certain studies have recorded is quite startling The cumulative ice loss from Greenland from to was billion tonnes which contributed approximately mm of the global sea level rise There are several factors that determine the net growth or decline of the ice sheets By looking at the melting of surface snow and ice which eventually flows to moulins a well like shaft within the glacier focusing on ice calving Other factors include Melting ice along the sheet s margins runoff and basal hydrology iceberg calving into the sea from outlet glaciers along the sheet s edges
