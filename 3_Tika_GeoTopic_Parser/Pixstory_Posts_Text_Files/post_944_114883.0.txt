Leela was the daughter of Dr. Raghavendra Row and eminent Sanskrit writer Pandita Kshama Row. She was educated at home by her mother and was fluent in English, French and Italian.

While most Indian women played tennis in sarees in the 1930s, including her mother, Leela was amongst the first to appear in a short skirt and bare legs to demonstrate that greater freedom of movement is the best approach to win a competition.

Leela undoubtedly had the huge advantage of being born into an affluent family and having a privileged upbringing, but that doesn't undermine the great proficiency with which she dominated Indian tennis for a decade .
Later she achieved critical fame for penning numerous volumes on classical dances, including Manipuri and Bharatanatyam, in Sanskrit and English. She also helped with the Sanskrit theatre adaptations of several of her mother's poetry.


In the 1930s India had witnessed the meteoric rise of a girl in the tennis arena. Leela Row was a versatile genius. She won numerous national and regional championships, cementing her legacy as one of India’s greats

However, she made history at the 1934 Wimbledon Championship. After a grueling duel of 4/6, 10/8, and 6/2, Leela Row defeated Gladys Southwell in the first round to become the first Indian woman to win a match at the coveted Wimbledon Championships.

Leela's journey to Wimbledon was not a simple one. She was the All-India champion in 1931, but the Wimbledon authorities didn't allow her to compete because the officials hadn't received her entry money.
