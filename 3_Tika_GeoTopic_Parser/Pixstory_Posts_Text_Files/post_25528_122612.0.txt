There are no rules to spirituality

As opposed to following a specific ideology or a set of rules, spirituality simply lets you follow your heart. It encourages you to listen to your intuition as well as do what is right for yourself and others around you.

It sets you free to be the best you can be with no promise of punishment or reward. The reward is simply your inner happiness.

When the pressure of having to be good so that God ‘likes’ you is taken off your shoulders, you’ll notice how it becomes simply natural. You won’t think of what needs to be done, but you will rather act involuntarily from the grace of your core being.

We all come on this Earth with the innate kindness of our hearts. And sometimes we just need to discover how to connect to this purity once again, as it had never left our being.
