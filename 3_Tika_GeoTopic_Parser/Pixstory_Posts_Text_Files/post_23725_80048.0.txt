Ramanathaswamy Temple, Tamil Nadu

Rameshwaram is a small island town in Tamil Nadu known for being one of the pious Char Dhams of the Hindus. As per the legend, Lord Rama with his wife Sita landed on the shore of this island after defeating the demon king, Ravana who was a brahmin.

To seek atonement for killing a brahmin, Lord Rama wanted to pray to Lord Shiva. He asked Hanuman to fly to Kailash and bring a Shivalinga. In the meantime, Goddess Sita made a small lingam. The one made by Goddess Sita is called Ramalingam and one brought by Lord Hanuman is called Vishwalingam.

As per the instructions of Lord Rama, Vishwalingam has to be worshipped before the Ramalingam which is followed even today.
