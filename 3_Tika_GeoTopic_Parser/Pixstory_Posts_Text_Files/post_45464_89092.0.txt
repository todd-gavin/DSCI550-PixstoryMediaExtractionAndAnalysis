Barcelona Women have remained undefeated this season and will enter the Women's Champions League quarterfinal second leg against Real Madrid with a 3-1 first-leg victory at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium.

FIRST HALF:

In the first half, Barça were unrecognisable, having played their worst 45 minutes of the season so far. A great Real Madrid squad came out with fantastic energy and stifling pressure without the ball, and they were incredibly threatening whenever they had the ball, which accounted for a lot of their awful play.

Barça were taken off guard by Madrid's performance, perhaps due to complacency and hubris, and were unable to play their normal style. They kept missing easy passes and never threatened in possession, and their defence was a complete mess: Madrid got whatever they wanted, and Olga Carmona scored an early goal that set the tone for the rest of the game.

Esther González, Madrid's finest player, was unstoppable and had two huge chances near the end of the half, hitting the post from close range and forcing Sandra Paos into a big save.

Madrid could easily have scored two or three goals in the first half, and they were clearly disappointed not to have scored more than once.

A mediocre Barça team was rightfully behind at halftime and needed to play much better in the second half to have any chance.
