Amnesty International, publishing a new report, says that the lives of women and girls in Afghanistan have been destroyed due to the suppression of their human rights by the Taliban.
 Since the Taliban took over, women have lost their right to work, study and travel, and cases of forced marriage and child marriage have also increased. The Taliban destroyed the system of protection and support for women fleeing from family violence and threatened, arrested, tortured and forcibly disappeared women and girls because of their protest against the group's "discriminatory laws".

 "In less than a year since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, their harsh policies have deprived millions of women and girls of their right to a safe, free and productive life," said Amnesty International's General Director.

This organization adds that the Taliban's policies and laws against women constitute a system of oppression and discriminate against women and girls in almost all aspects of life.
