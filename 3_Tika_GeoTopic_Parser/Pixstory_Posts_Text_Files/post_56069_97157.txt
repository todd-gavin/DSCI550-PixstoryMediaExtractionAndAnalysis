Defamiliarization is a Russian Formalist concept adapted in by Bertolt Brecht and he called it an alienation effect This is used by dramatists mainly to make familiar aspects of the social reality seem strange to prevent an emotional connection with the audience Many dramas use this effect to constantly remind the audience that this is a work of art and needs no emotional connection The technique involves breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience Using characters to remind us about the drama depiction of drama inside a drama A director may take a script that has not been written to alienate and introduce certain techniques such as playing dialogue forward to remind the audience that there is no fourth wall or guiding the cast to act in quotation marks By creating stage effects that were strange Brecht aimed to designate the audience an active role in the production by forcing them to ask questions about the artificial environment and how each element related to real life events In doing so it was hoped that spectators would distance themselves emotionally from difficulties that demanded intellectual solutions
