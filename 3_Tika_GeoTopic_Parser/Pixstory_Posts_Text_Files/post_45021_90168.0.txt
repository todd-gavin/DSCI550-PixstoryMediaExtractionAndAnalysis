The England internationals grew up together in Chelsea's academy and established themselves as first-team regulars during Frank Lampard's only full season in charge.

Both, however, were deemed surplus to requirements by Thomas Tuchel, but have improved their reputations since moving to Italy, with Tomori impressing at the heart of a Milan defence that has backed up their Serie A title charge.

Meanwhile, Abraham decided to leave his boyhood club following the club-record purchase of Romelu Lukaku and had been linked with Arsenal before opting for a completely new challenge.

Abraham wasn't entirely sold on the idea of relocating to Italy's capital at first, but Tomori's advice played a significant role in his decision.
‘When he said Roma was on the table, I said: ‘Bro this is a good league’,’ Tomori told the Guardian.

‘I felt like it would develop his game a lot. He has scored a lot of goals this season for Roma, they’re fighting for a Champions League spot.
‘Definitely it’s helped him and definitely I gave him rave reviews about Serie A because I enjoyed myself so much the first six months.’

Abraham was forced to pull out of the latest England squad which, somewhat surprisingly, did not include Tomori.

Tomori responded to Gareth Southgate's omission by saying, 'I just have to make sure I'm playing at a high level.' And then, if I'm called upon, I want to make sure I'm prepared. First and foremost, I need to concentrate on what I'm doing here in Milan.'

'I was speaking to my sister yesterday, and that's family, she's known me her whole life,' he said of his own Italian experience. 'You just seem a lot calmer, a lot smilier,' she said.

‘I think that’s probably the way Italy is. Everything is a bit more chilled. In England, everything is so rushed and hustle and bustle. In Italy, everyone’s walking a bit slower. Everything’s just a bit calmer.’
