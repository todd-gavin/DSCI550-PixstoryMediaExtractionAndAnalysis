My comfort food during monsoon is the classic duo of pakora and chai. Monsoon season is for enjoying crisp and savoury pakoras with soothing hot tea. As soon as we hear the melody of raindrops splatter on the window and smell that entrancing scent of wet mud, our taste buds start craving a generous helping of piping hot spicy pakoras and sweet chai. 
There isn't a single household in this nation of foodies that hasn't had a little pakora party at some point of time or the other. While the Brits have their own chai ritual with scones, cakes and butter, we Indians have this amazing concept of high tea, or shaam ki chai, which is quite bland without steaming hot pakoras. Take any plate of pakora, and you'll understand that it isn't just another food item. It's a centre piece for everything from conversations to celebrations. 

I love pyaaz k pakore and paneer pakore with a cup of tea. Pyaz ki pakore  comes to rescue when you want to eat pakoras. 

Tell me in the notes whatâ€™s your favourite pakoras ?
