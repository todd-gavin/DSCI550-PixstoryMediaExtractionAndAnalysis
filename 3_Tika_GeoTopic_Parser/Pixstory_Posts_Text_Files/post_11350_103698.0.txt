I tried to fit into someone else’s standard of beauty for too long. Now I’m creating my own.

I have an unhealthy obsession with mirrors. It started when I was a teenager taking dance classes at first one, then two, then three different studios. Ballet, tap, jazz, modern, acrobatics — I did it all.

In the beginning, it was fun. I did it for the love of the art form and for the friends I made.

But somewhere around the age of 14, I began to take it more seriously and see it as a possible career — a future where I could combine my love for the performing arts with my love for writing. By 18, I decided I wanted to major in dance and English so I could write and choreograph musicals.

But I had a secret. I wasn’t healthy. I was purging to keep my weight down ahead of every major performance, audition, or anytime the scale crept up higher than my liking.

It’s no secret that the dance world has historically elevated a standard of beauty and fitness that’s unattainable for many — and for Black girls, especially.

My quest to pursue a professional dance career meant forcing myself to meet an expectation that wasn’t designed with me in mind.

It was the first time I felt what so many Black women have felt when trying to navigate the fitness world, where the message is that the “ideal” body isn’t a Black body.

Letting go of impossible standards

Rejection compounded the pressure I felt as a dancer. After auditioning for several university dance programs, the top programs said “no,” and those I was accepted into, I didn’t want to attend (though now as an adult I truly question my reasons for turning down Howard).

Rejection and unattainable standards are a potent combination.

I binged when I craved sweets and junk food, or anytime, really, because I also liked to eat.
