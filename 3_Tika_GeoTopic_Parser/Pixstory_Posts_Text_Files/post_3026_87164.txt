First there was a tremendous backlash against all Russian vodkas in the US followed by some senators who asked people and stores to Dump all the Russian Vodka This happened immediately after Russia made the unprovoked invasion into Ukraine on February The sellers and manufacturers had time to explain to people that the Russian sounding brand names had nothing to do with Russia rather most of the best selling labels were manufactured either in the US or in a NATO member country in Europe For instance the majority of vodka imports in the US are from France such as Grey Goose Now Russian restaurants in several US cities such as New York are getting vandalised and their owners abused or trolled just for their Russian origin or just Russian name A few of these restaurants are even owned by Ukrainians who are actually relatives of victims of Russian invasion in their home country Take the case of Sveta a small restaurant in the West Village in New York known for its cocktails and Russian dish borscht The year old owner Sveta Savchitz is actually a Ukrainian who opened the restaurant years ago and called it Russian so that people can recognise it easily These days she is receiving negative emails saying Go back home or getting trolled under the assumption she is a Putin s supporter Similarly Russian Samovar a bar owned by a couple with origins in Russia and Ukraine is getting anonymous telephone calls that abuse them as Nazis The Russian Tea Room in New York is also receiving such calls even though they oppose Putin and his assault on Ukraine Such emotional calls for boycotts during war or conflicts is nothing new which remind of similar calls by US politicians to ban French products in when France opposed the US plan to invade Iraq in But such backlash against businesses has hardly any effect on the supposed enemy or its economy Such moves are counter productive damaging the economy of the US and its own citizens READ MORE
