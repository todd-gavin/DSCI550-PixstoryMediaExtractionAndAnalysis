Global entertainment and media corporation CMNTY Culture has chosen architecture firm HKS and landscape designer Hood Develop Studio to design a new creative campus in the heart of Hollywood. The project, dubbed CMNTY Culture Campus, would include production areas, offices, and performance venues in a 500,000-square-foot development that will bring together creative businesses. 

Dima Stouhi writes about how the project is a response to changes in the entertainment industry, where new opportunities to reimagine the landscape of content creation and consumption are emerging. 

As explained by Philip Lawrence, owner of recording studio the Record Plant, "creatives and their audiences now seek opportunities to collaborate and interact, not just in the digital sphere, but in-person. Content creators need a physical epicenter, a place that celebrates their work and the power of community". 

As a result, CMNTY Culture Campus is positioned to be a gathering place for creatives to connect with like-minded people and share their experiences. 

ArchDaily reported that the proposed campus, which will be located on a 2-acre site at Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, will be one of the area's largest Black-owned businesses, bringing together artists, content creators, tech and media companies, agencies and management firms, and other entertainment sectors who have been supporting artistic creation and enriching the Hollywood community. Along with studio/production space, pre- and post-production facilities, instructional space, and performance venues, 430,000 square feet of creative office space will be offered. A 500-seat theatre will be located on the street-level corner of the building at Highland and Sunset, as well as a rooftop terrace.
