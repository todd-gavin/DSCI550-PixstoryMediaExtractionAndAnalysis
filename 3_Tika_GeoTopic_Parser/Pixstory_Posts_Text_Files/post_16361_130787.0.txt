I personally believe this Hindi remake would be a flop.❌❌

I don’t think Hrithik Roshan is the perfect cast for Vijay Sethupathy. His looks or voice are never perfect for a Villain material.😈😈❌❌

Casting should be the opposite way.✅

Saif can do both characters with ease. Saif is a perfect Villain / AntiHero material. His looks, voice, and acting perfectly match or even can exceed VJS. Hrithik should have been cast for Madhavan's role.✅✅✅

But I don’t think Hrithik can do justice to VJS's role. So, I strongly believe this version would backfire. A perfect cast is needed for a successful remake.✅🤑🤑

Some successful recent examples are DRISHYAM OF AJEY DEVGAN AND KABIR SINGH OF SHAHID KAPOOR THESE BOTH MOVIE WAS A FOOD REMAKE OF THERI ORIGINAL VERSION❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
