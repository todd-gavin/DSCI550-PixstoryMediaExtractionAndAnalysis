Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is edging closer to a return to Juventus as his €8million salary net per season contract is almost agreed, per football transfer expert Fabrizio Romano. 

The French midfielder who has been widely speculated to leave United at the expiration of his contract this summer is on the verge of returning to his former club on a free transfer should he consent to a 4-year deal with the Italian giants. 

The 29-year-old midfield maestro re-joined the Red Devils in 2016 for a club record fee of £89million after initially leaving Old Trafford in 2012.

But following an underwhelming spell in the Premier League, neither the club nor the player are willing to extend his soon-to-expire 6-year deal.

Paul Pogba spent 4 seasons at The Old Lady from 2012 till 2016, clinching the Scudetto 4 times alongside 2 Coppa Italia titles and he his now expected to close a deal that will see him make a return to Turin, Italy.
