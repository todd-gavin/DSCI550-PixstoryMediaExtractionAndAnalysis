Happiness is one of the most important goals in life During the pandemic it trended as the most searched word on Google But here s why the pursuit of happiness can be bad for you It can make us more self centred The active pursuit of happiness can exacerbate individualistic tendencies to seek out pleasures at the expense of others breaking up a friendship because it is not fun society driving fast may make you happy but it endangers people s lives or the environment keeping the air conditioning on overnight Ironically that self centredness apart from not serving others well also makes people who pursue happiness more lonely Focused on making ourselves happy we forget the basic principle of happiness which is to look outside ourselves for true happiness Those who score the highest in any happiness rankings report good social support for instance supporting others when in need and in return being offered support live meaningful lives that allow them to contribute to society put effort into developing skills that serve others well experience abundance of positive emotions which are often created in the company of others we smile times more often in a group than in solitude This is the irony of the single minded pursuit of happiness Focusing on ourselves and wanting to be happier reduces our chances of experiencing happiness It can make us realise that we re unhappy The idea that we should be searching for it can highlight the absence of happiness in our lives The more we value happiness the more likely it is that we will be disappointed with our current situations Even worse the more desperate we become about finding happiness the more likely we are to experience symptoms of depression Full story at The Conversation Image courtesy Rafael Ben Ari Alamy Stock Photo
