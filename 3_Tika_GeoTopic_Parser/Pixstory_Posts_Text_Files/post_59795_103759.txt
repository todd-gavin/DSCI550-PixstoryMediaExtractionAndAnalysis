In this respect everyone is unique Many women don t even have menstruation cramps It s probably most usual to have a nagging discomfort that s not too difficult to deal with but it s also common for it to be severe enough to make a woman miserable and make it impossible for her to go about her daily activities without the use of ibuprofen Some women suffer from excruciating menstrual cramps that necessitate the use of prescription medicine typically NSAIDs with opioids as an adjuvant other therapies are also available Some people find it difficult to comprehend how severe it can go Some women appear to believe that all cramps are the same and that women who complain about severe cramps are wimps However there is a significant disparity amongst women The majority of women agree that labour is excruciatingly painful Some women who have had the most severe sort of monthly cramping since adolescence go on to have children and declare that the contractions were no worse than their menstrual agony rarely they may even say that labour was a little less painful
