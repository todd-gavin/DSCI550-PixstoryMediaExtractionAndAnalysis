 Maria Thorisdottir and Vilde Boe Risa are a part of Martin Sjogren s side for this summer Norway have been titled the dark horses of this tournament but nobody should underestimate this Norway side who in my opinion are one of the favorites in contention to lift that trophy having lifted it in and Thorisdottir has been a key member at the heart of the Norweigan defense in the recent years and after a good club season her presence in this side will help the team defend at the front foot Boe Risa has also been a key part of the Norweigan team in recent years and offers the role of flexible midfielder She has played as a CDM CM and CAM this season and has done well in all those positions so it s safe to say that Sjorgen has a big task at his hands to manage his midfield as there are so many exceptional midfielders in his side Former United GK Aurora Mikalsen is also a part of the squad The last time Euros were held in England Norway reached the final but lost to Germany Ona Batlle is one of the best full backs in the WSL and in the world right now Only years old Batlle won the Manchester United Women s Player of the Year award in season and was voted in the PFA WSL Team of the Year for season Ona has made appearances for the La Roja and has won the edition of the UEFA U Women s Championship and the edition of the UEFA U Women s Championship Now a part of Jorge Vilda s side Batlle will be one of the key players in Spain s quest to lift their first ever European Championship who was on loan at Manchester United last season from Lyon is a part of the Denmark squad The biggest tournament of this summer is here Make sure to tune into the UEFA Women s Euro as the best European Nations fight it out to lift that Euro Trophy
