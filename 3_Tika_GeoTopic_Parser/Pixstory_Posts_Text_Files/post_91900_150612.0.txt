Lord Krishna’s Abode – Dwarka
Founded by Lord Krishna, Dwarka is said to have existed more than 10,000 years ago and is believed to be the first capital of Gujarat. Today this coastal city is one of the ‘Char Dhams’ (four religious seats) as per Hindu beliefs. Badrinath, Puri and Rameshwaram are the other three. The Dwarkadish temple, dedicated to Lord Krishna was originally built around 2500 years back, but was destroyed by Mahmud Shah. It was later rebuilt in the 16th century.
