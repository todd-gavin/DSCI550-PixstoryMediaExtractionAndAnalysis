Swift s songs always have me dreaming of myself in larger than life situations While I love almost all of her songs I think I have a couple of favorites This one though it s too beautiful to just pass All Too Well Red All Too Well is a ballad of sorrowful recollection of a relationship she adored not merely a beautifully written song It is a song about heartbreak a heartbreak anthem The poems cover the entire relationship from beginning to finish Taylor Swift presents a beautiful vision of how everyone wishes their lives might be with that one special person in the first line This is the beginning of a romance and everything appears to be vibrant Taylor states that being with this someone made her feel at ease He was warm and she was at rest It appeared as if all of the pieces were falling into place like autumn leaves But as she didn t realize the loss of autumn leaves heralded the start of a new season when trees slumber for the winter The trees essentially perish Taylor was too innocent and full of love and hope to notice Taylor Swift is a storyteller and with this song she told my story and of every other young heart
