Gigi Hadid turns heads in a lime green gown as she arrives at the British Vogue X Self-Portrait Summer Party on Wednesday (July 20) at Chiltern Firehouse in London, England.

Maya Henry, Ellie Goulding, Pixie Lott, Oliver Cheshire, and Georgia May Jagger attended the event, which was hosted by British Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful and Han Chong.

For the event, Gigi, who is Self Portrait's new brand ambassador, even colour coordinated her bag and shoes to her neon dress.

The party provided an opportunity for old and new friends to come together to celebrate the value of creativity.

Gigi was spotted back on the runway late last month, walking in a very fashionable runway show alongside her famous sister, Bella.
