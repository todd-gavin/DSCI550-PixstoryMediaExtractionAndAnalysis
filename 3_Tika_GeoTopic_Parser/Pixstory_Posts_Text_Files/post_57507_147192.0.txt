People mostly see the positive sides of face streaming while ignoring the harm it can sometimes, if not taken care of, certain things.
Steam can cause severe burns, so keeping a safe distance from the steam source is necessary. 
If you’re steaming your face using the damp towel method, ensure the towel is warm — not hot.
You might want to skip facial steaming if you have rosacea(chronic skin disease). The heat dilates blood vessels, which contributes to redness.
Though steaming can hydrate the skin, people with dry skin and eczema should use extra caution. Limit steam sessions to just a couple of minutes to avoid irritation.
People should keep these things in mind before choosing face steaming because it might have dire repercussions.
