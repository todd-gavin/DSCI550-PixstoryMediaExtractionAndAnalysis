Victory for the eighth consecutive useful result Juventus beat Udinese at home in advance of the th matchday and with the three points earned they reached Atalanta in fourth place in the standings The match was decided by Paulo Dybala in the first half who did not celebrate after the goals and Weston Mckenny ten minutes from the end I invited a friend and I couldn&#39;t find him Dybala explained at the end of the game talking about the lack of celebration after the goal and the almost defiant look towards the grandstand And then on the renewal and on the transfer market rumors I don&#39;t know there was a lot of news a lot of things happened I prefer not to talk I have nothing to prove to anyone The club has decided that we will talk in February March I don&#39;t know I have to wait I remain at the coach&#39;s disposal To deny what the Juventus number said thought Massimiliano Allegri Dybala was looking for a friend in the grandstand But if no one was there He simulated as if the grandstand was full
