Mary Earps is an English footballer who plays for Manchester United women in FA WSL and England’s women's national team. 

She has been quite a journeywoman as she has plied her trade for FA WSL clubs Leicester City, Nottingham Forest, Bristol Academy, Birmingham City, Doncaster Belles, and Reading, and in the Bundesliga with VfL Wolfsburg. 


Earps joined Man Utd women in the 2019/20 season to replace retiring Siobhan Chamberlain. 


Mary Earps won the FA WSL cup with Reading in the 2016-17 season and she also won Frauen- Bundesliga in the 2018-19 season before moving to FA WSL club Manchester United.

Earps ranks 0.81 in shots which she is expected to save, even though the data doesn’t do her justice as she is a very good shot-stopper. Whether the opponent is taking shots from outside, inside or edge of the box Mary usually stops them or parries them away. 



In recent matches, she had made some saves which could be contenders for the Save of the Season award.


Her ball distribution is really good as she had made a total of 65.6 total passes per 90 out of which she had completed 29.0 and she has a pass completion of 81%. She has 16.8 per 90 in medium ball distribution passes. This season her ball distribution is much better than the last season.

Mary Earps has kept 9 clean sheets and she has faced 55 shots, out of which she had made 36 saves taking her tally to 69.1% in the number of saves she had made.

Mary also plays as a sweeper keeper. She pushes herself up the pitch and stays close to the last line of defense. Johan Cryuff always used to say that in his team, the goalkeeper is the first attacker and the striker is the first defender. Mary has come out to help her teammates. She has done 16 defensive actions outside the box. United plays from the back and Mary Earps is an integral part in orchestrating the play bringing Millie, Thorisdottir, and Mannion who are excellent ball progressors and distributors.
