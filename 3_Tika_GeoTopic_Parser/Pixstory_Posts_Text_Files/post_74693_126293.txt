Darling a film released on August Friday on OTT platform Netflix starring Vijay Verma Alia bhatt Shefali Shah and Roshan Mathew Darlings explores the lives of a mother daughter duo played by Bhatt and Shefali Shah trying to find their place in the city seeking courage and love in exceptional circumstances while fighting against all odds Alia Bhatt during a interview added that with OTT in the business there is a lot of scope for writers to not worry about the day one box office numbers Makers simply need to focus on creating good characters female or male it doesn t matter she said The movie received a good response so far Fans are excited and enjoying the dark comedy Darlings portraying the women abuse snd domestic violence in a marriage Darlings says that when it comes to domestic violence there are no gray areas It doesn t allow an abusive husband to fall into the safety net of social conditioning and eating and drinking habits The creature is born with a sense of entitlement and expresses it when he imagines provocation from the so called weaker sex Made with an activist s gaze the film wants women to punch past the abuse rather than negotiate with the scorpion a euphemism used for the abusive husband in the film The treatment and the quality of the performances give Darlings a unique space in the category of films that address domestic abuse With dark humor never really reducing the seriousness of the central theme Darlings is an interesting film that works in totality One dialogue that stayed with me was by Shefali Shah s character when the inspector suggests divorce as a solution She says it s a solution only for Twitter people And a majority is still struggling in a judgemental society Concluding in the end with thumbs up to this OTT I think darlings is a must to watch movie to let people understand the reality of lives a women faces I think you definitely will love this movie toooo a d enjoy your weekend tooooo
