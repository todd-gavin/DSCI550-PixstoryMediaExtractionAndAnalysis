Let’s talk about Fight Club starring the Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and directed by David Fincher. The film tells the story of a human male, living on Earth. The filmmakers forgot to give him a name, so let’s just call him Edward Norton. At the outset of the film, Edward Norton has lost the ability to sleep, which is what humans call it when they have to recharge their bodies. Later, he meets Tyler Durden. They become friends and start punching each other, which allows Edward Norton to sleep. Soon other males want to punch each other too. They call it Fight Club, because why not? From here, Tyler creates Project Mayhem, which is like Fight Club, but with bombs instead of fists. Unfortunately, Edward Norton discovers that he and Tyler Durden are the same person, because human brains are primitive and occasionally malfunction. Edward Norton shoots himself in the cheek, which destroys Tyler, because imaginary friends always live inside your cheek. At least that's my interpretation. In the end, Edward Norton fails to stop the mayhem caused by his spectral friend, but he gets to hold hands with a girl, and that’s all that really matters to human males. Now, on the surface, this might seem like a movie about punching. And that wouldn’t be a bad guess, since human movies are almost always about punching. However, a closer reading reveals that Fight Club is a cathartic expression of frustration with American capitalist society.
