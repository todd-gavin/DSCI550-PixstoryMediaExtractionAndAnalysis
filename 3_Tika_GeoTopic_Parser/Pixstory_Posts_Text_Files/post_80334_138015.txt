Manchester United Arsenal post match reviewing What went wrong for the Gunners Manchester United triumphed winners to continue their incredible home record vs Arsenal with goals from debutant Antony a Rashford brace with Saka scoring for the visitors My first talking point is the first goal Gabriel overly commits leaving Arsenal unbalanced Zinchenko had to come inside to cover for Gabriel which left Antony open should the ball get to him which is what happened A brilliant pass from Eriksen to create the space for the counter and a perfectly executed pass from Rashford to find Antony Man United Thriving in Transition As much as Arsenal dominated Man United were incredibly effective in transition and easily could ve exploited more goals but for better efficiency Star Performers United started the game off very sharply Mctominay particularly I was surprisingly impressed with Dalot grew into the game massively Bruno Eriksen were impressive ultimately United were well organised Rashford s favourite Bruno s pass to Rashford was simply sublime Rashford was a transitional problem all game and high lines is absolutely his bread and butter Back to Arsenal Gabriel Jesus Gabriel Jesus was absolutely fantastic He plays like a proper target man while having incredible footwork linkup flair and so much more So strong a complete nightmare for Martinez Varane particularly in the st half Transition inconsistent press Arsenal s high line got decimated by a side who are notorious for doing so The high line isn t usually such an issue and although White Saliba both should ve stepped up respectively it was Arsenal s disoriented press which created the space lack of protection The lack of a natural N positioning wise was telling Bukayo Saka The Englishman has looked a lot better recently and yesterday was a continuation Flawless v a goal for confidence great linkup a very tidy game Overall a very good display slightly wasteful sometimes not direct enough and a slight pressing inconsistency but exploited in transition ruthlessly
