The financial records of New York City reveal that over the preceding years, $200,000 in taxpayer funds were used to finance the appearance of drag queens in public elementary schools serving children as young as three. Some parents were not informed in advance of the arrival of these drag queens, nor were their children given the choice to opt out. The drag queens would read children stories and instruct them on how to apply drag makeup.

This outrageous act committed against impressionable schoolchildren is inexcusable. Do macho men enter elementary schools and read books to young children about embracing their heterosexuality? No, they don't. Allowing drag queens into elementary schools to read and teach their ideology to young, impressionable children would only confuse them. 3 year old’s, 4 year old’s, 5 year old’s, etc., have a difficult time understanding sexuality, generally, so how can the school board expect children to understand what is occurring when a man dressed in women's clothing is lecturing them about men loving men and women loving women?

This is one of the clearest instances of the intrusion of politics into our educational system. There are actual school officials that are content to expose your children to their political beliefs and principles outside of your presence and without informing you of what they taught them. They are striving to raise your children as if they were their own. Thankfully, there are numerous vocal parents who are upset and eager to speak their opinions in order to effect change. If we want things to change, this is precisely what is required.
