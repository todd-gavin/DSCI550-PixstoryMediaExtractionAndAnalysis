Images of a well-maintained government primary school in Uttar Pradesh are being circulated on social media. The name and address of the school — Prathmik Vidyalaya, Itayla Mafi — are visible in one of the images. Sharing the photos, many users have lamented the fact that the improved condition of government schools in Uttar Pradesh in the Yogi Adityanath regime has not made headlines in the international media. It is pertinent to note that the viral claims surfaced following a New York Times report on August 16 on the AAP government’s efforts toward improving the standard of government schools in Delhi.
Haryana’s former BJP IT Cell chief Arun Yadav tweeted these images on September 3, with the caption, “ये प्राईमरी स्कूल उत्तर प्रदेश के जिला संभल में है” (Translated: This is a primary school is located in Sambhal district of Uttar Pradesh). His caption further reads, “अगर ये दिल्ली की तस्वीर होती तो अंतराष्ट्रीय अखबारों में सुर्खियां बनाई जाती” (Translation: Had it been a picture of Delhi, headlines would have been made in international newspapers).

User Tanmay Shankar also tweeted these images. His caption reads, “योगी सरकार में काम दिखावे के लिए नहीं बल्कि प्रदेश को आगे बढ़ाने के लिए होता है।” (Translation: Work is not done for show but for the progress of the state in the Yogi government). (Archived link)
