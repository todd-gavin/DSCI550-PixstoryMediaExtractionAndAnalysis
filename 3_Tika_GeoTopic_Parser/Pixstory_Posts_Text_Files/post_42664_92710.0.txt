The love for songs too came from my father. Once a year, we would have celebrated folk singers come to our house and perform. And everybody was invited.

We had a huge fall at the top of our Wazir Bagh house, which was called Kaeni (attic) that accommodated about 150 people at one point of time.

So, once a year, all the relatives would get together. There was dinner in the night and the singer would come and sing popular Kashmiri songs.

Our neighbours, which were again, a fair share of Muslims and Punjabis, would attend this event organised by my father.

And his favourite singer obviously was Ali Muhammad Sheikh of that times. “Faqirey tabavun aftaab chumay, Faqirey Kabavuy mehraab chumay” was his all-time favourite song. Occasionally, he also liked Muhammad Subhan Bhat.

They were typical Kashmiri folk singers of those days. And at that point of time obviously I didn't understand the contents of the song though I understood Kashmiri. So, it became a part of my life and maybe that is the reason I carried this legacy forward. My children, who understand Kashmiri but can't speak it, have to listen to the folk songs of today if they want to hang around with me. That's the deal. 

I tell them that if you want to go to Pahalgam or Gulmarg with me, then we have to listen to Kashmiri songs and may be dance also if we can. And it has to be somewhere in Shopian or Kulgam or Pulwama on the route and then have lunch and hang around with my friends. They did it and continue to do so.

Over the period of time, I can claim that I am among those who understand the meaning of these hardcore Kashmiri folk songs.

I also take pride in being among those who actually understand the poetry of the likes of Nyama sahib, Ahad Zargar, Ahmed Batwara and Shams Fakir.

I have realised that there is lot more beauty in what is being said through these songs. It coincides with mysticism. I started correlating history with music, who came when and how it changed.
