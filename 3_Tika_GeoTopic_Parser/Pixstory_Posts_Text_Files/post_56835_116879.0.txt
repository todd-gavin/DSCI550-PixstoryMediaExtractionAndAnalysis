Choose a sunscreen with "broad spectrum" protection. Sunscreens with this label protect against both UVA and UVB rays. All sunscreen products protect against UVB rays, which are the leading cause of sunburn and skin cancers. But UVA rays also contribute to skin cancer and premature ageing. Only products that pass a specific test can be labelled "broad spectrum." Products that aren't broad spectrum must warn that they only protect against sunburn, not skin cancer or ageing.


Ensure your sunscreen has a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number is the sunscreen's level of protection against UVB rays. Higher SPF numbers mean more protection, but the smaller the difference becomes, the higher you go. For example, SPF 15 sunscreens filter out about 93% of UVB rays, SPF 30 filter out about 97%, SPF 50 sunscreens about 98%, and SPF 100 about 99%. Of course, no sunscreen protects you completely. The FDA requires any sunscreen with SPF below 15 to carry a warning that it only protects against sunburn, not skin cancer or skin ageing.


"Water resistant" does not mean "waterproof." No sunscreens are waterproof or "sweatproof," and manufacturers are not allowed to claim they are. If a product's front label claims to be water resistant, it must specify whether it lasts 40 or 80 minutes while swimming or sweating. For best results, reapply sunscreen at least every 2 hours and even more often if you are swimming or sweating. Sunscreen usually rubs off when you dry yourself, so you need to put more on.
