The start of the Juventus season in terms of injuries can certainly not be said to be lucky After losing Pogba probably for months, the bianconeri also lose McKennie to a shoulder dislocation The medical staff intervened immediately and the dislocation was reduced but it will still serve at least a month to see him again on the pitch With the start of the championship just around the corner with the first match against Sassuolo Allegri will have to deal with many injuries and suspensions In addition to the aforementioned Pogba and McKennie, Juventus will miss Federico Chiesa who is not yet ready Kaio Jorge who should return to October in addition to the suspended Kean and Rabiot Wojciech Szcz sny is also in doubt due to a muscle strain that requires rest He should be able to recover for his league debut but in the meantime he has already missed the last friendly against Real Madrid
