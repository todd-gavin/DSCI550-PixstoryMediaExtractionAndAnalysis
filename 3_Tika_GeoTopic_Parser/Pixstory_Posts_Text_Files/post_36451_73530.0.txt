BTS is the biggest boy band in the world of 7 members.
They are part of United Nations through a campaign named "Love Myself" Launched in November 2017, the Love Myself campaign sends a powerful anti-bullying message, promoting self-love among children and young people across the world.
In September 2021 they gave a speech in United Nations conference once again and talked about the current issues in the world i.e. pandemic, global warming, digital community etc. 
Their campaign has helped many people around the world. Their campaign has got full support from their fans "ARMYs". With the help of them the money raised will go toward UNICEF's work to halt violence. BTS said it hoped to keep the campaign going, ‚Äúso we can help people find happiness and love.‚Äù
