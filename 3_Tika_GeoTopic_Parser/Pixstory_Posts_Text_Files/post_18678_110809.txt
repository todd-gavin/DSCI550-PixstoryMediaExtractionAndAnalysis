Gold medal at the World Swimming Championships in Budapest for Gregorio Paltrinieri The Emilian champion conquered the highest podium in the cross-country kilometers The victory adds to the three already on the bulletin board: gold in the freestyle in the pool, bronze in the relay and silver in the kilometers on Lupa Lake Behind Paltrinieri arrived the other blue Domenico Acerenza which made both of us very happy The best thing was having finished first and second We are best friends and being on the podium together is wonderful We wanted to get here and we succeeded In the water I felt it touching me my feet felt at home and I enjoyed Paltrinieri&#39;s post-match commentary I&#39;m also happy because after the disappointment of my team I thought I would leave without medals Instead everything has changed Now I&#39;m resting there are the European Championships and I think I&#39;ll do the same program
