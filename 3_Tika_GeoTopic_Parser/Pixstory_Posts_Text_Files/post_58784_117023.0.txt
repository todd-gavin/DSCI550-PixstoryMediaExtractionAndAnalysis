Even at peak hours, it is now much easier to find a seat on the once-packed Blue Line (Dwarka Sector 21 to Noida Electronic City/Vaishali), which is a very clear indication of how Metro traffic has decreased over the previous two years due to the pandemic and the lockdowns it involved. According to data from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the city's Blue Line saw the biggest decrease in ridership overall when compared to pre-pandemic levels.

The average daily ridership on the Blue Line between May and July (to date) was 1.13 million people per day, down from 1.48 million during the same period in 2019, which represents a decrease of 23.98 percent.

With a daily average passenger drop of 22.10 percent from 1.49 million in 2019 to 1.16 million in Mayâ€“July 2022, the Yellow Line was the second-biggest loss.

The data, however, showed that two lines, Green and Pink, were able to post an increase in daily passengers.

Between May and July 2022, there were 188,000 passengers using the Green Line (Inderlok-Brigadier Hoshiar Singh), an increase of 18.09 percent from the 154,000 passengers who used it in the same period in 2019.

The average daily ridership on the Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar), which became operational in 2018, increased from 381,000 in May and July 2019 to 399,000 in May and July 2022.

The DMRC cited the completion of a new halt station in Punjabi Bagh this year, which serves as an interchange between the two lines, and the construction of a new halt station in Punjabi Bagh as the primary causes of the growth on these two lines.
