A skyscraper-sized asteroid is zooming toward Earth and will skim past our planet today. As per Mint, the asteroid, named 2013 CU83, measures approximately 600 feet (183 m) across at its widest visible point, and will pass by about 4,320,000 miles (6,960,000 km) from Earth, or about 18 times the average distance between Earth and the moon.

Earlier on Friday, another asteroid, dubbed 2016 CZ31, whizzed past the earth. Astronomers estimate that the asteroid measures about 400 feet (122 meters) across at its widest point, making it about as wide as a 40-story building tall.
Astronomers predicted that it would safely miss our planet, passing about 1,740,000 miles (2,800,000 kilometers) out from Earth â€” or more than seven times the average distance between Earth and the moon. 

According to NASA, this space rock makes close approaches to Earth every few years, with the next one scheduled for January 2028.
