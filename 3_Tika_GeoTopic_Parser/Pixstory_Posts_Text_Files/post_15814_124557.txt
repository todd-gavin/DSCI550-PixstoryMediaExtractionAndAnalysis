Abstract Aims It is now understood that almost half of newly diagnosed cases of type diabetes are adult onset However type and type diabetes are difficult to initially distinguish clinically in adults potentially leading to ineffective care In this study a machine learning model was developed to identify type diabetes patients misdiagnosed as type diabetes Methods In this retrospective study a machine learning model was developed to identify misdiagnosed type diabetes patients from a population of patients with a prior type diabetes diagnosis Using Ambulatory Electronic Medical Records AEMR features capturing relevant information on age demographics risk factors symptoms treatments procedures vitals or lab results were extracted from patients medical history Results The model identified age BMI weight therapy history and HbA c blood glucose values among top predictors of misdiagnosis Model precision at low levels of recall was compared to incidence rate of misdiagnosis at the time of the first type diabetes encounter in AEMR Conclusions This algorithm shows potential for being translated into screening guidelines or a clinical decision support tool embedded directly in an EMR system to reduce misdiagnosis of adult onset type diabetes and implement effective care at the outset Sources
