When we discuss health we often associate it with being fat or obese. More than that most parents are worried whether their children be called fat or might not be most popular in school. 

Often parents tend to comment on their child's weight thinking it is constructive-it could only trigger your child's insecurity. A home is a place where you can be yourself and it's from home you get the confidence to be yourself. When parents comment on their children's weight you have done the first step of the damage which many others will continue. 

Before being concerned about your child's weight be concerned about whether they are good human beings and check whether they have any health issues. If so help them to reduce weight and not to the size zero figure. Help them maintain a healthy weight. If they choose not to you can never force them. 

Check on the mental health of your child as it can cause eating disorders rather than blaming everything on Junk food. Banning Junk food will bring in the size zero image it intends to many in to forward. Junk food isn't some poison, if made in healthy conditions it has no problem. Also, health issues or overweight conditions can be due to hereditary problems. Human bodies are different and people have different body structures. Understand that there is no perfect structure that one wants for themselves. So before injecting a healthy conscious diet into your children. Just take a moment to think about your intention.
