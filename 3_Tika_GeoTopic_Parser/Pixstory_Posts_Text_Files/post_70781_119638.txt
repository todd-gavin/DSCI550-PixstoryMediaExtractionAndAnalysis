The Pyrshang Da Lade Little Star Football club was started in It began coachings in and started training children The founder Muthok Khongmawloh took the initiative to train young village children and teens so that they would have a balance between academics and physical activity My goal was to improve the quality of their lives and prevent them from sticking to electronics only The club was started because there was a considerable lack of resources for village children compared to those living in cities The club is like a resource providing refuge to everyone deprived of opportunities Mr Muthok took the initiative to guide the children of his village and take them to games and tournaments across the state so that even the villagers could access equal opportunities in football and realise their passion The club remained focused on only sports for a good few years before Mr Muthok decided to expand his initiative to a community learning centre to make his village self reliant The Pyrshand Da Lade Alternative learning centre was opened in and despite the challenges posed by the pandemic it managed to organise many events and learning sessions other than football Currently the learning centre tries to impart skill based courses that the villagers can learn to earn a livelihood They also organise environmentally sustainable activities encouraging young children to be more environmentally conscious We ll look at more activities organised by the club and the challenges it faces in the upcoming posts Stay tuned with us
