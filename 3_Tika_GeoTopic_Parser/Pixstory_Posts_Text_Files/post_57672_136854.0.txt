Pescatarians call them vegetarians who have added seafood to their diet.
But what is their logic?
There are many reasons, like considering raising livestock to have environmental harm rather than using fish and seafood.
"A 2014 study calculated that diets of fish eaters caused 46% less greenhouse gas emissions than those of people who ate at least a serving of meat daily."
Pescatarians also stand for ethical purposes, like opposing slaughter; they don't want to kill animals for eating; it's against their belief.
Also, they don't support inhumane factory practices that torment innocent animals.
Although excessive aquaculture and fishing can be harmful too.
So believing in these reasons and logic, they eliminate meat and other animal products from their diet while choosing seafood and fish.
