A systematic review and meta analysis Highlights Effects of nut consumption on components of metabolic syndrome were summarized Nut consumption led to a significant reduction in some components of lipids profile Nut intake had no effect on glycemic markers and blood pressure Aims Randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of nut consumption on the metabolic profile of healthy adults with overweight obesity have yielded conflicting results This systematic review and meta analysis aimed to summarize the effects of incorporating nuts into the diet on serum lipid profile glycemic markers and blood pressure in healthy adults with overweight obesity Data Synthesis PubMed Embase Scopus Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched up to April The random effects model was used to determine the pooled effect sizes expressed as weighted mean difference WMD with confidence intervals CIs Ten eligible RCTs with arms were included in the meta analysis The meta analysis revealed that nut intake significantly decreased serum triglycerides TG WMD mg dL CI Furthermore subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in serum LDL cholesterol LDL C following adherence to normocaloric nut enriched diets WMD mg dL CI However nuts did not affect serum total cholesterol high density lipoprotein cholesterol glycemic markers and blood pressure Conclusions Overall incorporating nuts into the diet of healthy adults with overweight obesity have favorable effects on serum TG and LDL C Thus nuts might exert protective effects against dyslipidemia in this population Source
