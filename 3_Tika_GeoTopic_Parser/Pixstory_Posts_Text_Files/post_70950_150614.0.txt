It goes without saying that Hrithik Roshan is one of the most talented stars we've seen. From portraying the role of a romantic hero in his debut film, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai to a relatable Arjun in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Hrithik has carved a niche for himself in the industry as one of the most versatile heroes. But over the last few years, Hrithik's been embroiled in one controversy after another but that hasn't taken away from his on-screen presence.
And the actor is back again to the big screen to showcase his talent with Vikram Vedha and praises have been pouring in from all quarters. More recently, Duggu's ex-wife Sussanne Khan took to her social media handle to share the sweetest post.
Sharing a poster, Sussanne wrote, "RA RA RA RA…Rooooom this is by far one of my favourite movies ever!!! Superrrrbly gripping and full of Thrillssss!! Congratulations @hrithikroshan @saifalikhan_online and the entire team… for this tremendous entertainer!!! this one is going to be a huggge BLOCKBUSTER"
Sussanne and Hrithik have proved to be the perfect example of modern parenting. Although they parted ways many years ago, the two continue to be great friends and spend quality time by going on holidays, movies and meals with their kids. Sussanne and Hrithik have also met and spent time with each other's partners Arslan Goni and Saba Azad.
Apart from Hrithik, Vikram Vedha also stars Saif Ali Khan, Radhika Apte, Rohit Saraf, Sharib Hashmi among many others. The movie is the official remake of the Tamil film with the same name that starred R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi in the lead.
