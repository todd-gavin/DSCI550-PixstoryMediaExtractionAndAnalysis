Victory By Sherman Alexie When I was twelve I shoplifted a pair Of basketball shoes We could not afford Them otherwise But when I tied them on I found that I couldn t hit a shot When the ball clanked off the rim I felt Only guilt guilt guilt O immoral shoes O kicks made of paranoia and rue Distraught but unwilling to get caught Or confess I threw those cursed Nikes Into the river and hoped that was good Enough for God I played that season In supermarket tennis shoes that felt The same as playing in bare feet O torn skin O bloody heels and toes O twisted ankles O blisters the size Of dimes and quarters Finally after I couldn t take the pain anymore I told My father what I had done He wasn t angry He wept out of shame Then he cradled And rocked me and called me his Little Basketball Jesus He told me that every cry Of pain was part of the hoops sonata Then he laughed and bandaged my wounds My Indian Boy Poverty Basketball Stigmata The poetry gives a heart breaking picture of poverty faced by the Native American Citizens The boys passion for Basketball made him steal a pair of shoes which he later regretted and his regret was so deep as the river in which he threw the shoe When he confessed the crime to his father was not mad at him but he was ashamed for not being rich in a consumerist country The poem on many levels reflects the themes of poverty unequal distribution of money Consumerism and Capitalism The poem doesn t conform to the traditional style of poetry the author has given his own unique style to convey the emotion effectively to the reader The monologue description moves the heart of the reader It also throws light on how religion propagates guilt in the mind of younger generation God is something feared upon The poetry points us in to certain situations in which its hard to choose the right and wrong
