Anand you tapped into every beat of your life making it huge!!! "Babu moshai zindagi badi honi chahiye lambi nhi", your words were less but filled with meaning, always. I would say, Bhaskar, a doctor by profession who was curing people with diseases learnt how to cure ones own heart.

It would still be a paradox how we humans worry so much about people who are budding us goodbye while we fail to admire people who are with is in the form of everything that we would be earning for, once they would be gone. 
It is said when a character sneakingly slips into your heart's strings it's the characters win that time. Maybe that's truely the case with you. You would always be an awe inspiring figure for me, when the would would feel a little bit problematic. Wait! Isnt it problematic already? 
Maybe we need more Anands in our life to male our lives beautiful.
