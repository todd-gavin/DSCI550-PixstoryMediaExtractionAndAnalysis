I always prefered a book.A book is way more self explanatoy. People watch a movie and half of it is lost in talking
Movies are shallow, one-way, non-stop experiences.Books offer a rich depth of thought rather than sensation When I read a book, I can “see and feel” ”it in my mind.

Well, it depends upon individuals choice at the end, but I feel not just I enjoy reading Book, I get to the skin of the character and somehow book reading has contributed to my personality development.
