Just a reminder to all my friends So no one told you life was gonna be this way Your job s a joke you re broke Your love life s DOA It s like you re always stuck in second gear When it hasn t been your day your week your month Or even your year but I ll be there for you When the rain starts to pour I ll be there for you Like I ve been there before I ll be there for you Cause you re there for me too
