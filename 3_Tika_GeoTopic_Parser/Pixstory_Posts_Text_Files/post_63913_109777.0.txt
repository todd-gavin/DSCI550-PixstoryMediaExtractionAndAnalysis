Looking at the new gameplay footage of Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl was extremely impressive. For those who don’t know, Stalker is a horror survival first person shooter franchise developed by Ukraine based game developer GSC Game Developer and is a historic franchise in gaming history.

But what makes the new Stalker even more impressive is that the development of this game is taking place in very similar circumstances to what is happening in Ukraine right now, with the Russia-Ukraine War still going on.

Amidst the ongoing conflict, the studio has shifted operations to Prague and also changed the game’s subtitle from “Heart of Chernobyl” to “Chornobyl” to reflect the local Ukrainian spelling of the famous 1986 nuclear disaster site.

The new footage once again takes us through the dark, desolate and haunting world of Stalker as a lone Stalker, encountering danger at every turn. 

Besides that, the devs have also added a ton of new features including new weapons, customizations, equipment, enemies etc. 

While the gameplay looks stellar, in light of the war, the release date has been extended, so fans of the franchise, fps games must be patient. As of now, the game has been delayed to a 2023 release.
