Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 100th goal in the Premier League, with the Manchester United star marking the strike against Arsenal by pointing to the sky in tribute to his recently deceased son. 

Ronaldo was back in the United squad for the first time since he and his partner Georgina Rodriguez announced their baby son had passed away. 

The Portuguese international struck his 100th Premier League goal in the first half of the clash against Arsenal as they were 2-0 down and subsequently paid tribute to his child following the tragedy.

Ronaldo scored 118 goals across all competitions during his first stint at United between 2003 and 2009, including 84 in the Premier League and has boosted that tally since returning to his former club. 

The 37-year-old had hit 16 goals after joining his former club in the top plight season, with his latest strike coming against Arsenal.
