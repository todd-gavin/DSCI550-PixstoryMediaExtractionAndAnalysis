In my personal opinion, as long as properly sanitized equipment is used by a trained professional in hygienic conditions, tattoos are not bad for you. 
Of course, it may lead to skin infection and other allergies reactions, but i suppose it's the risk you run. 
Health matters aside, will the people around you support your decision? Maybe or maybe not. 
I've always wanted to get a tattoo, much to the dissatisfaction of my family, but ultimately, the choice is mine.
