Abstract

The World Health Organisation recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life (Australian institute of health and welfare, 2011). Breastfeeding confers many short- and long-term benefits for infants and mothers, including reduced childhood obesity and lower maternal body weight (Infant feeding survey, 2010; CDC National immunization surveys, 2012 and 2013; Sorkio et al., 2010; Hummel et al., 2014; Finkelstein et al., 2013). Exclusive breastfeeding is also recommended in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), for at least four months (Nucci et al., 2017). However, the impact of breastfeeding on mothers with T1DM, and, conversely, the impact of maternal T1DM on breastfeeding, is not clear. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the epidemiology and physiology of breastfeeding in women with T1DM. In particular, it highlights the relationship between breastfeeding and glycaemia. Potential areas for future research are also identified.
