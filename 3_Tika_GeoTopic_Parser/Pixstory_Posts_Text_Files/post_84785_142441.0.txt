"Roz raat ko jab quarter laut te hain, toh aisa lagta hai ki out ho kar pavilion laut rahe hain."
This conversation between Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his South Eastern Railways manager, A.K. Ganguly, took place when Dhoni was working as a ticket examiner at Kharagpur Railway Station.
When his manager asks Dhoni what he does when confronted by a bouncer, the distraught player replies, "I duck."
 This cricket-life analogy perfectly illustrates a remark by Charles R. Swindoll that states, "Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% of how you react to it." 
The manager then smiles and responds, "Life is exactly the same! You will keep on receiving bouncers, all you have to do is duck." 
"Life main saari balls ek jaisi nahi milengi, toh merit pe khelna hai aur tikke," the manager says in closing.
