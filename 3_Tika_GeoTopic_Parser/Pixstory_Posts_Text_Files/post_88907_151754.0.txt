Ukrainian forces have recaptured the southern Kherson region and taken control of Lyman over the weekend. 
Last week, Russia announced the deployment of partial mobilisation in four Ukrainian territories- Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson. 
None was fully annexed by Moscow’s forces, taking this advantage Ukraine advanced towards the south. 
Lyman’s take over could also pave the way for Ukraine’s acquisition of the Donbas region (Luhansk and Donetsk collectively), by moving towards east to liberate northern Luhansk first. 
However, the Lyman defeat incorporates the inherent faults of Russia’s military system, on the other hand Chechen leader accused Lapin for not supplying ammunition and communication equipment.
