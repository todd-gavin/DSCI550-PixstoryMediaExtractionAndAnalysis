It’s been two days since Real Madrid got thrashed by FC Barcelona by 0-4 and as a Real Madrid fan, it’s still hurting.

The night before the El Classico, when I wrote the preview of the match, my headline for the game was “Old Guards vs Young Guns,” and that’s what all the fans of Real Madrid experienced after the match. Real Madrid’s old guard wasn’t capable to match the pace of Barcelona’s young guns. 

 Carlo Ancelotti, manager of Real Madrid got it all wrong that day. When I saw the lineup, I thought that Real Madrid will play in a 4-3-3 shape because there are 3 midfielders (Casemiro, Kroos, Modric) and there are 3 attackers (Vini, Rodrygo, Valverde) but we saw a completely different game. Carlo Ancelotti decided to play in a 4-4-2 shape where Vini and Rodrygo are playing up front on the pitch and Valverde is used as a midfielder.

On the other hand, Xavi, manager of FC Barcelona brings his team to Madrid with proper homework. He got the answer to every question that Real Madrid asked them in the first 20 minutes but after it was just the FC Barcelona show and at halftime scored 0-2 already. 

The worst decision of Carlo Ancelotti in El Classico was the substitution. Carlo bring Camavinga and Mariano and take out Kroos and Carvajal. Camavinga and Kroos swap was justified but taking out Right back Carvajal to bring in the striker was abysmal and why on earth, Isco, Bale, and Hazard aren’t getting even single on the pitch?

As a Real Madrid fan, I think international break comes at a very good time for the team and players will get two weeks to break where they will analyze their mistakes and Carlo Ancelotti will have the time to decide the strategy which will he use against Chelsea when Real Madrid will face them in the semifinals of UEFA Champions League. 

Let’s hope, Real Madrid comes back stronger and bring back the smile on their face as well as on the face of all the Madridistas.
