Ingredients gr mascarpone gr whipping cream gr ladyfingers spoons of sugar bitter cocoa to taste white vermouth to taste coffee to taste Preparation Let&#39;s start by preparing a coffee maker for cups, make the coffee slightly longer than usual While the coffee comes out, whip the cream using a whisk, preferably electric do it first and we&#39;ll put it in a container Now take a large container and put the mascarpone and sugar and mix them When they are well blended you can incorporate the cream you whipped taking care to turn from top to bottom so as not to disassemble the compound It seems difficult but don&#39;t worry Now it&#39;s time to get your hands dirty take two soup plates Put the coffee in one and the vermouth in the other which you will need to dilute with half a glass of water and two or three teaspoons of sugar Meanwhile prepare a tray on which to place the tiramisu Take the ladyfingers, dip one in the coffee and one in the vermouth and adjust them alternating them until they cover the entire base of the tray. When the base of the dessert is ready, cover it with the cream obtained from the mascarpone, sugar and cream, the one prepared at the beginning. And now off we go with a second layer of ladyfingers remembering a very important thing and that is to put the ladyfingers dipped in coffee on top of those that we had dipped in vermouth and vice versa Cover the second layer of ladyfingers with the remaining cream, smoothing the surface with a knife and sprinkle the surface of the cake with plenty of cocoa bitter The dessert is ready but don&#39;t eat it yet You must first put it in the fridge for hours and then you can serve it and finally eat it I recommend if you prepare it the night before for the next day it is even tastier
