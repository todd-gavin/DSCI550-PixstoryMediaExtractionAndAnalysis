James Anderson came out in defence of Stuart Broad after his opening partner was on the receiving end of history against India at Edgbaston.

Broad experienced the ignominy of conceding a record 35 runs from his 18th over, as India's tail rallied on day two of this fifth Test to lift their team to a first innings total of 416. His misery was compounded by the fact the batter causing the carnage was India's No. 10, Jasprit Bumrah.

The stand-in India captain teed off to smash four fours and a two sixes, swinging himself off his feet at one point, as Broad persisted with short-pitched deliveries, as per the fields set. As well as a no-ball, Broad contributed five wides himself. The over finished with a scampered single, resulting in Broad attempting to run out Mohammed Siraj in his follow-through, decimating the stumps but missing out on the dismissal

Broad is no stranger to being smashed by an Indian. 15 years ago in the first T20 world Cup, Yuvraj Singh of India, smashed Stuart Broad for 36 runs in an over hitting six sixes in six balls
