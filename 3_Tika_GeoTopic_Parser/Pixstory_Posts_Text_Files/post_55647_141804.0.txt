One of Sydney's most notable building has a handwritten note from Queen Elizabeth II addressed to "the residents of Sydney," but it won't be discovered for another 63 years. As Daily Mail reported, a time capsule containing a secret message from Her Majesty and strict instructions not to be opened before 2085 is kept in the beloved Queen Victoria Building in Sydney's central business district. Following extensive building restoration work in November 1986, the Queen wrote the letter. Even her own staff is unaware of what she wrote, and many Sydney residents also won't ever learn. Only Her Majesty's orders are visible on the letter, which is framed and housed in a glass case in the restricted dome region of the top of the QVB.The letter is addressed to the 'Right and Honourable Lord Mayor of Sydney, Australia'.'Greetings. On a suitable day to be selected by you in the year 2085 A.D. would you please open this envelope and convey to the citizens of SYDNEY my message to them,' the letter reads which is then signed by the Queen.It’s sad as most of us won’t be even alive to get to know what is written in that letter!
