Jim Carrey has criticised Hollywood outrightly for giving a standing ovation to Will Smith after he won the Oscar for best actor. Will Smith was awarded just some minutes after he slapped Chris Rock for making an insensitive joke about Jada Pinkett Smith. 

Jim Carrey was giving an interview to CBS's Gayle King for his upcoming movie, Sonic 2. Carrey said, 
“I was sickened...I was sickened by the standing ovation. Hollywood is just spineless en masse and it really felt like this is a really clear indication that we aren’t the cool club anymore." 

Carrey added that Smith should've been taken out t of the ceremony after he slapped Chris. Carrey said the only reason Chris didn't press charges was because he wouldn't have wanted the hassle.
Carry further said, I’d have announced this morning that I was suing Will for $200 million because that video is going to be there forever, it’s going to be ubiquitous...That insult is gonna last a very long time. If you want to yell from the audience and show disapproval or say something on Twitter, its fine. But you do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words.”
In the end, he said, ' It came out of nowhere because Will has something going on inside him that’s frustrated. I wish him the best. I have nothing against Will Smith. He’s done great things, but that was not a good moment. It cast a shadow over everyone’s shining moment last night…It was a selfish moment.”
