In the press conference, Walter Mazzarri presented his Cagliari match against Napoli in this way We know the value of Napoli we have seen what they did in Barcelona but we must think of ourselves Even with the big teams if we do things as we have often done throughout the game we can put even the big teams in difficulty like in Bergamo With a cool head I&#39;m still a little angry at how we shut down for minutes in Empoli we conceded the goal and then we managed to equalize We need to always be intense for minutes not we can throw away points for voltage drops We have made great strides but we still need to improve against Napoli I expect to see my team concentrate throughout the game As I always say about what the others are doing we can&#39;t do anything Milan he unfortunately lost points in Salerno but I&#39;m focused only on us We have to do everything possible and impossible to score points And I go back to Empoli we had to win again It burns me Without that block in the first half we would have brought home the three points We even risked several times to also concede the second goal It mustn&#39;t happen again and I don&#39;t want to go back to the first round For me now only Cagliari counts You know there is no past I have already said that I thought I would have less difficulty here in Sardinia instead it took a long time but for now we&#39;re doing what I like
