Ghana captain Andre Ayew believes he could have acted similarly to Uruguay striker Luis Suarez when the Uruguayan stopped a goal-bound header with his hands to deny the Black Stars a place in the World Cup semi-finals in South Africa in 2010. His remarks echo those of legendary Ghana forward Asamoah Gyan, who was at the centre of events as Ghana exited the global showpiece in the quarter-final match in Johannesburg.

Talks about the famous incident have resurfaced after the two countries were drawn together in the same group for the 2022 World Cup, which will be held later this year in Qatar.

“Like I said before in the past, maybe if it was me or someone else, I could have done the same action [as Suarez],” Al-Sadd winger Ayew told Joy Sports.

“It’s true he killed us, he killed our dream, he killed Africans’ dream, and we all have that feeling that he didn’t make us the first [African] country to get to the semi-finals, so that will always be there.

“But he did it for his nation, he took a decision but we don’t [have to] look at that. We want to play well and try and succeed [in Qatar].”

In the match at Soccer City Stadium, Ghana had a last-gasp chance to win in extra time when Dominic Adiyiah headed on target, but Suarez produced a goal-line clearance with his hands, earning a red card and earning Ghana a penalty, which Gyan missed. Ghana suffered even more heartbreak in the ensuing penalty shoot-out, losing 4-2, making former Liverpool player Suarez a national hero back home.
