Lazar Markovic

Markovic was regarded as one of Europe's best young talents, but he only scored three goals in
34 appearances for Liverpool, failing to justify his £20 million price tag.

He joined Fulham on a permanent transfer in January 2019 after loan spells at Fenerbahce,
Sporting Lisbon, Hull City, and Anderlecht, only to be released a few months later.

The Serbian international then returned to his boyhood club Partizan Belgrade, where he has
recently regained some form. In 27 games, he scored 12 goals as the club finished second in
the Serbian SuperLiga.

Dejan Lovren

In the summer of 2014, Liverpool exploited Southampton as their personal shopping mall,
spending £20 million on Lovren, reuniting him alongside Lambert and Lallana.

The centre-back was frequently chastised at Anfield, but he stayed long enough to earn the
grudging respect of the Reds' supporters.

He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £10.9 million in 2020 and had an instant impact, winning
the Russian Super Cup on his debut and playing a key role in the club's defence as they
retained the Russian title in 2020-21.

“I never regret anything and this is a feeling I don’t allow in my head,” Lovren told Zenit’s official
website in January 2021.

“I made the decision to leave Liverpool. I wasn’t feeling happy there towards the end, because I
wasn’t playing. I am happy that I decided to come here and I think they miss me more than I
miss them.

“Jurgen Klopp knows that, we sometimes chat and he once wrote to me that he misses me. I did
not answer that.”
