Although Oeneus was the first mortal to whom Dionysus gave a vine plant Icarius preceded him in the art of making wine He offered a jar of his product to a group of shepherds in the woods of Marathon near Mount Pentelicus and these shepherds neglected to cut the wine with water as Enopion later advised them to do they became so drunk they saw everything double they believed themselves bewitched and killed Icarius Icarius&#39;s dog Mera watched the shepherds bury the body under a pine tree and later guided Icarius&#39; daughter Erigone to the grave pulling her by the hem of her dress and digging the ground with her paws Desperate Erigone hanged herself from the branches of the pine praying that the daughters of Athens would suffer the same fate as her until Icarius was avenged Only the gods heard and the shepherds fled overseas but soon many Athenian maidens were found hanging from the branches of the pines and the Delphic oracle explained that it was Erigone who had demanded their lives The guilty shepherds were immediately found and hanged and the harvest festival was instituted during which libations were poured to Icarius and to Erigone and the maidens swing on ropes hanging from the branches of the trees resting their feet on a slat this is how the swing was invented Masks are also hung from the branches which turn on themselves at the slightest breath of wind The image of Mera the bitch was placed in the sky and became the constellation Ursa Minor others however identify Icarius with Bootes and Erigone with the constellation Virgo Source The Greek Myths Gods and Heroes in Homer Volume Robert Graves
