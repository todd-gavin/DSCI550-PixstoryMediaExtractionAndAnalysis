1. Coursera 
I don't like it much using it but it's useful in knowledge Development. You can use others Apps for Courses like SkillShare, Edex etc.

2. MyCaptain
It's a startup so there's more improvement needed in the app but they can give you Basics to any Field of knowledge.

3. Shaw Academy
It's my Personal Favourite. Just use it! It has detailed courses. I really want you to try this.

4. Duolingo
You can learn Any language. In a fun way. 
Best thing is Completely Free with no ads. That's Great.

5. Pro App
It's also a Start up, Oriented to Design only, you can find a lot of course in the field of Design. Worst thing is It's Courses are in app purchase. 

6. Kuku FM
I use it to grasp some context about different books so that I can Find whether reading any book is worthy or not.

7. Ted
You are learning from the best, Not anybody, not ordinary. 
But it's not Addictive!

8. Discovery
You can get any Research Article in this app. Useful in researching for a Projects or something like that.

9. Grasshopper
It's Coding app by Google. You will get to know about coding but you will not become a coder just by using this app only.
It's Fun!
Best for just knowledge.

What apps do you use to Learn? Let me know in the Note section.

Thanks
Stay Khush!
