On deadline day, every year there are some unexpected transfers. This year the surprise came from Tottenham Hotspur. Dele Alli who was having a bad time under all the managers since 2020, permanently moves to Everton to play under Frank Lampard.


The deal was signed off on 31st January 2022. Everton had a shopping spree in the last couple of days. Rafa Benitez was fired some weeks back due to a poor form of run in the Premier League. Everton was looking for a new manager. Finally, they chose Frank Lampard, who was Chelsea's ex-manager.


After Lampard, Everton signed Donny van de Beek from Manchester United on loan until the end of the season. Ever since coming to Old Trafford, Van de Beek has struggled to get game time under Ole as well as Ralf Rangnick. He did not start a single game this season in the Premier League. After the loan deal, Everton initially went for a loan deal for Dele Alli too. But due to some reason, his move was made permanent until 2024.


Dele Alli joined Spurs in 2015. Since then he has played 269 games for Spurs and scored 67 goals. He also grabbed 61 assists in that time. 2020/21 season was the first season where Dele Alli failed to score a single goal in the League. He was already struggling for game time under Mourinho that time.


The transfer fee is said to be around 40 million Pounds. The fees will be structured based on performance-related add-ons. The Frank Lampard era will officially start at Goodison Park as he got two great players in the Premier League.


Dele Alli can make his debut for Everton at New Castle in the coming week.
