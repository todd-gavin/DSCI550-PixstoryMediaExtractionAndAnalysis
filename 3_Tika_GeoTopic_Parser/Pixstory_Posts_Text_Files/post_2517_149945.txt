After the wedding of Shiva and Parvati was fixed and the day finally arrived Shiva visited Parvati s father king Himavan s place palace in his usual self complete with the leopard skin matted hair ash smeared on his body and his snake Vasuki around his neck completely naive about the first impression it would create in the mind of Parvati s family Not only this in the marriage procession came his followers comprising ghosts ghouls goblins ascetics and so on All this was a shock to Parvati s family and her mother actually fainted To salvage the situation and avoid any embarrassment to either her parents or Shiva Parvati took the form of the terrorizing Chandraghanta complete with ten hands holding a Trishul and riding a tiger She then approached Shiva and requested him to take the form of a handsome prince and make the marriage procession a bit nobler Shiva agreed and then finally the marriage of Shiva and Parvati took place as per the rituals The third day of Navratri is dedicated to Maa Chandraghanta and this year the colour of the day is royal blue
