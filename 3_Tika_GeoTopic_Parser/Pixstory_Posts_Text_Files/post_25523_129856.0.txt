People ring the temple bell on entering as the sound of it is said to clear our mind and help us stay sharp, keeping our full concentration on devotion. Moreover, these bells are made in such a way that the sound they produce creates unity in the left and right parts of our brains. The duration of the bell echo is ideal to activate all the seven healing centres in our body, clearing us of negativity.
