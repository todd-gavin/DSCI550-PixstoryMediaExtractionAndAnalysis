The episode takes off with Daemon (Smith) making a rather powerful return to King's Landing, riding his dragon and as he makes his way to see the King, the Prince proudly wears a crown, stating that it was the people who called him the "King of the Narrow Sea" after his victory over the Crabfeeder. Although the Daemon that returns is a different version of the man that we have met before and he doesn't forget to put on a spectacle for everyone as he not only bends the knee in front of the King, his brother but also shares a hug on his safe return, thus showcasing how there's no bad blood between the brothers over the succession. 
Without going into any spoilers, if there's one thing that can be discussed about the fourth episode of the show, it's that it embraces peak GOT-level drama this time around as scandalous incidents happen and they are all the products of the deceitful minds of those involved. This episode needs no deaths and blood to insert some shock value for its viewers because it has far more sinister stuff to offer. The climax of the episode also packs a massive punch and it's probably from here on that the true game begins. The big players in this episode are Rhaenyra (Alcock), Daemon (Smith) and King Viscerys (Considine) and the three Targaryens promise to shock you in ways you would not have expected. In some of the sombre moments of the episode, there's also a different side of Queen Alicent Hightower (Emily Carey) in that we see her internal struggles of being the heir-delivering wife to Viscerys. In a conversation with Rhaenyra Carey beautifully puts it how Lady Alicent seems to have gotten lost as only the Queen Alicent remains. The Lady has been robbed of several things including the idea of ever experiencing true female pleasure and it's conveyed rather notably by Carey who lays lifeless while being a dutiful wife to Viiserys
