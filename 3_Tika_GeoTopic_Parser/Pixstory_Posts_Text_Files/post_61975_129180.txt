Loki season filming is already underway and we saw a bunch of exciting images from the set We ve also seen the first plot spoilers for season but they re not very detailed yet We can t even tell if those leaks are accurate What s clear is that the number of Loki season leaks will increase in frequency and the next exciting spoiler concerns the show s villain Well it s not the villain that you expect considering how season ended It s another bad guy with Marvel reportedly casting a huge actor to play the character None of this is official news however Season concluded with Sylvie Sophia Di Martino outmaneuvering Loki Tom Hiddleston to kill the milder variant of Kang Jonathan Majors who maintained the Sacred Timeline He Who Remains wasn t necessarily the first season s villain Similarly the Kang variant who leads the TVA now might not be the villain of Loki season Sylvie s actions had immediate consequences on the timeline unleashing the multiverse We ve already seen the consequences in the MCU The spell that went wrong in No Way Home and the multiverse shenanigans in Doctor Strange are the kind of events that the TVA would have kept in check while He Who Remains was in charge This brings us to the claims of an MCU leaker who goes by the name CineStealth This person provided accurate details about Marvel shows in the past suggesting they have some well placed connections The leaker now claims Loki season will be crazy as hell Expanding on that statement CineStealth said that a super huge actor might have been cast as a villain to debut in Loki season If true it would break the internet They did not reveal who this mysterious villain might be other than to say it s not Kang We expect Loki season to continue to explore the multiverse And since we re in the Multiverse Saga anything goes
