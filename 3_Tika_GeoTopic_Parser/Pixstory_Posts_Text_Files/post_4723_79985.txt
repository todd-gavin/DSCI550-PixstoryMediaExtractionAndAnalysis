Mountain glaciers are essential water sources for nearly a quarter of the global population But figuring out just how much ice they hold and how much water will be available as glaciers shrink in a warming world has been notoriously difficult In a new study scientists mapped the speed of over glaciers to get closer to an answer They discovered that widely used estimates of glacier ice volume may be off by about in terms of how much Earth s glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could contribute to sea level rise Mathieu Morlighem a leader in ice sheet modeling and a coauthor of the study explains why the new results hold a warning for regions that rely on glaciers seasonal meltwater but barely register in the big picture of rising seas If mountain glaciers hold less ice than previously believed what does that mean for people who depend on glaciers for water Globally almost billion people rely on mountain glaciers and snowpack as their main source of drinking water Many also rely on glacier water for hydropower generation or agriculture particularly in the dry season But the vast majority of glaciers around the world are losing more mass than they gain during the year as the climate warms and they are slowly disappearing That will profoundly affect these populations These communities need to know how long their glaciers will continue to provide water and what to expect as the glaciers disappear so they can prepare In most places we found significantly lower total ice volumes than previous estimates indicated In the tropical Andes from Venezuela to northern Chile for example we found that the glaciers have about less ice than previously believed This means downstream populations have less time to adjust to climate change than they may have planned for Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
