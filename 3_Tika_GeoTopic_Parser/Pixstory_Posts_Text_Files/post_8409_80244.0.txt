23-year old R Babu, a trekker who was stuck in a deep gorge in Palakkad, Kerala without food or water for 2 whole days, has finally been rescued after a 45-hours long operation by a Disaster Response team from the Indian Army after initial rescue advances from the Fire & Rescue Dept, Coast Guard and the NDRF failed.

R Babu, 23, slipped and fell into the crevice on Monday while on a hike with three friends. Three different rescue teams had failed to reach him earlier.

Early on Wednesday morning, the Indian army finally made contact with him.

"Army personnel who conducted the rescue operation reached near R Babu and gave him water and food. A member of the rescue team took him to the top of the hill after giving him safety gears", as per reports.

The 1,000-ft (305 metres) Kurumbachi hill in Palakkad district of Kerala is known for its steep terrain and the state's forest department has previously warned trekkers about the risk of hiking up the hill.

After his friends failed to pull him up using sticks and ropes, they went down the hill to seek help from the police.

Mr Babu sent photos and selfies of the spot to help them locate him.

As rescue efforts expanded, drones were used to monitor his location on the side of the hill where he was stuck.

On Tuesday, Coast Guard helicopters made several sorties to reach him but failed because of the topography of the terrain and a heavy downdraft.

Rescue teams were also unable to get food and water to him.

Till Tuesday noon he had responded to the rescue operators by raising hands. But by evening he had become very weak.

Last night, authorities lit flambeaus to keep wild animals away, as per an official involved in the operation.

A team of the Indian army was mobilised after the state's chief minister requested their help and finally, after a protracted rescue operation, Army managed to pull him out.

The man also displayed mental fortitude and finally went on to prove that God helps those who help themselves.
