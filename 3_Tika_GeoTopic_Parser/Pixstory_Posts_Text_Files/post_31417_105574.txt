In a percentage of those recovered from Covid, a condition of malaise defined as long Covid persists, characterized by asthenia, fatigue, difficulty breathing and cognitive symptoms such as memory loss, difficulty in concentration, anxiety and depression, often referred to as brain fog and at the basis of the clinical picture defined as NeuroCovid. recent pilot study coordinated by Marco Fiore and Carla Petrella of the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the National Research Council of Rome Cnr Ibbc led to the identification of early biomarkers of long Covid in adolescents The research was conducted at the Policlinico Umberto I of Sapienza University of Rome in collaboration with Raffaella Nenna Fabio Midulla Luigi Tarani of the Department of maternal and child and urological sciences and Antonio Minni Department of sense organs The results of the study were published in Diagnostics We measured the levels of some inflammatory biomarkers and of two neurotrophins Ngf and Bdnf factors proteins that regulate the growth, survival and morphology of neurons in the serum of a small cohort of boys and girls who had contracted the infection during the second wave of the pandemic between September and October but were negative at the time of sampling. They were divided into symptomatic asymptomatic groups acute symptomatic acute patients who developed long Covid symptoms over time These data were then compared with the values emerging from a sample group that had not contracted the disease explains Fiore We found that the serum levels of Ngf were lower in all the adolescents who had contracted Sars Cov infection compared to healthy controls The inverse relationship between Ngf levels and stress syndromes widely reported in the scientific literature The research hypothesizes that the decrease in Ngf reflects a persistent activation of the stress axis due to a direct effect of the virus or to psychosocial effects resulting from the isolation and changes to the daily routine encountered during the quarantine periods The levels of Bdnf similarly to the inflammatory biomarker Tgf were instead higher in individuals who had fallen ill than in healthy ones but only in symptomatic girls who would later develop long Covid symptoms adds Petrella
