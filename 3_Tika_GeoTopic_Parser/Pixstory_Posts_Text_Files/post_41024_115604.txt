No hate towards Squid Games It s an amazing show and I am glas that international art is finally getting recognition However my mood is just sour over how Sadie Sink and Millie Bobbie Brown were overlooked Anyone who has watched Stranger Things S will agree with me The fourth season of Stranger Things received an astonishing number of Emmy nominations but none for the stars As per EW the massive smash from Netflix received an astounding nominations including the major one for Outstanding Drama Series and a raft of technical honours At the same time celebrities like Millie Bobby Brown and Sadie Sink clearly the season four standout continued to be passed over Nevertheless the Television Academy did submit Stranger Things for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series suggesting that viewers were pleased with the ensemble s performance as a whole in season Everyone I know praised Sink in particular for her compelling storyline this year as heartbroken teen Max Mayfield I always had a little voice in my head saying you re still the new kid Sink had said Even while we were filming season I think I was so used to just playing a character that was a little bit newer and I as Sadie was still finding my footing So when the scripts came out for season it was a shock to see the storyline that they had planned for Max No doubt that she killed it and this season was all hers She may not have the nomination but she definitely has the fans appreciation
