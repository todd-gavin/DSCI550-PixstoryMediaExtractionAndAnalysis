From the horrors of 1990s Assam-Bhutan border where stepping out was risking your life, a small sports club emerged. It all started when four sports enthusiasts sat down to discuss the possibility of starting such a club. Their tenacity did the rest. 

Biddheshwar Dewry is a football enthusiast who is now one of the main caretakers of this club. It was registered back in 1996 and it continues to prosper with the support of the founders. This club not only promotes football, but also cricket, athletics and more. They also have a women’s football team!

From childhood, Mr. Dewry grew up watching Ronaldo and Messi play. He gained inspiration from these individuals and starting doing well in football. While he couldn’t play for a long amount of time, he channels his passion for sports into the club. 

He tries to promote the club as much as possible and he’s grateful for the community’s continuous support! That is evidenced by the number of individuals who visit every time even if they’re busy with their work. “The tickets to the tournaments are normally Rs50. One day’s ration for someone comes to the same amount and still, people choose to come and watch the students play!” People offer money for proper tournaments to take place and dignitaries also lend a helping hand. They come and congratulate them for organizing such big tournaments. 

After more than 25 years since its inception, the sports club continues to get more students. While the number of players dwindles during specific seasons, the interest doesn’t die. Without the existence of a clubhouse, the desire of 4 devoted individuals to begin a discussion about sports led to the creation of a small sports club. Not many people were interested in the start but when has hard work not paid off? The field is now much more than a place to grow crops. It’s a ground filled with inspiration, diligence, and productivity.
