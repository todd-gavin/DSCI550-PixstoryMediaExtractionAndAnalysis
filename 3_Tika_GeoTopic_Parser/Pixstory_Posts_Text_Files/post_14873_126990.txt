Even before the Taliban took power on August last year Afghanistan was struggling with over million children out of school of whom they were girls Although the potential costs of girls and boys not getting an education are high in terms of lost income girls&#39; lack of education particularly costly due to relationship between education attainment and girls delaying marriage and motherhood and participation in labor force Unicef analysis indicates Afghanistan will not be able to recover gross domestic product lost during the transition and to reach its true potential productivity without fulfilling the right of girls to enter and complete secondary education The March decision not to allow girls to return to secondary school was shocking and deeply disappointing It not only violates the fundamental right of girls to education but places them at greater concern and risk of exploitation and abuse including child trafficking and early and forced marriage, said UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan Mohamed Ayoya UNICEF wants every girl and boy to in Afghanistan go to school and learn We will not stop working until this goal is achieved Education is not only a right for every child but the basis for Afghanistan&#39;s future growth Afghanistan remains one of the world&#39;s most complex and multidimensional crises for children has continued Ayoya This is a pivotal moment for a generation of children in Afghanistan Girls&#39; rights are under attack their childhood marked by deprivation For this reason, despite the challenges of the operational context, UNICEF is increasing its presence it is continuing its activities and is achieving results like never before In doing so we want to say to the people of Afghanistan we could not do what we do without your trust and support We also thank our donors and partners for their generosity to date but urge them to continue to supporting children especially with winter just around the corner
