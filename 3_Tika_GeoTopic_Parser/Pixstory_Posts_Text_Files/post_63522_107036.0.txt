Who doesn’t love a nostalgic reworking of an old school favorite? 

Jack Harlow’s “First Class” samples Fergie’s Glamorous with a low-key teenage angst that pretends to be chill. I’ll be honest though, I can never get through Jack’s full track when I play it. I’m tempted to play it, but after a minute of listening, I realize that it tastes like a sloppy second.

Still, I keep it in my playlist because one day later, I find myself wanting to play it again. Do you experience this too – imagining a song to be better than it actually is? More importantly – what’s on your playlist? Get me out of this loop! 

(No offense Jack Harlow, this is a me-problem, not a you-problem clearly – you’re trending).
