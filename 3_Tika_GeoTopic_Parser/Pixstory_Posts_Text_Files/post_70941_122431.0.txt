Alison Brie stated earlier this week that "legitimate conversations" about a comedy series movie sequel were happening.

The Community actress Yvette Nicole Brown  (Shirley Bennett) has expressed additional hope for the possibility of a movie adaptation by asserting that she thinks "it's going to happen." If they can work out certain logistical issues, she expressed similar optimism about the project's success.

It's not that there is a lack of desire, as we've been saying for years, Brown asserted. We all wish we could, but we've all just diverged and done so many different things.

“It’s like how do you work out a schedule where you can get Donald Glover(Troy Barnes), or Gillian Jacobs(Britta Perry), or Danny Pudi(Abed Nadir) all together in one place at the same time again? So, I think that is the biggest jigsaw puzzle to put together, but every puzzle can find its way to completion. So, I believe that it’s going to happen, I don’t know when, but there are talks right now, currently.”

Community, a television series created by Dan Harmon, ran for six seasons from September 2009 to April 2014. After five seasons on NBC, the programme was cancelled, with the sixth season airing on Yahoo Screen, a streaming service that is no longer available.

Abed, a character on the sitcom, says that the most popular and well-regarded TV series have six seasons plus a movie, which raises the possibility of a movie sequel.

Along with Jim Rash, Chevy Chase, and Ken Jeong, Community is a drama series set in a community college in Colorado. Over the course of its run, the sitcom received four Primetime Emmy nominations and one win.

In Dave Franco's romance comedy Somebody I Used To Know, Brie will reunite with Community co-star Pudi. Later this year is when it's anticipated to be launched.
