 COVID detection and diagnosis procedures are either costly difficult or incorrect With a basic optical microscope and antibody proteins Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology researchers have built an unique biosensing platform Their adaptable technique based on slowing down light may open the way for novel diagnostic tools and low cost detection systems Despite all the terrible news the COVID pandemic has given us a better understanding of our preparedness to fight highly infectious illnesses When the epidemic hit rapid diagnostic test kits and PCR testing were vital instruments for prompt diagnosis But these instruments have limits PCR testing are difficult and costly whereas fast diagnostic test kits are less accurate In this context a team led by Professor Young Min Song of the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea recently created a novel optical microscope approach to view viruses The Gires Tournois immunoassay platform is described in depth in a recent paper GTIP This article was published in Advanced Materials on March Slow light is an optical phenomena that occurs when three layers of particular materials are layered together The colour of the platform seems uniform because incoming light bounces inside the resonant layers before being reflected However nanometer sized virus particles delay the light reflected around them affecting the resonance frequency of GTIP By using a microscope the viral particle clusters appear as islands of a different hue than the backdrop Using colorimetric analysis techniques the researchers could successfully measure the quantity of virus particles present in different parts of a sample based on the colour of the light reflected locally
