Chandigarh: The recent Right to Information (RTI) applications seeking details of Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann’s air travel expenses have been denied due to “security” reasons.
The last time the state had responded to the RTI query on this issue was in the month of April this year when it was revealed by the department of civil aviation that it received the bills to the tune of Rs. 44.85 Lakh on the pretext of aircraft hired to ferry Mann to Gujarat between April 1 and April 3.
During these three days, he along with AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a road show in Ahmedabad and also participated in the party's public meetings.  
RTI reply, filed by Bathinda-based Harmilap Singh Grewal, further revealed that Mann too had travelled to neighbouring Himachal Pradesh on April 6, where, as per media reports, he held a road show along with Kejriwal in Mandi.
“For that visit, he used a Punjab government-owned helicopter. But the expenses incurred on the individual visit could not be ascertained,” the department added.
In a separate RTI filed by Bathinda-based resident Sanjeev Goyal, Punjab spends close to 8 Lakh per month only on the maintenance of the helicopter it purchased for Rs 38 crore during SAD-BJP rule in 2016. 
In March this year, expenditure on the state-owned helicopter was Rs 73 Lakh of which Rs 55 was spent between March 15 and March 19. 
Mann had taken oath as Chief Minister on March 16.
Following his Gujarat and Himachal visit, Mann travelled to Himachal as many as five times on June 11, July 12, August 25, August 31 and September 9.
Two different RTIs - filed by journalist Ashwani Chawla and RTI activist Manik Goyal - sought Mann's travel expenses details of visits to other states ever since he took over as chief minister in March.
