An experimental in Dyarchy and it's failure continues.....

When I took over as Prime Minister, the young Yuvraj was confined to bed with a bone fracture. He was under the treatment 
of Colonel Mirajkar, a well-known surgeon of Lahore. The treatment did not bring about any improvement in the condition of the Yuvraj. I approached Sardar Patel for advice in this matter and he advised me that the Yuvraj should be sent to the United States for treatment to a bone specialist. I then requested him to arrange for a special plane for his flight. 

To avoid the Pakistanis making a
grab for him, the plane should not land at Karachi. This was so arranged with the Pan American Airlines. When I broached the subject to the Maharaja and the Maharani, they did not react favourably to it. They did not want to send away their only so to a foreign country, unaccompanied by either of them. Eventually I was able to persuade them to agree to my proposal in the interests of the Yuvraj. The Yuvraj was quite enthusiastic about it. At about midnight one day, I took the Yuvraj to the aerodrome. 

Here he stayed for the night in the rest house to be ready for his flight to New Delhi next morning. The Maharani was so annoyed at this that she did not come to see him off at the aerodrome: The Maharaja came, however, and a large number of citizens of Jammu came to see off the Yuvraj and gave him a hearty send off. 

Thus the Yuvraj was flown to the United States and put in a nursing home where a specialist treated him for about a year and a half. He returned with a stiff hip joint to India long after I had left the State and had been appointed a Judge of the Federal Court of India.
