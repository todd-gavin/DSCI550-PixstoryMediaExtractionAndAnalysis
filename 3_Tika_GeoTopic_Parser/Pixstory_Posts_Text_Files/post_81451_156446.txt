With us sitting on the top of the league a regular place in the heart of our defence and a newborn baby to cherish it s no surprise that Gabriel Magalhaes is having the time of his life right now And with that being the case it was the perfect time to sit down with the Brazilian centre back for our Close Up feature Speaking candidly Gabriel said I think it s one of the best periods of my life at the moment I m learning more about life every day with everything that s happening to me When you become a father you change in many ways and I m delighted I think the first season was tough the second went better and the third is just starting now My ambition is to play in every match We know how hard it is to go through a season playing in every game but I ll try to keep taking good care of myself to help Arsenal at all times
