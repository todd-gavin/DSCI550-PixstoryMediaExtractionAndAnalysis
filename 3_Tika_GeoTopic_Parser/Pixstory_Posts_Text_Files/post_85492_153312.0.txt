Arsenal vs Liverpool. Entertaining, but one-sided in recent years. Klopp’s side have dominated this fixture in recent years, during a period of time where they were competing with City for the league title. In contrast, we’ve been rebuilding the side which is strong enough to qualify for European football.____For the first time in a long time, this fixture is favouring the Gunners. Arsenal have started well, playing the slick, intense style which Liverpool are famous for. The visitors have had an odd start to the season, and come into this game as outsiders. However, Liverpool still possess the same threat, and are fully capable of taking the 3 points.____For Arsenal, this game provides an opportunity to see how far Mikel Arteta and this team have progressed. The games against Liverpool is the perfect measurement tool to see whether we’ve closed the gap at the top. Win this, we continue our fine form. Lose, and perhaps there are mental questions to still answer.____Key battlesMartinelli vs Trent | Salah vs Zinchenko | Partey vs Fabinho | Jesus vs VVD | White vs Diaz
