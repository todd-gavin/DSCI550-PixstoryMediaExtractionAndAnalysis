Recently I cut off some very close childhood friends.
Reason: Needed to prioritize my mental health.

It’s okay to be selfish to put yourself first, after all, when you’re truly happy from inside only you can spread happiness around.

If a friend isn’t understanding your personal space and doesn’t respect your beliefs. CUT THEM OFF. It’s not okay to have such people no matter how much you love them. I LOVED my friends but I didn’t LIKE them.

Don’t normalize bullying. It’s not cool. Be kind and do good always.
