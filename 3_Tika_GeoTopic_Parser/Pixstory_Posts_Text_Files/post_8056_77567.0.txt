The international community has yet to define ‘"inclusive government," the Foreign Ministry said, saying that efforts are underway to form a government which is acceptable for the nation.

The acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Amir Khan Muttaqi, after the three-day visit to Oslo told media in a gathering in Kabul on Thursday that the international community’s call for the formation of an inclusive government is a political “excuse."

Muttaqi insisted that the current government represents all Afghan ethnic groups, and he said that the government’s cabinet has yet to be completed.

“(The international community) doesn't have a definition for an inclusive government, nor is there an example ... these are just excuses,” he said.  

“As we do not have the officials of the former government in our cabinet, this is the (rule) of the world. After (US President Joe) Biden won the election, did he appoint any officials from the Trump administration?" Muttaqi asked.  

The Islamic Emirate came to power in mid-August following the rapid collapse of the western-backed government of President Ashraf Ghani.

“It is not an inclusive government and neither is the cabinet technically prepared,” said Sayed Zakir Shah Sadat, a political analyst.  

To recognize the current Afghan government, the international community has called for the formation of an inclusive government and for the respect of the rights of women and minorities, as well as human rights generally.
