Ice Cream is without a doubt the perfect dessert ever devised by man. It’s rich and creamy, full of the flavors of summer while being made from the cold like the winter, and is perfect at any time of the year. Ice Cream can be used to make sandwiches or entire cakes, or just eaten as a scoop all on its own. National Ice Cream Day celebrates this delicious treat and all the varieties it comes in!

Ice cream has become one of the most popular dishes enjoyed by people all over the world. Therefore, it is only right that we have a date to celebrate this sweet treat, and to be able to eat as much as we want of it without feeling guilty. 

Due to the difficulty of obtaining snow in hot summer months, ice cream used to be very difficult to obtain and reserved only for those of wealth and note. Thankfully with the advances made in refrigeration technology we’re able to have ice cream any time of year!

So, what is your favourite ice cream flavour?
