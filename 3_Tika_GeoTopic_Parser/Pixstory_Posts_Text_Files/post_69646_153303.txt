The science behind Messi s perfect free kick is impressive Messi s leg when taking a free kick has an angle of degrees He plants almost his entire boot on the ground before hitting the ball giving him stability and control in the shot Then to improve his accuracy Messi arches his shoulders and chest to caress the ball hunching his body to a more compact position Tell me if you like this in notes Thankyou
