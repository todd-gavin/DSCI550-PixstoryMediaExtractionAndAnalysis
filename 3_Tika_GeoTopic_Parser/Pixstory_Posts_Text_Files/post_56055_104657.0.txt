A domestic tragedy is a tragedy in which the tragic protagonists are ordinary middle-class or working-class individuals. This subgenre contrasts with classical and Neoclassical tragedy, in which the protagonists are of kingly or aristocratic rank and their destruction is an affair of the state as well as a personal matter.

Traditionalists discussed tragedies among the elite. Domestic tragedy breaks with Aristotle's precepts, taking as its subjects merchants or citizens whose lives have less effect in the wider world.

In Britain, the first domestic tragedies were written in the English Renaissance; one of the first was Arden of Faversham (1592), depicting the murder of a bourgeois man by his unfaithful wife. Other famous examples are A Woman Killed with Kindness (1607), A Yorkshire Tragedy (1608), and The Witch of Edmonton (1621). Othello can be classified as a domestic tragedy.

Domestic tragedy faded away during the era of Restoration drama when Neoclassicism affected the stage, but it emerged again with the work of George Lillo and Sir Richard Steele in the eighteenth century.
