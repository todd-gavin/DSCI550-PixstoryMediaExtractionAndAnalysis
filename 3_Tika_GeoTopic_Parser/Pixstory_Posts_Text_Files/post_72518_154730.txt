The only director who worked with all four actors in the Bachchan family Amitabh Jaya Abhishek and Aishwarya The collaborative creative energy in Black resulted in one of the greatest performances by Mr Bachchan Recalling the experience Bhansali says Every filmmaker in India hopes to work with Amitji at least once But I do hope I can work with him again Black was a memorable experience for both of us At least it was for me and I hope he considers it among his landmark performances Because I feel what he did to the character of Debraj the tutor to the blind and deaf Michelle is beyond anything I had hoped to get from even an actor of Mr Bachchan s stature The epic filmmaker was very clear he wanted only Mr Bachchan in the role I would have shelved Black if Mr Bachchan had not agreed to do it Luckily for me he agreed almost right away He was very pleased to work with me I was of course over the moon No filmmaker in Hindi cinema can consider his career complete without working with Mr Bachchan And to think Mr Bachchan did the film for free
