Volleyball is a game that is filled with a lot of suspense and action. The league which the Volleyball Federation of India is planning to start with Eurosports and Discover Channel in May-June will democratise sport across the country, not just in rural India.

When I started my playing volleyball as a ball picker in my teenage, I played the game because there was no other sport in our village other than cricket. Besides, cricket was a very expensive game. 

My parents could not afford to buy the cricketing gear. With volleyball all you need was just a ball and the net.

I was a ‘medically unfit’ kid when I started playing the game. Seeing my interest and love for the sport, my family decided to enrol me at the Sports Authority of India hostel in Delhi.

 But I was rejected in the medical test due to colour blindness. So I went and convinced the doctor that it’s
not going to impact my game in anyway. 

I told him there was no way in which I was going to miss the ball while playing due to my disability as the volleyball is a much bigger ball than a cricket ball or a hockey ball. Eventually, he agreed seeing my passion for the sport. 

Even today, I am unable to differentiate colours. I was also an underweight for a very long time. But despite all that I am still one of the few volleyball players to play the game professionally with a foreign club—Al Sadd Club—in the Qatar league for the longest period: seven years. I signed to play for the league at a rate of Rs 1.25 lakh per month. It was also the first professional contract of my life.
