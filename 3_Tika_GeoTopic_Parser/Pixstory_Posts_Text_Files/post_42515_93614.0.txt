Episode-03 of Marvel’s web series “Moonknight” felt like a filler episode to me because this episode didn’t take the story forward and the protagonist and antagonist are still searching for the ‘Scarab.’

But this doesn’t mean that as a fan of Marvel, you will not take away anything from this episode because there were a few things that will surprise you a bit which are as follows:- 

1. The music in this episode is just marvelous and perfectly apt according to the scenes and moods in the episode.

2. How Marc, Steven, and Khonsu's chemistry developed in this episode is something to watch out for and those scenes are really good.

3. The acting of both Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke is frame perfect and you can feel their dedication to their character.

4. Either it is good or bad but as a marvel fan, I am happy that Marvel is taking risks and they are not working on the same template that they were working on for years.

I can’t tell you about the story of this episode because if I do then that will be a spoiler for you all and the fun of watching the episode will be gone.

You can watch “Moonknight” on Disney+ Hotstar.
