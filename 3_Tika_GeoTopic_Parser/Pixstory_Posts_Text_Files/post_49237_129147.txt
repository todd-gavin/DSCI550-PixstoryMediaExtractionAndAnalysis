The American music industry is dominated by a few big labels and a multitude of smaller ones The lack of diversity in music in music is simply the lack of cultural representation in the American industries America has a diverse population which means that there are many different types of music that deserve to be heard Most small labels ans individual musicians don t always have the resources or the talent to explore these types of genres so they often stick to what they know This limits the variety of music that Americans can enjoy Not to mention America s copyright laws are outdated and restrictive This means that it s hard for new bands and artists to get started because they don t have the legal protection that established artists do diversity promotes creativity and innovation When you have a wide range of musical styles available to you you re more likely to come up with new ideas that nobody has ever thought of before And honestly it just feels good to listen to something that s different than what you usually hear on the radio or in your own hometown it makes you feel alive Every group deserves to be heard We need to be more open minded
