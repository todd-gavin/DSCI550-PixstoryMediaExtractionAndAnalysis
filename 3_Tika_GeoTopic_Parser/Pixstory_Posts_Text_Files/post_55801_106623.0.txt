Australia’s most renowned thriller writer, Reilly takes his rightful place next to authors such as Lee Child and Stephen King. His novels are fast-paced, action-filled and intellectually twisting. While he was young, when he first started out, his writing – much like fine wine – has only improved with time, with three of his novels being the biggest-selling Australian titles of their year.

The Six Sacred Stones is his best novel! It is a  thriller. It is a sequel to Seven Ancient Wonders (released as Seven Deadly Wonders in the United States of America) and The Five Greatest Warriors is its sequel. The novel was released on 23 October 2007 in most bookstores in Australia (though some stores released it later on 1 November) and was released in January 2008 in the US and UK.
