Man is alive to love without love life is gloomy love is within us so the happiness of our fellow man is within us nothing breathes outside of human existence The farm of human existence from the ocean of love is intoxicating Love is an infinite sea that immerses the world and man in its vastness to see its destiny more clearly Love is the life giving song of the human soul So penetrate each other s worlds of the soul and free the chaotic world from the clutches of natural and unnatural calamities Love can give color to the human being Live with love and leave unique food for tomorrows from the manger of love Go in a hurry to the place where your mistress has stayed with a rose branch squeeze her in the warm embrace of your feelings Kiss your lover s hands prostrate on his feet give thanks for his health because he is breathing On this holy and holy day those who love each other must open the door of their hearts immediately Receive love plant the seedlings of love and affection in the field of their breasts and welcome the wind that blows you crazy Before the wind steps get up open the windows and the breath of love is refreshed O love O destiny of all the human beings of the world This loveless world the graveyard is ready it takes its heart to a strange land at every moment So let us praise love and be honest in protecting it Because without love blowing from being is humiliation The flag of love must be held high
