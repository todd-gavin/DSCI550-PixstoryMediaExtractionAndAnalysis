Rene Meulensteen said he never thought Manchester United would be "left behind" under Sir
Alex Ferguson, according to reports linking the Dutchman with a return to the club.

 Meulensteen
spent six years at Old Trafford as a coach under Ferguson during United's glory years, and a
new ESPN report claims that the 58-year-old might return to the club if Erik ten Hag is named as
the club's new manager at the end of the season, as expected.

Ten Hag will be United's fifth permanent manager since Ferguson stood down in 2013, and the
52-year-old will be entrusted with recovering the club's fortunes in order to restore United's
position at the top of English football.

If Meulensteen is enticed back to the club, he will be keen to help rebuild United. He is now an
assistant coach with the Australian national team. He confessed in an interview with the club
last year that he believed the club would never be left behind under Ferguson, despite the fact
that United have failed to win the Premier League since the great Scotsman retired after 26
years at the helm.

Meulensteen informed Manchester United on his time working with Ferguson at the club:
He brought me to United as a skills development coach, working with the youth players, then
managing the Reserves and doing individual sessions with the first team. When Carlos Queiroz
left in 2007, Mick Phelan became the new assistant manager and I became first-team coach.

When I look back on that period of my life, only great memories come in my head.

"His approach to playing entertaining, attacking football never left him and – absolutely crucially
– he was able to constantly move with the times. However, fast the game evolved with
technology, sports science and the development of the players themselves, he always managed
to keep pace with everything. There was never a chance United would be left behind."
