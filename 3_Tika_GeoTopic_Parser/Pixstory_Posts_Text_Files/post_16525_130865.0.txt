1- SUPER 30❤️❤️‍🔥

This is a biographical movie depicting the life of Anand Kumar, a mathematician who begins a program named Super 30. The movie shows the struggles that Anand had to face during his existence as a student and then as a teacher. The picture Description is super good.🔥🔥

It’s the kind of movie one sees with their family, such an inspirational journey.✅✅

“Raja ka beta hi raja kyun bnega?

Ab raja vo banega jo haqdar hoga.”

The dialogues and the exchange delivery are brilliant. Hrithik has nailed the character.🤠🤠
2- LAKSHYA🫡🫡

This one again, my favorite movie, the feeling of nationalism that this movie lights in you is incredible. The movie is breathtaking and has an amazing song placement. It does that to me.🔥🔥

Hrithik’s role is super good, the way he managed to draw both an aimless boy and a strong army leader who did everything to make his country proud. It’s astonishing.❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

3- KABHI KHUSHI KABHI GHAM

The movie we all grew up listening to, K3G. We all get Laddu, don’t we??

Hrithik’s screenplay was so brilliant in this movie that it never felt like he wasn’t in the lead.💙💙

4- ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA🍀❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

It is counted among the best films about friendship. This epic is so friendly to my heart. Since it’s release in 2011, I must have watched it about 100 times. One cannot ever get bored of this film.😍😍

ZNMD is an all-time mood film. Three friends on a holiday before one of them gets married and the movie gets a turn. The vacation turns into an excuse to look back at life once again. Heal from the past, Mend friendships and bonds, fighting the worst fears and so much more.💘💘💖

The film inspires you so much as a person and gives you an insight into life.
