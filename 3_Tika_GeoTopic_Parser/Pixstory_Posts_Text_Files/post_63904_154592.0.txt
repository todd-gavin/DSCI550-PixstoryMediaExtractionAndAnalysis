They say that Doom is playable anywhere, well it seems that it was no idle statement after all. The iconic and legendary demon slaying first person shooter Doom is now available on Windows Notepad, and on 60 FPS.
 Modder, Sam Chiet has created a fully operable version of Doom in a completely unmodified version of Notepad, joining in the several other bizarre ways that the game has been ported in years.
 
Some of the other creative ways people have modded the game include making the game playable on Twitter, a Mc Donald’s kiosk, LEGO, an ATM, a potato-powered calculator, a treadmill, and even a pregnancy test.
 
For the younger audiences or those who have not either played the game, the impact of the 1993  id Software’s game which went on to inspire three decades of first person shooter development as well as become integral to every gaming generation, directly or indirectly through its influence.
