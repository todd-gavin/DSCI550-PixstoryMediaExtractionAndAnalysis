Meditation is an ancient way of keeping our mind in check and make sure that it is not 
overburdened. It is a state of blissful awareness where you are just a witness to your thoughts and not the one experiencing them. 

Meditation is also useful if you have a medical condition, especially one that may be worsened by stress. It is not a new notion, that any physical illness might affect the mental health of the patients. 

Meditation is a great way to make sure that the patient are in high spirits, and as the mind regulates the body, it is highly likely that the body will respond more positively to the treatments, thereby increasing the chances and the timeframe of the recovery. 

With that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help people manage symptoms of conditions such as: 

Anxiety: - Meditation clears up the vagus nerve in our body, which as the research suggests is the main cause of Anxiety. 

Asthma: - Meditation focuses on conscious breathing patterns, which regulate the breath and helps the asthma patients. 

Cancer: - Active meditators are always expected to make quick recovery, as their bodies always respond positively to the treatments. 

Chronic pain: - Meditation brings calm and serenity to the mind, and calms the nerves which act as pain receptors, so it dulls out the chronic pains without any artificial pain killers. 

Depression: - Meditation clears up the negative thoughts in our mind and keeps us from spiralling down, which as the research suggests is the main cause of Depression. 

Heart disease: - Slow breathing which are essential to Meditation are directly co-related with resting heart beats, which means the more you meditate the better it is for your heart. 

High blood pressure: - When the heartbeats are calm and slow, the blood pressure would 
undoubtedly be low. 

Meditation isn't a replacement for traditional medical treatment. But it may be a useful addition to your other treatment.
