A lot of the Arsenal fanbase often respond to transfers by assuming that an ingoing should be met with an equal and opposite outgoing, perhaps a result of Wenger’s twilight years in which we became a selling club, but that is not the case, especially for elite clubs.

With Saliba returning the club and White having a more obvious role as a potential inverted RB, competition for places is more crucial than ever. Nonetheless, this should only be able to be seen as a positive with often 3 games a week and in a season with an even more condensed fixture schedule. 

Now more than ever, Arsenal’s depth is starting to look incredibly healthy. Tierney & Zinchenko offer 2 elite LB options, particularly important depth in this position considering Tierney’s injury struggles. In CB we have White, Saliba, Gabriel, Holding and potentially even Tomiyasu. These options provide slightly different dynamics but give us tactical flexibility the option to rotate to avoid burnout. 

The crux of the point is that considering the demands of modern day football we should no longer look at the strength of starting XI’s, but for how strong a squad is throughout, and it’s ability to cope during the adverse parts of season. Arsenal’s selection troubles are nothing but a good thing for the club.
