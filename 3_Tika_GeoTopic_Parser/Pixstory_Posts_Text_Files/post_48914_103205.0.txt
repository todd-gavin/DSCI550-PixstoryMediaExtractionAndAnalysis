Not long ago Daily Mail posted a tweet saying that texas school shooter was bullied at school because of the clothes he wore and because his family was poor. Which, let's be honest, is a bunch of crap. He had money to buy two military grade brand new weapons – a rifle that cost more than 2k and an optic that cost 700, and an iPhone 13 pro max. American media's tendencies to find excuses for mass murderers never fail to surprise me but I think that's our media for you all.

However, following up the same news, his senior from school, Ivan, came out to give his statement. He said, "Salvador Ramos was a boy that was not bullied. He would try to pick on people but failed and it would aggravate him. I would like to get that out of the way, he was not bullied. He prior, and I don't see this covered and i'ma put this out there– he would hurt animals. He was not a good person."

Quoting that, a tweet with 169k+ likes said, "the animal-to-human abuse pipeline is very much an actual thing and it’s the first early sign of serial killers. when there is lacking empathy for a living thing, something is wrong and it needs to be confronted immediately just a tip."

Another said, "They've said this so many times it starts with animals. Hurting innocent creatures for fun is not normal, people don't grow out of it. It's not a phase."

"i feel like people might keep turning a blind eye because of hunting, like it's seen as this sport that people engage in and it's just killing animals for fun and so when a kid kills animals for fun especially if they belong to this kind of culture or society, people ignore it" says another user.

"Ted Bundy and Richard Ramirez started with animals, Jeffrey Dahmer too."

It is believed there's a big correlation between how one treats animals and how they treat humans. While not all animal abuser become human murderers, but it's an early sign of such tendencies.
