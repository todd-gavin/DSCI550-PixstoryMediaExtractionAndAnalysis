Marcell Jacobs returns to run and win The Olympic champion of the meters did it tonight at the Berlin indoor meeting on the meters He won the final with the time of closing just hundredths from the Italian record and doing better than Arthur Ciss the athlete who arrived right in front of Jacobs a year ago The return to the track a good start and represents his second best career performance on meters There was a lot of tension in the race six months without competing there are many, he said at the end of the race to Rai Sport The tension that I suffered in the heats didn&#39;t let me find good sensations which I found instead in the final Time not bad but I can still improve a lot this year
