PEERS Programme for Emerging Artistic Researchers 2023/24

ZHdK Zürcher Hochschule der Künste

PEERS is a new pre-PhD programme of the Department of Performing Arts and Film at Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK). Its main aim is to support emerging artistic researchers who are interested in pursuing a doctorate in the arts, foremost yet not exclusively in the performing arts and film. For a period of one year, starting in March 2023, participants will be offered the opportunity to benefit from an intensive mentoring and training programme. They will become part of the vibrant research environment at ZHdK (such as lab-practice, colloquia, symposia, research academy), and will gain access to the University's outstanding infrastructure and relevant professional networks. Participants will also benefit from peer-to-peer learning in the Junior Research Group and will receive tailored support aimed at promoting their individual development. They will be assisted in developing their individual research plan, as well as in searching and applying for artistic PhD programmes at ZHdK and beyond.

Application Deadline: 30 September 2022
