Real Madrid are confident that they will manage to reach an agreement to sign Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer this summer. However, to see Mbappe don the Los Blancos shirt next season, the club need to strike a deal with the star and his family, who are negotiating the terms of a potential agreement.

Mbappe wants to play for Real Madrid, but the two parties will be called to reach an agreement on his image rights, as Los Blancos usually own 50 percent of their players' image rights.

Mbappe is now earning 21 million euros per season and, as MARCA has reported, he has already turned down PSG's two-year contract renewal offer.

To be able to offer Mbappe a yearly salary of 25m euros, Real Madrid may have to give up a little more than half of his image rights.

Mbappe has already signed a lucrative deal with Nike and he has also been confirmed as the face of EA Sports' FIFA for the second consecutive year.

Meanwhile, he has agreements with Good Gout, a brand of organic food products for kids which had a turnover of around 18m euros in 2020, as well as Bulk, a Japanese brand of beauty products, and Swiss luxury watchmakers Hublot.

As MARCA reported last week, Mbappe's mother had asked to receive a percentage of his Real Madrid shirt sales in the event he agrees to join Los Blancos.

It should be noted that only Mohamed Salah, Robert Lewandowski, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi sold more shirts than the France international in 2021.
