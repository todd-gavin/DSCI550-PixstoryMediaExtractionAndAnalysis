The transition from high school to college is an important phase for adolescents in social as well as academic aspects While your high school friends were probably in your class or sports team you probably meet your college friends in a different way But what if you have the same best friend who accompanied you from school to college Isn t it the best thing ever On my personal experience I got my best friend who is always by my side since we were in high school She s really the best Sometimes she gets jealous of my other new friends but that s okay to me as she loves me so much I love her as well She is my constant Hope so our friendship never dies and grows better in upcoming years
