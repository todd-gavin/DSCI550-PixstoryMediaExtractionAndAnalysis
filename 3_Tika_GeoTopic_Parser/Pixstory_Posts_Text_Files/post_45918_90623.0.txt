Most of the times (if not all) people utter “no offence” before cracking a joke, it’s not to hide behind the phrase. It’s to safeguard themselves because stand up comedians realise how intolerant people are. But it seems that this phrase should be a disclaimer to every joke because people are now resorting to physical violence if they don’t like a joke. (Yes, I am referring to THAT Oscars incident)

The inherent part of the profession of stand up comedy is entertain people, make people laugh and crack jokes. Now, jokes are subjective. You may not like some of them and it’s okay. But that doesn’t mean you go around attacking people who made the joke. 

“Comedies are meant to entertain the audience; without hurting any single one of them. If it's possible go on.”- I disagree with this statement vehemently. 
 If say tomorrow that making jokes on certain topic hurts me, will comedians stop doing so? 
Different people have different sensitivities and if stand up comedians start to take ALL of them into account, it won’t be a profession anymore. 

Yes, you can be critical of certain jokes but we as audience have absolutely no authority to attack or question someone’s work ethics over this. 

Rather, learn to take a joke and liven up a little!
