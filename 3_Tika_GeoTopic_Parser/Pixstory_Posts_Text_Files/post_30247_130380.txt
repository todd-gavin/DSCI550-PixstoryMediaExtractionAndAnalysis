Napoli continues to impress at the start of the championship and after the home game against Monza the coach Luciano Spalletti can only congratulate his players The team played a very good game and commanded the game right away At the start we were unable to take advantage of a few episodes we were up against a tough opponent We were superior but it wasn&#39;t an easy game Stroppa knows how to make Monza play well I&#39;m happy that we kept our balance on counterattacks even when we were ahead The cover man for this first phase of the championship is certainly the Georgian Khvicha Kvaratskhelia scorer of two goals which adds to his debut goal against Verona a footballer with excellent qualities a great professional and a good boy He kicks with his right and left foot but he still has to loosen up he was still very tense he feels his new job too much Do you know of having to give satisfaction to a demanding public like this feels a lot of this responsibility But I hope you find the right peace of mind as soon as possible
