Are you tracking your cervical mucus
(CM) aka HooHaa Glitter!?

In a healthy cycle CM changes with the cycling hormones alerting you to ovulation. If you aren't seeing any CM or you are only seeing one type like creamy, something is up!

* Here is an example of a CM pattern in a healthy cycle:

Sticky or creamy -> egg white/ slippery & clear ->
creamy or sticky

Not everyone has stretchy egg white, that's okay, slippery & clear is still peak fertile mucus that preps sperm & helps it get to the egg.

Ovulation happens on the last day of fertile CM about 80% of the time so it's a great way to time intimacy when TTC!

Follow these tips for an improvement in the cervical mucus: 

1) Hydrate! Water & electrolytes are important for
hydration. Aim to drink half of your body weight (lbs) in
ounces each day while including potassium, sodium, and magnesium rich foods and beverages.

2) Gut Health. Support a happy gut by eating 30+g of fiber daily. Work up to this slowly while increasing hydration.

3) Nutrients. Nutrition supports cervical mucus production too! Focus on nutrient dense foods like animal protein, healthy fats, fatty fish and colorful produce.

4) Hormone Balance. Happy hormones support healthy
cervical mucus. Stress management & improving sleep
quality can be game changers!
