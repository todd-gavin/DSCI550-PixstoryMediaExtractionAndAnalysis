As per NASA TV Asteroid Bennu s boulder covered surface gives it protection against small meteoroid impacts according to observations of craters by NASA s OSIRIS REx Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer spacecraft These observations give new insight into how asteroids like Bennu respond to energetic impacts said Edward Beau Bierhaus of Lockheed Martin Space Littleton Colorado lead author of a paper published in this month s issue of Nature Geoscience Bennu is a rubble pile asteroid meaning that it formed from the debris of a much larger asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient impact Fragments from the collision coalesced under their own weak gravity to form Bennu The team used unprecedented high resolution global data sets to examine craters on Bennu images from the OSIRIS REx Camera Suite and surface height data topography derived from the OSIRIS REx Laser Altimeter a laser ranging lidar instrument on the spacecraft Measuring craters and their population on Bennu was exceptionally exciting said David Trang of the University of Hawaii at M noa Honolulu a co author of the paper At Bennu we discovered something unique to small and rocky bodies which expanded our knowledge of impacts
