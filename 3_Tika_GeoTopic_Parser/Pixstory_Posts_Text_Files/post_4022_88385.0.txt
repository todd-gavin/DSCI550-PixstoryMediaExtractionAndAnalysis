Happiness for all of us comes in different forms. For some of us it maybe through watching the movie we have been eagerly waiting for or to take some break and have some me time or to try out that adventure in your bucket list or spending time with your friends or family. 

Happiness is very subjective for all of us and we enjoy it in our own ways. So for this International day of happiness make sure that you do something that makes you happy maybe by having a biryani or through art, music or dance therapy. 

Enjoy the day ðŸ¥³ðŸ’œ
