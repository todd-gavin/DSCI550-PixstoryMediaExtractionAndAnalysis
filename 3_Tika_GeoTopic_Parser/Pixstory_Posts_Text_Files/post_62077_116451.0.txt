Anything can happen in football. 

A few years ago, if you'd have said to your mate that Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos would become teammates and that Barcelona's record goalscorer would let a Real Madrid legend take a penalty then they would have told you where to go.

But that is the bizarre and unexpected reality we are in, with the pair going from long-time rivals to colleagues at Paris Saint-Germain after both joined on free transfers last summer.

The Ligue One champions returned to action on Friday with a friendly against Ligue 2 outfit Quevilly-Rouen and both Messi and Ramos started the first game under new manager Christophe Galtier.

And the opening saw Messi win a penalty after being fouled inside the area. But instead of stepping up from 12 yards as we've seen him do for club and country he let Ramos, a reliable penalty taker, assume the honours.

Ramos took care of the business and stuck it in. 

A truly bizarre scenario for sure
