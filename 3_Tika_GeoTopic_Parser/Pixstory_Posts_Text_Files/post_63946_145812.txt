 Japanese rock band One OK Rock have come out with their tenth studio album titled Luxury Disease and this album has been definitely a somewhat return to form Over the years the J rock band lost their rock attitude almost completely trading it for a much more commercial power pop sound Luxury Disease is definitely a rock album no doubts about it though it is still somewhat lacking Particularly more so as it feels more like a Simple Plan album with some post grunge elements rather than a One Ok Rock album carrying a strong commercial pop overtone combined with a very Westernized sound On the surface for someone who does not know that One Ok Rock is a Japanese band they d certainly think that is your typical American power pop or pop rock band because that is what the J rock sensations have become Sonically while a somewhat return to form the sound is about as generic as it gets with little efforts at sounding new However at the same time Luxury Disease packs in a good sense of melody with a lot of catchy hooks which is enough to get the attention of the listener and keep them occupied at least for a while Though the generic tone does eventually start to drag on and get a bit boring as there really is not a whole lot going around here Even more so the lack of Japanese really does not do the group a whole lot of service Nonetheless this is definitely not a bad album as there are some really good tracks here such as Save Yourself Vandalize So Far Gone Free Them etc though on the whole there is little variety here and that is indeed a shame Overall a step in the right direction this is definitely far better than their previous effort Eye Of The Storm and if they progress more in this direction One Ok Rock may get back to their original sound which was as much American rock as it was their own signature sound which was simple yet diverse Score
