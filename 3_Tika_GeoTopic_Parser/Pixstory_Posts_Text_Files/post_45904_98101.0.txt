With events every day, UWSP began off a week of commemorating Native American education and culture. 

All of this is part of Native American Awareness Week, which takes place from May 2 to 7. On Monday, there was an Acknowledgement ceremony. 

Waow reported that on Monday, the American Indians Reaching for Opportunities ('AIRO') group celebrated their 50th anniversary. The ceremony's invocation began with a prayer spoken in Hochunk by AIRO alum Allen Cloud. 

Members of AIRO stated the group's presence on campus meant a lot to them because it promotes awareness and understanding of indigenous people.

â€œIt's always been a part of why I wanted to come to Stevens Point, cause I knew they had a spot where I could feel at home away from home." said Nita Alloway, a freshman at UWSP and AIRO member.
