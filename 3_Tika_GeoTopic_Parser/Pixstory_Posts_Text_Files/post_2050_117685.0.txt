The New York bodega owner who fatally stabbed a man who rushed him from behind the counter, cornered him, and yelled and threatened him with a knife recently had murder charges against him dropped by the Manhattan district attorney because they were unable to prove that he did not act in self-defense. 

It was obvious that he acted in self-defense. If you've seen the video, you would have seen that the man went behind the counter and cornered the owner in a space barely bigger than an arm's span. The elderly bodega owner was pushed to the ground by a young, fit, and enraged individual, and he was unable to flee. When the owner was able to momentarily escape past the individual, he was still held by the man from behind. It would be unfair to expect someone to presume the best of a criminal under that circumstance. In any event, we don't even need to reach that point; the sheer fact that the man stormed behind the counter should be sufficient justification for the use of deadly force. 

The fact that the bodega owner was arrested and held on a very high bond demonstrates how far far-left prosecutors are prepared to go to advance their agendas, including seeking to imprison people for life in the name of politics.
