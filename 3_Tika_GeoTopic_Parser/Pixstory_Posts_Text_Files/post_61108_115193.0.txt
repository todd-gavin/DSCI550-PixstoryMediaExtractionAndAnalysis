Chur chur naan is an oval-shaped Indian bread that is fluffy and delicious. Chur Chur naan is vastly popular it almost tastes like heaven with Punjabi chole or buttery Dal Makhani. 
If you wanna eat best chur chur naan then you should visit this place for sure.
I Ordered their famous Amritsari Chur Chur Naan with Dal makhni. The taste was decent. The chur chur Naan was flaky and buttery. The filling inside tasted good too. I also asked for the imli ki chutney(tamarind chutney) along with the Naan which accompanied it pretty well. The restaurant has a decent seating area and the staff was responsive too.
