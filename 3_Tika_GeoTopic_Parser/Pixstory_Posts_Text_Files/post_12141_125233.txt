Raksha means safety and Bandhan means bond so how accurately defined as the safety bond between brothers and sisters Interestingly this festival isn t limited to a female tying thread to a male anymore Even sisters who don t have brothers have started celebrating the festival by tying rakhi on each other s hands and promising love and safety always It is important for parents to make the siblings understand the importance of celebrating these festivals in full fervour and never to let its spirit die down So that even long after they are gone the siblings maintain the bond and the preciousness of the festival
