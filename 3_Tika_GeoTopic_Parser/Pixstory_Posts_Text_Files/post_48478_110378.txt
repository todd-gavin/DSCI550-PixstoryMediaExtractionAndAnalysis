While calling another woman words like that is wrong the message behind it is actually right Sex was created by God to be experienced in the context of a committed married partnership between one man and one woman Taking it out of that context distorts its meaning and drastically limits its enjoyment Sexual intercourse entails a level of intimacy not found in any other type of human relationship God formed the one flesh relationship between Adam and Eve when they married A man will leave his family join his bride and become one flesh with her according to Genesis In a sexual relationship there is a level of vulnerability that should only be experienced in a committed trusting marriage The belief that because the couple will almost certainly marry there is no harm in having marital relations now This demonstrates impatience and disrespect for oneself as well as the other person It takes the relationship s unique nature out of its proper context undermining the notion that there is one at all If we tolerate this behaviour it won t be long before we embrace any form of extramarital sex Telling a potential mate that they re worth waiting for deepens the bond and increases the amount of commitment When we participate in casual sex what happens to us We leave a piece of ourselves behind every time we end a sexual connection The longer we are in a relationship the more we leave behind and the more of ourselves we lose We continue to lose a small part of ourselves as we move from partner to partner and we may eventually lose our ability to build a lasting sexual relationship The sexual relationship is so powerful and intimate that we cannot join it casually no matter how simple it appears And it causes too many unwanted pregnancies that can easily be avoided
