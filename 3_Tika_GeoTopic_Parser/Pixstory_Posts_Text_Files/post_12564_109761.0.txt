* Teach young boys to open up about their
emotions instead of saying "be a man"
• Avoid showing media that perpetrates the
stereotypes of manly men' and toxic masculinity
• Show that asking for help shows strength and not weakness
• Stop Shaming Men for showing emotions

One of the missions for men's mental health month is destigmatizing men's mental health. We need to show men that it is strong to show emotion, ask for help, and be vulnerable. 

Society paints a picture that these things mean weakness, however, let's abolish these stereotypes and move towards equitable mental health for everyone.
