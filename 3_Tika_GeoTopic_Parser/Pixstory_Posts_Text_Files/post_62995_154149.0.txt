In the midst of the continuous upheaval in the nation, protestors hacked Iran's state-run broadcaster on Saturday, interrupting live coverage to show an anti-government message. A message that appeared on screen during the program read, "The blood of our youth is on your hands."
This was in response to the killing of Mahsa Amini, a 22 year old Iranian girl who was beaten to death for not wearing a hijab.
Anti-government demonstrators briefly hacked the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network (IRINN) under Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) newscast at 9 p.m., according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim News Agency. The Assembly of Bushehr, in the southern Iranian city of Bushehr, was being aired when the hack occurred. The hack was attributed to the hacktivist group Edalat-e Ali (Ali's Justice), who put the message "Join us and rise up" to the upper right corner of the screen.
