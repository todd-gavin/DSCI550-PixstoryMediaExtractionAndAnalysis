Once you get your verdict, the story does not end there—although Part 1 of Mission Study Abroad is over. Now, you have to sort out the funding, accommodation and the living expenses. “Where will it come from? How will it come from? Will I be able to deal with the aftermath?” were the questions that would pop in my head a lot. But with the grace of my lord and the love and support of my family, things shaped up!
My parents are the most supportive parents one could ever get—I am beyond grateful to them and all I want is to give a great life to them and sometimes words just don’t come out. I have seen their struggle and it hurts me that they had to go through to give flight to my dreams.
Support and love is vital in this process but it is also draining as it is you, you and only you who has to gather all the pieces of the puzzle (aka your application). And while doing so, you can be your worst critic and believe me, it could be demoralising. I have had episodes of extreme mood swings wherein I’d get depressed looking at my marksheets and my I would be scrutinising my own resume.
I’d put self-doubt in myself and it was something very hard to snap out of but thanks to good friends in my corner, who have been where I was, and just like that… they made me stronger… all day, every day. All they said were the three words: “YOU GOT THIS.
So, the application was submitted, got an acceptance, booked an accommodation, shopped for the winter—you know the sexy overcoats that I will just look fucking fabulous in. And then, come my birthday, I get the news of the scholarship. Tears of joy came down; it was everything I worked for. The pain, the struggle and the blood with tons of sweat—it was all worth it!
