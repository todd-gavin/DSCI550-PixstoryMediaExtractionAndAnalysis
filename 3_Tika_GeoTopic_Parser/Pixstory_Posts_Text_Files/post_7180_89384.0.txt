Since most of what I have recounted was based on memory, I needed hard facts to beef 
up the stories. While researching, I had to reconnect with police officers at all levels 
from Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Gujarat and the CBI. Their response and support were 
always spontaneous and refreshing. Part of the joy in putting together this book was 
speaking with them and feeling the abiding bonds of police fraternity and its espirit de 
corps that surmount time, age and retirement. I owe a debt of gratitude to Rakesh Maria, 
KMM Prasanna and Senior Inspector Sandbhor of the Mumbai police; Sudhir Sinha of 
Gujarat Police; Rajeev Kumar of Kolkata Police; ACP (Retired) Prithvi Singh, Inspector 
Ishwar Singh of Delhi Police, Virendra Singh (formerly a close colleague in the CBI and 
now in Income Tax department), Raman Tyagi, Ajay Bassi, MC Sahni, VS Shukla, DS 
Shukla of the CBI and countless others who helped me in my research for the book. If I 
have missed out someone, I apologize in advance.

A big thank you to Haripad N. Ravi Kumar, my Personal Assistant from my C.B.I. days 
and to Inspector Khurshid Ali, member of my personal staff in Delhi Police, for rendering me the secretarial help I desperately needed.

I wish to thank the C.B.I. of the years of my tenure, my bosses and, most of all, members of my team, who worked alongside me during the operations on which stories that follow are based. I owe the success of these missions equally to my superiors and subordinates in the C.B.I.

Last but not least, a big hug to my dear wife Mala who sacrificed several hours of our 
being together to let me write and made do with watching ‘Zindagi’ channel.
