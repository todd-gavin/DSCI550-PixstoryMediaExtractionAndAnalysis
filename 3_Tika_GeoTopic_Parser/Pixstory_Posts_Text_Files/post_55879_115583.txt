Recently the New York Times released a poll conducted by Siena College that revealed half of the Republican voters are ready to leave Trump behind So this is a very statement from the voters that even if he stands in the elections there are low chances for him to win Multiple polls over the past year have shown him near or below percent in the undeveloped Republican field Trump s strongest opponent in these polls is Florida Gov Ron DeSantis R But coming into Trump was endorsed by only about a third of the Republican electorate That backing thrived as his nomination became more unavoidable and opponents dropped out There s an important discrepancy between indifference to Trump now and fervent opposition to Trump in April Not every voter who supports someone besides Trump or DeSantis now will slot into DeSantis s column later Cheney and the House select committee could damage Trump s standing simply by weakening him and it would be better without the nominee having the baggage of attempting to overturn a valid democratic election Polling shows that there has been a deterioration in support for Trump since the Jan hearings began last month but not really among Republicans YouGov s weekly polls for the Economist show that the percentage of independents who view Trump favorably fell from percent at the beginning of the hearings to percent in the most recent survey conducted after the explosive testimony from former White House staffer Cassidy Hutchinson Among Republicans there was a brief dip in the percentage of those who viewed Trump very favorably but we know Republicans are Trump fans forever Source The Washington Post
