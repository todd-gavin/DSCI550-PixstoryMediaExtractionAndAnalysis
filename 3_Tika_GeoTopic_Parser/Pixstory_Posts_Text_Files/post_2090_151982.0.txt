Democrat Stacey Abrams recently lost her case against Georgia where she alleged the Georgia was violating the U.S. constitution and the Voting Rights Act with the infamous, and wrongly dubbed, “Jim Crowe in the 21st Century” voting law.To make matters even more embarrassing for Abrams and the democrats, the judge was appointed by Obama. In his 288-page long opinion, the judge stated, “Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the VRA.”Despite all the misleading headlines about the law, the mass media coverage alleging it’s racist purpose, and the celebrities and sports leagues pulling events out of Georgia as a result of it, the law did not have any discriminatory effect nor did it even have any language. In fact, after the law was passed, Georgia saw a record number of voters voting during the election - including seeing a 22% jump in African American voters.
