Covid has decimated several Serie A teams forced to play with important absences in the last period One of these is Udinese which through its technical director Pierpaolo Marino has returned to talk about the topic with particular reference to the heavy defeat against Atalanta last week for E the decision to let us play with Atalanta for other teams was incomprehensible it was decided to postpone Marino said to the microphones of Radio Anch io We expect justice to be done in this match Our controversy obviously does not concern Atalanta but who made us play Udinese&#39;s standings radically changed for the worse in recent weeks Also to blame, as mentioned, for absences due to the virus And when asked if the Bianconeri&#39;s championship is distorted, director Marino replied Of course we found ourselves a month after Cagliari&#39;s victory in terms of standings very different we have to mend the wounds I hope the new protocol will help to avoid these disparities
