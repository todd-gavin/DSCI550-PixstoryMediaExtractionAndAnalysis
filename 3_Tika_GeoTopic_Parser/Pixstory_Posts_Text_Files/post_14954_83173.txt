Colorful and fresh, the spritz cocktail symbol of Italian aperitifs started from the Triveneto area to conquer the whole peninsula and become a real philosophy of life. From an idea of Filippo Bosio and Marina de Bertoldi, the ORANGE SPRITZ BAR was born in the heart of Milan, the first spritz bar in the center of the nightlife of Porta Venezia in via Tadino It offers different types of spritz in various formats combining classic liqueurs with prosecco bubbles strictly on tap as per tradition A room that develops in depth dominated by a glass window surrounded by orange LEDs which acts as counterbalanced by a 1990s-style counter A ceiling dotted with small reddish lamps that recall the shape of the glass used for spritz Wine top quality liqueurs and toppings A great desire to create but always respecting tradition this is my vision of the ORANGE SPRITZ BAR says the Founder and CEO Filippo Bosio Each spritz is embellished with a particular garnish and different flavors of soda c Laguna Blu with cura ao Pinky with passion fruit liqueur Milano with cynar China Mon Amour with china martini and many others to discover The wide selection also allows you to always assemble new spritzes at the request of customers In addition to the spritzes, traditional cocktails are also available The internal kitchen prepares toasted sandwiches and pizzas cooked on refractory stone in the oven Just like in a New York caf√© in the new spritzeria di Milano Spritz can be ordered in different formats starting from euros My father from Veneto of Austrian origins and has always been passionate about liqueurs says Filippo Bosio I liked the idea of recovering his passions by mixing tradition and innovation Marina and I who work in the world of fashion we were inspired by the glamor of disco clubs years exclusive and inclusive at the same time And what Spritz are you from me classic classic and always great classic
