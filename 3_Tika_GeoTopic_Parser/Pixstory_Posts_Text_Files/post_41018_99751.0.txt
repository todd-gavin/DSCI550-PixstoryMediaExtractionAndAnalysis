Hollywood Reporter said that Disney once again beat Wall Street expectations last quarter in streaming, adding 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers, and suggesting that the company may be positioned to take a lead in what has become a cutthroat race to the top in streaming.

While Wall Street expectations for Disney+ were varied, a midpoint expectation was 4.5 million to 5 million adds.

Disney reported revenue of $19.2 billion and income of $3.7 billion, with earnings per share of $1.08. Wall Street expectations were for revenue of $20.1 billion, operating income of $3.3 billion, and EPS of $1.17. The EPS miss could be due to a change in tax regulations, which saw the company’s effective tax rate balloon from 8.8 percent a year ago to 45.8 percent last quarter. Disney also took a $1 billion hit related to ending content licensing agreements early that it could use it on its own streaming service. Disney didn’t break out what that programming was, but it is likely the output deal with Netflix, including the streaming services’ Marvel series.
