There are many things we can do to protect the environment.
We can reduce, reuse, and recycle materials. The simple act of reusing things you already have instead of buying new things would not only save the environment from wasteful consumerism, but also save your money.
We can also be mindful of the way we use resources. 
Try to understand from where and how the product or service comes to you and whether the product is actually justified by the need or the process.
We can slowly cut back on our consumption and be more efficient in how we use resources. A sudden change is not easy to adapt to, however, if we ease into a sustainable lifestyle, it would be helpful in the long run.
 You could start small by reusing old cloth and plastic bags, and then slowly you could move on to reusable items such as bottles, boxes and quit single-time use bottles, boxes, etc.
And finally, we can proper family planning to help reduce our population growth. We are quickly depleting the resources that we have on this planet so we need to think through them with care.
