In the first 20 games of the season, Steph Curry looked like he was on the path to a near unanimous MVP campaign. However, Stephâ€™s recent slump has resulted in a drop from No. 1 in Kia MVP Ladder to not even making the top 5. In his last 22 games, Steph is averaging 24.4 PTS, 5.0 REB, 5.4 AST on 38.5%-35.1%-90.1% shooting splits. This brings his FG% and 3P% to a career low excluding his 5-game injury season in 2019-2020.

Kevin Durant is also part of the MVP conversation averaging 29.3 PTS, 7.4 REB, 5.8 AST on 52%-37.2%-89.4% shooting splits. He is leading the league in scoring and currently the Brooklyn Nets are the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. However, on Jan 16th Kevin Durant was diagnosed with a sprained MCL in his left knee and will return in 4-6 weeks which does hurt his MVP case unfortunately.

Nikola Jokic is having one of the greatest statistical seasons in NBA history. Jokic is averaging 25.6 PTS, 13.9 REB, 7.4 AST on 56.9%-36.7%-78.9% shooting splits. Jokic has a PER of 32.9 which is not only a career-high, but it is the highest PER by any player in NBA history and the only reason he is not no. 1 in the race is because of Denver being only the 6th seed in the Western Conference due to injuries to Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.

In my opinion the frontrunner for the MVP currently is Giannis Antetokounmpo as he is averaging 28.6 PTS, 11.3 REB, 6.1 AST, 1.5 BLKS on 53.3%-28.8%-71.6% shooting splits. Ignoring voter fatigue, Giannis has been dominant as usual this season on both ends of the floor and is currently one of the favorites to win the Defensive Player of the Year award. While the Bucks are the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference due to battling various injuries from Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez this season, there is no denying that Giannis is having yet another MVP caliber season.
