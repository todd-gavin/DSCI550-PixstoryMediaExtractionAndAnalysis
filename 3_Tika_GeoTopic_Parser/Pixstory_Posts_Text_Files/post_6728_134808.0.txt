A video of a woman walking out of a temple while accompanied by a man is widely circulating on social media. In the clip, the pair get out of the temple and sit on a bike and start to leave, during which the woman’s dupatta gets stuck in one of the bike’s wheels. Seeing the woman in distress, a Muslim passerby hands over her burqa to help the lady cover up herself. Social media users have been amplifying this as a real incident.
A user named Zafar Saifi made the same claim while tweeting the video. It racked up more than 1.6 lakh views at the time of writing. Several hours after multiple users questioned the authenticity of the video, Zafar tweeted that though he didn’t know if the video was original or scripted, it had a positive message.

A similar clip is widespread on Twitter and Facebook.
Fact-check
Alt News has already fact-checked a number of CCTV videos that have gone viral with various claims from time to time. There were many characteristics in this video which made us suspect that it was scripted. For example, the picture quality of the CCTV footage is unusually high, whereas CCTV footage usually is of a much lower resolution. The recording template and sound effects in this video are also similar to scripted videos that Alt News has investigated before. 
Using these clues, we examined the YouTube channel ‘3RD EYE’, which regularly posts scripted videos to spread awareness.
