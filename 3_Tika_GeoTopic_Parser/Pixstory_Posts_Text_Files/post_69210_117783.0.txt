Every football Coach and Manager has a certain philosophy that they adhere to while coaching their team for play . It gets tweaked a little here and a little there with the opposition's tactics but the mainframe always remains the same. The top managers are always associated with theirs, Pep Guardiola with the Possession style, Klopp with the Gegenpressing style, Jose Mourinho with a counter-attacking defensive style and so on.

I employ possession based football in my teams and tweak the tactics depending upon the strategy that the opposition team uses. I insist that my teams play attacking football and always move the ball up the field. I've come to the realisation that even the players that I coached started to love playing this attacking style of football rather than just sitting back in their own half and waiting to counter attack. I tell my team to defend from the front that is that the forwards and the midfield have to apply pressure on the opposition defence to win the ball in the other half. The playing style of my team also depends on the quality of the players that I have at my disposal. I usually set up my teams in 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formations. These days I've been using the 4-4-2 formation. These completely depend on the team I'm coaching and what will suit the players of that team and make them play at their best.
