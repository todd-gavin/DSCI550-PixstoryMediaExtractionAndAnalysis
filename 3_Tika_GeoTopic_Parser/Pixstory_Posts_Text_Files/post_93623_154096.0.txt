Arsenal come out victorious.A 3-2 win at home against Liverpool.Arsenal have been elite. The press, the positional play, the build-up, you name it.Saka deserves that. He's an elite attacker - few players are as complete as he is.He toasts his man with ease in 1v1's on the inside and outside, dictates attacks creatively, rarely gives the ball away, makes threatening runs to score goals, has two feet.Elite. No other word.
