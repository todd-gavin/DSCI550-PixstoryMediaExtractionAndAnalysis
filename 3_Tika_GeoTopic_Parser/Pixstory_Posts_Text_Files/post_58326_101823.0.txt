Vaccination , a word been popularised since COVID-19 has entered our lives .

But it's not the only disease which has been controlled with the use of vaccination , many infectious and hazardous disease , namely
• POLIO
• TETANUS
• FLU (Influenza) 
• HEPATITIS B
• HEPATITIS A
• RUBELLA
• MEASLES
• WHOOPING COUGH(PERTUSSIS)
And more such diseases.

But when we think of the how vaccination works?

Then the answer is hidden in a simple concept which can be simply explained!

Have you heared of chicken pox , if yes then you also had heared that it occur only once in lifetime , have you wondered why?

Because when there's one time attack , the body fights back and immune itself by producing antibodies which protect body by getting diseased second time.

This is the same concept used in vaccination .

In vaccination , weakend microbe is injected in body which triggers body's  immune system and therefore make body to produce antibodies against the microbes.

Due to weakened microbe, there can be low level reaction of body , causing some symptoms to appear, but doesn't affect body too much .

But on actual encounter with microbes , body already is immuned to it and has antibodies which will fight the microbe and won't let it affect the body.

And that's how it is for COVID-19 , in vaccination , weakened corona virus is inserted in body , which makes it immune for any encounter with virus.

So that's the need for vaccination, get vaccinated! If you're not.

Hope you understood what vaccination is!
