A 60-year-old daily wage labourer from Kerala is making waves online with his swish makeover. Mammikka, who belongs to Kerala's Kozhikode district, traded his faded lungi and shirt for a suit and sunglasses while posing for a local brand. Pics from the photo shoot, captured by photographer Shareek Vayalil, have gone viral online, with thousands of people complimenting the newly-minted model, NDTV reported. 

 Mammikka owes his newfound fame to photographer Shareek Vayalil. According to Manorama News, a leading Malayalam news channel, Shareek had taken a photo of Mammikka and posted it on his Facebook page earlier. The photo went viral for the labourer's resemblance to South Indian actor Vinayakan. 

Soon afterwards, Shareek asked Mammikka to model for a wedding suit company he owned. Before the photo shoot, the 60-year-old underwent a makeover which was captured in a video that has been watched by thousands of people on Instagram. The video has racked up over 23,000 views since being shared last week.
