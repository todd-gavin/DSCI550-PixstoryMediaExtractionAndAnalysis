How I Met Your Mother was the talk of the town as a sitcom because it had such a unique format as the show. 

The whole journey towards the propagandist Ted Mosby trying to find the love of his life made for a compelling story and gave the writers something great to work with. All of his failed relationships were meaningful and gave us life lessons that we can implement in our lives. 

But the best part of the series was, how grounded it felt, it wasn't something over the top, it was about a guy trying to find love. And his struggles and anxieties and desperation that came with it. 

The other characters were just as brilliant. HIMYM gave the world it's first anti marriage lead who prioritised career over her relationship and didn't villainise her. 

Barney Stinson could've been just a womaniser  but they gave his character so much depth that you couldn't help but root for him. 

Marshall and Lily were the couple that dreams are made of, they were just perfect. 

And tbh, HIMYM was, is and will always be better than FRIENDS
