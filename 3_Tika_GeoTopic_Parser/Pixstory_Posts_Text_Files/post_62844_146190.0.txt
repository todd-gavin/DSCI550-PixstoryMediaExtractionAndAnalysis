There are a few things you can do to make surfing more fun.
1. Stay hydrated – staying hydrated while surfing will keep you feeling alert and focused, which will make it easier to stay in the waves.
2. Dress for the weather – remember that the weather is always changing, so dress accordingly. When it's hot out, wear sunscreen and hats; when it's windy, bring an extra coat and protect your ears and face.
3. Learn some surf tips – this won’t only make your surfing experience better, but it will also help you get better at judging waves and making faster turns. 
4. Get more comfortable with the waves – Once you're more comfortable with the waves, you'll be able to ride them in a more relaxed manner and find new ways to surf them.
5. Stick to well-known surf spots. Not only will this make surfing easier for you, it will also help other surfers find you when they're looking for a good wave. 
6. Practice your timing – The faster you can time your strokes, the better your chance of making it through the waves safely. 
7. Be aware of where the surfer ahead of you is going and try to stay close by so that you can share in their wave when it comes to come in shore.
8. Have fun! Surfing is all about having fun, so don't be too serious about it – let yourself go crazy and have some good old-fashioned fun!
