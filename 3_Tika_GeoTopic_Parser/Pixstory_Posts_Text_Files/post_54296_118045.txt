If you close your eyes and imagine a system of planets orbiting a distant star what do you see For most people such thoughts conjure up systems that mirror the Solar System planets orbiting a host star on near circular orbits rocky planets closer in and giants such as Jupiter in the icy depths However the more we study the cosmos the more we begin to realise planetary systems like our own might be more of an exception than a rule Imagine a system with one gaseous planet a little larger than Saturn skimming the surface of its host star on an extremely fast orbit It s hellishly hot and glows a dull red baking in stellar radiation Then imagine another giant planet farther out larger than Jupiter moving on a distant and highly elongated orbit which makes it look more like a comet than a traditional planet It doesn t sound much like home does it Yet that s what we found Introducing the HD planetary system The story of the HD system begins in the late th century when astronomers began obsessively observing stars similar to the Sun They were looking for evidence of those stars wobbling back and forth under the influence of unseen planetary companions Using the metre Anglo Australian Telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran researchers discovered a planet orbiting the star HD This planet HD b was as massive as the gas giants Saturn and Jupiter But that s where the similarities ended HD b is a hot Jupiter a giant gas planet skimming the surface of its host star which is a little smaller and cooler than the Sun and completing each lap in less than three Earth days For two decades since its discovery we have continued to monitor the HD s movements In recent years we ve been conducting this work at the University of Southern Queensland s Mt Kent Observatory By combining our observations with others we discovered a strange new planet in the system which we describe in a paper published last month Read more
