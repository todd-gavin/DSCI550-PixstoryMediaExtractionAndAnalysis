Insects and animals educate us about bravery and strength. The bumblebee is one such insect with incredible power. Aerodynamically, the bumblebee shouldn't be able to fly, but it doesn't realize it, so it keeps flying. Its body is too hefty for its light wings, but bumblebees refuse to accept their limitations. It continues to fly despite all obstacles, defying the laws of nature. Bumblebees are strong, and we should be too. The Earth and the environment have a lot to teach us; we should know how to pay attention and learn from it.
