Each garden one maintains… creates a story of flowers that blossom at perfect timing. 

Sometimes in the process of establishing such beauty of your garden…it requires you to get dirty, you might sweat, lose some flowers, kick unwanted people out, and even start over. It’s the beauty that evolves after all the hard work that was put into it, that allows you to see nothing but beautiful colors that were created out of ALL the challenges in building and creating it. 

Don’t let the world stop you from being those very colors you were created to be. Your journey can inspire and heal! Keep going❤️🌹
