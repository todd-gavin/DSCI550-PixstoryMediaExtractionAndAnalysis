With three losses in four successive Premier league gameweeks, nothing seems to be going Arsenal's way as the race for top 4 reaches It's climax. Brighton's win at the Emirates last week was embarrassing as it is for Arteta's team, but what followed was also confirmation of two long term injuries to two crucial first team players.


The first, obviously being Kieran Tierney. The left-back picked up an injury during the international break whilst on duty with Scotland. Thomas Partey was the second, but the extent to which his thigh was aggravated was unknown. Now, having run tests and assessed the midfielders situation Mikel Arteta confirmed his absence for the remainder of the season.


“The news that we got after having another assessment was not great,” said the Gunners boss. “It is not looking very positive [for] his availability this season, but we will have to wait and see.


Arteta considers the Ghanaian an important part of his plans.


“He is trying to get back as quickly as possible, but at the moment we are not very optimistic about it. “At the moment it is not ideal,” Arteta admitted. “We knew that towards the end of the season one of the key elements was going to be having the team available and the squad available as much as possible."


Following initial signs of optimism, Partey will not play again until next season. The 3-0 defeat at Selhurst Park being his final game of the campaign, Arteta confirmed. The problems don't stop there. Tierney too has already played his final game of the campaign, with an impending surgery. Multiple other minor layoffs prevent the North Londoners from operating at full strength ahead of some big games.


“We have a few issues with him and [Takehiro] Tomiyasu, but we need to continue to compete and work in the best possible way.”
