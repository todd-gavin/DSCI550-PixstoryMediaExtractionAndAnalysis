New Delhi: Bhutan is hosting the toughest ultra-marathon in the world today. The Tourism Council of Bhutan announced that Snowman Race is billed as one of the most ultra-challenging ultra-marathons, which will be held on October 13 and 17, 2022, in Bhutan.
The Race is an initiative the King of Bhutan took to generate awareness about the climate emergency and effects of global warming, particularly on the planet’s most threatened ecosystems, such as those of the high Himalayas.
The competition will have twenty-nine international athletes, including nine Bhutanese runners. The athletes are from the USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Singapore, Tanzania, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
The Race will navigate the most challenging trekking route in Bhutan, the Snowman Trail, passing through some of the most stunning areas in the Kingdom, including the remote Lunana area, home to nomadic herders living between glaciers.
Competitors will also traverse the base of Gangkhar Puensum, the world’s highest unclimbed mountain (and Bhutan’s tallest peak at 24,836ft.
Athletes will compete for over 203 kilometres across five days at an oxygen-sparse average height of 14,800 feet above sea level, with the highest point of 17,946 feet. The trail has been completed by fewer people than have summited Mount Everest and typically requires between 20-25 days to complete.
It is the first imitative the tourism ministry in Bhutan has taken after the borders of Bhutan were opened for tourism on September 25, 2022.
