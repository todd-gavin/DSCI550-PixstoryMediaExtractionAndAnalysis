Anthony Albanese has said his predecessor Scott Morrison “undermined democracy” by secretly appointing himself to additional ministerial roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After a review of the issue by the Prime Minister’s department, Albanese told reporters Morrison, who stepped down as leader of the Liberal Party after losing May’s election, had taken on the health and finance portfolios in March 2020, resources in April 2021 and home affairs and treasury in May 2021.

Albanese said he had asked the country’s Solicitor-General to advise him on whether Morrison’s actions, which he called a “shadow government”, were legal.

The outrage over the appointments has drawn increased scrutiny of the Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic, and his decision to block a controversial offshore gas project after making himself resources minister.

Morrison has also come under fire from senior members of his own party and its coalition partner, the National Party, who have said they not aware of the arrangements.
