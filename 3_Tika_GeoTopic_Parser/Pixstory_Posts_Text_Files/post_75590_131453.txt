Nicolas Jover arrived from Manchester City in to become Arsenal s new set piece coach Since his arrival defence of set pieces and the way Arsenal use them to attack has improved dramatically Last season only Liverpool and Manchester City scored from set pieces and Arsenal placed th in the league for the defence of them Most notably Arsenal s defence of corners has been very impressive Last season Arsenal faced well over corners until they eventually conceded from one in the latter stages of the Premier League season Attacking them Arsenal have developed different ways to bemuse teams and capitalise on their corner opportunities Gabriel Magalhaes is one of Arsenal s biggest threats from corners The defender scored goals more than any other Premier League defender All of those came from corners The Brazilian s huge frame and heading ability make him a nightmare to deal with in the box and Arsenal are great at getting him in the right area to attack the ball As well as this the deliveries are key Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka are Arsenal s main corner takers and both are mastering the ability to swing low fast crosses into the box With the pace on the ball often it just takes a slight touch to see the ball fly past the opposition goalkeeper In just games this season Arsenal have already scored goals from set pieces The first came against Crystal Palace a clever corner routine which resulted in Oleksandr Zinchenko having space to head back across goal Martinelli this time was on hand to divert into the goal The second came was another corner against Leicester City Martinelli s low delivery was too much for the Foxes to handle and Jamie Vardy could only flick the ball onto a free Gabriel Jesus who tapped home The third against Bournemouth was a free kick Taken short Martinelli managed to get down the wing and swing a ball into the box which arrived with Granit Xhaka The Swiss midfielder layed the ball onto a free William Saliba who expertly stroked the ball into the top corner With Arsenal s ever developing attack set pieces are an extremely important asset
