Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who passed away Saturday, not only contributed to taking mindfulness meditation to a large number of people in the west but also practiced the other, equally important aspect of this religion with his peace activism and ‘Engaged Buddhism’. 

Many Buddhist monks and teachers of various denominations helped in making ‘mindfulness’ a movement and in popularizing the teachings of the Buddha outside Asia. Nhat Hanh (with the Dalai Lama), was different as he was actively involved in anti-war campaigns in his homeland during the 1960s. 

As he had been in the US earlier to study comparative religion at Princeton, he was also in touch with anti-war activists, and this led a remarkable meeting between him and Martin Luther King, Jr, in 1966. The Zen master famously compared the civil rights leader with ‘Bodhisattva’ – someone with a potential to become a Buddha. King described him as “an apostle of peace and non violence.” Impressed by his efforts to promote reconciliation between the US-backed South and communist North Vietnam, King nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize a year later.

Bernice King recalled her father’s “friend and ally” and tweeted: “I celebrate and honor Thich Nhat Hanh’s life and global influence for peace”: https://twitter.com/BerniceKing/status/1484667427824836609

Nhat Hanh founded the ‘Order of Inter-being’, dedicated to nonviolence, mindfulness and social service, in Vietnam. In south France, he founded Plum Society, a retreat center where he spent most of his life – till 2018. After a stroke in 2014 left him unable to speak, he chose to return home and spend his final years at the monastery where he was ordained nearly 80 years earlier. There, he died at the age of 95: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60092461

Among his numerous books of prose and poetry, ‘Miracle of Mindfulness’ remains a classic. 

“Buddhism means to be awake — mindful of what is happening in one’s body, feelings, mind and in the world. If you are awake, you cannot do otherwise than act compassionately to help relieve suffering you see around you. So Buddhism must be engaged in the world. If it is not engaged, it is not Buddhism”: https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-thich-nhat-hanh-oprah-winfrey-religion-78841c007addc0f910c8bbc73e9ca471
