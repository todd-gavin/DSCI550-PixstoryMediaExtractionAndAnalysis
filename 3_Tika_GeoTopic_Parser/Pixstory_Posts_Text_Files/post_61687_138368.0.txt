It looks like Imperium is back together.

The trio were mainstays in NXT and NXT UK until shortly after WrestleMania 38, when Gunther and Ludwig Kaiser were bumped to the SmackDown roster, while then-Fabian Aichner disappeared from TV. He returned to NXT recently as Giovanni Vinci.
Saturday at Clash at the Castle, Gunther, Kaiser and Vinci reunited for Gunther's Intercontinental Championship defense. Adding Vinci back to the mix evened the odds with the Brawling Brutes, as Sheamus was joined by Butch and Ridge Holland.
Before the IC title match got underway, the seconds brawled out of the ring and up the ramp, out of the arena, clearing the way for Gunther and Sheamus to have a brutally amazing title match that saw the German retain his championship.
As Imperium, Vinci and Kaiser (then Aichner and Marcel Barthel) held the NXT Tag Team Championship twice, with the second reign ending in April, days before Gunther and Kaiser were called up.
Vinci has been added to the SmackDown roster on WWE.com, so it looks like Imperium is back in full forcce.
