Emily Bates has become just the second AFLW player to scoop all three major end-of-season awards in the same year.

Having already been named the league's best and fairest, and the coaches' association's (AFLCA) MVP, Brisbane's Bates on Wednesday night received the MVP award from the players' association (AFLPA).

Just a day after she clinched the competition's best and fairest title, the Lions vice-captain was voted player of the year by her peers with 286 votes.

Prolific North Melbourne ball-winner Ash Riddell (256 votes) and Richmond's Mon Conti (164) rounded out the top three.

Adelaide champion Erin Phillips is the only other player to have won all three awards, performing the feat in 2019.

Lions coach Craig Starcevich said Bates's string of accolades would "cement her right at the top" of the competition.

"When Emily started … she was already accomplished but perhaps in the shadows of some of the bigger names and Victorian-based midfielders," he told the AFLPA website.

"She's always searching for an edge, or looking to improve herself … she's never [been] complacent."

Starcevich also praised Bates's leadership qualities, which were on display in the Lions' grand final triumph over Adelaide in 2021.

"She's not a demonstrative leader with words. She's more of a lead-by-example [type], [with her] training work ethic and holding high standards," he said.

The 26-year-old became the first Brisbane Lions AFLW player to win the award, joining men's players Lachie Neale (2020), Michael Voss (2002, 2003) and Paul Roos (1986) for Fitzroy.
