 Victory is tough for Judge Jackson The nine member court is currently divided between six Republican appointed justices and three picked by Democrats On Monday All Senate Democrats and three Senate Republicans advanced Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson s nomination Republican Sens Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah all voted for Jackson While Jackson seems likely to win the manner of her confirmation does not indicate well for a process that is evolving into partisanship If Republicans win control of the Senate this year it seems likely the door will shut on any future Biden Supreme Court nominees We see the Supreme Court confirmations are getting only more and more political The rivalry between Republicans and Democrats seems to affect representatives each of them badly The Delay of a democratic member caused the whole meeting to wait as votes are very much essential to confirm Ketanji This indicates risks on her confirmation Moreover upon Sen Durbin s criticism of the Republican s harsh attacks on Jackson Sen Marsha Blackburn rebuked that questions are not attacks and that it would be a dereliction of duty to our constituents not to ask tough questions In addition for democrats the GOP hostility was just another obstacle the judge would have to survive
