In the early days of the space age the Apollo astronauts took part in a visionary plan Bring samples of the lunar surface material known as regolith back to Earth where they could be studied with state of the art equipment and saved for future research not yet imagined NASA TV reported that fifty years later at the dawn of the Artemis era and the next astronaut return to the Moon three of those samples have been used to successfully grow plants For the first time ever researchers have grown the hardy and well studied Arabidopsis thaliana in the nutrient poor lunar regolith This research is critical to NASA s long term human exploration goals as we ll need to use resources found on the Moon and Mars to develop food sources for future astronauts living and operating in deep space said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson This fundamental plant growth research is also a key example of how NASA is working to unlock agricultural innovations that could help us understand how plants might overcome stressful conditions in food scarce areas here on Earth Scientists at the University of Florida have made a breakthrough discovery decades in the making that could both enable space exploration and benefit humanity Here we are years later completing experiments that were started back in the Apollo labs said Robert Ferl a professor in the Horticultural Sciences department at the University of Florida Gainesville and a communicating author on a paper published on May in Communications Biology
