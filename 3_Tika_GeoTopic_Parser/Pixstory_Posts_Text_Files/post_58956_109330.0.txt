As a result of support from organisations like the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP), Droupadi Murmu, the candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), is expected to win the July 18 presidential election with ease.

Of the 1086431 votes cast in the electoral college for the presidential election, the NDA received 49 percent, or 5,32,351. YSRCP has 45,550 votes, the BJD has 31,686 votes, and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has 14,940 votes. Murmu, who is expected to become the first tribal president, can win with support from either the BJD or the YRSCP.

The Jharkhand Mukti Morch (JMM), a party led by Scheduled Tribes (ST), is another source of support for the NDA. JMM is probably going to oppose the opposition alliance, which has chosen Yashwant Sinha, a former BJP leader, as its candidate. The Santhal Tribe is Murmu's home tribe.

BJP executives claimed that Murmu is also likely to receive support from organisations like the Shiromani Akali Dal, Telugu Desam Party, and Bahujan Samaj Party.

The leader stated that because MPs are not constrained by party whips and presidential elections are conducted by secret ballot, there is also a chance that they will cross-vote for Murmu.

By roughly 20,000 votes, NDA fell short of the necessary majority and was depending on allies like BJD to back its candidate. Another friendly party is the YSRCP, which is not affiliated with the NDA.
