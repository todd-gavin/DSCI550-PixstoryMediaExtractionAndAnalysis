I know Why I write Content in Pixstory.

Because I want to get going as a Writer, even if I fail I'll have opportunity to learn from mistakes.

Writing one day may not be significantly important.
But Writing Each day will have significant impact on my writing at the end of the period.

Just Write whether you're wrong or right, good or bad, Just Write it.

That's my Why.

Know your Why because it's the only thing that will keep you going in the long run/ in your low times.
Why is the only thing that is primarily defined by you.
Everything else is secondary.

Hope I'm Clear to you with my thoughts.
If you've any doubt you can note it.
