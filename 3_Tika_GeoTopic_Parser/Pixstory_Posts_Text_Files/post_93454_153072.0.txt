You can practice body neutrality by acknowledging the ways your body functions well and even the ways when it does not work well, eat in a manner that is neutral to the body by choosing foods you can digest, enjoy and which gives you energy. You can wear clothes which are comfortable to you and that you enjoy seeing. To practice body neutrality in exercise you should choose activities that you enjoy doing, and then stop doing them once you are tired or sore.As per my learnings, I feel Body Neutrality is a great practice to have a healthy relationship with your body. One day we can love our body and the next day we donâ€™t but still appreciate our body which can carry out multiple activities. When our body feels peaceful, we are able to focus more on our personal goals and self-worth.
