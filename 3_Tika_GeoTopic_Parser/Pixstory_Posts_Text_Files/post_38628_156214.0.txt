Sweeper keeper- As per sportskeeda, a Sweeper Keeper is a goalkeeper who pushes himself up the pitch and stays close to the last line of the pitch. According to famous line of legendary Johan Cyruff - "the goalkeeper is the first attacker and the striker is the first defender". 
To defend a high press from the opposing team, a goalkeeper leaves his comfort zone and moving near the defensive third, keeper provides the team with passing option to players to adjust accordingly or make forward runs to receive a pass.
