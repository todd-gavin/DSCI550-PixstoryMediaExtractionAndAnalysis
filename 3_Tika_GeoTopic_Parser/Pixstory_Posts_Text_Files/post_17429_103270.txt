Resplendent with a charismatic protagonist politicians two of the world s biggest football clubs and hundreds of millions of dollars at stake the Kylian Mbapp saga kept the football world gripped as he oscillated between signing for Real Madrid and staying at Paris Saint Germain As a World Cup winner at just the second teenager after Pel to score in a World Cup final and the Ligue top scorer for four consecutive seasons Mbapp is a once in generation footballer The year old star striker had long been linked with Real Madrid He was invited to the Spanish club s academy as an year old had posters of Real s Cristiano Ronaldo on the walls of his childhood bedroom and had said he wanted to join the now time European Cup winners last year The Spanish giants submitted a million bid for Mbapp in August The deal was close to being struck and the striker even admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG I was honest I gave a feeling I gave what I have in my heart Mbapp told CNN s Becky Anderson in December So when the Frenchman extended his contract with PSG instead of signing with Los Merengues it was a shock to say the least It was the hardest decision of my life Mbapp told CNN s Amanda Davies on May I wanted to make the best decision and that takes time but I think I made the right decision The project is to win always Mbapp explained his decision to stay in Paris by repeatedly referencing the project being built at PSG Despite drawing upon seemingly limitless reserves of money PSG has so far failed to win a Champions League title and has an unfortunate knack of imploding in the knockout stages Now it appears the club is altering its approach If I change all the things I want to change in the club said Mbapp before pausing and recalibrating If the club grows up with me if I can write the history of the club collectively with the Champions League or individually too I will be happy with this contract
