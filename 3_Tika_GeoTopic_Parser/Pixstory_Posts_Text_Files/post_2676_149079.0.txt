26th September is 99th Birth anniversary of Evergreen Hero. I have a special affinity to Dev Saab since he belonged to Gurdaspur, birthplace of My father and his forefathers. Not that he was ever aware of our existence. Difficult to write about Dev Saab since so much is known and so much has been written. Will therefore write about the Song, ‘Leke pehle pehla Pyaar’ from CID.Movie was Directed by Raj Khosla who went on to make cult classics like Mera Gaon Mera Desh, Woh Kaun thi, Etc.Raj Khosla was assisting Guru Dutt and when Guru Dutt produced his first movie he cast Dev Anand as per agreement between the two. But Dev Anand wanted a different Director and Raj Khosla was chosen.When Leke Pehla Pyaar  was to be pictured, Dev Anand assumed that he would be singing on screen. Imagine his shock when Raj Khosla told him that he would only walk in the song and another would sing. Eventually Guru Datt's assistant Shyam Manohar was chosen to play the harmonium on screen and make Usha Vaz Dance.OP Nayyar the Music Director was an outspoken chap. When he saw Waheeda Rehman on the set he asked Guru Datt, 'Yeh aaya nayi rakhi hai?Dev Anand argued but gave up with Raj Khosla but finally gave up. Of course when the Movie came, the song became a super hit and Dev Anand tipped his proverbial Hat to Raj Khosla. The scene of iconic Movie Guide with Dev Anand as The Swami was pinnacle of His career. There is a Song from movie Kashti With Dev Anand playing the sarod and Geeta Bali, the Sitar. Ali Akbar Khan And Nikhil Banerjee played actually. ‘Main Zindagi ka Saath’ was an anthem for the youth.Kala Bazaar’s song ‘Apni To Har Aah’ had Rafi singing in such a low pitch that makes one wonder at the Virtuosity of The great Singer. Dev Anand the quintessential Hero was grace personified!!!
