The BBCI(Board of Cricket Control in India) have unveiled the jersey on occasion of ❤️ Azadi ka Amrit Mahaotsav. The jersey is quite cool in its own sense. The JerSey has the Silver number 75 imprinted all over it. The launch is brought about by MPL, the official Sports Kit Partner of BCCI and the Indian  Cricket Team. 🥰

 

The Jersey is a limited edition, so pretty much to get out of stock within a week or so. 🤩 The Tweet goes by the name “Let's celebrate the 75th year of Indian Independence by donning this Flag of the Nation, Limited Edition Jersey.”
