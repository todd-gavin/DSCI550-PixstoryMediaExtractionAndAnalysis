Industrial activities of the past couple of centuries have polluted the environment and its devastating effects are obvious to one and all. For those who still want proof, there are reports after reports, warning an apocalypse ahead. The fact of climate change has been largely accepted now, but little action is forthcoming from world leaders. Scientists resent the fact that decision-makers are not attaching due importance to their work. Some of them have even threatened to go on strike in order to draw the world attention to their concerns. Such a course of action might indeed provoke some action, but more likely it would be ignored – even welcomed in some quarters.

The scientific studies, of course, are shouting from the rooftops that we are running out of time to make course correction: https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/state-of-climate-2021-extreme-events-and-major-impacts Last year, many parts of the world suffered from extreme weather events. In August, the IPCC released a report saying some of the shifts were already irreversible: https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362 UN secretary-general António Guterres called it "a code red for humanity”. Last week, there was yet another report from the IPCC, and Guterres called it an “atlas of human suffering”: https://www.usnews.com/news/news/articles/2022-02-28/un-climate-report-atlas-of-human-suffering-worse-bigger

But did any of those reports lead to effective action? COP26 in October last year was probably a failure: https://theconversation.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-why-the-cop26-summit-ended-in-failure-and-disappointment-despite-a-few-bright-spots-171723

In the journal ‘Climate and Development’, scientists Bruce C. Glavovic, Timothy F. Smith and Iain White write: “The tragedy of climate change science is that at the same time as compelling evidence is gathered, fresh warnings issued, and novel methodologies developed, indicators of adverse global change rise year upon year”: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17565529.2021.2008855 They feel that the science-society contract is broken, and discuss options to repair it. The trio then calls on climate scientists to stage a mass walkout, to stop their research until nations take action on global warming: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/climate/ipcc-climate-scientists-strike.html

Their exasperation is understandable. But effecting widespread and permanent changes in democratic societies is not an easy task, nor one that can be accomplished in a year or two. On the other hand, if the research is stopped, climate-deniers will have a freer hand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1rxv1yPQrc Science will have to continue its job, without expecting its fruits.
