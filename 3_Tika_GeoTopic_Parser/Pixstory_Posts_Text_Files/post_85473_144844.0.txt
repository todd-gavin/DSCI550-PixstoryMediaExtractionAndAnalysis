It’s been one year since we lost 2-0 at Brentford, and you could argue circumstances didn’t favour our squad through Covid and injuries to key players.Since Brentford’s victory over us, both sides have gone on different paths. They maintained their Premier League status and we finished in a European place after a poor start to the season. This match presents another opportunity to make a statement.Ivan Toney is in great form so far, so he’ll be a player to keep quiet. Gabriel and Saliba, both expected to start, will need to improve on their most recent league performance against United if they want to minimise Ivan Toney.Brentford’s form is strong at home, so Arsenal must match the intensity of their side - the home support will get right behind them.Arsenal have a few injuries to contend with, but Thomas Partey is expected to return. The postponement of last week’s game resulted in players receiving rest and a return to injury for some. Zinchenko is a doubt according to reports but Arsenal should have enough squad depth to handle any missing personnel. PL RECORD SO FAR:Arsenal: P6 W5 D0 L1Brentford: P2 D3 L1Spurs and City both recorded victories so we must respond. Let’s get another win, so we can go into the international break with a smile on our faces.
