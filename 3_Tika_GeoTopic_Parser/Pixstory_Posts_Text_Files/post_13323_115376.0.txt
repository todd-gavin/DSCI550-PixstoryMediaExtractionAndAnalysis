NASA has released the first color image of the early universe. This image was captured by the James Webb Space Telescope.
A telescope that has "provided the clearest and deepest picture yet of the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang."

Joe Biden called the unveiling of these images "a historic moment for humanity".
The unveiling ceremony of the first image of the James Webb Space Telescope began on Monday evening with the speech of US President Joe Biden at the White House.

Billed as "Webb's first deep field," the James Webb Space Telescope's first image is "the deepest and highest-quality image ever recorded of the early universe."
US President Joe Biden called the unveiling of these images a "historic" moment and said that "these images provide a new window into the history of our world."

"It's hard to even fathom. It's amazing. This is a historic moment for science and technology, for America and all of humanity," the US president said.
