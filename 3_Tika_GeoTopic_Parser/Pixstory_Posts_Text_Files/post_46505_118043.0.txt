When i Talk about vitamin D , the very first source of it which comes in my mind is Sunlight ! ðŸŒž

We all Know the Importance of Vitamin D - vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the body . These nutrients are needed to keep bones , teeth and muscles healthy . ðŸ’ªâœ…

But not just sunlight , there are also many other sources of vitamin D ! You don't know about other sources ?? Lemme tell you ; 

1 Oily fish â€“ Eg- salmon , sardines , herring and mackerel .
2 Red meat .
3 Liver . 
4 Egg yolks . 
5 Fortified foods â€“ Eg- some fat spreads and breakfast cereals .
6 Orange juice .
7 Mushroom .

I include all of these in my regular diet . I love to have orange juice in breakfast , and Fish in Dinner or lunch whenever i want . ðŸ˜‹

From about late March / early April to the end of September , most people make all the vitamin D from sunlight . Our body creates vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors .

A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children . ðŸ¤”

Soo guys keep your deficiencies in check for better health . âœ…

Tell me in notes , which of these foods do you consume regularly . ðŸ’­ðŸŒž
