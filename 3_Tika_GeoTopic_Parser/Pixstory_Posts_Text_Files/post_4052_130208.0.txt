Why are the no's not being heard
Why does it have to be laughed and said 
Why is this sugar wrapped with so much of words ?
Because of a no!
Why is no not being audible, I don't know 
No is not something "to not to be told" 
It is as powerful as a yes to get hold 
A no has to be taken as a no 
A no has a room of reasons 
No with a feeling it floats, feels like sinking away as the conversation goes 
Why is my NO not heard to you as I roar 
This is a plight of one's own 
And this image of "yes" is no longer available
