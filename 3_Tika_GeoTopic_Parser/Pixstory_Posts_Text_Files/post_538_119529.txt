Internet is cruel By now this is an established fact But if you need to see how far the cruelty can go you have to watch Netflix series The most hated man on internet a documentary about Hunter Moore based on a case in Moore year old founder of IsAnyoneUp com a so called revenge porn website that allowed jilted lovers in possession of an ex s compromising photos to send said photos to Moore who would than post them on his website The purpose public humiliation and vilification of the victim Moore claimed the website was user driven and he had no role in the entire thing He said his job was to only verify that the unlucky subject was or older Not only the pictures the website included these so called Ex s full name profession residence and even link to their social media pages So the pictures would pop up on google for the world to see The website had roughly visitors who had become more or less like a cult calling Moore father and even God The vilification and the loopholes in law made sure Moore s business continued to thrive However what got him down was that the content was infact not necessarily user driven but posted after hacking into peoples computers The viciousness the lack of morals and remorse in Moore spelt everything that was wrong with the way internet was allowed to work It also highlighted the need for not just laws and regulation governing use of net and social media but also the need to build a safe space on internet It also highlights the need for a social media space like Pixstory Which is based on the premise of not allowing misuse of internet social media and bringing about behavioral change As a pixstory user I must assure such behaviour is neither tolerated nor encouraged The artificial intelligence and human moderation will make sure there are not any such victims Being a victim of the anonymity internet dark web provides to criminal minds I believe pixstory is the change that is needed Do you agree
