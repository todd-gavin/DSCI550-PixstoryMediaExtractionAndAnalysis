Hours prior to the show, Riddle and Rollins were seen exchanging blows at each other in the parking lot. As the superstars brawled, they were separated only after the official intervened. WWE took to their official social media handles early morning on Monday and shared a video featuring the brawl, with the caption, '@riddlebro and @wwerollins just tried to fight in the parking lot!
If this wasn't enough, they kept on fighting after WWE Raw went off the air, and even made it to the ring, while fighting each other. This feud has boiled over and is definitely going to get bloodier!! 
Plus Rollins getting personal, and mentioning the real life situation of Riddle's divorce and being seperated from his kids, just added the fuel to the fire!! 
This match is going to be exciting!! Rollins and Riddle will face off at Clash of the Castle
