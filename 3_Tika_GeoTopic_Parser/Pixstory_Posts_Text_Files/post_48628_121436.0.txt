Spike Lee, the legendary director, is seen sitting courtside at every New York Knicks game, reverently supporting the Knicks, a team he has supported with fervour throughout the years. Over 30 years in fact. Man doesn't give up hope. He's me, me is he! Knicks for life!

But he isn't the Knicks' only celebrity backer. Howard Stern, Woody Allen, Olivia Wilde, Kate Upton, Drew Barrymore, and Katie Holmes are among the many celebrities who use the Garden court. Several well-known comedians, including Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, and Jon Stewart, frequently appear at Knicks games. 50 Cent and Sean Diddy Combs, who are well-known in the music industry, are great supporters of the New Your Knicks too!
