Shane Warne remains a fan favourite. He was one of the game's all-time greats, with a larrikin streak that Australians adored. He can be a jerk at times, but he's always the first to admit it and put his hand up. He's now a cricket commentator, and while he can be a little predictable ("Shane Warne thinks they should bring on the spinner, what a surprise"), he's certainly insightful, particularly when it comes to spin bowling. He had an excellent cricketing mind and could always tell what the spinner was trying to do and how his tactics could be improved.
