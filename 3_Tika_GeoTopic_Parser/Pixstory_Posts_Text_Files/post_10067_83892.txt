The doorman in my hotel room beats the women shouting Sir sir wake up Your colleagues asked me to tell you as if it had been bombed I never thought these were the words I heard in Kiev Like many people I have heard in recent months US warnings that a Russian invasion is imminent but I could not have imagined that this would really happen I came to Ukraine in as a journalist to cover the Maidan protests At the time then President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown after his decision to move away from Europe and move closer to Russia I was covering the events in Crimea when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine and I was in eastern Ukraine when Russian backed separatists declared their People s Republics Russia has denied any involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine since day one But I clearly remember September when Russian tanks were occupying a small Ukrainian town right near the Russian border I saw these tanks with my own eyes but when I went on the air to describe the situation to a Moscow radio station I was told That is not possible You must be wrong I also witnessed Russian forces supporting insurgent fighters from the Buddhist region of the Far East of Buryatia during the bloody battle for the strategic town of Debaltseve in Donetsk Oblast in February All of this as well as the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny the horrific rigging of Russia s last election and changes to the constitution to allow Vladimir Putin to remain in power until However I still could not believe that the Russian president would launch a full scale attack on Ukraine
