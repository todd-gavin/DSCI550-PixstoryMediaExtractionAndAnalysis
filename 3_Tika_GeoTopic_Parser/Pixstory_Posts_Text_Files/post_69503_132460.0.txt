Hokersar is a wetland that tens of thousands of waterfowl chose to visit, making it a literal paradise for migratory birds. These visiting birds, who come to the valley throughout the winter from all areas of the world, always give this wetland top importance. Hokersar Wetland, which is about 10 kilometres from Srinagar, is home to close to six lac migratory birds, and according to a census study that was published a few days ago, of the 567884 birds—representing 33 species—that visit this wetland, 81% are migratory. 
The diligent work of the concerned warden and his crew is what allows the visiting birds, who are primarily Gadwalls, northern Pintails, Conman Teal, Eurasian Coot, Geese, and Northern Shovelers, to enjoy their brief visits without incident in this paradise.
