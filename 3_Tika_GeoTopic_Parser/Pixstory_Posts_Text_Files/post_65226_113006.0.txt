The week-long UN Ocean Conference concluded on 1 July, with the unanimous adoption of the Lisbon Declaration "Our ocean, our future, our responsibility.” 

More than 6,000 participants, including 24 Heads of State and Government and over 2,000 representatives of civil society joined the Conference in Lisbon and galvanized efforts to save our ocean. 

The Conference succeeded in translating ideas into action. A plethora of bold and firm commitments have been made from every sector of industry and all stakeholders, including an emphasis on eliminating plastic marine litter and supporting innovative science-based actions to save our ocean.
 
With the conclusion of the Conference, a new wave of ocean actions will sail from Lisbon to all corners of the world
