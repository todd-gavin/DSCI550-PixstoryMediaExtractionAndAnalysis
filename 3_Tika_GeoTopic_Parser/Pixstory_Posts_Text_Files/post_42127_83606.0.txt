I believe that today we can't take up any hobby just for the sake of fun or just for trying to learn something new. Nowadays, when you take up something new, the society expects you to be able to master it and be perfect at it otherwise its all a waste. No one takes into account the exposure or new things you learn along the way unless you are able to monetize that hobby. 

Take for example someone who has just started painting would of course not be an expert in it but they realize that painting helps them to pour their emotions out on a piece of paper and the whole experience is a rewarding one for them. However this would be deemed as a waste of time by the society just because the person is not good at it.
This pressure of being perfect at everything can sometimes take its toll on people and not let them enjoy the activities they once loved to do.
