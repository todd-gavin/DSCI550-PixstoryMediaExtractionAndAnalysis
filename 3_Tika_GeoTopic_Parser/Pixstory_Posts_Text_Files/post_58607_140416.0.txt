Few of us,specially, young generation of Varanasi, should be knowing that Queen Elizabeth   came to Varanasi in 1961 and  took an elephant ride in a royal procession, enjoying the hospitality of the erstwhile Maharaja of Benares. After 1961, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited India together again in 1983 and 1997, when India marked the 50th year of its Independence.
