Most people would scoff at the idea of adults needing a bedtime routine.  With our busy lives, it’s common to work until late at night, Creating a bedtime routine helps you to get to sleep more easily, sleep more soundly and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day.  🛌🌌

Create your own bedtime routine-
By getting on a schedule your body clock knows what to expect and will start the internal chemical cascades that help you drift off.First of all, make sure your bedroom is a place you enjoy being in.🛌

Introduce a winding down routine-
It really doesn’t matter what you do, physical or mental, the idea is to create a ‘third space’ to help you separate the day and all its stresses from bedtime. Spending a little time doing  gentle stretching, yoga or meditation is a fantastic way to help you wind down and switch off.  Spending as little as 10 to 15 minutes, being mindfully present will help you let go of the physical and emotional pains of the day. Adding a short meditation to your bedtime routine will almost certainly help you get to sleep more easily, and it will also probably have the added benefit of improving your mood throughout the rest of the day.🧘‍♀️

Take time to wind down-
Before you head to bed, take some time to let your body and mind relax.  Research has shown that spending as little as 5 minutes mentally reviewing what went well during the day, or what you’re grateful for leads to better sleep quality.  🛀

Make the bedroom a no-phone zone-
We’ve all become thoroughly attached to our smart phones, kindles and ipads.  Unfortunately, they are disruptive to sleep on a number of levels.  Because the light they emit is blue light, your brain doesn’t start producing melatonin, a sleep hormone. 📲📴
