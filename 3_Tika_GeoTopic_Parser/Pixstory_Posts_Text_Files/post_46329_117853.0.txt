Scattered hair , Bit dirty clothes But the Most beautiful Smile i have ever seen ! She is Khushi . Just like her name she was filled with lots of happiness and you can see that in pictures ! Even though bereft of what we so take for granted. 
Never seen a school, never lived in a house, you may find her smiling at some signal some day, selling flowers doing her bit for the family at age eight. 

Met Khushi some days back when I went out with my parents somewhere in pitampura i guess ? I was Sitting In the car at Red signal .

She with her mother and father was selling flowers . I observed her- , going from one car to another. Non was interested in the flowers . 
Then She came to me ! And said " Flowers Lelo Didi " ! The way she said it melted my heart ! I talked to her for a while ! I asked her, what her name was . " khushi ‘she said.
Trust me Guys , She was so cute and was smiling ! I asked her " Do you go school ? " She said " Nhi ! ! I Asked her to give me Flowers ! She said and took a bunch of three for " 25 Rupee " ! 

The moment i took flowers , Dammn there was a twinkle in her eyes she smiled with happiness. When i saw her smiling i smiled too ! 

The Signal Turned green !

In those 1-2 mins , that 7-8 years old khushi Made me Realize the Reality of life ! Being honest My eyes were filled with tears ! She is a kid , hardly knows struggles of life but still going through all that with smile ! when i saw Khushi I got alot of " Sabar " ! ❤️
