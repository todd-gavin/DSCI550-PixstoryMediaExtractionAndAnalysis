Since March 2, an image of a young woman who had made a distress video from Ukraine has been shared with a false quote attributed to her. The quote attempts to mock the student’s plight. It reads: “Indian Embassy dropped me at Mumbai Airport, from there I got no help. I waited for 30 mins but no one was there from Indian Embassy. I called embassy no one picked up my phone. Then I had to book a cab by myself and reach home. which costed me 234 Rs.”
