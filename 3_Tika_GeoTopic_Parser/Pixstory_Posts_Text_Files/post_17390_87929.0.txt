Lionel Messi has decided to stay at Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) until 2023 despite the recent troubles, according to journalist Matteo Moretto.

The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner was recently jeered by his own fans following a disappointing performance against Real Madrid in the Champions League. PSG were knocked out following a 3-1 defeat to Los Blancos in the second leg of their Round of 16 clash on 10 March. Messi struggled to make a positive impact in the Santiago Bernabeu game.

Following the off-color performance in that match, both Messi and Neymar were booed at home during PSG's Ligue 1 clash against Bordeaux on 13 March.

Despite not being happy about several things at the club, Messi has decided to continue with PSG until 2023. The 34-year-old forward had signed a two-year contract with the Parisian giants when he joined them back in the summer of 2021. He also has the option to extend his contract by another year at the end of the 2022-23 season.

Lionel Messi is determined to make things right and improve his performances on the pitch to win back the fans. With the 2022 FIFA World Cup scheduled for later in the year, the Argentine will be keen to get some momentum ahead of the mega event.

Lionel Messi will have the opportunity to shine in a PSG shirt next season if Kylian Mbappe decides to leave in the summer. This will leave the Argentine forward as their main man going forward, which could, in turn, bring out the best in him.

Mbappe is expected to leave the Parc des Princes to join Real Madrid on a free transfer at the end of the current season.
