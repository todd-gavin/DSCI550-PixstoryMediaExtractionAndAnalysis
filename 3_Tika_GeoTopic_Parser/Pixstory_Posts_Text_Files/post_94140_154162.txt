 TW Mention of Suicide Death The organization YWP was conceived by us Akhilesh Nair and Akash Saxena when in one of our school friends lost his life by suicide We were in college then But the news devastated us He was also studying in a college in Noida then Later that year we met another person again whose two friends had done the same All three of them had same problems too many expectations from people education financial issues While we were thinking about this when we came across some international websites where people could ask questions anonymously and were seeking help this way We wanted to focus on suicide prevention at that time only to learn mental health awareness and accessibility is pivotal to prevent suicide in the long run In we started You re Wonderful Project In the form of a support group and a collaboration of people with similar interests We can say equate Suicide with a train Suicide is like a destination in a train journey where one doesn t want to get down at and no one wills to go there but circumstances take one to this destination Perhaps if one knows about emotional understanding the concepts of mental health various mental illness and they have an emotional ventilation space then they are less likely to get down at this station of suicide It is not the end goal that needs to be worked upon but rather it is the journey that needs some efforts of change which could prevent reaching to that goal of death Sometimes when we work solely on the end goal but we should not let a person reach that stage The suicide prevention measure have to work on this very last stage
