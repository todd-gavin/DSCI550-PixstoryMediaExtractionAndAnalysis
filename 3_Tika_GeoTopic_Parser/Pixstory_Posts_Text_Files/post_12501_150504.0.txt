Practicing mindfulness is another way to promote mental wellness by reducing stress, promoting sleep and helping you feel more balanced and connected. According to the British Heart Foundation, there is growing evidence that practicing mindfulness may contribute to reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Mindfulness is defined as the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. Mindfulness can be practiced through meditation, utilizing physical relaxation techniques and breathing exercises.
Many people find mindfulness beneficial to their overall well-being. It can positively impact their mental, emotional, and physical health.
Mindfulness practices may help people become more perceptive of themselves and their environment. They can use mindfulness as a tool to develop focus, concentration, and mental clarity. This may enhance their work, academics, or athletic performance.
On a physical level, practicing mindfulness may promote relaxation and pain reduction.
