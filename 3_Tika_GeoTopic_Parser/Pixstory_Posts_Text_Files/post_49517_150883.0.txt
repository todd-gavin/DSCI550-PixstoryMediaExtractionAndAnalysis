At its core, socialism is simply the idea that the means of production should be owned and controlled by the community as a whole. This is in contrast to capitalism, in which private individuals or corporations own and control the means of production.
There are a number of benefits to socialism that make it an attractive option compared to capitalism. For one, under socialism, the rich will be poorer than they are currently because they will no longer have access to resources that are monopolized by capitalists. This can lead to greater equality among people, since everyone will have an equal share in the benefits generated by society. In addition, socialism allows for more efficient use of resources because it eliminates the need for profit motive. This is because businesses under socialism are geared towards serving the needs of society rather than making profits for their owners. 
Socialists believe that human beings are inherently good and able to cooperatively organize themselves into societies that provide justice and welfare for all. This is unlike capitalism, which sees humans as selfish and competitive creatures who must fight each other in order to accumulate wealth. 
So overall, there are many reasons why socialists may view socialism as a preferable system to capitalism. Though it has been tried before with mixed results, it seems likely that this time around things will be different thanks to advances in technology.
