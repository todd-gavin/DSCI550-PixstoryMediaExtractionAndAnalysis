Threats:
The team despite being flawlessly good on the Majority of the occasions so far this season also has been held back quite a few times due to several seasons. The site has been failing to suppress the counterattacks from the opposition on a regular basis which has led to goals. 
The fact that the players have looked to back themselves and rise up higher into the opponent's half of the play has been really good, but it has also given rise to a lot of problems at times. Players in the midfield losing possession of the ball at dangerous places to the opposition and letting them rush into their half of the play have led to several goals being conceded. 
Though Barcelona looks to be having one of the strongest attacks of the season, the players have been failing to find the back of the net under crucial circumstances. Pedri and Lewandowski missing big chances to score in Barca's recent outing against Bayern in the UCL cost them the match. The team will have to cope up with these issues if they want to achieve desirable results this season.
