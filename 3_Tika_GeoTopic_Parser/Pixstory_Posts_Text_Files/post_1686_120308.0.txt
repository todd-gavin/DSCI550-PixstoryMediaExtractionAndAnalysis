As is perhaps known to many, Dev Anand formed a political party called "National Party of India" (NPI) in 1980. 

A rally was held at Shivaji Park, the historic ground in Mumbai, then Bombay. It was Dev Anand’s belief that a packed house prompted Indira Gandhi to send him feelers, asking if he would join hands with her. The actor snubbed her “Joining hands with an autocrat was absolutely out of question." 

The National Party of India, with Dev Anand as its president, would, however, close shop within months when, first, Nani Palkhivala and then Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit declined to contest the Lok Sabha elections. 

In Dev Anand’s own words, “The inertia already visible amongst the early enthusiasts dampened my spirits And that was the end of (the) National Party. It was a great idea that was nipped in the bud.”
