Defensive Ability


The Dutchman is considered one of the best technicians, but his defensive contributions are very underrated. As per his data in fbref, he ranks very low in defensive contributions. But if one watches him play one can see that he is jumping to support his backline when Barca loses possession. 

He is able to tackle, intercept, block and recover the ball, while helping the other center backs to clear the danger. He usually shuttles movement and not giving into tackles and not giving unnecessary fouls. He usually assesses the situation before diving into tackle. However he is aggressive when the opponent team is transitioning, drawing fouls. He has ranked 0.92 per 90 in committing fouls. He is very inconsistent in pressurizing his opponent to commit a mistake, as he has made a total of 270 pressures out of which he has been successful only 76 times in dispossessing his opponents. He ranks only 28.7% in successfully dispossessing his opponents. 

From the above heatmap we can see that most of his defensive actions have come in the defensive third or in the middle third. He has also made some actions in the attacking third, but the majority are in the defensive and middle third.
