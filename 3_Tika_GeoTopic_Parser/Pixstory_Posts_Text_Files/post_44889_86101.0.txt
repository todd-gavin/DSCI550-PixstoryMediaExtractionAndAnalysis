Following weekend violence during a match that left 26 people needing hospital care, three of whom are in critical condition, Mexico's football league has banned away fans from stadiums.

Fights broke out immediately after the hour mark of Queretaro's game against Atlas at La Corregidora stadium in Queretaro on Saturday. The confrontations spilled out onto the field of play, sending players scrambling for safety as some supporters, including families with children, attempted to flee.

Mikel Arriola, the executive president of Liga MX, announced on Sunday:
“From today away fans will not be able to go to the stadiums,” Liga MX executive president Mikel Arriola said on Sunday.

The game was called off, and the league suspended the rest of Sunday's games. When fighting broke out between supporters during Saturday's game, it soon devolved into chaos.
Because security officers were unable to control the scene within the stadium, they opened the stadium doors to allow spectators to flee to safety. However, other players continued to fight, prompting the game to be stopped and the players to go to the locker rooms.

World football’s governing body FIFA hit out at the “unacceptable and intolerable” violence.
“FIFA joins the Mexican Football Association and Concacaf in condemning this barbaric incident and encouraging the local authorities to bring swift justice to those responsible,” FIFA said.

Mauricio Kuri, the governor of the state of Queretaro, said on Sunday that three of the 26 persons sent to the hospital had been discharged, three were "in a serious condition," ten were "in a delicate state," and the remaining ten were "not serious."
Kuri slammed the match's security arrangement, claiming that there were insufficient police personnel inside the stadium who "did not act quickly enough." He also promised to hold those responsible accountable.
