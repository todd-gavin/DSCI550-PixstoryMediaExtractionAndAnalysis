The fact that clubs feel the need to add these abominable terms to players' contracts in order to prevent rivals from swooping in and stealing their prospective star is a testament to how bizarre the game has become in recent years.

In football, who has the biggest release clause?

Ansu Fati has signed a contract extension with a 1-billion-euro (£846 million) buyout clause, joining compatriot Pedri at Barcelona. The 18-year-old has renewed his contract with the Nou Camp through 2027, sporting Lionel Messi's previous number 10 jersey this year.

Fati has been a member of the club since he was 10 years old. On Wednesday night, he assisted Barca in a 1-0 Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv.

 The international player from Spain signed a new deal just days after Ronald Koeman was successful in guaranteeing Pedri's long-term future. 

Having witnessed Paris Saint-Germain swoop in to trigger Neymar's £198 million release clause in 2017, Barcelona has obviously learned their lesson.

In order to deter any possible bidders, the Catalans have now made sure that the release clauses in their players' contracts are particularly high. In actuality, Messi's final Barcelona contract's 700-million-euro (£624 million) release clause is exceeded by both Fati and Pedri's current €1 billion buy-outs. Since attaching buyouts to stars in France is prohibited, the Argentine no longer has a public estimate of his value to PSG.

Because both teams valued Kylian Mbappe differently, Real Madrid struggled mightily to reach a deal for the Frenchman in the summer. In August, Manchester City's pursuit of England captain Harry Kane came to an end due to the absence of a release clause.
