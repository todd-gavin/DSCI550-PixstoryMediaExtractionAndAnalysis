Kelsen with his reductionism considers a single model of legal norm that of the coercive norm Kelsen&#39;s main critic Herbert Hart According to this author Kelsen is wrong in neglecting the radical difference of function between norms of different types Kelsen failed to differentiate the norms that confer private or public powers from those which impose duties If the rules concerning the exercise of powers did not exist we would be missing some of the more familiar concepts of social life since these logically presuppose the existence of such rules Kelsen has a purely structural conception of law deliberately neglects the purposive functional or teleological aspects which instead concern Hart In order to resolve the question of the legality of a single norm we have to consider the way in which it has been recognized by the sources of a given legal orientation A legal norm if it belongs to a legal system Before examining if the norm under examination is juridical we must be able to establish that it is a valid norm To do this we must make use of the ultimate identification criteria of the law in force The problem of legality shifts from the single norm to the legal system
