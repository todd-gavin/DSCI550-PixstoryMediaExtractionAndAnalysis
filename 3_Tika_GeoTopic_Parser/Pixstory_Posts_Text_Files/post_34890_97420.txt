The return to Italy had not given the desired results after the failure with Brescia and Monza Mario Balotelli found himself in Turkey with the Adana Demirspor shirt with which he also deserved a return to the national team albeit only for an internship and not for the play-offs lost with Macedonia for the next World Cup After Turkey, the future of the former Inter Milan prodigy could be very far from Italy There is talk of Argentina and Boca Junior club where Balotelli would like to play as he himself admitted in a live Twitch made with Sergio Aguero I would like to play for Boca Juniors If Riquelme calls me today vice president of the club ed. I&#39;ll go All the children of Europe grew up watching videos of Maradona or Roman at Boca and I have known this club since I was a child thanks to them At least one year of my career I would like to live it at Boca Balotelli has scored goals in total matches this season including in the league and in the Turkish Cup
