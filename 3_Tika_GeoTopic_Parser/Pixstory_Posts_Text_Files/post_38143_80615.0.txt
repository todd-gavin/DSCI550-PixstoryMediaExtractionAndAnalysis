The Marina Machans have sacked their manager Bozidar Bandovic with immediate effect. Assistant manager Sabir Pasha will take over the reins of the South Indian club until the end of the season. 

Chennaiyin suffered the biggest loss in their history at the hands of FC Goa. This 0-5 loss in a "must-win" game finally broke the camel's back. 

Following the sacking, Chennaiyin FC co-owner Vita Dani explained the reasons for the expulsion. She said “Over the years, we’ve lost and won. But as a club, losing like this is something we cannot stand by and watch. And for now, we have full confidence in Sabir to see the season through”

With 4 games to go, CFC need to win all their games to have a chance to qualify for the playoffs. Hence, Sabir Pasha immediately has a lot of pressure as he takes over as the head coach of the two-time champions. 

Sabir Pasha has also officially become the first Indian head coach of Chennaiyin FC following the announcement. It has to be seen how the manager now leads his team and motivates them after the hammering at the hands of Goa.
