Graham Potter has reached an agreement in principle to leave Brighton and will take over as manager of Chelsea.
On Wednesday night, Potter, 47, spoke at length with Chelsea co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali. After being given the night to consider his decision, he verbally agreed to accept the position.
Thursday's scheduled Potter weekly before Brighton news conference was postponed. Instead, he will bid farewell to the team and the staff before departing for London to finalise a long-term contract.
In the absence of any unforeseen issues, Potter will take over for Thomas Tuchel as the club's head coach and will be in charge for Saturday's Premier League trip to Fulham. Potter is anticipated to bring several employees, including his aide Billy Reid, although the specifics have not yet been worked out.
Although Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane were on Chelsea's shortlist, Potter was the preferred candidate. Zidane reportedly had little interest in managing in England and is instead looking forward to a chance to manage elsewhere.
Potter, who has been successful on the south coast since taking over in the summer of 2019, will require Chelsea to pay Brighton roughly £16 million in compensation in order to be appointed.
With four victories in their first six games this season, Brighton, who ended ninth in the Premier League last year with 51 points, are in fourth place this year, above Chelsea.
Tuchel was dismissed by the new Chelsea owners just three months after completing their takeover following his 100th game in charge on Tuesday, a 1-0 Champions League defeat at Dinamo Zagreb
Sources have told ESPN that Chelsea also intend to appoint a sporting director to oversee the club's transfer policy. Boehly stepped up in an interim role following the departures of lead negotiator and director Marina Granovskaia and technical and performance adviser Petr Cech.
