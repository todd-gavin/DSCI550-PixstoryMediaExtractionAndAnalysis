Shakti, one of the most important goddesses in the ancient Hindu religion, is really a divine cosmic energy that represents feminine energy and the dynamic forces that move through the universe. Shakti, who is responsible for creation and can also be an agent of change, is often manifested to destroy demonic forces and restore balance. As a vital cosmic force, Shakti takes many forms and names, including mother goddess, fierce warrior, and the dark goddess of destruction. In Hinduism, every god has a Shakti, or energy force. Itâ€™s one of the reasons she is worshipped by millions of people throughout India. ðŸ•‰

SHAKTI is the primordial cosmic energy, and represents the dynamic forces that move through the universe. This energy is creative, sustaining, as well as destructive, and is sometimes referred to as auspicious source energy. In Tantra, Shakti is worshiped as the Divine feminine that imbues every living being and deity with energy, power and creativity. Her divine feminine energy has no beginning or end and is in constant play.

From Shaktisangama Tantra:

"Woman is the creator of the universe, the universe is her form; woman is the foundation of the world, she is the true form of the body "
