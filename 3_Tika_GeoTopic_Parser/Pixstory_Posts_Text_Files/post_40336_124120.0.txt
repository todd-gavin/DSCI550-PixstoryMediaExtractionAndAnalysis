As per sports rush, Michael Jordan signed deals with a number of well-known companies in the 1990s, or he himself helped some of them become well-known by becoming a celebrity and running successful commercials, in addition to his lifetime earnings from Nike, with whom he made a deal in 1984 to become a billionaire in the future. 

Nevertheless, for some reason, Coke declined to offer MJ a 10-year contract throughout the 1990s; as a result, he signed a decade-long $18 million contract in 1991 to sing for Gatorade.

We all recall the "Be Like Mike" commercial, which has since become popular on TikTok, but it almost never took place because Disney demanded $350,000 for a five-week run or $1 million in order to grant the rights to the song "I Wanna Be Like You" from the Jungle Book for the advertising. 

Even after 30 years, the song by Pitzel is still remembered as one of the best ads ever created. Jordan was the brand's first ambassador, and today it is estimated to be worth $19 billion.
