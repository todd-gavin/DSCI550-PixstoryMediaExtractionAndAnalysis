Michy Batshuayi’s six-year spell at Chelsea has come to an end after completing a permanent move to Fenerbahce on Friday evening. Batshuayi had just 12 months left on his contract with the English club.
Confirming the transfer, Chelsea released an official statement which read:
“Michy Batshuayi has completed a permanent move to Turkey. We thank Michy for his services to the Blues and wish him well at Fenerbahce.”
The Blues went on to a bidding war with the likes of Tottenham and West Ham in 2016 to acquire the services of the Belgian forward. Though Batshuayi couldn’t earn a regular starting position in the side, he had moments to cherish during his six-year spell.
He has featured in 77 games, netting 25 goals for the Blues. Nobody can forget his winning goal against West Brom, which had sealed the 2016/17 Premier League title. He was also part of the FA Cup-winning squad the following year.
The promising forward was even loaned to Borussia Dortmund, Valencia, Crystal Palace, and the most recent being Besiktas to find some valuable game time. For the Istanbul rivals, he featured in 33 appearances, netting 14 times.
The 28-year-old was very close to staying in the Premier League when newly promoted Nottingham Forest showed interest in getting his signature on deadline day. But a delay in the paperwork from the London club, who were already busy trying to land players at Stamford Bridge, saw the deal collapse.
This opened the path for a move to Fenerbahce, which would provide him with the opportunity to compete at European level. He has 45 Belgium caps under his hat, during which he has scored 25 goals for his country.
Chelsea have had a rusty start to the season; they find themselves at No.10 in the Premier League points table with just two wins in five appearances so far.
