Tiger Shroff has always left his fans stunned with his daredevil stunts and action sequences ever since he made his debut with Heropanti. He is frequently seen flaunting his dance abilities and a lean body. He is a black belt in Taekwondo and has studied other martial arts as well. Tiger recently revealed that he almost bagged a role in Spider-Man after auditioning for the film."I had auditioned for Spider-Man, I had sent them my tapes, and they were quite impressed. My pitch to them was that Iâ€™d save you a lot of money on your VFX because I can do most of what Spider-Man can do. I was quite close to being a part of that," Tiger said during his interview with Connect FM.
