Global Athlete defined it as a totally unacceptable situation What was denounced by the Belgian athlete Kim Meylemans an absurd event a few days before the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics Upon her arrival in China Meylemans tested positive for Covid and therefore according to the regulation she would have had to comply days of isolation inside the Olympic Village She could have participated in the life of the Village but alone therefore eating alone sleeping in an isolated room and so on Instead what happened is a completely different story Hello everyone Some of you have read the good news that I was sent out of the isolation facility We thought this would mean I could go back to the Olympic Village We never entered the Village gates but they transferred me to another facility where I am now denounced Meylemans on social media asking for help Should I stay here others days isolated without seeing anyone and testing myself at least twice a day I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;ll ever be allowed to enter the Village Obviously this condition is heavy for me So I ask all of you to dedicate some time to me and try to make my story known because I don&#39;t think I can bear all this much longer After the complaint, Global Athlete commented negatively on what happened and the IOC intervened immediately Meylemans was provided with support and placed in a single room inside the Olympic Village
