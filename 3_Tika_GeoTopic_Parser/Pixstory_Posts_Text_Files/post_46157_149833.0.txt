Common shopping mistakes one should avoid 💁🏻‍♀️
📌Impulsive shopping - If you like something but if you are skeptical then avoid buying it immediately . Use the 15 minutes golden rule - Divert yourself for 15 minutes from the piece you were about to buy impulsively and then post 15 minutes if you still think it’s something you need then you can buy it ! 
📌Not considering the multi-utility factor - Buying styles that cannot be re-styled will end up adding a lot of clutter in the closet .
📌Buying everything from same brand/store - Avoid shopping from the same brands /stores as they will end up creating a very monotonous style for you. Keep on switching the places you shop from as this will help in reviving your style every single time .
📌Buying styles that ain’t suitable for you - Styles that you personally feel don’t complement your body type or don’t enhance your undertones should be avoided as doing this will always leave you in dilemma of “I don’t have anything to wear”.
📌Buying similar styles - Avoid buying similar styles just because you feel they are safe to go with . (For eg -Buying those same black jeans because you feel they make you look slim) This will restrict you from experimenting .
📌Buying without planning - Avoid going shopping without planning, It’s important to plan the styles you need to buy , colours you should experiment with , styles to experiment , budget etc . this will help in more focused shopping and will avoid impulsive buys .
📌Running behind trends - Opt for styles that go with your personal style instead of running behind trends .
📌Shopping when you are tired or not in the mood for it - Good mood = Awesome shopping . Avoid shopping when you are not in a mood for it as this will lead to bad shopping choices and impulsive buy . 
Happy shopping Everyone 🛍️❤️✨
