National Cinema Day was a resounding success for Brahmastra Part One- Shiva. The Ayan Mukerji fantasy epic saw a huge jump in ticket sales and collections on Friday due to reduced ticket prices on the day. As per trade sources, Brahmastra earned ₹11 crore nett in all languages on Friday, a huge jump from just over ₹3 crore the previous day😱😱😱😱😱😱As most theatre chains and halls sold all tickets at flat ₹75, footfalls dramatically increased. After advance bookings for Friday reached record levels, on-spot booking also saw a huge rise. On Friday, Brahmastra sold close to 15 lakh tickets, netting ₹10.80 crore in all languages in India. The film had earned around ₹3.2 crore on Thursday, making the intra-day jump a whopping 240%, one of the highest-ever in recent times. Many halls across the country reported houseful shows much in advance, even for late night and early morning shows. 😍😍😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱The collections and sales are likely to go down over the weekend as regular pricing will be back nationwide now. But the resurgence should push the film to have a strong third weekend, which makes it likelier to have a healthier lifetime run.💯💯💯With this, the film has now crossed ₹380 crore worldwide gross, and is inching towards the ₹400-crore mark. Given its reported budget of ₹410 crore, the film still needs a strong third week to enter the hit zone. Regardless, the film has managed to bring audiences back to the theatres something many recent Bollywood releases had failed to do✅✅✅✅
