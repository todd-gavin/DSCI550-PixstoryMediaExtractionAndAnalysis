Arjun Kapoor often makes honest conversations and this time when the Ek Villain Returns actor graced Karan Johar s show Koffee With Karan along with sister Sonam Kapoor spoke about a lot of things from his personal to professional life On the show Arjun even revealed how he thought of Malaika s son Arhaan Khan before dating her as he too has been at that place in his dysfunctional family He admitted that he loves Malaika but cannot jump on her as she has had a family and son and he equally respects that He said I think somewhere I have lived the life being on the other end of the spectrum I grew up in a disjointed or dysfunctional situation where it was not the easiest being a son having to see what was going on around and understand it but still having to respect it and accept it So somewhere there was an understanding in my head about how I should try and ease everybody into it including the first people around us I can t just jump on her
