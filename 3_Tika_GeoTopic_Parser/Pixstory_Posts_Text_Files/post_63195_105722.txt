I m a teenager I don t get the grades you want me too I don t act like you want me too I get an attitude on the unexpected times I don t dress like you want me too You always think I m ungrateful You make me feel as if I m not worth it The things you say hurt me The things you say are not always accurate Please think before saying anything you never know if you might be hurting me am only teenagers for a little while Let me go out and have fun Let me bring boys over without being accused of me dating them Let me go to sleepovers I m a teenager
