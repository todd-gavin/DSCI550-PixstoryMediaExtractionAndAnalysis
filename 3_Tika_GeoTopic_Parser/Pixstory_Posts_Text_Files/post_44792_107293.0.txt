Metal and finger to wear emerald for astrological benefits

The metal in which the gemstone is set is an important factor to get good results for the gemstone. This seat is like the throne of the planetary lord whose gemstone is being worn.

The emerald should be worn in gold or silver in the little finger after consecration as the mount of mercury is located just below the little finger on the palm. In rare cases as per the astrologer’s recommendation it can also be worn in the ring finger.

The emerald can also be worn in the neck as pendant touching the thymus gland area (just above the first rib bone). The chain of the pendant can be of gold or silver. Adjust the chain as per your height so that the gemstone touches the thymus gland area.Mantra-Sacred chants for energizing Emerald

Gemstones that are incompatible with the Emerald

One should not wear red coral, natural pearl, moonstone and ruby along with 
the emerald gemstone unless specifically recommended by an expert astrologer. Only in certain special conditions and gain of specific objectives even mutually inimical gemstones are recommended. However this should 
happen only after thorough analysis of the chart in detail and the recommendation should come from an expert.
