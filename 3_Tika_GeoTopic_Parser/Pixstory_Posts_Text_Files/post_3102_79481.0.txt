Twitter has added a new feature, ‘downvote’ – a downward arrow, to let users express their ‘dislike’ for a tweet, just as they’ve been clicking that heart-shaped button to show their ‘like’. Dislike or disagreement was not something the micro-blogging site had allowed so far, so why it is following Reddit and YouTube now? It will of course help users highlight objectionable content. But that depends on the profile of users. Equally or more likely is the scenario in which the new feature ends up becoming a tool for trolling. If Twitter aims to improve the discourse on the platform, with more content moderation, then ‘downvote’ is just crowd-sourcing that task.
 
Twitter had announced this feature in July and started its rollout Thursday in phases. It is available in some parts of the US, and will come up soon elsewhere. Announcing this “experiment” on the global audience, it said, “We learned a lot about the types of replies you don't find relevant and we're expanding this test –– more of you on web and soon iOS and Android will have the option to use reply downvoting”: https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1489351648245956613

Downvotes aren’t public (the tweet’s author won’t see it), but they'll help inform Twitter of the content people want to see. Dislikes won’t change the order in which replies show up.

“We’re always looking for new ways to increase healthy participation and engagement on Twitter. We are still in the learning stage of this experiment and are looking to gain a better understanding of how Reply Downvoting could help us better surface the most relevant content for people on Twitter in the future,” Twitter spokeswoman Celeste Carswell said: https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/04/twitter-downvote/

Among early reactions, many users welcomed it saying it’d help curb harassment, trolling and misinformation. Yes, if there’s ‘like’ option, then there should be ‘dislike’ too. Users can downvote fake news, hate speech and so on. But that also depends on the profile of users engaged in the conversation. With an army of trolls, some organizations can silence some intervention that was actually in public interest.
