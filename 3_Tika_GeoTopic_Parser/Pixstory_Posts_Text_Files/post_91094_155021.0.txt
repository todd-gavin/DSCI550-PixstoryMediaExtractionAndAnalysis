The shooting of the film wrapped on the year 2021 itself and the actress shared a sweet note on Instagram for her father and team, “It`s a wrap! #Milli My first film with papa, of whom I`ve only heard stories of all my life as a producer. But after working with you, it feels so cool to say that!! I finally know what everyone means when they say you give your heart and soul to each film you take up. That isn`t the only reason this film is so special to me- it`s been the most inspiring journey to work with someone so completely consumed by his focus and love for cinema-like @mathukuttyxavier sir."
