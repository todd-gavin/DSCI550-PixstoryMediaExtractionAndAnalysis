How much do you consume? Since 1930, whole-grain wheat-based, high-fiber biscuits have been a staple of Australian cuisine. 

As CNN points out, in comparison to Weetabix sold in other countries, this variety is smaller, sweeter, and more shaped like a brick. It frequently blended with a few Queensland bananas, strawberries, or a teaspoon of sugar. And milk, of course. 

Australian kids are Weet-Bix kids, proclaims the brand's catchy commercial jingle. Unless you live in New Zealand, where it's amusing to note that New Zealand children are also Weet-Bix children.

Do you like it? Personally, I love it because it reminds me of home and is a comfort food for me!
