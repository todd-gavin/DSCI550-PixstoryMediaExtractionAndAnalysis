The coronation ceremony is an occasion for peasantry and celebration, but in royal families, it has many religious values attached to it.
After the death of Queen Elizabeth, her son King Charles became the monarch of the United Kingdom and the head of the state of 14 other realms.
In the coronation ceremony are representatives of the Houses of Parliament, Church and State. 
"During the ceremony, the Sovereign takes the coronation oath. The form and wording have varied over the centuries. Today, the Sovereign undertakes to rule according to law, to exercise justice with mercy - promises symbolised by the four swords in the coronation regalia (the Crown Jewels) - and to maintain the Church of England."
