Adult movie star Stormy Daniels has called former first lady Melania Trump a "vapid b****" in a harsh attack on the woman she allegedly claimed to have had an extramarital affair with while staying at a hotel. 

7news reported that Daniels previously avoided mentioning Melania when discussing "that night" in a hotel with Donald Trump, but now the proud director of a pornographic movie has switched her venomous attack from the "orange elephant in the room" to the president's spouse. 

In a historic interview with 7NEWS Spotlight that will appear on Sunday night, Daniels criticises the former first lady for the first time, calling her a "bad person" who provided no useful leadership while she held the position alongside her husband during his tenure as the president.

“I was very quiet about her in the beginning for two reasons,” she tells interviewer Steve Pennells.

“One, she had nothing to do with it,” she said, in reference to her famous night with Trump, who was at the time a television celebrity and leading businessman. “You know, it’s not fair. She’s a mom. She had a young child. I respect that.

God knows what this is all about!
