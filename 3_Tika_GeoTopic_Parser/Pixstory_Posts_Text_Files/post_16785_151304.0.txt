The film’s box office collection grew by almost 25 per cent to 30 per cent on Saturday, reported Bollywood Hungama. Therefore, it earned in the range of Rs 13.25 to 13.75 crore (One of the most highly anticipated films of this year, Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha had minted only Rs 7 crore on its second day). The major growth happened at the multiplexes in the metro cities, but the single screens showed a downward trend. However, if Hrithik and Saif continue to pull in the audience on Sunday as well and Vikram Vedha records a good weekend total, there are chances of the film sustaining at the ticket counters until Diwali.
