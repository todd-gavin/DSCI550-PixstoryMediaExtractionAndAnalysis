Hurricane Fiona is very powerful. I hope everyone reaches safety soon. If you're in the area when the hurricane is approaching, take the following precautions to ensure your safety:
- Stay indoors if possible. Hurricanes are strongest in low-lying areas where flooding is likely.
- Protect your windows from flying debris by placing boards or other materials between the window and outside wall. 
- Secure doors and windows to prevent them from being blown open by wind or rain. But don't try to fix or replace anything that does not possess much a threat during the storm; wait until it's safe to do so. Keep anything that can hurt you somewhere it can't reach you. 
- Keep a supply of food, water, and emergency supplies ready in case you're unable to leave your home. 
- Make sure you have an evacuation plan in place.
- Stay off the roads as much as possible possible. If you must go out, drive slowly and use headlights to make it easier to see.
- If you do have to leave your home, try to evacuate in a group and take all of your belongings with you.
- If power is outâ€” which they are, make sure that all candles are put out and all flammable materials are secured away from windows or doors. Also, save that energy as much as you can. Candles and lamps included.
