According to a story in the Daily Mail on Sunday citing the Sydney Morning Herald, Australian cricket legend Ian Chappell has formally ended his more than four-decade-long commentating career. 

According to reports, the veteran of 75 Test matches, who finished his successful career with more than 5,000 runs in the longest format, said his decision to quit the broadcasting booth was akin to his decision to retire from the workforce. 

After retiring from international cricket, where he led Australia in 30 Test matches, the cricket legend started his time in the media box.

â€˜I remember the day when I knew I'd had enough of playing cricket,' the 78-year-old, who signed in 1980 with Channel 9 and has worked with the ABC, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I looked at the clock and it was five past 11 on a day of play and I thought, 'S***, if you're clock-watching at that time, I have to go,' Chappell was quoted as saying.
