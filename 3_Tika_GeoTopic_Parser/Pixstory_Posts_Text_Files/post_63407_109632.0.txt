After the third wave driven by the omicron sub-lineage BA.2 peaked in end of January this year with over 0.33 million cases per day, there has been a small bump in the number of daily cases reported in the first fortnight of June and a slightly bigger increase in the last one week to touch over 13,200 cases on June 17, but the rate of increase has been small and restricted to a few states and some Major cities. The rate of growth of active cases has also been low. While the sun-lineage BA.2 is still the dominant strain in India, BA.4 and BA.5 seem to be causing the new cases. The small increase in testing in the past week could be a reason for the more cases reported. The seven-day average test positivity rate doubled from less than 1% in early June to over 2% by mid-June and has been increasing incrementally since then to 2.7% on June20. Increasing the number of daily tests will result in more detected. But with a large percentage of the adult population fully vaccinated and a sizable percentage also infected, the focus should be more on hospitalisation and deaths are not daily infections. There has been a slight increase in hospitalisation in a few states, but there is no cause for alarm. However, there has not been any increase in daily deaths. The small bump in daily cases seen in a few states for the last three weeks therefore does not appear to mark the beginning of a new wave.
