We call this part of our campus the birds park This is just part of what I have captured There s more to this The block my classes are held in is just adjacent to this park It s popularly known as the invisible block because it s nestled between shady trees and surrounded by bird enclosures on either side It s a marvelous sight to be greeted by the geese honks and the chittering of love birds in the morning It s also just great to sit in the park and have big roosters and hens pecking around you for food
