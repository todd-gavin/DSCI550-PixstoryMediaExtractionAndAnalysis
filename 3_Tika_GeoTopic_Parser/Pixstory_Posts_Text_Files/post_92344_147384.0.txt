Unbelievable experience watching PSG Féminine vs BK Häcken in the UWCL au stade Jean-Bouin. A win to top it off. Thank you Pixstory for this opportunity and absolutely love what you guys are doing to build a safe social media platform. It’s so important to have a abuse free environment for fans to come forward and voice their opinions without hate. Look forward to more!
