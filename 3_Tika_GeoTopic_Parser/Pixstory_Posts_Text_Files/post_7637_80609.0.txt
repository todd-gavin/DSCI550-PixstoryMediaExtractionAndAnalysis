Some more exclusive still of LOTR: The Rings of Power have just been released and Vanity Fair have been allowed to view the first three episodes of the series and they've said that its lavish, mythological and the series really looks likes it belongs to Tolkien's Legendarium.
The series is set in the Second Age of Middle- Earth,  after Morgoth was defeated and Suaron has disappeared. We'll see a fairly young Galadriel not the one we saw in LOTR Trilogy, she'll be ferocious yet wise, we'll also see a younger Elrond. 
The series will have multiple storylines and the showrunners have a vast playground as Tolkien didn't exactly write a proper novel around the Second Age.
The series will range from  the dwarf mines of the Misty Mountains to the high politics of the elven kingdom of Lindon and the humans’ powerful, Atlantis-like island, Númenor.
