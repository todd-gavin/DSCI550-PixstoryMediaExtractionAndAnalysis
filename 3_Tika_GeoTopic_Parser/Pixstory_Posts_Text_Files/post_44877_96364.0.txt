Daniel Agger

Agger, another seasoned Liverpool defender, earned his 100th Premier League appearance
that season and handed over the vice-captaincy to Henderson when he left for Brondby in 2014.

Jose Enrique

Enrique had also gone to Liverpool from the North East that summer, signing for £7 million from
Newcastle United just two days before the match with Sunderland, and later that season he
filled in for Reina after he was sent off against the Magpies.

However, injuries ravaged his final three seasons at the club, forcing him to return to his
homeland of Spain with Zaragoza.

Dirk Kuyt

Meanwhile, Kuyt is regarded as one of Liverpool's greatest cult figures.

Lucas Leiva

Lucas certainly fits the criteria as an ultimate cult hero at Liverpool, having played for the club
for a decade, making just over 350 appearances and scoring seven crucial goals.

Henderson paid respect to his long-serving teammate before the Brazilian's departure in 2017,
telling the club's official website:

“In simple terms he sets the standard of professionalism and attitude of what it is to be a
Liverpool player."

“In the dressing room there is no-one who is respected or admired more.”

Charlie Adam

The fact that many people accepted those bogus Craig Bellamy statements on Adam's arrival
aptly sums up the midfielder's Liverpool tenure.
