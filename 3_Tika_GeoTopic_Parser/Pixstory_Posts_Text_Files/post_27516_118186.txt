The Jumbo Visma of Wout Van Aert and above all of the yellow and polka dot jersey of Jonas Vingegaard got their hands on the edition of the Tour de France In the fifth success in stages for the Dutch team, Cristophe Laporte won today, a fugitive from the first hour who did not get up feeling the arrival of the large group ready for the sprint and instead has relaunched his attacking action ahead of the sprinters by a handful of meters The Frenchman thus interrupts the fasting of transalpine cycling which had lasted since the first stage of the edition when Alaphilippe triumphed Obviously nothing changes in the general with Vingegaard who keeps the advantage over Tadej Pogacar waiting for the km time trial which tomorrow, barring sensational surprises, will award the final victory to the Dane Instagram photo letourdefrance
