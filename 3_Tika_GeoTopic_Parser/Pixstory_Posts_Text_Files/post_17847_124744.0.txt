Johnny Depp has returned to work following his defamation action against Amber Heard. This time, the actor is interested in more than just movies; he is also involved in music and commercial endorsements. Depp has just inked a multi-year contract with Dior, which will give him a seven-figure salary.

It's for the same Sauvage fragrance that JD previously advertised, while other firms withdrew out of arrangements with the actor following Amber's abuse allegations. However, the tide appears to be turning for the Pirates of the Caribbean star, as his career is resuming and he will soon be seen on film.

For those who are unaware, Johnny Depp is reprising his role as King Louis XV in the French-language film Jeanne du Barry, formerly named 'La Favorite.' This was disclosed immediately following Amber Heard's highly publicised slander trial. It will also be his first feature film role since Minamata in 2020, his first in French, and his first significant film since the trial.

While we're on the subject, Why Not Productions has released the first look at Johnny Depp as King Louis XV. It depicts the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory star dressed as the unpopular king. He wears a white wig and his face is powered, like emperors used to do in the past. However, it is only a headshot and does not portray the whole appearance.

Depp is towards the side, his eyes covered by a dark cloth. In the midst of all of this, the actor is making news due to leaked court documents revealing some personal information about him. For those who are unaware, a few JD followers unlocked the documents in order to uncover information about Amber Heard.
