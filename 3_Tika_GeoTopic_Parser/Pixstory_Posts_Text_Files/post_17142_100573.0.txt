Sunny Deol was Chandraprakash Dwivedi’s first choice for the role of Prithviraj Chauhan. When they were shooting Mohalla Assi in Varanasi five years ago, Dwivedi and Deol had long discussions on Prithivraj. In their discussions Dwivedi and Deol covered a lot of topics about the film and the character, from what the final look and feel should be to the character’s dialect and mannerisms. They had even discussed the look and voice-quality of the character,” a source was quoted as saying by Bollywood Hungama.
