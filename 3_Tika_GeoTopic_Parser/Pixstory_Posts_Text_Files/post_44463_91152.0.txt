The thief broke into an upstairs bedroom in Holland Park, West London, ignorant of David, 46, Victoria, 47, and Harper, ten. When horrified son Cruz got home with friends after a night out, he discovered the robbery at the Beckham family's London house. While his parents were in the house, he noticed that a spare bedroom had been looted, with broken window glass strewn across the floor.

While he and Cruz searched the Â£40 million mansion, the 17-year-old notified his father David, who dialled 999. Victoria is thought to have stayed with her ten-year-old daughter Harper. The masked raider had vanished, leaving behind tens of thousands of pounds in designer and electronic items.
It's unclear if he was disturbed, but he's suspected of being part of a gang that targeted at least two other adjacent homes on the same night.

The "invasion" of their home in Holland Park, West London, is reported to have "shaken up" former England captain David, 46, and fashion designer Victoria, 47.

In the past, the pair has faced stalkers and kidnap threats. "Unfortunately, the Beckhams were the victims of some quite professional thieves operating in the neighbourhood," a source stated.
Following the burglary, the Beckhams are alleged to have requested a security evaluation of their London house. On February 28, the day after the break-in, a forensic examination was conducted.
One of the nearby properties that had been broken into was also vacant. Another house on the block was also targeted, but the thief was unable to gain inside. The Metropolitan Police said they are investigating late last night, but said it was unclear whether the bandit was acting alone or with others.

"Police were contacted at 00.37 hours on Tuesday, March 1 to reports of a burglary at a domestic residence in the W11 district of Kensington," a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.
