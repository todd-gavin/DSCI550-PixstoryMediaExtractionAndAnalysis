One of the most interesting studies in the last few years, carried out at Yale University, found that mindfulness meditation decreases activity in the default mode network (DMN), the brain network responsible for mind-wandering and self-referential thoughts – a.k.a., “monkey mind.” 

The DMN is “on” or active when we’re not thinking about anything in particular, when our minds are just wandering from thought to thought.

 Since mind-wandering is typically associated with being less happy, ruminating, and worrying about the past and future, it’s the goal for many people to dial it down. 

Several studies have shown that meditation, through its quieting effect on the DMN, appears to do just this. 

And even when the mind does start to wander, because of the new connections that form, meditators are better at snapping back out of it.
