Priyanka Gupta - An Economics graduate sets up a tea stall outside a Girls College in Patna . 
With a slogan on the banner of her tea stall : 
Log kya sochenge, agr yeh bhi hum sochenge, toh log ky sochenge . 
Breaking stereotypes & entrinched norms of assigning dignity based on the kind of job one does, this girls sets an example that when faced with difficulty, instead if sitting unemployed she is doing something to earn her living. 
Not being able to find a job for 2years after her graduation, priyanka decided to open up a tea stall taking inspiration from Prafull Billore. 
She says if there can be a 'chaiwala ' then why can't a 'chaiwali'. 
She sets example for the youth of India that no job/ work is high or low or good or bad, if you have the will to be independent you can do wonders not caring what the society has to say about  it.
