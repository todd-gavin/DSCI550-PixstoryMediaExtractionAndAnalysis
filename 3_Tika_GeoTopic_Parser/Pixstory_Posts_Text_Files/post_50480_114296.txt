Well it s my first time staying in Delhi and I am missing monsoon so badly There is huge humidity in Delhi and no rains at all sometimes I feel like maybe living in Rajasthan can even much better than staying in Delhi in summers because its just so not tolerable Though the monsoon embraced the capital in an impressive manner on June giving the first spell of heavy rainfall this season scanty precipitation in the subsequent days has led to a gradual rise in maximum temperatures Hope things will become better some day
