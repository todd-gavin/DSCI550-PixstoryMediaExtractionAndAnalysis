 Activision Blizzard’s newest first person shooter is in sight as Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is nearing its launch date. In a recent update by the company regarding the game, the company has said that players will need to connect their mobile phones to Battle.net (Blizzard Entertainment’s online gaming platform) to play the game and that mobiles with pre-paid numbers may not work.
This news comes following the slew of DDOS (Distributed Denial Of Service) attacks on Overwatch 2 and the controversial SMS Protect mechanic, the phone-linking system in use by Overwatch 2 and apparently soon in Modern Warfare II. 
The SMS Protect is a two step authentication system that aims to defend players by verifying ownership as well as save them from online abuse and harassment by suspending or outright banning disruptive and non cooperative players as well as bots and fake accounts.
The phone linking system is not new and is not what initially the sole reason for the controversy, but rather that the SMS Protect didn’t allow certain numbers like prepaid and VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) numbers, thus restricting them from playing Overwatch 2.
Then of course, there’s been concerns with giving Activision Blizzard access to people’s personal phone numbers and the prospect of what they could do in the future with that data. 
In fact, the system proved so unpopular with fans, that Blizzard would later make changes to the system for Overwatch 2 as they apologised for the game’s launch issues.
At the moment, it’s unclear if all Warzone 2.0 players will need a mobile phone number to play that game once it arrives because since 2020, Infinity Ward has made all free to play Warzone players on PC go through a two step authentication process.
