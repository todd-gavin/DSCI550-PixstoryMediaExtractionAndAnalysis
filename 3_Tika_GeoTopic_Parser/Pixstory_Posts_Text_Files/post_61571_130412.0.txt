On Tuesday, August 17, WWE filed for the trademark for "DAMAGE CTRL." This appears to be the name for Bayley's new stable with Dakota Kai and IYO SKY.
The group has been dropping "Control" references in their social media posts since they formed at SummerSlam. On Tuesday morning, Bayley made a "DAMAGE CONTROL" reference on Twitter.
Bayley, SKY, and Kai appeared last night during Friday Night SmackDown during the Women's Tag Team Tournament match that featured Toxic Attraction's Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne against Natalya and Sonya Deville.
