Between and a series of heat waves hit all regions of the Mediterranean basin causing mass mortality events in various marine species such as corals, sponges, macroalgae and even fish According to an international research published in the journal Global Change Biology in which the Institute participated for biological resources and marine biotechnology of the National Research Council Cnr Irbim these phenomena have affected thousands of kilometers of Mediterranean coasts from the Alboran Sea to the eastern coasts between the surface and the meters of depth Unfortunately, the results of the work show for the first time an acceleration of the ecological impacts associated with climate change an unprecedented threat to the health and functioning of its ecosystems The interaction between warming and the presence of new pathogens in marine environments is also worrying, with effects that are still poorly understood From the exception to the norm the climate crisis is seriously affecting marine ecosystems around the world and the Mediterranean a particularly important hotspot explains Ernesto Azzurro researcher at Cnr Irbim The data provided by the study made it possible to demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between the duration of heat waves and the incidence of events of mortality The mass mortality events in the Mediterranean are equivalent to the consecutively observed bleaching events also in the Great Barrier Reef suggesting that these episodes are already the norm rather than the exception underlines Carlo Cerrano of the Marche Polytechnic University The research was carried out in collaboration with over research groups from countries which has made it possible to detect the incidence and severity of the phenomenon in every corner of the basin The authors are working on strengthening scientific cooperation at all levels in order to raise the drama of the climate emergency in progress which must be considered today in all managerial and political decisions
