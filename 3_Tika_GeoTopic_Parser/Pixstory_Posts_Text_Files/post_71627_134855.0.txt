Prologue continues .....
Babur is an interesting figure in the history of India. His name evokes political controversy even now. He had literary inclinations and he was a lover of flowers and gardens. He wrote Baburnama, a memoir that revealshis personality. He was a ruthless warrior, but a great lover of poetry. Heconstructed gardens and fountains but knocked down a lot of Hindu temples and killed a lot of people. He was a curious mixture of cruelty and elegance.
The impression one gets from history books and other literature onMughal history is that Babur became disillusioned after his conquest ofIndia. He became nostalgic about his motherland and the comforts of the social life back home. He could not like India nor did he think much ofthe people here. His perceptions were different. Babur wrote:
“Hindustan is a place of little charm. There is no beauty in itspeople, no graceful social intercourse, no poetic talent orunderstanding, no etiquette, nobility or manliness. The arts and crafts have no harmony or symmetry. 
There are no good horses,meat, grapes, melons or other fruits. There is no ice, cold water, good food or bread in the markets. There are no baths and no madarassas (Muslim schools). There are no candles, torches or candlesticks... one nice aspect of Hindustan is that it is a large country with lots of gold and money.”
