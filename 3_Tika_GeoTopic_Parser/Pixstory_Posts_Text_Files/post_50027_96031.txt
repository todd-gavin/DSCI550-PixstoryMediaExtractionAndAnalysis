TS Eliot is often referred to as the face of modernism Modernism is the rejection of everything old and traditional and full of experimentation which does not limit to form but also continues in themes Modernism was also mainly represented by the direction toward fragmentation free verse contradictory allusions paradox and multiple points of view different from Victorian and Romantic writing These modern features appeared in the works of Eliot Two of the most prominent poems where Eliot shows his modernism are The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock and The Waste Land Both poems are unique in theme and style some people even call them nonsensical Whatever it is what Eliot did was open the realms of creative freedom and not stick to the norms Abandoning all the jargon that exemplified the traditional literature all the rhymes and meters and accessing poetry in the form of it as an art to everyone
