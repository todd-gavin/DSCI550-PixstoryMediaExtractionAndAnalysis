Sodexo Australia has become a member of the Australian Food Pact, which is gaining traction as more food and beverage companies recognise the need of reducing food waste. 

FandD Business reported that Sodexo, along with initial members Simplot Australia, Woolworths Group, and Coles, is now assisting in the achievement of the aim of halving Australia's food waste, which costs the economy $36.6 billion per year, by 2030. 

Globally, 1.3 billion metric tonnes of food is wasted or lost. This statistic accounts for a third of all food produced each year. 

Sodexo will make financial contributions totaling more than $100,000 throughout the first three years of the agreement as part of its commitment.

Sodexo will also form an internal food waste team and develop an action plan, participate in frequent working groups, and quantify loss to track food waste reductions against agreed-upon goals. 

Darren Hedley, Sodexo Australia's country president and CEO APAC Energy & Resources, said the company understood its obligation to provide consumers with the greatest quality cuisine while also being socially and environmentally conscientious.

“The effects of food waste prevention are proven to be circular, reducing the dollars spent on food and the resources used to produce more food.

“For this reason, we’re deliberate in introducing sustainable food initiatives into our daily practices which lessen the environmental footprint of our operations and, more broadly, our industry,” said Hedley.
