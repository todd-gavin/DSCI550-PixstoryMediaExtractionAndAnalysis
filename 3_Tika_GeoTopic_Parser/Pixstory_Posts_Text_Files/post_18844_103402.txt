Nadal conquers the quarterfinals of Roland Garros but this time the Spaniard wins at the end of a marathon against Auger Alissime that lasted more than hours and minutes and not as easily as one would have expected The blister on his foot probably made itself felt because against the Canadian tennis player he didn&#39;t play his best tennis getting slipped several times and allowing too many breaks The final result reads for Nadal with the result of As you understand it wasn&#39;t a walk in health on the contrary a really hard fought match won thanks to experience and a last set played much better of opponent Nadal with today&#39;s to his victory at Roland Garros net of just defeats Two of these came at the hands of Djokovic precisely the opponent that Nadal will have to face in the quarterfinals And at the moment the Serbian seems in better shape But you know a match is always played between the two as Auger Alissime got off to a better start He made the first set his own by exploiting a break point In the second set Nadal started to break in and closed before and after making one think that the match would soon end Instead in the fourth set the Spaniard slowed down and Auger Alissime regained his courage until he equalized the count of the sets The Canadian miracle at that point seemed possible but once again history was written by Nadal With his service in favor a break point was enough for him
