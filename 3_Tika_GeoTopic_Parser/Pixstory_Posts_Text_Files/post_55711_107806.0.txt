This week's Guardian Essential report supports this vein of goodwill, most notably in our new prime minister's personal approval rating, which has risen by 40 points. 

The Guardian reported that while all election winners enjoy a post-election honeymoon, none has experienced such a dramatic change since we began polling. After their victory speeches, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison saw double-digit improvements, but the significant shift in opinions toward Anthony Albanese indicates something more. 

The issues that the new administration will face include regional instability, spillover effects from the Ukraine war, our pandemic-ravaged economy, neglect of the NDIS and aged care, and a crumbling hospital system. Most importantly, from a decade of wasted climate denial and inaction. 

For those of us who want to see a long-term progressive government, the key is to harness this positive mood shift, not to pretend away these challenges with a magic wand, but to own, share, and work our way through them.
