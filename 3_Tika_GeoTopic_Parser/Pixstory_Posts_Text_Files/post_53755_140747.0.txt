Along the River Elbe, in Germany and the Czech Republic, is a series of rocks that are submerged in all but the lowest water conditions. The locals call them “hunger stones” because they are warnings: if the stone is visible, then famine will follow. Carvings on the stones record droughts back to the 15th century, and one has text translating to “If you can see me, weep”.
As Europe faces what may be its worst drought in 500 years, these stones are appearing once again. Famine is not inevitable in the modern era, but this drought has arrived amid an energy crisis, and the lack of water threatens to make the energy shortage worse.
Water levels on Europe’s cargo-carrying rivers have been diminishing for much of the summer and are still low today. Barges have been carrying reduced loads so that they don’t sit so deep in the water.
Parts of the Rhine were effectively closed to traffic for a period, as shipping companies decided that there was not enough water to operate safely or economically. That was a concern for supply chains in general, but one result was that some German power stations were cut off from supplies of coal. Thanks to some rainfall, river traffic has resumed for now, but capacities are still reduced.
France, meanwhile, is not a country that worries about coal supplies – most of its electricity is nuclear. But nuclear plants need cooling water, and French rivers have been at historically low flow rates and – thanks to this summer’s heatwave – high temperatures.
