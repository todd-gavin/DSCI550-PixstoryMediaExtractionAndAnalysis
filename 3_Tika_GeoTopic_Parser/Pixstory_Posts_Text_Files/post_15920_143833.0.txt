Abstract
Objective
To assess the association of diabetes and mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders in youth, we examined the magnitude of overlap between these disorders in children and adolescents.
Study Design
In this cross-sectional study, we calculated prevalence estimates using the 2016–2019 National Survey of Children’s Health. Parents reported whether their child was currently diagnosed with diabetes or with any of the following mental, behavioral, or developmental disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, learning disability, intellectual disability, developmental delay, anxiety, depression, behavioral problems, Tourette syndrome, or speech/language disorder. We present crude prevalence estimates weighted to be representative of the U.S. child population and prevalence ratios (aPR) adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Results
Among children and adolescents (aged 2–17 years; N=121,312), prevalence of mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders varied by diabetes status (diabetes: 39.9% [30.2–50.4]; no diabetes: 20.3% [19.8–20.8]). Compared with children and adolescents without diabetes, those with diabetes had a nearly two-fold higher prevalence of mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders (aPR: 1.72 [1.31–2.27]); mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders (aPR: 1.90 [1.38–2.61]); and developmental, learning, and language disorders (aPR: 1.89 [1.35–2.66]).
Conclusions
These results suggest that approximately 2 in 5 children and adolescents with diabetes have a mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder. Understanding potential causal pathways may ultimately lead to future preventative strategies for mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders and diabetes in children and adolescents.
