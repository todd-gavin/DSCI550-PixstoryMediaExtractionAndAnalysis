Senator Joe Manchin has gotten a storm of criticism from the left and the mainstream media for being the deciding vote that consistently thwarts the ability of Democrats to move their agendas forward. Recently, for instance, the New York Times published an editorial completely devoted to criticizing this West Virginia senator.

In the past, I have praised Joe Manchin's independence, and I must now reprimand the media and the left for presenting him as the single culprit for obstructing the Democrats' agenda.

Clearly, Joe Manchin cannot unilaterally block any Democratic actions. Claiming that he is responsible for obstructing them is dishonest and misleading. These Senate moves, for which they accuse him, need a majority to go ahead, which implies that, in general, nearly every Republican is opposed to these steps, including Joe Manchin. Therefore, he is not the deciding vote since any one of the other Republicans can cause the measures to pass.

So, who is it then? Joe Manchin or the Republicans who are harming the goals of the Democrats. Instead of concentrating on a single senator, the media could have more success trying to convince one of the many other Republicans in the Senate.
