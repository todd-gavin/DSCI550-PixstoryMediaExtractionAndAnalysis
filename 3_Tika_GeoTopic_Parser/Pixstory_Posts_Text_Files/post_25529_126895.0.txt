Mind is like a fertile land. When you plant a seed, the earth mass will help it sprout and then grow into a full-fledged plant. Land, left to itself, may breed weeds. Similarly, mind acts on thought feeds, it acquires from various sources. It usually takes off on thought seeds carried over from the past, coming as they may as Karmic carryover. That sets the trends of one’s desire and mind trends, thus conditioning the mind one way or the other, which varies from person-to-person. For everyone would have gone through different courses of learning and unlearning as well as varied experiences in the past. They, however, play out at their optimal level when the person grows up to a level when his sense of independence takes the drive.

In between, during early childhood, how one is groomed, does also have a long- term impact on their mind and psyche. At that age, the child is not capable of comprehending the happenings in the right perspective. But, what they encounter, their impressions get imprinted in the deep realms of one’s mind. If per chance, the family atmosphere would be vitiated, it makes a dent particularly in their emotional framework, and with obvious consequences. That keeps influencing a person’s thought process even till late in life, unless otherwise consciously resolved.
