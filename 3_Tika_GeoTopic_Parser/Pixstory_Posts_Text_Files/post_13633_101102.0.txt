Women are more exposed to economic damage and environmental disasters than men. This is due to the unequal biological experience of women, especially in developing countries. Unequal access of women to financial resources and facilities and more responsibility of women in supporting their children are other factors influencing this issue.

 One of the reasons most women are vulnerable is their lack of equal access to resources. On the other hand, in countries where gender policies are against women, the issue of poverty and economic harm has a greater impact on women as a vulnerable group. This may be due to the fact that in the economic crisis in general, many factors affect the severity of mortality. for example; The greater the rate of economic development, government mismanagement, and the degree of inequality between men and women in society, the greater the number of victims, especially women.
