Sri Lanka scripted history by beating Pakistan in the Asia Cup final on Sunday September Coming into the tournament nobody gave them a chance to win the title but they have proved otherwise We have seen how the Lankans have struggled in the past few years since their star performers took retirement They were in continuous search of impactful players who could take their legacy forward but were unable to find any such However the search might be over up to an extent as the continental cup win will give them a major boost ahead of the T World Cup and restore fans faith in the national side Speaking of their performances in the six team tournament there was not one factor behind their marvelous victory but a couple of co existing factors Right from the beginning they believed in their capabilities and performed under no major expectations which usually adds pressure The Sri Lankan side played fearlessly without focusing too much on results and doing the process right Their approach helped bring the best out of the individuals as different names stood tall at different moments for the team To summarize it at once it was a complete team performance It wasn t like someone carried the team by doing the majority of work but all individuals came in with their small contributions which ultimately did the big job Sri Lankan batters did well collectively as the three names surpassed the run mark in the tournament Apart from the batters they had world class spinners who were complimented well by the inexperienced pace attack One of the biggest positives was their captain Dasun Shanka who was on point with his tactics and decision making It s fair to say that they deserved to win the Asia Cup and it s a big win not only for Sri Lanka but for the whole cricket fraternity Going forward we can only hope this side gets better and better enhancing the competition amongst the teams It would be interesting to see how they perform in the marquee event in October
