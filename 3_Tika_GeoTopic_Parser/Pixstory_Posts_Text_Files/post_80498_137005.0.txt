Body positivity ❤️🥰
Live your life on your terms 🤍
How you love yourself is how you teach others to love you.
You are lot more than your color 
You are lot more than your height , weight , size and body.
You are a beautiful soul & a powerful mind.
Don't let these pitty things overpower you .
You are stronger than you think.
Love yourself a little more everyday 
Embrace your insecurities
Accept your flaws 
Talk about it 
Normalise sharing your blemishes.💜✨
