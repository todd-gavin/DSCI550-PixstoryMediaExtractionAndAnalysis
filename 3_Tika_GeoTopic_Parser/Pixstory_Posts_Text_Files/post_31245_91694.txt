In general, the dating of archaeological sites and objects is carried out by combining stratigraphy or the determination of the chronological sequence and typology, i.e. the identification of the typical artefacts of the different periods within this sequence. Except for the areas with historical documentation, archaeologists only had this type of chronology available. relative in itself quite elastic until the invention of the radiocarbon or Carbon C method made it possible to date the remains of an organic nature and consequently the original sediments. Since then numerous other scientific dating techniques have been developed, most of which are radiometric based on the percentage of disintegration of particular radioactive isotopes it is possible to date an artifact by determining the extent to which its original radioactivity has decreased since the radiometric clock has been reset to zero Radiocarbon however does not allow us to date the remains of our first ancestors such as Homo habilis in this case it is necessary to combine different techniques such as the method of potassium argon that of thorium uranium inversions of the polarity of the earth&#39;s magnetic field and biostratigraphy DENDRCHRONOLOGY The fluctuations in the rate of carbon in the atmosphere make the dates determined by radiometry in a particular way those earlier il to C are more recent than they actually are Dendrochronology, i.e. the dating method using tree rings helped solve the problem By referencing a large number of trees, scientists have developed sequences of rings that date back to beyond BC By comparing the dates provided by the radiocarbon method applied to the wood of plants with the effective age of each plant determined through dendrochronology, scientists have elaborated a conversion table of radiometric dates into effective calendar dates Source lArcheology illustrated library of knowledge
