As football fans, we've witnessed some genuinely memorable events over the years. We've become so accustomed to forwards scoring 40, 50 goals per season that we've adopted it as a metric for evaluating their impact on their teams. Football has evolved from a defensive, tactical, and physical sport to one that is more offensive, possession-based, and fast-paced.

Robert Lewandowski (Bayern Munich)
Lewandowski has it all and is always one step ahead of the competition. His finishing ability is unrivalled, and he seems to be in the right place at the right time at all times. It's also not by chance: if he gets the ball, only one thing can happen.

Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United)
Ronaldo exemplifies how mental toughness can help you overcome adversity. Have you seen him in the Champions League so far this season? He's used to being ranked first or second in these polls, but at 37, and with Manchester United crumbling around him due to his lack of all-round ability, he'd return and start scoring.
