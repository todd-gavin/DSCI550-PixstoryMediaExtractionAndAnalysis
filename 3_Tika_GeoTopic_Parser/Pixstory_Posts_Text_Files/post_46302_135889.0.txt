Fat loss is a tricky thing ! And let's accept that we all have been there confused between doing strength training or cardio for fat loss ! 🤔
Well , according to me - the one and only way to loss fat is to get into calories deficit . And for that we make some nutritional changes in our diet and start exercising . Now while exercising we can either opt for cardio or strength training . 💪
But the main question is - which one is more efficient ?? 🤔
My answer is - Balance of both ! 😍👍
Strength training will help you in ; ✅
1 Boosting your metabolism
2 Building more muscles
3 Lose fat 
4 Improving range of motion 
5 Promote mobility and flexibility 
Cardio will help you in ; ✅
1 Improve Cardiovascular health
2 Regulate weight
3 Reducing risk of heart disease
The fun fact is - while cardio will make you burn more calories in a shorter period of time , strength training will help you burn calories not during exercising hours but also during the remaining time of your day . Yup , even when you rest and scroll on your couch ! ✅
My recommendation is - 
1 Strength training - 3-4 Times in week 
2 Cardio - Daily 10K steps and you can also dedicate 1-2 day specifically for high intensity cardio workout .
So , maintain a good balance between both the exercise and lose fat easily ! 💪✅
