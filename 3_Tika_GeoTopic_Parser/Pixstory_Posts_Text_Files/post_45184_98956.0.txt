The 41-year-old explains why the Indomitable Lions have a chance to win the Gulf nation's tournament. Cameroon can accomplish marvels at the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar, according to Samuel Eto'o, if they follow Jose Mourinho's example of Inter Milan winning the Champions League trophy in 2010.


The 41-year-old, who is currently the President of the Cameroonian Football Federation, was a member of the Inter team that won the triple in 2009-10, winning the Scudetto, Coppa Italia, and their first Champions League victory in 45 years, under the Portuguese maestro.


Cameroon will compete in the World Cup in Qatar, where they will be drawn in Group G alongside Serbia and Switzerland, and the former Barcelona and Chelsea midfielder feels they can make an impact. "I don't see why he can’t win it," Eto'o, who is now in Italy to announce a charity game in San Siro on May 23, told BeSoccer when asked if coach Rigobert Song can lead Cameroon to World Cup triumph.


"I believe that in order to win the World Cup you don’t need to be monsters or aliens, you need good preparation, a strong mentality, and a pinch of madness.


“I won a bit in my career and to do it I gave everything. I always take Inter as an example: no one at the beginning of the 2009-10 season thought we could win [the Champions League] and instead, Mourinho did something crazy, with a group of men and warriors.


Cameroon has had eight appearances in the World Cup finals, the first of which was in 1982, when they drew all three group games. Cameroon reached the quarter-finals in 1990 before losing 3-2 to England. In Qatar 2022, the Indomitable Lions will make their sixth appearance in the championships.
