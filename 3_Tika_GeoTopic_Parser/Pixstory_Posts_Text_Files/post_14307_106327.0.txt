Club Deportivo Guadalajara on July 22, Barcelona on July 26 and Real Madrid on July 30.

These are the opponents and the dates for the three summer fixtures Stateside, to be played at the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, the Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas and the Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles.

The Bianconeri head off on a summer tour from July 20-31. After the forced stop of recent years, Juve return to the States, just like in 2013, when one of the stopovers was Los Angeles, and in 2018, when instead they remained on the East Coast.

Three friendlies in three American cities as part of theÂ Soccer Champions Tour, the inaugural event organised by AEG, which alongside Juve, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Club Deportivo Guadalajara also involves another Mexican team, Club America.
