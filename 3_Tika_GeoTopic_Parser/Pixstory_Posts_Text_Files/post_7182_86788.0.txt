22 yards of deceit continues………


Ajay Sharma kept in touch with him and a relationship developed between the two, where M.K. was the benefactor and Ajay the beneficiary. Sure enough, Ajay was picked for India’s tour of New Zealand in the year 1990. Another player from Delhi in the Indian team,
waiting to be trapped by MK, was Manoj Prabhakar, on whom the shrewd MK had set his hawk- eyed sights.

During the New Zealand tour, Ajay Sharma provided critical inputs over phone to MK about pitches, weather conditions, composition of teams, chances of India winning or losing etc. MK used such inputs to his advantage and made big money, both in betting and taking bets from other punters.
The Indian cricket team returned home from New Zealand in March, 1990 having lost the three Test series 0-1. Later, the same year, India was to tour England but Ajay Sharma was dropped. 

On MK’s request, Ajay Sharma introduced him to his close friend Manoj Prabhakar. MK paid Rs. 40,000/- to Manoj Prabhakar as an advance for providing services similar to what Ajay Sharma had done from New Zealand. In addition, MK promised to buy him a Maruti Gypsy on return, if Manoj gave him (MK) useful information. Manoj Prabhakar did more than was expected of him. Besides providing information about pitch, weather etc, he underperformed in one of the Test matches, which ended in a draw. India lost the three Test series 0-1.

True to his word, MK bought Manoj Prabhakar a Maruti Gypsy with wide wheels. Through Manoj Prabhakar, MK was introduced to several international and India level players. The list, which is long, included venerated names like those of Aravinda D’Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, Martin Crowe, Salim Malik, Dean Jones and Brian Lara.
