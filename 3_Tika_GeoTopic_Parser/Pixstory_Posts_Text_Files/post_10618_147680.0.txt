Snehit, Patil upset higher seeds to reach men’s singles quarterfinals
Surat: Telangana’s F R Snehit and Maharashtra’s Deepit Patil packed off third seed Sanil Shetty and fifth seed Anirban Ghosh respectively to reach the quarterfinals of the men’s singles table tennis event in the 36th National Games here on Friday. The top two seeds, G Sathiyan and A Sharath Kamal as well as women’s No. 1 seed Manika Batra were made to work hard in the pre-quarterfinals.
Snehit, considered to be a promising talent, displayed a wide range of his strokes to get the better of left-handed Shetty in a match that could have gone either way. The Telangana lad drew first blood winning the opening game in extended points but Shetty imposed himself and took a 2-1 lead. Another marathon game helped Snehit restore parity. The players stayed neck and neck in the next few games with the youngster showing nerves of steel to clinch the match.
Earlier, Patil fought back from a 0-2 deficit to beat Ghosh 4-3. The Maharashtra paddler struggled with his focus and rhythm in the opening two games but when he found his bearing, he piled the pressure on his opponent. Ghosh did manage to win one more set in the match but his frustration was visible in his reaction to losing points and even got a red card.
Patil remained composed even while trailing 3-5 in the decider and closed the match by winning eight of the next 10 points. In the quarterfinal, he will face local hero Harmeet Desai, who thrashed Uttar Pradesh’s Sarthak Seth 4-0.
Manika survives Kushi scare
In the women’s singles, three seeded players were sent packing in the pre-quarterfinal stage while top seed Manika Batra was given a run for her money by Karnataka’s Kushi V, scraping through to a 3-2 win.
