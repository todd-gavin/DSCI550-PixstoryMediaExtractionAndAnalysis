After watching us go through a tough second half that saw us concede a penalty and be rescued by VAR on another, Mikel Arteta was delighted to return to north London with a 1-0 win at Leeds United.Bukayo Saka’s goal sealed the points that saw us extend our advantage at the top of the table to four points, but a gritty display saw us stave off our opponents who threw everything at us during a chaotic second half.Reflecting on the game, Mikel said: “It was a really tough one. We knew that; we expected a really chaotic game in certain periods. We extended that period too much, especially in the second half. “I think in the first half, we had some great moments, some incredible plays where we should have scored two or three goals, and we didn't. Then the second half, we started right from the kick-off in a really bad way. We conceded a goal that was disallowed, and we never got any momentum. We put ourselves in trouble in the first regulation, especially in build-up. “After that we never got a real kick of the game and be able to impose ourselves. But that said, as well, the resilience, the character, the personality, and as well, that willingness that I saw there from the players to win again, is what I really love.”
