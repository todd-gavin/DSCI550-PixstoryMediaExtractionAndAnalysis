After a three year run with Frank Vogel the Los Angeles Lakers decided to part ways with him after an underwhelming season The Lakers are going to need to nail their next head coaching hire especially because the clock is ticking on LeBron James career A couple of head coaching jobs are open meaning Los Angeles may have competition for some of their preferred targets As far as what their interview process will look like in the coming weeks it seems they are zigging a bit from normal practice Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reported on Friday night s pregame show that L A is interviewing candidates in batches They re doing this search a little differently than other teams might Typically teams will ask for permission on maybe up to a dozen candidates a large number start interviewing them one after another do sometimes two or three in a day on Zoom bring them in in person The Lakers what I m told they re going to do is essentially call for permission on a couple guys at a time talk to those coaches think about it and then move on to a next group of two perhaps three Los Angeles requested to interview Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach Darvin Ham and it sounds like he may be a front runner One coach they have called on permission to interview is Darvin Ham assistant coach in Milwaukee He s got a history as an assistant with the Lakers You look at the Mike Budenholzer coaching tree in the NBA Taylor Jenkins in Memphis Quin Snyder is from that coaching tree Kenny Atkinson who had success in Brooklyn and certainly Darvin Ham well regarded around the league He s certainly somebody the Lakers are going to take a long look at and he ll be part of this process Historically the Lakers have looked to hire people based on previous stints with the organization so people like Ham and Quin Snyder are easy people to link to their opening Either of them would be great options but it will be interesting to see which direction the front office ultimately goes with
