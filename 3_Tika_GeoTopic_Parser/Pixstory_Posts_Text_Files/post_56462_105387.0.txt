Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he will attend the G20 meeting in Indonesia later this year despite the Russian embassy signalling that President Vladimir Putin plans to attend.

Mr Albanese said he would attend the annual meeting of the leaders of the world's 20 largest economies, which is scheduled to be held in Bali this year, during his first bilateral overseas visit as Prime Minister. 

It comes amid many G20 member countries asking Indonesia not to invite Mr Putin because of its invasion of Ukraine. 

"I … [will attend] because the work of the G20 is critical at this time of global economic uncertainty," Mr Albanese said in a brief speech alongside Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

"It will be by working with Indonesia that we most effectively tackle the many challenges we face in navigating the post-COVID global economic recovery.

"I will work closely with President Widodo to help deliver a successful summit. And we discussed that this morning."

Former prime minister Scott Morrison had urged Indonesia to reject Mr Putin's presence, saying it would be "a step too far".

Mr Albanese was later asked his position on Mr Putin attending the summit.

"In terms of why I'll be attending, I'm focused on sitting with President Widodo, not President Putin," he said.

"It's in Australia's interest to have good relations with friends. The Indonesian presidency of G20 is important."

Mr Albanese said the Russian leader had attended previous meetings in Australia.

"That doesn't mean we agree with his stance," Mr Albanese said, before adding the invasion of Ukraine was "abhorrent" and "illegal". 

Mr Albanese said revitalising trade relationships with the world's fourth most populous country was a priority for his government. 

"Australia's relationship with Indonesia is one of our most important," he said.

"We're linked not just by geography, but we are linked by choice."
