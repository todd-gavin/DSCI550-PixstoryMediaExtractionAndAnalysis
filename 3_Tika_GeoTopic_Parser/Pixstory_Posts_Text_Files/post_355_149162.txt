I know it for a fact we would have been best travel buddies From the Welsh hills to Himalayas to Scottish Highland to Amazon I will gladly trust my life with you We had the same instincts We both saw nature as food and love One that was a little strange to our friends From plans to build traps to just the plain sighting we found joy in it together We lived close to nature and lived by norms of nature It s a different law a law that can only be understood if you know the nature so close I learnt so much from you and wish I spent more time It s a pity that we only traveled once But that one trip is worth a years of memories To a rebellious traveler To a born naturalist and a true human being Happy Birthday comrade rest in peace We miss you jacknissan peekayty
