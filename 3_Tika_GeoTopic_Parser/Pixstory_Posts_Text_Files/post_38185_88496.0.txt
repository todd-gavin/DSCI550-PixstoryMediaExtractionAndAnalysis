Hyderabad FC are crowned the Champions of the 2021/22 ISL season. The South Indian side win their first title since their inception. 

Kerala Blasters on the other hand suffered their third consecutive defeat in the Hero ISL finals.  The Blasters certainly had a good fan backing in the stadium but their "12th men" could not lead them over the line! 

Kerala Blasters took on Hyderabad to close out the 2021/22 ISL season. Both sides had their chances in the first half but they couldn't find the back of the net.

The deadlock was eventually broken in the second half when Rahul KP put the ball past Kattimani in the 70th minute. The HFC goalkeeper clearly misjudged the effort as Blasters took a 1-0 lead. 

The fans would have thought that this would have been enough but it was not to be as Sahil Tavora scored a scorcher of a goal in the 88th minute to level the score at 1-1. 

Courtesy of this magnificent effort, the game went into extra time. Both the sides again went at it for another 30 minutes. There were big chances for both HFC and KBFC but they failed to convert them. Eventually, both the teams were not able to convert and it went down to the penalty shootout to decide the winners.

Having made a huge mistake in the first 90 minutes, Laxmikanth Kattimani would have the last laugh in the penalty shootouts!

The Hyderabad goalkeeper saved three penalties in the shootout as his side emerged 3-1 victors in the penalty shootout!
