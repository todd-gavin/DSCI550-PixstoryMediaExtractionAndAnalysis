The 16 time world champion John Cena, is an inspiration to countless teens around the world. One such teen is Misha Rohozhyn of Ukraine. 

Cena traveled to Amsterdam after hearing the story of Misha a teenager with Down's Syndrome who fled Ukraine with his family and spent an entire afternoon with him.

Misha is a non-verbal 19-year-old who did not understand why he and his family had to leave his native city of Mariupol after their house was destroyed. His mother told him that they were going to meet John Cena to ease Misha's worries.

Cena commented that when he heard the story, he got very emotional, he was an hour away from Amsterdam and had 3 days off from shooting, so he immediately hopped on a plane and made his way to Amsterdam and fulfill a fan's lifelong wish. 

Cena also dressed Misha in all of his merch and clicked photos with him. Needless to say, Misha will remember this for a lifetime. 

Cena is well known for his philanthropy as he has granted 500+ wishes with Make-a-wish foundation
