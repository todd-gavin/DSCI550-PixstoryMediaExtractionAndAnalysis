The American team's identities may have changed, but their dominance has not. US News reported that at the women's basketball World Cup, the United States defeated China 83-61 on Saturday thanks to A'ja Wilson's 19 points, Kelsey Plum's 17 points, and their fourth straight gold medal. “It feels great,” said Wilson, who was selected as the tournament’s MVP. “We came here on a mission, we got it. We got gold. Now we’re going home with some hardware. It feels great to us. Australia was great to us. I didn’t see any kangaroos, but it’s OK because we are leaving with a gold.”This was one of the most powerful American teams in the illustrious history of the World Cup, which has now produced 11 gold medals for the country. For the first time, they have won four successive gold medals. It surpassed the two triumphs by the Americans by 20 points to become the largest victory in a gold-medal game.
