The activation of the body's immune cells in response to an injury or infection is what is called as inflammation. 

Inflammation needs to be there in order to have a proper  healing. But if it persists it can contribute to develop inflammatory related health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in others. 

Chronic inflammation could be because of ongoing infections, exposure to irritants and autoimmune disorders. Its not only because of that, but factors like age, stress and diet could also play a role in this. It is  challenging to find inflammation, but with certain inflammation biomarkers in the blood can indicate its presence. And one of them is Creactive protein. 

As per the research from 2021, vitamin D has been shown as a powerful anti-inflammatory effect,  and deficiencies in this nutrients could cause and add onto chronic inflammation. 

The link between vitamin D and CRP is still unclear and in a previous studies published in 2015 and 2020 it investigated on Vitamin D’s influence on CRP and no evidence was found to support the casual effect. 

A new genetic research from the University of South Australia, that was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, found out a link between low vitamin D levels and increased CRP in the blood. 

This findings from the researchers suggests that boosting vitamin D in people with deficiency can reduce chronic inflammation.
