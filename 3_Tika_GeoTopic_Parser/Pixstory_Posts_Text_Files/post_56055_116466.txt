Ah Sun flower BY WILLIAM BLAKE Ah Sun flower weary of time Who countest the steps of the Sun Seeking after that sweet golden clime Where the travellers journey is done Where the Youth pined away with desire And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow Arise from their graves and aspire Where my Sun flower wishes to go Ah Sun flower by William Blake is a multi layered poem that depicts a weary sunflower tired from counting the sun s progress Despite seeming quite reasonable this poem is fairly complicated There are several different possible readings and most readers will likely come away with different interpretations of what the sunflower is supposed to represent In the second stanza after explaining that the sunflower is weary of time the speaker says that it wants to join the Youth and the Virgin in what is presumably Heaven This poem can be found in Blake s Songs of Experience along with an engraving It was published along with twenty five other poems in It includes poems like London and The Lilly The latter was included on the same engraved sheet as Ah Sun Flower It followed Songs of Innocence which was published in and includes poems like The Chimney Sweeper and Laughing Song The poems in Songs of Experience are generally considered to be darker than those in Songs of Innocence The two books were eventually published together as Songs of Innocence and Experience
