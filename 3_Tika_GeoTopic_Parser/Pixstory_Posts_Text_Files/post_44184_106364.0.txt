When Hungary takes on Germany in a UEFA Nations League match at the Puskas Arena on Saturday, they will be looking for another memorable outcome against their League A Group 3 adversaries.


Under Hansi Flick, Germany has improved over the past year and is currently in third position in their group. After being pushed to a 1-1 draw by England in their previous match, Die Mannschaft will need to step up their game this weekend.


Hungary, on the other hand, is in second place in Group 3 and has consistently outperformed expectations this season. The hosts lost 2-1 to Italy last week and will be looking to avenge that loss in this match.





Hungary vs Germany: Probable Playing XI


Hungary : Peter Gulacsi; Adam Lang, Willi Orban, Attila Szalai; Loic Nego, Zsolt Nagy, Adam Nagy, Balint Vecsei; Roland Sallai, Dominik Szoboszlai, Adam Szalai


Germany :Â  Manuel Neuer; Lukas Klostermann, Antonio Rudiger, Niklas Sule, David Raum; Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka; Jamal Musiala, Thomas Muller, Leroy Sane; Timo Werner





Hungary vs Germany: Prediction



The goalscoring luck of a disciplined Hungary side on home soil may run out against a well-drilled German outfit, who will feel aggrieved not to have come away from any of their two opening encounters with all three points.


The Magyars will prove a stern test as ever, but Flick has an abundance of well-rested attackers and Bundesliga stars who are aware of and can quell the threat of Szoboszlai, which should ultimately lead to a professional performance and win for the visitors.


Prediction : Hungary 0-2 Germany
