Almost a year ago he had an accident that could have ended his career After that very bad moment today Tiger Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame An achievement that puts him among the best golfers of all time This is an important milestone in my career and there it took me years to reach it a long time I wish my father had been here to see me because he was the one who got me started playing but my mother will be there said Woods in an interview with Golf Digest in which he thanked his family several times for accomplishments Tiger Woods told of all his family&#39;s sacrifices of the hours in the car to reach the tournaments with alarm clocks at dawn without anyone ever complaining my mother who took me to all our youth tournaments in Southern California we&#39;d get up and go play league peewee then an underage tournament in riverside sometimes we&#39;d be in the car for an hour an hour and a half stuck on the road she never complained she kept score and explained how it went to my dad when we got home That&#39;s why it&#39;s so special to me The golfer entered the Hall of Fame despite still being active He hasn&#39;t yet thought about retiring at the moment I&#39;d like to see the Hall before entering it and here comes the golf nerd that I like to do in me part of the story so seeing how our sport developed is being part of this story that is really special to me
