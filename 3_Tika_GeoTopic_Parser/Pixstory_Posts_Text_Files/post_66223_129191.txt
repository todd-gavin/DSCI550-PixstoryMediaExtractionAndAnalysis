Most of the world s mountain glaciers remnants of the last ice age are retreating due to climate change But those in the European Alps are especially vulnerable because they are smaller with relatively little ice cover Meanwhile temperatures in the Alps are warming at around C per decade around twice as fast as the global average If greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise the Alps glaciers are expected to lose more than of their current mass by Many will disappear regardless of whatever emissions action is taken now thanks to global warming baked in by past emissions according to a report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Already Morteratsch is much changed from the glacier depicted on the region s tourist maps The long tongue that once reached deep into the valley below has shrunk back by nearly kilometers miles while the depth of the snow and ice pack has thinned by up to meters feet A parallel glacier Pers flowed into it until but has now receded so much that an expanding strip of grit lies between them
