New Apple Tv+ Korean Drama " PACHINKO"  to premiere on March 25.

Pachinko, the beloved epic historical novel by Min Jin Lee follows the trials and tribulations of Korean immigrants in turn-of-the-century Japan, which unfolds over four generations.

The main appeal of Pachinko is Leeâ€™s effortless weaving of individual characters within this timeline. Its main protagonist is Sunja, whose journey to Japan in the midst of poverty reveals a deep-rooted undercurrent of intolerance towards Koreans in the country. Her story entwines with the life of Hansu, a mysterious Korean merchant born into a rich Japanese family, along with a host of characters that are both Korean and Japanese.
