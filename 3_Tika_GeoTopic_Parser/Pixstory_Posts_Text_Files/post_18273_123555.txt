The friendly at Continassa played between Juventus and Atletico Madrid was also an opportunity for the two managements to talk once again about Alvaro Morata The striker returned to the team that owns him but the bianconeri would like to bring him to Turin Atletico Madrid ask for many money to sell him over million euros A lot too much for Juventus who had had him on loan in recent seasons Morata was also a protagonist on the pitch by scoring a hat-trick in the final In the post-match things for Juventus went equally badly Atletico Madrid do not come down from his requests also because Morata has shown that he can be useful It is possible that the Juventus management will put a stone on it
