In its first Performance Audit Report on the functioning of the Noida Authority, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has pointed out that there have been flaws in the tendering process and financially inadequate and ambiguous criteria were followed in the allotment of large plots of land (125 to 325 acres) in prime sectors in Noida for developing world-class sports infrastructure facilities. This has led to the selection of incompetent consortiums with weak financial capabilities that have failed to enforce the terms and conditions of the schemes. The lack of a monitoring mechanism related to the projects has resulted in non-existent sports infrastructure in the region for over a decade now.

825 acres of the prime land grabbed in the name of development of Sports Infrastructure

With a vision to hold international sporting events like the Commonwealth Games and Asian games in Noida City, the Noida Authority allotted 4 Sports City plots admeasuring 33,44,193 sqm (826.34 acres) of land in prime sectors of Noida from May 2011-July 2015 at the lease premium of Rs 5597.92 crores to a consortium of 6 Members led by a Software Company Logix Soft Tel Pvt Ltd of the Logix group in May 2011, a consortium of 9 members led by Xanadu Pvt Ltd of 3C group in May 2011, a consortium of 7 members led by the Lotus Green Developers Pvt Ltd of 3C Group in September 2014 and a consortium of 10 members led by ATS Home Pvt Ltd in July 2015. The allotment was made based on competitive bidding against a reserve price (RP) fixed by the Authority.

The Sport City schemes envisaged that the allottees would construct world-class integrated sports infrastructure and recreational facilities in 70% of the plot, and the remaining 30% plot area would be used for residential and commercial projects.
