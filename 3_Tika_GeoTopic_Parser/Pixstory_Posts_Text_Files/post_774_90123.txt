The Power of the Dog Jane Campion s western that isn t really a western is a masterpiece beautifully made brilliantly acted and endlessly thoughtful about the damaging consequences of social and sexual expectations The film is truly the year s best But Coda ticks so many boxes that Oscar voters usually love with its little movie that could backstory history making deaf cast and an emotiveness a far cry from Campion s restraint You might as well toss a coin to predict the outcome but Parasite s win two years ago is a good sign for artistic films so I m guessing The Power of the Dog will come through
