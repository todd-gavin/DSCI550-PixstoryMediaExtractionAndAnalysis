The hottest pepper in the world is continually altering—almost morphing. It seems like a new pepper is either developed or found every year.

The spiciest chilli in the world right now, nevertheless, has been among the top 10 since 2013, and keeps beating its own record!

If you're curious about how peppers are graded, SHU, or Scoville Heat Unit, measures a pepper's level of spiciness by counting the amount of capsaicinoids it contains.
The molecule in peppers that gives out the spiciness is called capsaicin.
Peak SHU values are shown on the pepper Scoville Scale.

Let's take a look at the chilli that doesn't stop burning, shall we? 

Carolina Reaper, the previous world champion, has been defeated, by itself! The Carolina Reaper is once again recognised as the hottest pepper in the world.

The Reaper, which was rated as the hottest in the world in 2013, was put to the test once more in 2018 with a greater SHU. This grants the reaper a renewed distinction as the hottest person in the world (71,000 SHU hotter to be precise).

With an average SHU of 1,641,000 SHU and a peak of 2.2 Million SHU, it was bred to be hot.

How hot, you ask? Let's compare: 

The Carolina Reaper is over 200 times hotter than the Jalapeño. 

Its potency is obvious with a single glance. The Carolina Reaper is unlike any other pepper in that it has a distinctive stinger tail. Being a hybrid of a Red Habanero and a Pakistani Naga, it has an amazing amount of heat.

Surprisingly, this pepper not only has heat but also a fantastic fruity flavour. That is, of course, before it vaporises your face.

So, do you think you're brave enough to try the hottest chilli of 2022?
