For the longest time, being pregnant meant investing in a brand new wardrobe of leggings, stretchy waistlines, and large flowy dresses in an attempt to cover a growing baby bump. For so long, concealing was the goal.

Today, Rihanna is redefining maternity fashion as a whole. By challenging the expectations of maternity fashion, she is fully embracing and flaunting the beauty of her baby bump. And why wouldn't she? 

Of course, this does not mean all mothers are expected to wear sexy and revealing clothes, but it is inspiring to see someone on her status and level maintain her sense of individuality through the changing of ber body. 

It is good to see someone challenging the norms of society that has been oppressive to women for so long. Your baby bump isn't something to be ashamed of. It's beautiful and life giving and worth flaunting. 

Go Riri! You slay!
