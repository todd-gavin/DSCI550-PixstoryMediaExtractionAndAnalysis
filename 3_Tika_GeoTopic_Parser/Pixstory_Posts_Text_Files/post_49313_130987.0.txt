St. Buchard Church in Germany has been hosting a 639-year performance based on avant-garde composer John Cage's "As Slow as Possible" since September 2001. Cage is also the composer of "4'33," a piece that comprises of four-and-a-half minutes of complete restsâ€”or, to put it another way, silence. The automated organ's performance is so slow that visitors must wait months for a chord change, and it is slated to end in 2640. The performance is so slow that the organ on which it is performed was not even finished when the concert started. In 2008, pipes were added to keep the music consistent.
So if you want to listen to the full piece, you might actually have to wait 618 more years for that.
