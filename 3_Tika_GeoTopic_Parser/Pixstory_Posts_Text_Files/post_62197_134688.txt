 When I first started meditating it was not what I was expecting My mind raced and I thought that it wasn t worth the effort Yet after the first few sessions I did notice that I felt calmer in my daily life I downloaded a few apps with guided meditations to help me along I recommend this to anyone who is starting a practice Guided meditations help you connect with yourself in a more meaningful way You re guided out of the mental chatter and into the silence that s where the magic happens Speaking of mental chatter if you re prone to overthinking like me meditation helps calm your racing thoughts At first you may get a few moments of peace per session Those few moments will be immensely rewarding for you You ll want to experience that feeling more The more you practice the more opportunities you ll have to experience the peace that exists within all of us It becomes almost addicting During my first year I was also very impatient with myself I wanted to be the perfect meditator But when you have a mindset like that it s a recipe for disaster Simply practice letting go of the thoughts that flow past Easier said than done but eventually it will get better Be kind to yourself as much as possible during your practice Experiment with different types of meditation Immerse yourself into spiritual based material If you find yourself gravitating towards certain teachers or books go with it Allow yourself to explore life from a totally different perspective
