While most tourists that visit Europe get obsessed with Italian, French, or Spanish cuisines, and with so many international restaurants and fast-food chains, Polish and Slavic food is often overshadowed and unnoticed by most travelers. However, that doesn’t mean that these cuisines don’t have anything to offer. Polish and other Slavic dishes are typically warming, hearty and well worth the effort to make. Bigos stew, decadent blueberry mazurka bars and Krakow-style cheesecake are all on our must-try list. Traditional and modern flavours combine in a plate of pierogi dumplings that can be filled with trendy sauerkraut and mushrooms, sweet white cheese curds, or American-style buffalo chicken.
