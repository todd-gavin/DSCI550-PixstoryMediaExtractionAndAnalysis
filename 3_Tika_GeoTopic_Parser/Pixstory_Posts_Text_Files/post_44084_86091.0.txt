The second half was played at an exciting pace and intensity, and in the 62nd minute, Lautaro Martinez – who had previously been a fairly anonymous figure – received the ball from Alexis Sanchez before unleashing a venomous strike from the edge of the area that arced away out of the diving reaches of Alisson.
However, the Nerazzurri's chances of pulling off a comeback were dashed only two minutes later when Sanchez was sent off for a second yellow card after his follow-through caught Fabinho, leaving referee Antonio Mateu with no choice but to show the red card.
Inter Milan coach Simone Inzaghi acknowledges that their Champions League elimination against Liverpool left him with enormous remorse. Inter were eliminated 2-1 on aggregate after a 1-0 win.
"There are certainly great regrets, as we wanted to reach this Round of 16 with all our strength, we were up against Liverpool, who along with Manchester City and Bayern Munich are the best team in Europe right now, and we fought them on an even keel," Inzaghi told Sky Italia.
“We are probably paying the price for the final 15 minutes of the first leg, because I think we had two very good games against an excellent opponent."
He continued: “I think the first 75 minutes saw us deserve far more, then we conceded on a corner, which wasn't even a good one, and the second goal really knocked us down.
“We came to Anfield to give our best and we emerge fortified from this meeting with a top team. During our best period of the game and the worst for them, Alexis Sanchez was sent off, that was bad timing.
"The regret is Sanchez, because Liverpool really were shaken by Lautaro's goal and I wanted to see what happened after that."
