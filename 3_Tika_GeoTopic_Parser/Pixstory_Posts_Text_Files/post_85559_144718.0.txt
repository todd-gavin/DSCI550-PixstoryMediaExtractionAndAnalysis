I know many girls stole some or the other thing from their sister's or mother's wardrobe 😉✨️but have you guys ever stolen something from your elder brother's wardrobe? I did once.🤫 He used to wear this shirt to his office and as it was giving a sober kinda look it catched my eye.👀🌈 Although it was a normal yet basic SHIRT but only my evil mind knew it can be worn as a DRESS. 😈
Shirts are one of most efforless and priceless piece of cloth that Instantly puts you to a chic side of fashion🛍🌼 but when it comes to oversized ones, it's quite a task to dress them and appear more presentable. There are days you just wanna wear them and they are inherently comfortable and cool.💃🏻❤️
Personally the purpose of the above look is to get the 'NO PANTS' look.👖 Else one is better off wearing just normal shirt and bottoms. And of course, one also has to respect public decency.
So, i will pair them with short shorts just enough to almost cover my shorts 🩳 and wearing an oversized shirt is all about the accessory. Depending on the shirt you can never go wrong with a nice waist belt. The sling bag really puts the outfit together. At last I completed this look with sneakers.👟
Tell me in the notes how your EVIL MIND works?😎⚡️
