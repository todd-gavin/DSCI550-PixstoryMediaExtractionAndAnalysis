According to NJ.com, a total lunar eclipse is coming soon, which means the full “flower moon” of May 2022 will be turning into a reddish-orange “blood moon” for almost 90 minutes.

Astronomy experts at Space.com call it “one of nature’s most beautiful spectacles” and a “must-see skywatching event.”

Although people all across the United States — including New Jersey and Pennsylvania — will have an opportunity to see the upcoming lunar eclipse, the timing isn’t ideal. You’ll have to stay awake late Sunday night, May 15, to catch a glimpse of the moon as it slowly turns dark with a reddish-orange tint.
