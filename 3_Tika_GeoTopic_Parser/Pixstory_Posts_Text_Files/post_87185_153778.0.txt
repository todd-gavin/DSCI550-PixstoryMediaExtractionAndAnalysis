Manchester City locked horns with Southampton in a Premier League fixture on October 8 (Saturday). And once again, Erling Haaland found himself on the scoring sheet.
Haaland made a devastating run in the box to open up the space before striking the ball low to the near goal post in the 65th minute. With this latest addition, he has now scored in 10 consecutive games.

Many doubted whether he would be able to deliver in the toughest league but the Norway striker is having goals for dinner. He has already netted 20 goals in all competitions for the Sky Blues.
I’m upset with Haaland: Pep Guardiola jokes
The expectations with Erling Haaland are going sky high and people are expecting him to score three or four goals in every other game. Speaking about the unrealistic expectations, manager Pep Guardiola joked in the post-match conference:
"I'm so upset with him - he didn't score three goals. That's why there's a petition to sack him from the Premier League!”.
"Expectations here are so high that people expect he's going to score every game three or four goals. But at the end he was there to score it. He helped us again, keeping the ball and fighting and I think Erling played really well today."
With the victory over Southampton, City are the current table toppers of the premier league. However, Arsenal, who are on a roll this season, will have a chance to regain their top spot if they beat Liverpool on Sunday (October 9).
City will travel to Denmark for their Champions League fixture against Copenhagen on October 11. A victory will ensure their advancement to the next round of the tournament.
