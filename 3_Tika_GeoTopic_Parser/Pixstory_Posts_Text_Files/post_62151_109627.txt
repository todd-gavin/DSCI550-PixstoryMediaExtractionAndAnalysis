Ousmane Dembele s situation at Barcelona continues to drag on and has been frustrating for the club and the fans alike The French Winger is a heavily sought after commodity but he just hasn t been able to make up his mind He has been linked with Chelsea among other teams At one moment it is claimed that the winger will be leaving the club as a free agent but then reports emerge that the winger has decided to accept the contract offer tabled by the Catalans and stay put It is apparent that manager Xavi Hernandez is intent on extending the Frenchman s stay at Camp Nou with his brilliant string of performances towards the end of the season But with neither the club nor the player seemingly willing to move from their position the situation does not reflect well for the Blaugrana Hopefully the dilemma is soon resolved and we can move ahead to get confirmation whether the winger is staying put at Barca or moving on to Stamford Bridge
