Yes guys I had very long and naturally straight hair but due to pollution, high temperature and all other reasons in Delhi I decided to cut off my hair's. Okay so story goes like I went to the salon with one of my friend and she wasÂ  sad even more than me because I took such a big decision. I went there and the lady chopped my hair's and when I turned back to look at the amount of hair I lost that day, I was about to cry and I was asking that lady to attach my hair's back(I know this is very stupid but I was disheartened to see this much of hair's). And then she trimmed some more hair and then I went back and showed my haircut to my family, they were in shock(I took permission from then but they were not ready to see this much change). But as we say "Jo hona tha vo ho gayaðŸ˜‚". 
But my hair growth is very fast so I'm about to reach the same length as before in a month or soðŸ’—.
