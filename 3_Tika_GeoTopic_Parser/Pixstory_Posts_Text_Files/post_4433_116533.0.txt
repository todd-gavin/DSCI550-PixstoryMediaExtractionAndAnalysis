Is it just me or you all also love when it rains?

Long drives when its raining its a key to my heart ✨😛 , the weather here in Delhi is just perfect , i went out for a long drive and had brunch with my brother, surely  i’d call it a perfect start to the day. 

How are you spending your weekend? ✨☔️
