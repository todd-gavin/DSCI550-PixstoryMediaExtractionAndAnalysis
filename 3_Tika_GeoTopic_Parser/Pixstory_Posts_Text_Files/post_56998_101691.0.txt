It would be the strictest law made on women's reproductive health. Oklahoma lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill where all kinds of abortions are verboten. In addition, the bill allows private individuals to sue abortion providers and anyone who "aids or abets" an abortion.

This is not the first time they passed an anti-abortion bill; instead, many bills have been passed this year in Oklahoma against abortion. In addition, two of the abortion clinics in Oklahoma stopped providing any abortion procedures earlier this month when the governor signed a six-week ban.

The bill would go to the governor next week, and the first-term Republican running for reelection has already said he would sign any anti-abortion bill the Legislature sends to him. It would take effect immediately after he signs it.
"This bill could go into effect at any time, and once it does, any person can sue the clinic, the doctors, anyone else who is involved in providing an abortion in Oklahoma," said Rabia Muqaddam, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Oklahoma clinics in legal challenges against several proposed new anti-abortion laws.

These are some images of how the cruelty would prevail in the future after many such bills would be passed all across the nation restricting women from making decisions for their bodies.
