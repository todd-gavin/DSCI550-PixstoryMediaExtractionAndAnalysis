This blossoming relationship sounds like heaven to us.

According to a source close to Demi Lovato, the "Confident" singer and musician Jutes have been "secretly dating for months now" after working together in the industry.

"Demi and Jutes met while working on music together," a source tells us. "Everything is going swimmingly, and they have a lot in common. They connect over music."

Demi's new relationship comes two years after she split from ex-fianc√© Max Ehrich. Though the pop star "swore off dating for a while," Jutes has "restored her faith" in that department, according to the source.

"She's definitely smitten," says the source, who adds that Demi and Jutes "have been spending a lot of time together."

Demi isn't the only one who thinks this connection is wonderful. "Everyone thinks he's really good for her," the insider added.

The couple recently made their relationship public by going on a date in New York City on August 16. An eyewitness told E! News at the time that the couple "looked extremely happy" as they walked hand in hand.

But let it be known that Demi's life isn't just full of new beginnings. Demi also has "so many projects and new music coming out," according to an insider close to her.
