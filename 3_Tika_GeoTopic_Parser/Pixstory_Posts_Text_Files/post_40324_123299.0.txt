🍚Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs , vegetables , seafood , or meat . It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish .

🍗Chicken is filled with high-quality proteins and doesn't contain much fat — especially if you eat lean cuts .

🥚Egg is heart healthy , have alot of protein and is great to add in meal .
