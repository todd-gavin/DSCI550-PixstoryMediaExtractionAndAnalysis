As the season winds down, we propose our top five PL managers of 21/22 Season

Pep Guardiola

Jürgen Klopp believes that Pep Guardiola is the world's best coach, and few would disagree.

Klopp has seen Guardiola's success in Spain, Germany, and now England, and he is extremely
impressed. With Erling Haaland signed up for next season, this may be remembered as the
season Guardiola captured the Premier League title without a recognised striker.Within the
complex makeup of Guardiola, there is a desire to do things differently, to challenge
conventional wisdom.

He is successful by using a large budget and talented players, but he is
also willing to experiment and try new strategies in order to win titles. Nights like the collapse at
Real Madrid seem to have a negative impact on Guardiola's psyche, as his eyes betray his
feelings of horror.

Jürgen Klopp

Many people have said that the Klopp era at Liverpool has peaked since the end of 2018, and
that the club has not won enough trophies during that time. They were wrong about all of it.

Klopp was nearing the end of May and Liverpool had become very fond of domestic cup
competitions. The return of Virgil van Dijk, improved form from the forward line, and Thiago
Alcântara's flourishing in midfield helped the team win again. Luis Díaz and Ibrahima Konaté are
astute transfer business brilliance. Klopp is the key to Liverpool's success. Liverpool's owners
have handed the keys to someone who is respected by fans, players and suits, and who is
known for his humanity, man-management and will to win.
 Klopp is contracted until 2026, and
he is staying on with Liverpool Football Club.
