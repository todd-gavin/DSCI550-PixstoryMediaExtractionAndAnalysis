The link between mental health and physical health is often misunderstood. They’re often thought of as separate entities, but the two go hand in hand.

The perceived disconnect between “mind” and “body” creates the misconception that mental illness is not a physical disease. In reality, mental health has a direct impact on your physical health.

Scientifically, people with a mental health problem are more likely to have a preventable physical health condition such as heart disease.

This can be for a variety of reasons, including-

Genetics. The genes that make it more likely that you will develop a mental health problem may also play a part in physical health problems.

Low motivation. Some mental health problems or medications can affect your energy or motivation to take care of yourself.

Difficulty with concentration and planning. You may find it hard to arrange or attend medical appointments if your mental health problem affects your concentration
lack of support to change unhealthy behaviour. Healthcare professionals may assume you’re not capable of making changes, so won’t offer any support to cut down on drinking or give up smoking, for example being less likely to receive medical help. Healthcare professionals may assume your physical symptoms are part of your mental illness and not investigate them further. People with a mental illness are less likely to receive routine checks (like blood pressure, weight and cholesterol) that might detect symptoms of physical health conditions earlier.
