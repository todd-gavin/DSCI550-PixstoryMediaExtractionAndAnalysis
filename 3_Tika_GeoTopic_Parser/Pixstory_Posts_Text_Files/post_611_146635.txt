Well darlings Cinemas are open again in Kashmir Will it make any significant difference in our lives may be with OTT platforms not much Was this the first thing people in Kashmir wanted is it a beginning of a new Era Well I will answer in negative for all the above However it might can be a pleasant change A movie going experience for a young boy and girl holding hands munching pop corn is something all of us need to experience once atleast We missed it when we were growing up I do have memories of going to cinema in Kashmir pre militancy but the memories are very faint The early s when I would mostly be carried in a lap to my seat For me the seats were so big that I would just sink into them The cinemas were also not a pleasant experience I infact used to be scared The halls were nothing like the multiplexes we have now inspite of special seats my Dad got us I don t remember having seen many movies a couple with a close female relative after she got engaged Her fianc would take her for a movie and I had to tag along like a passport Some with my mom and her sisters some with again my mom and colleagues some with family I have a faint idea of watching Jackie Shroff s hero as year old Sitamghar featuring my moms favourite Dharmender was nightmare villain branded a horse and the hero with hot rods Don t remember having watched any other movie May be I just refused to go to cinemas Am a film buff movies are integral so is crying while watching them I think it started then My first actual cinema experience was in on a college trip when we watched two movies including Kuch kuch hota hai and it was something else But yes when Raj Simran sang in Switzerland in DDLJ or when Shahrukh was dancing Chays Chaya I kept wondering how would it look on the big screen Now the youth won t they will go watch
