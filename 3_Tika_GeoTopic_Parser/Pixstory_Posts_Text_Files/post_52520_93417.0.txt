In today's world the vegetarians suffer from various deficiencies caused by the lack of protein in their body. To balance this equation, Some of the vegetarians have converted themselves into Eggetarain. But maximum vegetarians avoid eggs stating that it is not a vegetarian food. But science had proved them wrong. Various scientific researchs and facts show that egg is a vegetarian food. Eggs contain three parts- the shell, the albumen which is the white part and the yolk. The egg white is a suspension of the protein albumen in water. It contains no animal cell. Hence, egg whites are vegetarian and all products containing egg whites are, technically, vegetarian.There are two types of eggs, fertilized and unfertilized eggs. While people think that eggs are home for chicks, there is a huge difference between hens that lay eggs for consumption and eggs which produce chicks. Fertilized eggs the eggs to be fertilized, the hen and rooster must mate before the formation of the egg. If this happens, then the eggs laid by the hen are fertilized. If the hen has not mated and she lays eggs, then the eggs are unfertilized.Neither fertilized nor unfertilized eggs contain chicks that are meant to be born. To make a chick, a hen needs to mate with a rooster. And the farms that breed hens for edible eggs, keep the roosters away so that the fertilization process is not completed.For a chick to be formed inside an egg, the fertilized egg needs to develop into an embryo, which can happen only under specific conditions.
If someone thinks ethically than these facts cannot be considered. But based on the research and the facts, Egg is scientifically proven to be a vegetarian food.
