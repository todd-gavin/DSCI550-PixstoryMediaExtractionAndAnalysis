Here is a very straightforward—and, in my opinion, really significant—sign that you have found true love, and it comes from the Russian novelist Dostoyevsky. He claims that loving them as God intended them to be is a sign of true love. You don't have to be religious to understand what he's saying. He means when you truly love someone, like it's the real thing. You don't want or expect them to be flawless.
You're not attempting to fix them. You're not attempting to complete them. You're not idolising them. Instead, you're embracing their flaws. You're loving what is unlovable about them. Not their toxic traits, but the things they don't see as being beautiful in themselves. You see beauty in them that they may not see. You love them as God intended them to be loved. You adore them completely and unconditionally. That's true love
