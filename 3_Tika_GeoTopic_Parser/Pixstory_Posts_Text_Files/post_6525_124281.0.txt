The ongoing political crisis in Bihar continues to deepen further. Nitish Kumar recently met with the Governor and resigned from the post of Chief Minister of the NDA government. Along with this, he also proposed to form a new coalition government. As of writing this article, Nitish Kumar has taken oath as the CM in a grand alliance with the RJD.

Against this backdrop, a video of Nitish Kumar is circulating widely on social media. Here, he can be heard saying, “After this, there’s no basis for going back under any circumstances. Whether we remain in power or become irrelevant (get mixed into the soil), we will never compromise with you in the future. Impossible! It is simply not possible now. Impossible! This chapter is over now because you people broke our trust.” A number of BJP leaders, journalists, and social media users shared the video claiming that Nitish Kumar was directing these remarks at the RJD.

ANI-affiliated journalist Amit Kumar tweeted this video and wrote, “We may become irrelevant but we will not compromise with the RJD. This statement was given by Nitish Kumar in the assembly. Listen for yourself.”
