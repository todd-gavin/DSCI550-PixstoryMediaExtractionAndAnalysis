I remember the book A Thousand Splendid Suns written by Khaled Hosseini I didn t see Afghanistan years ago but I think Khaled Hosseini wrote the current situation of Afghanistan in that book I only read the stories of those days from my father and in history books I was but now I see the same bitter days in front of my eyes Let history repeat itself and we are more oppressed than before stuck in a black valley In this turbulent year Afghan women value the loss of values that they have gained in the last years with many efforts and sacrifices These sacrifices were lost within a year and they are facing more difficult conditions than in the past We have to try for at least another hundred years to return to the values of a few years ago The history of Afghanistan today is not the history of Afghanistan today is zero We went back in time But we didn t want to go back to the past The forced marriage of children over the age of has increased in Afghanistan Kabul s life was colorful Other girls and young people of Afghanistan have enjoyed life in Kabul in recent years The pleasures to be wished for now are Kabul had many cafes girls students families and young people laughed and talked there with carelessness Libraries were established and various cultural programs were held The life of Kabul was colorful until one year ago but everything changed overnight Today in the streets of Kabul even women are rarely seen children were forced to go to school with enthusiasm today they are wandering a piece of dry bread
