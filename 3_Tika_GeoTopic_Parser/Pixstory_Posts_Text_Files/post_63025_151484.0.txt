Authorities said on Sunday that one of the deadliest stadium catastrophes in history has left 125 people dead and more than 320 injured at a soccer stadium in Indonesia after police used tear gas to disperse a pitch invasion.
After the game ended on Saturday night in Malang, East Java, agitated fans of the losing home team invaded the field. Officers used tear gas to try to disperse them, according to the region's police chief Nico Afinta.
Apparently, according to the police, the crowd had become 'anarchic' and had started attacking the officers. In retaliation, the officers used teargas. The crush occurred when people were exiting the stadium.
