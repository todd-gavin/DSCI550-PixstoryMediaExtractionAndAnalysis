 The Matrix is a visually stunning cyberadventure full of kinetic energy but it falls back on formula just as things start to get interesting The film recycles the plots of Dark City and Strange Days ramps up the heat and noise and takes Hong Kong action movie choreography Larry and Andy Wachowski are the directors and they know how to make movies Keanu Reeves Neo is a mild mannered software author by day and a feared hacker at night He is recruited by a cyber rebel cell led by Morpheus Laurence Fishburne and the leather clad warrior Trinity Carrie Anne Moss They aim to break the framework that keeps the Matrix in place and liberate humanity The battles in the film take place in Virtual Reality with the heroes minds hooked into the action Jacking in in this manner was explored in Strange Days and Dark City In Matrix there are no flesh and blood beings behind the illusion only a computer programme The film provides no clear explanation for why the Matrix creating programme went to such lengths It s visually appealing both in terms of design and kinetic energy that fuels it It visualises cyberspace locations using completely integrated special effects and animation The Matrix contains space leaps dramatic moments involving rooftop fights helicopter rescues and conflicts over mind control Keanu Reeves adopts Harrison Ford s deadpan demeanour acting as little as possible Laurence Fishburne strikes a balance between action hero and Zen master in this film Hugo Weaving has a flat intimidating tone that reminds me of Tommy Lee Jones in passive aggressive mode Gloria Foster as the Oracle is maddeningly mysterious
