Recruitments of volunteer soldiers were organized by several Pakistani political parties who used Madrassas as natural recruiting centres.

This recruitment was performed openly, and some Pakistani government officials have repeatedly admitted knowledge of the paramilitary activities of the religious schools and have officially expressed discomfort regarding them. 

However, significant numbers of recruits, travelling in trucks and buses, regularly crossed into Afghanistan from Pakistan to fight with the Taleban against United Front forces without any obstruction from Pakistani border officials.
