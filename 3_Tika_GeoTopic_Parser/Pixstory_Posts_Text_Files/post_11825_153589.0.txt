It's very common - many new mothers believe they have a poor milk supply , but the truth is nothing is wrong ! Your supply is probably fine as long as your baby is awake , engaged , and routinely soaking and filling diapers . Keep in mind that your milk may not arrive for a few days after delivery .
Let's focus on the best foods that needs to be consumed which can boost milk supply ; ✅🍼
1 Oats 
2 Brown bread 
3 Brown rice 
4 Apricots
5 Garlic
6 Carrots 
7 Almonds 
8 Leafy greens
9 Chickpeas
10 Salman fish
Consuming each and every one of these everyday will be difficult , so i recommend taking at least 3-4 foods from these everyday . Grab anything that is available in your local supermarket . Besides these , drinking at least 4-5 litres of WATER daily is the first and foremost important task to be done .
Happy breastfeeding mums ! 🍼🤰
