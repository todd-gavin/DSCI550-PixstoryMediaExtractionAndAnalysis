On Saturday, România will host Finland at the Arena Națională in Bucharest in a UEFA Nations League Group B match.


Romania entered their UEFA Nations League match against Finland having lost their first two games in Group B3.


Finland, on the other hand, have four points from two games, and a win on Saturday evening would effectively eliminate the danger of relegation from the third division.



Romania vs Finland: Probable Playing XI


Romania : Florin Nita; Andrei Ratiu, Adrian Rus, Vlad Chiriches, Nicusor Bancu; Alexandru Maxim, Alexandru Cretu, Razvan Marin; Andrei Ivan, Denis Alibec, Valentin Mihaila


Finland : Jesse Joronen (GK); Jere Uronen, Leo Vaisanen, Miro Tenho, Daniel O'Shaughnessy, Nikolai Alho; Robin Lod, Rasmus Schuller, Ilmari Niskanen; Teemu Pukki, Joel Pohjanpalo




Romania vs Finland:  Prediction


The form book points to Finland remaining on track for promotion and pushing Romania towards the second tier exit door. However, despite their lack of goals, we are backing Romania to find some form in front of their own supporters, even if it may only be enough for a share of the spoils.


Prediction : Romania 1-1 Finland
