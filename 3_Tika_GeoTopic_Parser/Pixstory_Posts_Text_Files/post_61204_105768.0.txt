Home is a place where one not only feel comfortable , but a place where they look forward to live in every day. A home is not only made of bricks & woods but made by the family. For me home is a place to make memories with one another and where i feel safe, relaxed . No matter whatâ€™s going on in your life , how challenging it is we know that there is only place called home where we can feel every emotion.
