White Sands has the largest collection of fossilized human footprints Every day people from all over the world visit White Sands National Park New Mexico and leave traces of their adventures The white dunes of the Tularosa Basin are just a recent occurrence on the geological timeline At White Sands we find many remarkable fossilized footprints scattered across Lake Otero While these footprints are ancient scientists are still uncovering new evidence of past life Tens of thousands of years ago during the ice age a giant body of water Lake Otero rested within the Tularosa basin The climate was less arid and the vegetation was abundant One could have seen grasslands stretching for miles that would have looked more like the prairies of the Midwest rather than New Mexico s deserts This paradise of lush green life naturally captured the attention of the larger animals of the ice age Plant eaters such as ancient camels Columbian mammoths and Harlan s ground sloth came to Lake Otero to feast on the grasses and trees of the Tularosa Basin This attracted fearsome predators known as the dire wolf and American Lion These animals footprints remained long after their departure of the wetlands of Lake Otero and eventually became fossilized The latest research shows that humans have been living in North America and Tularosa Basin for at least years It was previously thought that humans arrived in North America closer to years ago Research was conducted to see what could be found below the surface by digging a trench in the gypsum soil on the park s western playa Human Footprints were found within different layers of sediment below the surface of the dig site Above and below these footprints were ancient grass seeds Ruppia cirrhosa which were analyzed using radiocarbon dating It was revealed that the calibrated dates were of and years ago
