Because of a temperature issue with one of the four RS-25 engines, NASA decided to cancel the test launch of its massive Moon rocket on Monday. The US space agency announced that the Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket launch that was scheduled for early Monday will be postponed. It can be delayed for several days or perhaps several weeks. 

Mint reported that at T-40 minutes, the countdown to the launch of Artemis 1, NASA's most potent rocket, was suspended as the hydrogen team and Artemis 1 launch director discussed the strategy. 

“The launch of Artemis I is no longer happening today as teams work through an issue with an engine bleed. Teams will continue to gather data, and we will keep you posted on the timing of the next launch attempt," the US space agency wrote on Twitter. 

Alternative dates for launch of the Artemis 1 mission, an uncrewed flight around the Moon as part of an ambitious program to eventually go to Mars, are 2 and 5 September.

We might have had a rocky start but let’s not lose hope!
