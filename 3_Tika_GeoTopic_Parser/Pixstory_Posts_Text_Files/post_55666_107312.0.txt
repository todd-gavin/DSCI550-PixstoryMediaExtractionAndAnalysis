While ordinary Australians struggle to pay their bills, put gas in their cars, and buy groceries, federal MPs have collected a handsome $5810 salary hike. 

As per news portals, from July 1, all federal MPs' wages will increase by 2.75 percent, from $211,250 to $217,060 per year. This does not include their allowances or expenditures. 

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's salary will increase by $15,104 to $564,364. Peter Dutton, the leader of the Opposition, will earn $401,561 a year, while Adam Bandt, the leader of the Greens, will earn $314,737. 

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the average Australian earns little under $91,000. 
As Covid gripped the country, federal MPs did not receive a wage raise in 2020 or 2021. They had been doing so for the previous three years.

The news that politicians are set to receive a bump in pay is unlikely to go down with Australians families are they are slugged with higher-than-ever petrol prices and grocery bills.
