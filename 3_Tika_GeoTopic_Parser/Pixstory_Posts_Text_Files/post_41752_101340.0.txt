It’s a good day for us Australians! Zac Stubblety-Cook, an Olympic gold medalist from Australia, has broken the world record in the 200m breakstroke. 

Fox News reported that at the Australian swimming championships in Adelaide, the 23-year-old finished in 2:05.95, almost edging out Russian Anton Chupkov's world record of 2:06.12 from 2019. 

He had owned the Commonwealth record of 2:06.28, which he established last June, before winning gold in Tokyo in a time of 2:06.38, one of nine for the Australian team, and the first Australian champion in the 200m breakstroke since Ian O'Brien in 1964. 

Stubblety-Cook now holds the current long-course world record, making him the only Australian to do so.

“I was just trying to swim fast - I didn’t think that fast,” he explained post-race.

“Last year, you put everything in and we got that result (Olympic gold). This year there’s a lot less pressure, so it’s a different kettle of fish. I’m just stoked.”, he said.
