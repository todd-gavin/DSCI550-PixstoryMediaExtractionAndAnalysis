1. Stay Anxious

Taking offense to a perceived insult can be a function of anxiety in that it requires the other person to acknowledge and potentially tailor their thinking and behavior to match the offended person’s worldview.

2. You may be driven by guilt

People who have engaged in offensive behavior sometimes have a tendency to overcompensate with moral rectitude as a way to help lessen the guilt they are feeling, as well as convince everyone else (and themselves) they are not truly a “bad” person.

3. You may be insecure

People who feel insecure have often been invalidated and learned others will not respond to their needs in helpful or meaningful ways. They typically have not learned how to get their needs met assertively and often respond in a passive aggressive manner.

4.You may be trying to rewrite a pain from their past

Being offended is a way to validate and address the pain by speaking to it and for it in the moment and in a way a person may not have been able to do in the past. It is as if they are standing up for themselves in a way they were not previously able to do at the time the pain was originally inflicted.

5. Being highly sensitive

Some people are simply more sensitive than others. That’s their temperament, how they’re wired. It’s very hard to be overly sensitive and have healthy relationships, but this is a changeable quality when you recognize this is how you are.

6. Having parents who modeled oversensitivity

If your parents were easily offended, then became defensive or went on the offensive, you won’t have learned skills in childhood to handle untoward remarks or actions and will think that this is how everyone responds to them.

7. Having an abusive or traumatic childhood

When we are abused or traumatized as children, the actions taken against us get stored in our brains differently than less distressing memories because they are highly emotional and seen as a threat.
