Pasta is one of the most widely consumed foods worldwide. This popular, low-cost staple is available in almost every country. Spaetzle is popular in Germany and Hungary. Orzo is a dish that is popular in Greeze. Pocket-sized pierogi are popular in Poland. Kreplach dumplings are a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish dish. With the exception of all-American spaghetti and meatballs, pasta is prepared and served in America in a similar fashion to that found in Italy. Many of us associate pasta with Italian cuisine, and the majority of people believe it originated there. While pasta is commonly associated with Italy, it has a long and illustrious history that makes determining who invented it first very impossible. 

PBS tells us that it's tough to pinpoint pasta's origins. While we associate pasta with Italian culture, it is most likely a descendant of ancient Asian noodles. Pasta was brought to Italy from China by Marco Polo in the 13th century, according to popular legend. A section in Marco Polo's book "The Travels of Marco Polo" recalls his introduction to a flour-producing plant (perhaps a "breadfruit tree"). This plant was used by the Chinese to make a meal similar to barley flour. Polo referenced a barley-like meal that was used to make many pasta-like dishes, including one called "lagana" (lasagna). The book primarily relies on retellings by many authors and specialists because Polo's original text no longer exists.
