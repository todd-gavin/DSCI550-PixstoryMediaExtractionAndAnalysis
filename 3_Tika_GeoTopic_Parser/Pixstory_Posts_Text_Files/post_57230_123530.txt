I don t think gender neutral parenting can always work It is essential for parents to give a choice to their children but this will only help their children until they are with them The world outside is cruel their way of teaching would not help the child combat every problem that would fall on them Most people who support and validate existing gender rules would not spare a moment to accept the difference in identity and nonconformity It would instead pressure children to tackle the problems and they will feel excluded from society Furthermore it would not end by teaching their children gender nonconformities parents should be ready and prepared to help their children and pressure other parents and teachers to promote gender neutral views Other than this there are several cons associated with gender neutral parenting A gender neutral child can also get confused without a concept of gender as they are raised in gender neutral surroundings it would become difficult for them to adjust to society when they meet more people and kids So the goal here should be not to erase the gender completely but instead make their children understand the outer world as well which will always exist
