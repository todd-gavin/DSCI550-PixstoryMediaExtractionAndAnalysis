2. Mute swans are actually very intelligent, and if you treat them kindly, they will actually befriend you!
3. They spend a lot of time on the ground, as they need to find food in the mud or water.
4. They usually mate for life, and their egg-laying habits are among the most unusual in all animals.
5. Mute swans have a very large range - they can be found all over Europe, Asia, and North America.
6. They are one of the slowest flying birds in the world due to their heavy weight.
7. Mute swans are peaceful animals and seldom attack humans or other animals â€“ their aggression is mostly limited to other swans.
8. Their feathers are very soft and they don't have any real defense mechanism other than their large size (which often works in their favor!).
9. Their plumage is mainly black but they can also be coloured pale blue or green, depending on their region of origin.
10. The male mute swan leaves its nest in order to find a mate during the springtime mating season. If it fails to find a mate, it may return to its nest later on in the year or abandon it completely! So the males are not exactly great dads.
11. In ancient times, mute swans were considered sacred by many cultures because they were seen as symbols of love, fertility and peace
