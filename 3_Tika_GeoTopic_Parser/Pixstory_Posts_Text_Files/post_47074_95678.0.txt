Through this campaign, the Stars and Stripes hope to easily qualify for the 2023 World Cup. The
women's national team of the United States has been assigned to a group that includes Mexico,
Jamaica, and Haiti for the CONCACAF W Championship.

The team will attempt to introduce a youthful crop of players to its existing core during the
competition in Monterrey, Mexico, this summer, in order to return after a poor bronze medal
performance at the 2021 Olympics. However, Canada, coming off a win against the Stars and
Stripes in Tokyo, might be a tough challenge at the end of the tournament.

Who is in the group of the USWNT?

In the draw, the USWNT was put in Group A as the top-seeded team. Canada, Costa Rica,
Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago make up the other group.

When will the tournament be held?

Mexico will host the CONCACAF Women's Championship, which will take place from July 4 to
July 18, 2022.

What's on the line?

The event will select who will represent the region at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia
and New Zealand in 2023, as well as the 2024 Olympics in Paris. In addition, the victor will be
guaranteed a spot in the 2024 CONCACAF W Gold Cup.
