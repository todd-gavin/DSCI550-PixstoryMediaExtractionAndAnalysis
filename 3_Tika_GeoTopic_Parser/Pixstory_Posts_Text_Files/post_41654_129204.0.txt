The aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, are stunning dancing waves of light that have mesmerised humanity for millennia. But did you know that despite its beauty, this amazing light show is actually rather a “violent spectacle”.

As per Space.com the energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's upper atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph), but our planet's magnetic field protects us from the onslaught. 

As Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles the dramatic process transforms into a cinematic atmospheric phenomenon that dazzles and fascinates scientists and skywatchers alike.

Also, did you know that this process gives us the southern lights too? 

If you want to see the best of Northen Lights, Norway is your best bet!

Northern Norway has early afternoon to late morning darkness and regular displays of the northern lights from late September to late March.
