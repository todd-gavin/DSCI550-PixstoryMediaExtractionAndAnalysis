The next worry is about raising more resources. The FM is betting on heavy market borrowing and increase in Corporate tax (+85,000 cr), Personal Income tax (+85,000 cr) and GST (+1,05,000 cr).  There is not a word about raising more resources from the rich, especially the very, very rich 142 persons whose wealth in the last two years has increased from Rs 23,14,000 crore to Rs 53,16,000 crore.

You will ask me, no doubt, if there is not any aspect of the budget that I welcome. There is a short list of three:

1.  The FM has promised capital expenditure of Rs 7,50,000 crore in 2022-23 as against the RE of Rs 6,02,711 crore in 2021-22.

2.  The FM has promised an additional borrowing of Rs 1,00,000 crore to the States free of interest. 

3.  The budget speech was mercifully short at 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Parliament may vote this Budget because the ruling party has a brute majority in the Lok Sabha, but the people will reject this capitalist Budget.
