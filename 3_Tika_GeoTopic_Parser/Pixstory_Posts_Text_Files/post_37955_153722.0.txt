Cristiano Ronaldo is plotting a move away from Manchester United next year. The club has now reportedly set a £10m transfer fee for their star however there are no indications that they would let him go as of now. 
The Portuguese striker has been left frustrated on the bench under Erik Ten Hag this season. Owing to a lack of playing time, Ronaldo's confidence has fallen drastically and this was under display in the Europa League as he missed a sitter against Omonia Nicosia in United's 3-2 win midweek. 
As per the Express, "It’s stated that United’s price tag for Ronaldo ‘will be nearer to £10m’ if a suitable offer arrives, though there’s still no indication they’re willing to part ways."
Though Erik Ten Hag has stated multiple times that he thinks CR7 is crucial for the team, his playing XI paints an entirely different story. Ronaldo has started just 1 Premier League game this season. To add to this, he was an unused substitute in the 6-3 thrash against Manchester City last week.
With Chelsea and Bayern Munich being considered as potential options, any top European club is yet to make an official approach for Ronaldo. It has to be seen how the 2022 World Cup goes for the iconic number seven as he aims to return to Champions League football following the spectacle midseason.
