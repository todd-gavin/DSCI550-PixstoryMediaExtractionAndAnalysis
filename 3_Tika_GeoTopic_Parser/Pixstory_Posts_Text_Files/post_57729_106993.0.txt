Oh man, this is really at times the worst thing to happen to you🤦‍♀️
I mean you're there with all of this excited and happy energy, showing and talking about something you really like and finally have.
And thennnnn, some people don't reciprocate and acknowledge your excitement appropriately and are all cool and indifferent about it, well that just wrecks the mood😗
