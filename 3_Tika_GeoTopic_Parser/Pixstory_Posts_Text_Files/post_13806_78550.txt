The transfer window is often the mirror of how fortune changes in the football world the Juventus FC transfer stories in the January window is an apt example One still remembers how pleased the Juventus fans were when Aaron Ramsey reached Turin as a free agent a couple of seasons ago Today the Old Lady is sadly relieved to see him moving over to Rangers on loan He is regarded by supporters as no good who could hardly make an impact while appearing for not more than five games for the club Ramsey is now labelled a footballer who does well for the national team but a misfit in Serie A His going is also a financial relief for Juventus The same band of supporters are now focussed on Dusan Vlahovic who is expected to bring goals with him from Fiorentina Juventus badly needed a striker and Vlahovic is widely regarded one of the best in Europe Only Robert Lewandowski scored more goals in Europe s top five leagues than Vlahovic Vlahovic who has goals in appearances with Fiorentina in this Serie A campaign ranks fourth in Europe for number of goals scored over the last two seasons Transfer rumour says Fiorentina had put a million euro price tag on the young striker and Juventus didn t hesitate to finalise the deal for the year old Serbia international The deal could be the third largest fee ever recorded in the January transfer history Former Juventus star Michele Padovano is full of praise for the new Bianconeri striker He has been quoted saying The player is really very strong important who will adapt to every game system able to lend a hand to Juventus Vlahovic is among the top five forwards in the world in Italy there are only him and Osimhen of such strong young people One hopes things go according to the plan because not every transfer goes in the right direction But then lots of them do click and turn into path breaking ones Dusan Vlahovic will definitely make the Old Lady smile
