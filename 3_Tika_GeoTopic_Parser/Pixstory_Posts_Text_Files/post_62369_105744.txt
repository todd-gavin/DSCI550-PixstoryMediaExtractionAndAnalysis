What if a gay person asks u why are you straight how would it feel to u To some people being gay is a disease and they would pity you sympathize you but will never accept you is homophobic a correct word for such arses I mean they literally hate people who are differently unique from them how are they even phobic They are just people who are discriminative and judgemental God would have not made Gay people if he hated them He loved us all but to some he just gave some more colors than the normal ones
