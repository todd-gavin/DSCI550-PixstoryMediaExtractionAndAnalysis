Cricket Australia has unveiled a packed summer schedule that includes T20I and ODI matches against England's men's and women's sides. 

SkyNews reported that the men's team will travel to Brisbane to face the reigning T20 champions on October 9, before meeting at the Manuka Oval in Canberra on October 12 and 14, preparatory of Australia's World Cup defence from October 16 to November 13. 

On November 17, Matthew Mott's ODI side will begin a three-match series in Adelaide, with games in Sydney on November 19 and Melbourne on November 22.

Australia's T20 World Cup-winning women meanwhile compete against Australia, Pakistan and Ireland in Derry from July 16 to July 23 as part of the Women's Commonwealth Bank T20I Tri-Series, after which Birmingham awaits as the 2022 Commonwealth Games take place from July 29-August 7.

Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley said: "Following arguably the most successful summer in our cricket history last year, we are thrilled to announce an action-packed international schedule for our outstanding women's and men's teams.
