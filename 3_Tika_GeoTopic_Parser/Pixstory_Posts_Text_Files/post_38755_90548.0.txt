Bayern Munich were recently interested in getting Gravenberch in the summer to accommodate him in a squad full of Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka, Jamal Musiala, and Paul Wanner. However, they are willing to pay him  €17 million (guaranteed), rising to €25 million(including bonuses). But Ajax want €35million pounds to let their star asset go.


Juventus are also keen on acquiring Gravenberch’s services. They might be willing to pay Ajax a better offer, which the dutch giants are looking for.  


He had turned down an offer to join Manchester United. If Erik Ten Hag replaces Ralf Rangnick, he could be looking to bring Gravenberch with him. But it seems he might join either of the 2 European Heavyweights in Bayern Munich and Juventus.  It remains to be seen where Gravenberch ends up come summer transfer window.
