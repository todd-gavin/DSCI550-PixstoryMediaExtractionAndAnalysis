After receiving money from the Australian Sports Commission through Sport Australia, Australian Taekwondo is set to recruit a national integrity manager. 

Because the high-performance programmes of the three sports merged last year and were governed by the Combat Institute of Australia, the integrity manager will also work with Judo Australia and Boxing Australia. 

The National Integrity Framework will be implemented and embedded at all levels of taekwondo in Australia by the integrity manager.

As per ITG, the integrity manager's responsibilities will include reducing integrity threats, supporting safe sport, and providing a healthy environment for taekwondo, judo, and boxing practitioners in Australia.

“There is no place for inappropriate behaviour or misconduct in taekwondo," Australian Taekwondo chief executive Heather Garriock said.

“The National Integrity Framework outlines the expectations of us as a National Sporting Organisation, our members, and affiliates in our community to ensure safe and respectful conduct; it keeps everybody accountable.

"Having a National Integrity Manager will help us to safeguard clubs and members, plus, handle any complaints from within our community.

"This will allow us to address areas of concern, mitigate risks, and ensure a safer sport for everybody."
