Amazon Prime Video just dropped the latest trailer for the its upcoming multi million dollar “The Lord Of The Rings: Rings of Power” television series, and compared to the previous teaser, this is looking a lot better. The trailer sports some incredibly grand visuals, almost Peter Jackson level, with the world truly feeling like the early days of Middle Earth, evident from the fact that we can literally see the Two Trees of Valinor in the trailer. For those who do not know what they are, the Two Trees of Valinor were the primal source of light for all of Arda (Earth) and its realms including Middle Earth, until they were destroyed by Melkor the first Dark Lord and Ungoliant the primordial spider.

The show itself takes place millenia before the events of either The Hobbit or The Lord Of The Rings, and is based primarily on The Silmarillion, The Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle Earth going all the way back to the Second Age of Middle Earth and covering some of its major events, such as the Fall of Numenor, the Forging of the Rings of Power and the rise of the second dark lord Sauron, the antagonist of The Lord Of The Rings. The trailer features many characters and grand locations of Middle Earth where many of the storylines will come together.

The eight-part series will premiere globally on Prime Video on September 2, of this fall and gives viewers a first look at various characters such as Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) ,Isildur (Maxim Baldry), Elendil (Lloyd Owen), Pharazôn (Trystan Gravelle), Queen Regent Míriel (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), Númenóreans Kemen (Leon Wadham) and Eärien (Ema Horvath).
