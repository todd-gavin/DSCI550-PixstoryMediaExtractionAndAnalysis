Confidence is not about being the smartest, most gorgeous, or bravest person in the room. It's about how comfortable you are with yourself, and how inclined you are to enhance your skills without degrading yourself. 
These are some of the qualities that a confident person has :

• A person who values self-care and understands the importance of balance in life.

• Someone who doesn't try to fit into others' standards and beliefs. They embrace themselves as who they are. 

• Someone who knows their value and doesn't tolerate toxic people.

• A confident person is not always confident they have their insecurities too but they understand the concept of self-love and are not harsh on themselves. 

• They own their actions and mistakes, don't need anyone's praise, and are not afraid to ask for help when they need it.
