Gadisar Lake is a gorgeous alpine lake located in the Ganderbal region of Jammu Kashmir at a height of feet about kilometres from Sonmarg The sky mountains and surroundings are wonderfully mirrored in the bluish green waters of the lakes because they are so pristinely transparent Gadisar which means the lake of fishes in the native tongue is well named because it is teeming with brown trout This is a fantastic opportunity for fishermen and fishing enthusiasts to enjoy fishing After passing via the Gadsar Pass one can reach Gadsar Lake which is a stop on the well known Great Lakes Trek If you enjoy taking pictures you should use your camera to record this lovely scene
