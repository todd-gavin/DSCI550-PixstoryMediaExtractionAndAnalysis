Dear readers,

I’m writing to ask you to support The Conversation. Your donation will help us combat the spread of misinformation through our unique model of journalism powered by experts.

Whether we are covering an election, the climate emergency or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, our editors produce trustworthy journalism that helps you stay informed. We can’t do this work without your support.

If you value The Conversation as a free source of trusted news, please donate today.

In the past year we’ve published more than 4,000 experts whose voices have become an essential part of public discourse. We do this work because we believe quality information should not be limited to a small elite. Everyone should have access to reliable information that can help them make better-informed decisions, whether it be choosing a government, navigating a pandemic or addressing the climate crisis.

Australians increasingly get their information from social media and other platforms that lack rigorous editorial standards. We work hard to get engaging fact-based content to these audiences, whether it be an article, infographic or podcast.

Please support this vital work with a donation and join the thousands of civic-minded people who are already helping us produce better journalism and a better-informed democracy.
