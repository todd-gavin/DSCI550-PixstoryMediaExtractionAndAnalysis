Visited the exhibition . I am still overwhelmed by the effect the glowing canvasses had on my entire being  . I was reminded of Jennette Winterset 's experience in an Amsterdam art gallery wherein she felt compelled to cancel her flight and visited the gallery again and again...
Against the historical context of rising parochialism KNMA revisits the cosmopolitan modernism of this great artist . The exhibition ,curated by Roobina Karode,covers the entire span of Raza 's journey across the continents ,spanning across almost six decades .If you happen to 
be in Delhi ,make sure that you visit and experience the  subliminal artworks of Raza ...Go and enrich your soul .
