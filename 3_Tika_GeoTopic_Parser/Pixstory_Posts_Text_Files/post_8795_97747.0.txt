An experiment in Dyarchy and it's failure continues...

I am glad to record my appreciation of the kindness of all the officials and Ministers of the State Government who gave me full cooperation and support while I was there. Major General Kulwant Singh—now Lt. General Kulwant Singh in retirement—was 
the officer commanding Jammu areas when I was there. 

He did a fine job in a very difficult situation. He made a fine commander and had the loyal support of all his staff. In the absence of communications in the area under his command-and when the raiders on all sides were supported by Pakistan army who had the advantage of a long border close to the State—he had to face a difficult situation. With limited means and a small force at his command, he was able to retain all these parts of the State which had not been lost before his arrival. 

Though Jhangar was lost at one time he was  able to recapture it. The same was the case with the towns of Rajori and Kargil. He had to maintain his communications with India on a bad road which was laid on the border between India and Pakistan.

 I had occasions to accompany him several times on his visit to the troops located at different places. With me his relations were very cordial and friendly and he gave me his fullest co-operation in a most difficult period when we were together. It was with General Kulwant Singh’s help that we were able to maintain law and order throughout the state. His difficulty was that he did not have at his command the forces required for the operations in Jammu and Kashmir. I did my best with the Government of India to get for him as much war material and man power as I could but sufficient forces were never placed at his disposal so long as I was there. When I left the State, he was busy recapturing Jhangar. 

To he continued....
