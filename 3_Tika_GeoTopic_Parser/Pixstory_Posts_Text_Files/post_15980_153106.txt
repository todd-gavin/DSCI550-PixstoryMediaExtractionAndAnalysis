Although there is a significant reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk with statins a higher risk of diabetes mellitus has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials The risk of incident diabetes with statins may be heterogeneous by presence of coronary artery calcium CAC We evaluated participants without prevalent diabetes at baseline from the MESA Multi Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis a prospective cohort study of subjects free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline We used multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to study the association between statin use and incident diabetes adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors including time varying statin use and stratifying by baseline CAC to The study population included participants with a mean SD age of years women White Black Chinese American and Hispanic In the unadjusted analyses statin use was associated with a higher risk of incident diabetes hazard ratio HR confidence interval CI to After adjustment this risk was no longer significant HR CI to Although imprecise the HR expressing the association of statins with diabetes was lower for those with CAC HR CI to than for those with a higher CAC burden HR CI to for CAC to and HR CI to for CAC but this heterogeneity was not statistically significant In conclusion statin therapy was not significantly associated with incident diabetes mellitus in this observational study The risk of incident diabetes did not significantly differ by baseline CAC Sources
