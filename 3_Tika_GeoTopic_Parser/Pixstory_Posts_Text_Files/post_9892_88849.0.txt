The Taliban rule and the flagging economy have seemingly put a dampener on celebrations this year.

Kabul, Afghanistan – Groups of women bustle through the female entrance of Sakhi Shah-e Mardan Shrine in Karte Sakhi in western Kabul, where many Afghans gather every year to celebrate Nowruz, which marks the arrival of spring. They rush towards the mosque located inside the shrine premises, posing for selfies and TikTok videos, wearing colourful dresses donned with sequins.

This is the first Nowruz since the Taliban returned to power 20 years after they were toppled in a United States-led invasion.

The Taliban rule and the flagging economy have seemingly put a dampener on celebrations this year. While the scenes at the shrine and mosque feel much like any other Nowruz in Afghanistan, today the numbers – even at peak hour on the eve before Nowruz – are fewer than last year.

Colourful flags flutter in the spring breeze outside the Shia shrine and mosque and on the streets in surrounding neighbourhoods. Street vendors at the bazaar sell sweets and ice cream to women pushing children on tricycles.

The shrine was attacked in 2018 during Nowruz celebrations. At least 31 people were killed in the attack claimed by ISIL (ISIS).

Today Taliban fighters guard one of the capital city’s largest shrines.

Nowruz has been celebrated for more than 3,000 years, observed by adherents of both the main branches of Islam – Sunnis and Shias in Afghanistan, Iran, Central Asia and parts of the Middle East – and usually marked by a public holiday.
