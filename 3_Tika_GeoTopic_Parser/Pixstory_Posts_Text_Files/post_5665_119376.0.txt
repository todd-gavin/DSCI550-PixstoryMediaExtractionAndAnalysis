In Angola, a 170 carat Pink Diamond has been unearthed by miners which is believed to be the largest one found in almost 300 years.

The huge diamond - dubbed The Lulo Rose - was discovered at Lulo mine in the countryâ€™s diamond rich northeast and is among the largest pink diamonds ever found, the Lucapa Diamond Company said in a statement.

The diamond will be sold at international tender at a ground breaking price. Although it's real value will be realised after cutting & polishing, a process in which stones loose fifty percent of their weight.

The most expensive pink diamond ever sold is the 59.6 carat 'Pink Star' which was sold at an auction in Hong Kong in 2017 for humongous 71.2 million US dollars.
