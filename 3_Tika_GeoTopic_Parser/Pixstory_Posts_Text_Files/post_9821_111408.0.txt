Latifa is 27 years old. She lives in India as a refugee. 

'It was never easy for me to become a nurse. When I applied for nursing jobs, everyone turned me down because I am a refugee. I worked day and night to find a job in a hospital, and after 5 months and 15 days, I finally got one', she said.

Working as a doctor brings Latifa joy and  feel she pleased that she can help others and save their lives.
