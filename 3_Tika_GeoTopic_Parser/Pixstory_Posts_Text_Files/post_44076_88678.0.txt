The UEFA Women's Champions League has reached the quarter-final stage, with four big quarter-final matches set to take place in March. In one of those matches, Real Madrid will face rivals and defending champions Barcelona.

The 2021-22 UEFA Women's Champions Tournament was the first to have a group stage since the league was reorganised in 2009. Only half of the 16 clubs remain in the tournament as the knockout stages begin, with the biggest surprise being the departure of English WSL champions Chelsea from the groups based on head-to-head goal difference.

For the second year in a row, Real Madrid has won the Champions League. Barcelona was dominant in Group C, but their performances were much better than expected.

MATCH FACTS, HISTORY AND H2H RECORD:
During the last 7 meetings, Real Madrid have won 0 times, there have been 0 draws while FC Barcelona have won 7 times

Tactics used by FC Barcelona:

Starting with the base of a 4-3-3 shape, they have all the trademarks of a Barcelona side. Paos, Leon, and Paredes attack from the back, while Bonmati, Alexia, and Guijarro maintain the ball in the midfield. It helps that they've all played together for a decade, for club and country, and their chemistry is virtually instinctive.

Tactics used by Real Madrid:

Given the obvious difference between the team's early problems under Aznar and the time of stabilisation and rebuilding that followed Toril's appointment in November, it's been a difficult season to evaluate. The number of games that had to be rescheduled due to the pandemic in January, when the team only played once in the league for the entire month, didn't help matters.
