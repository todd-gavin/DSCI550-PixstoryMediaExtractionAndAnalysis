Fulham have pulled off an impressive signing in the form of Brazil’s Willian on the last day of the transfer window. The Brazilian footballer has signed a one-year deal on a free transfer which will bring him back to the Premier League.
Following the signing, Willian expressed his excitement to be back in the English league and also said that he wants to help his new club to improve.
“I’m happy to be here, I’m happy to be back in the Premier League. Fulham is a special club, a club that wants to improve, that wants to fight for something bigger, so I’m here to help, and I cant wait to get started.”
Willian made his first move to the English league in 2013 where he signed for Chelsea from the Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala. During his seven-year stay, he appeared in 339 games for the Blues, providing 63 goals and 62 assists.
At the West London club, he won the Premier League title twice in 2015 and 2017. He also won the FA Cup, League Cup and the Europa League Final in 2019 against Arsenal by winning 4-1.
Later on, he moved to Arsenal where he stayed for a season and contributed in eight goals, before returning to his former club Corinthians last summer. However, he terminated his contract with the Brazil Serie A side in August after receiving death threats.
Willian, who made his debut for the Brazilian national team in 2011, has represented them on 70 occasions, netting nine times. He was also part of Brazil’s squad for the World Cups in 2014 and 2018. On top of that, he featured in four games in the 2019 Copa America Cup win.
The versatile attacker will add much-needed experience to the squad of Fulham, who are having a busy deadline day as they look to land a couple of players to bolster their squad for the season.
