Leeds United underwent massive change last February, when manager Marcelo Bielsa was
sacked as head coach following a string of poor results. Leeds were promoted from the lows
of the second division in 2020, where they made a name for themselves for Bielsa's unique
style. Replacing manager Jesse Marsch however, believes that was the undoing to Bielsa's
success.

"The injury issue, for me, had a lot to do with the training methodologies. These players were
overtrained and that led to them being physically, mentally, psychologically and emotionally
in a difficult place to recover from week to week, from game to game," Marsch said.

The American was openly critical of Bielsa's methods.

"I have a very specific methodology with the way I work and I've had a reputation for running
and having high running data in the way that we play, but also having healthy, fit and strong
players who can meet the standards of the game that we want. We've tried to put that in
place to help the players, I think that has helped a lot."

Bielsa, previously of Bilbao, Lazio, Lille and Marseille â€” took over the Leeds project in 2018.

Elland Road came alive with high intensity football on both ends of the pitch, and his
translated press appearances too were pure entertainment for British fans. With surmounting
injuries and numerous negative results, Bielsa was dismissed following a 4-0 defeat to
Tottenham (their fourth in a row)
"The [injury] with Patrick I felt terrible about because the responsibility of a coach is to take
care of his players and make sure that you're not injuring them and putting them in harm's
way," Marsch added.

Striker Patrick Bamford played all 38 games of last season's Premier league season but has
appeared in just 9 this season.
