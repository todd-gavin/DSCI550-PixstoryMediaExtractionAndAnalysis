‌Democrats stood in unity to confirm the first-ever African-American Woman in Supreme Court; while Republicans stood firmly with a veto. But these three Republicans broke the party's decision and voted in support of Ketanji Brown Jackson: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. 
‌
‌Mitt Romney twitted his support: "While I do not expect to agree with every decision she may make on the Court, I believe that she more than meets the standard of excellence and integrity." While Collins declared her full support for her openly in a statement late last month, saying she "possesses the experience, qualifications, and integrity to serve" on the bench. Murkowski also remarked on Monday that her support "rests on [her] rejection of the corrosive politicization of the review process for Supreme Court nominees.
‌
‌The vote of these Republicans is a statement on the need for more Black Women in the Judicial and political arena. I sincerely adore these two women and gentlemen who also share this joy with other democrats. Ketanji Brown Jackson, you are the beginning; of many more to come👏
