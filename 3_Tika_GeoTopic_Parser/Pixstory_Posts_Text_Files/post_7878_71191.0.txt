If you still haven’t watched an anime, you’re missing out on whole range of storytelling, these animated series are based off on Mangas (Japanese Comics), these animated shows have their own genres and each has his own story. Anime have themes that range through many notions and philosophies. This series will be about some of the must watch anime. First comes the two legendary animes, created by Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. The story of Naruto Uzumaki who lives in the village of Konoha. He is an orphan who is the jinchurki of the nine tails, its his journey to become the Hokage, the head of the village. “Naruto” is about his childhood and “Shippuden” is about his teen years. To say the anime is all about Naruto would be wrong its also about Sasuke. The last surviving Uchiha, the Uchiha have amazing visual prowess as they posses the Sharingan. Both anime have some of the best arcs I’ve seen. One thing that always intrigues me is the details that goes behind in making shows like this. This anime has focused a lot on the side characters along with the two protagonists. Some of my favourite side characters include Jiraiya, Kakashi, Minato. The fights are absolutely mind-blowing with Jutsu. The jutsus (techniques) are divided into three main jutsus, ninjutsu, genjutsu and taijutsu. Then come the kekkai genkai and senjutsu. Then comes the concept of chakra. Things like these made me heavily interested in the anime. The abilities of characters are over the top but some of the best moments come when everything seems to simple. Just look at the taijustu (Jujutsu or empty-hand combat skill). Some of the dialogues of the series are straight up philosophical. This anime has some of the best antagonists like Madara Uchiha, Tobi, Pain, etc. Every side characters story is It has various themes such as friendship, courage, determination, faith, self belief and many more. It’s a must watch for everyone. As Naruto says, “Dattebayo”.
