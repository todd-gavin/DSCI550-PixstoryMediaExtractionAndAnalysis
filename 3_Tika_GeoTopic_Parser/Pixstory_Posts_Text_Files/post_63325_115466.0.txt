Blue light exposure can negatively impact your health. When you're staring at a screen all day
long (which is fake blue light) and especially at night, it will mess with your body's circadian rhythm. Your body won't be able to understand if it's ready for bed at night. 

This is why it's so important to use blue light blocking glasses at least 2-3 hours before bedtime so your body can produce melatonin and decrease cortisol production.

Blue light not only impacts your sleep, but can lead to
depression and memory impairment. We need quality AND quantity sleep. Sleep is crucial for optimal health because it's where our bodies can heal and reset.
Studies have shown that there is also a connection
between chronic blue light exposure at night and cancer.

It is crucial we try to limit artificial blue light as much as we can, especially right before bed. Your sleep with thank you for it.
