I am deeply disappointed by the news of Uddhav Thackrey residing in this state of turmoil Even after approaching the Supreme Court and the court staying the order of a floor test the MVP should have faced the floor test and proved its majority in the house The way MVP government was brought down it smelt corruption The Thackrey government did a decent job during the pandemic and with this news of the resignation I am not sure about the future of Maharashtra now one which Bal Thackrey envisioned It s all about the number games With the rebels outcasting the CM it was a grave decision I agree that the CM gracefully resigned from the post as he can t get involved in this nuisance yet if he would have faced the floor test and believed in his suporters and fought for his cause things would be better
