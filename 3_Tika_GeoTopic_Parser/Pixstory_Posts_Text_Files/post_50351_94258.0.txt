The first phase of Operation Vidhwansa was quite successful. The Police stayed for 3 nights in 6 different villages which earlier had been the den of Maoist activities. The Police also interacted with the villagers about the hideouts and membership of the Maoists. Some landmines were recovered on the road from Adhaura to Soli. 

But the Maoists who must have been watching the movements carefully were not directly encountered. The movement increased the confidence of the forces in moving safely upon the hills. The first phase of the operation was followed by more similar phases launched around every fortnight or so which had different modes of travel and different routes including several using no vehicles at all and by trekking hilly ascents on foot.

The different phases also included several night camps by the forces in remote villages on the Kaimur Hills. During these operations which were meticulously planned for hours and days to ensure minimal damage to police side, the police camped in the remote villages on the Kaimur Hills and interacted with the villagers to restore confidence. 

The terrain of the Kaimur Hills being very tough, these successful operations led to rise in the outlook and confidence of police and public at large. This also led to greater understanding of the Hill topography. It was documented properly for training purposes. Due to these operations the pre-requisites for conducting the Lok Sabha Elections on the hills in 2009 was achieved. The then DGP, Bihar commended the Rohtas Police for display of professionalism during the operation.
