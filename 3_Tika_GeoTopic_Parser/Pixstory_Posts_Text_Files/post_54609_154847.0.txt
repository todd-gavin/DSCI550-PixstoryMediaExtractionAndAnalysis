King Charles III’s coronation will take place at Westminster Abbey on May 6 2023. But what is a coronation, and what can we expect?A coronation is a ritual act bestowing a crown (or similar decorative head-piece) symbolising royal or imperial power.It is usually associated with other important political and religious acts, such as oaths, anointing, enthronement, homage, parades, gift-giving or presentation to the people.These acts will be on display in the coronation of Charles III.Hear from themCoronations are not necessarily legally required for the exercise of a monarchical office – Charles is already king. Instead, coronations are fundamentally symbolic and ritual.They affirm a social and political structure within the larger political theology of a polity.In Europe, they have played a pivotal function in formalising the acceptance by clergy, nobles and general populace of a monarch’s accession to office.A short historyCrowns and coronations have ancient origins and were popularised in Europe during the early Middle Ages.In the Roman empire, Constantine the Great began the practice of wearing a diadem (an ornamental headband), and the emperor Julian was raised up by soldiers on a shield.Christian coronation rites developed later in the Byzantine empire, and the Carolingian Franks in western Europe added the anointing.Coronation services were usually performed by a political leader or member of the clergy, such as a prominent local bishop or even the Pope.Coronations underwent standardisation, development and change across the Middle Ages and gradually declined in the modern period.The British crown is the only surviving European monarchy that retains a coronation, though there are Asian and African countries that still practice it.Other surviving monarchies have enthronement (such as Japan and Luxembourg) or inauguration (such as Spain and Sweden) ceremonies which are secular or religious in form.Coronations like those still held in England are associated with a biblical theology of kingship.Read more: https://theconversation.com/king-charles-iii-will-be-coronated-in-may-the-ritual-has-ancient-origins-heres-what-we-can-expect-191262
