The only big award missing from the striker's brilliant CV is an international one, but can his country even make it to Qatar?

Portugal failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup after losing 2-1 to Serbia in their last group game, with Aleksandr Mitrovic's late goal securing top spot in Group A for their opponents.

Cristiano Ronaldo has been in four World Cups since making his international debut in 2003, but how can Portugal ensure that he is on the aircraft to Qatar next year?

If Portugal qualifies and Ronaldo is fit when the tournament begins in November 2022, he will play in the World Cup. Portugal's position in Qatar, on the other hand, is still in jeopardy.

Ronaldo, who is already 37 years old, spoke about his desire to add the World Cup trophy to his impressive resume in December 2020.

"It will be tough, but we are a good team, a young team," he said. "We have a fantastic coach [Fernando Santos], so we’re very, very, very positive on that.

"As I told you many, many times, my dream is to win something for the Portugal national team and I won two titles, which is making me feel happy.

"I win [with] every club that I have played with, but the World Cup... it’s a dream. It’s a dream."
However, now that Portugal is in the World Cup play-offs, that dream will be much more difficult to realise.

Despite this, Ronaldo has remained stubborn, issuing a rallying cry on social media before of their match.
"Total focus on the 2022 World Cup," he said in an Instagram post. "Proud, as always, to represent Portugal.

"We know that the path will not be easy, we have the utmost respect for the opponents we will face and who share the same goals as us. But together, we will fight to put Portugal in its rightful place. Let's do it!"
