On June 1, the legendary Wembley Stadium in London will host a match between UEFA EURO 2020 champions Italy and CONMEBOL Copa America 2021 champions Argentina.

This 'Finalissima' showdown will pit the current champions of the world's two best footballing continents against each other for the coveted CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions.

The resurrection of this iconic footballing duel, twenty-nine years after its last edition, is the outcome of UEFA and CONMEBOL's long-standing collaboration.

Brazil and Argentina will compete in the UEFA Nations League after South America's governing body CONMEBOL negotiated an agreement with its European counterpart to join the biennial competition in December last year.

CONMEBOL will join the Nations League in 2024, according to UEFA vice-president Zbigniew Boniek.

“Twenty-nine years after its last edition, the relaunch of this legendary footballing encounter is the result of the long-standing partnership between UEFA and CONMEBOL and will serve as a catalyst for the global development of football – uniting countries, continents, and cultures, while also demonstrating to fans around the globe that football can be a force of good in turbulent times.”

It will be the first time since 1993 when the top national teams from Europe and South America compete for the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions.
