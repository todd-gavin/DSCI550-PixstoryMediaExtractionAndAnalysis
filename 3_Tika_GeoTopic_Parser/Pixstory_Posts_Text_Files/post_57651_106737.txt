Cancel culture is an unhealthy practice Just having the liberty to dominate or punish someone by bombarding the person with abhorring comments or mass insults can t be the only way to fight injustice Prejudices and wrongs can t permanently be eradicated by mass punishing someone as in the light of fighting against injustice one forgets the intensity of harm they re throwing on someone According to an article in Newyork Times a student opinion described cancelling culture as toxic Being called in instead of called out is a much more effective way to help members of our society grow and become better people in the future They can realize a mistake was made fix that mistake and take the proper steps to ensure this mistake will not happen again Calling people out only crushes their confidence and esteem which leads them to hide from the public eye unwilling to speak out on the issue and improve themselves When it comes to teens they are sometimes not able to bear the impacts of cancelling culture Research has found that teens are particularly vulnerable to social influences because the brain regions involved in the social aspects of life are still maturing In addition brain imaging studies show that social rejection hurts It lights up the same parts of the adolescent brain activated by physical pain As a result being socially boycotted at an age when peer connections are essentially meaningful can be devastating Many therapists report treating teen clients who suffered from depression and suicidality for months after being cancelled by peers
