Heavy downpours in the city that never stops raining. 

Do you enjoy rain? Does it make you happy? 

Sometimes I wonder the same rain we enjoy the most is also a nuisance for the people whose daily bread and butter is affected by it.

When I was walking back from college, I noticed a local fruits vendor was not there today. When it made me realize the same privilege I can have is not enjoyed equally by all, and how his day must have been not earning the hourly sales.
