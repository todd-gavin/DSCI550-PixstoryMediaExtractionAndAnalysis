 Just like Skyrim it seems that modding has now become an active practice in the PC version of Marvel s Spider Man as people are modding the game to play in different skins Now two unique skins have entered the game Ezio from Assassin s Creed Brotherhood and Revelations and Kratos the primal fury infused badass protagonist from God Of War allowing players to don their skins while web slinging their way across New York in one of the most awkward fashion there is As far as Kratos goes his design is still a bit of a mismatch in the game while web slinging though for Ezio it weirdly feels a good fit as both visually and gameplay wise it does not seem to be too far fetched Sometime ago a mod was uploaded on Nexus Mods that allowed players to don the skin of Marvel comics legend Stan Lee and traverse the streets of New York as him while still mimicking the movements of Spiderman With this players can crawl walls take selfies on rooftops sling webs throughout the streets of New York and do everything else that a normal Spider Man would do just looking a lot more ridiculous
