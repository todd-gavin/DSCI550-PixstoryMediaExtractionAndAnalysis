On Sept NASA plans to change an asteroid s orbit The large binary asteroid Didymos and its moonlet Dimorphos currently pose no threat to Earth But by crashing a pound kilogram probe into Didymos moon at a speed of approximately mph kph NASA is going to complete the world s first full scale planetary defense mission as a proof of concept This mission is called the Double Asteroid Redirection Test or DART I am a scholar who studies space and international security and it is my job to ask what the likelihood really is of an object crashing into the planet and whether governments are spending enough money to prevent such an event To find the answers to these questions one has to know what near Earth objects are out there To date NASA has tracked only an estimated of the bigger ones Surprise asteroids have visited Earth in the past and will undoubtedly do so in the future Experiments like the DART mission may help prepare humanity for such an event The threat from asteroids and comets Millions of cosmic bodies like asteroids and comets orbit the Sun and often crash into the Earth Most of these are too small to pose a threat but some can be cause for concern Near Earth objects include asteroids and comets whose orbits will bring them within million miles million kilometers of the Sun Astronomers consider a near Earth object a threat if it will come within million miles million kilometers of the planet and if it is at least feet meters in diameter If a celestial body of this size crashed into Earth it could destroy an entire city and cause extreme regional devastation Larger objects miles kilometer or more could have global effects and even cause mass extinctions The most famous and destructive celestial impact took place million years ago when an asteroid with a mile kilometer diameter crashed into what is now the Yucat n Peninsula Read more
