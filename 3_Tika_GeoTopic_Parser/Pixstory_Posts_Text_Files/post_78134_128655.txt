It s almost impossible to watch a sunset and not dream as said by Bern Williams Over a hundred miles away from Los Angeles here I am dreaming enjoying the solitude of the high desert wasteland of Kernville CA We visit the area every year for a family camping trip Although I m not taken for the outdoorsy type I enjoy the opportunity to disconnect from the daily stress of life It s an opportunity to unplug to get away from the inundation of our always on world The surrounding area is desolate filled with cacti brush and the semi frequent jackrabbit that is there to remind you of the surrounding animals whose kingdom you have called home for the night
