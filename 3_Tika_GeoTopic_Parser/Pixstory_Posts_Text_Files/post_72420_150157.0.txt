It is not a ritual. It’s more like a meeting between families which is a very common tradition. And just an informal gathering with an intimate dinner hosted by Richa and Ali for their families. It’s happening at a private venue in Central Delhi today. It will only have 30-35 people.”Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal will be planning several functions in the capital but will be tying the knot in an intimate ceremony in Mumbai on October 6.
