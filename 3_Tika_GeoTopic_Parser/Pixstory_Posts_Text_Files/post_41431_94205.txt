Since its inception in NASCAR has used Easter as an off weekend often the first natural break in a race season and industry executives have scheduled a rare vacation during that week Weather related rescheduling has resulted in races on Easter Sunday over the years the most recent being in when a snowfall forced a change in the schedule but NASCAR never chose the date However this year things are looking a bit different US News reported that in order to attract a larger television audience NASCAR official Ben Kennedy great grandson of NASCAR s founder worked with Fox to schedule the second Cup Series race on dirt covered Bristol Motor Speedway for Sunday night under the lights When you think about all the other sports leagues with NFL on Thanksgiving NBA on Christmas this is our opportunity to run on Easter Sunday and drive a lot of momentum for our fans that are watching at home Kennedy said when the race was announced In my opinion this is a good move People gather over holidays to celebrate together and this might even give NASCAR the opportunity to expand its audience Moreover since this is happening later in the day people can celebrate in the morning and tune in later at night to relax and watch the race This will not only promote family time but also may give birth to new traditions Let s see how this affects the ratings and if this experiment turns out to be beneficial for NASCAR
