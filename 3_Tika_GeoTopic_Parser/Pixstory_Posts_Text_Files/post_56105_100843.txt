Concrete poetry is an arrangement of linguistic elements in which the typographical effect is more significant in conveying meaning than verbal significance It is sometimes cited as visual poetry a term that has now developed a distinct meaning of its own Concrete poetry relates more to the visual than to the verbal arts although there is a considerable overlap in the kind of product to which it refers Historically however concrete poetry has developed from a long tradition of shaped or patterned poems in which the words are organized in such a way as to depict their subject The movement drew inspiration from Dada Surrealism and other nonrational th century movements Concrete poetry has an extreme visual bias and in this way is usually distinguished from pattern poetry It attempts to move away from a purely verbal concept of verse toward what its proponents call verbivocovisual expression incorporating geometric and graphic elements into the poetic act or process
