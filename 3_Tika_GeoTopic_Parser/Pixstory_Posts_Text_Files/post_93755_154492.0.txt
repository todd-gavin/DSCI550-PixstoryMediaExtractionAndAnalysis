Parody is important because it allows us to criticize and question without being aggressive or malicious. Rather, we use comedy. Parody imitates, stresses, and draws attention to certain features, characters, or plot points which are weak, silly, strange, or subject to criticism of any sort. 
A parody is a work that’s created by imitating an existing original work in order to make fun of or comment on an aspect of the original. Parodies can target celebrities, politicians, authors, a style or trend, or any other interesting subject.
The term parody (pronounced par–uh-dee) is derived from the Greek phrase parodia which referred to a type of poem which imitated the style of epic poems but with mockery and light comedy.Whereas serious criticism of politicians, artwork, celebrities, or literature can be boring or complicated, parody draws in an audience with a sense of humor and a lighter take on serious issues. Parody allows comedians to take on serious issues while still making us laugh.
