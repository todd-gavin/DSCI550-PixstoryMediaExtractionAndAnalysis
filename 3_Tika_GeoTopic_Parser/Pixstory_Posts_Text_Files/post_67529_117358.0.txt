Microgreens are vegetable greens that have been harvested immediately after sprouting. They're jam packed with  nutrients, great for garnishing, and add texture to the dish. They also lend a sweet and spicy flavour to the dish.. 

Microgreens can be made from just about any vegetable. Popular microgreens are beetroot, pea, garlic, radish, etc. They're also extremely easy to make at home. All you need is a container and a damp tissue. Depending on the weather, microgreens can sprout anywhere from a few hours to 2 days. 

Microgreens go well on salads, soups, sandwiches, desserts, and more!
