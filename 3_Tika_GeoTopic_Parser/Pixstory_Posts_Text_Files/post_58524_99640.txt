 continued Moving on to a story about nose piercings sorry Department of Anatomy I have nothing against you but y all are just horrible My therapist said If you want to try exploring gender euphoria try to experience what a little bit of mascara might make you feel like not that that necessarily equates to womanhood but why not try I started doing that I put on a bit of mascara I wore clothes that are more floral and got my nose pierced because in India it s very common for women to have their noses pierced in many cultures So there was an exam in the Dissection Hall there s cadavers laid out students were preparing I was studying and the HOD of Anatomy told me to get out Because you have a nose piercing she says I wish I said So do you Why is me wearing a nose piercing such an issue it s a piece of metal sitting on your nose its flesh She says It s against Indian culture and patients are not going to accept you I respond When was the last time you saw a patient darling I was really mean but she was being very very very condescending I said I don t want to take it off This is part of my gender expression It s my constitutional right to express the way that I wish There is no rule in college preventing this from happening So you have absolutely no basis to be doing this She convened a panel of the entire anatomy department residents professors no one said anything There were students sitting there she was screaming nobody said anything She told me to go to the jeweler to take it off I came back later to find that I was banned from the anatomy department for a piece of metal I broke down in the boys hostel badly that day I d always been a straight A student But for the first time a small attempt at being myself could hinder my access to education That was very depressing
