The use of simple stone tools increases the quality of food An interdisciplinary and intercontinental team has demonstrated by examining a population of monkeys in North-East Brazil This could also have happened in the course of human evolution The article Stone tools improve diet quality in wild monkeys by whose author, among others, Elisabetta Visalberghi of the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the CNR has just been published in Current Biology Homo and others who preceded us In the last century it was discovered that even some populations of chimpanzees use tools and today we know that even capuchin monkeys and macaques are capable of it To date, no study has examined whether and how the use of tools improve the diet An interdisciplinary team located in four of the five continents has now done it by examining the behavior of a population of capuchin monkeys that have been studied for many years in the North East of Brazil The article Stone tools improve diet quality in wild monkeys of which the author is among others Elisabetta Visalberghi of the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies Istc of the Cnr it has just been published in Current Biology The paleoanthropologists have noticed that the increase in the complexity of lithic tools is accompanied by that of the size of the braincase and therefore of the brain explains Visalberghi Given that the brain an energetically very expensive structure to maintain for paleoanthropologists have hypothesized that it was the improvement in diet made possible by the use of tools that allowed the evolution of larger and more energetically expensive brains
