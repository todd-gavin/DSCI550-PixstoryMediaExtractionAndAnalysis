You'd be hard pressed to visit Australia and not come across Barramundi on the menu. As nomadsworld tells us, the Aboriginal name for this species of seabass found in Australia and the Indo-Pacific is barramundi. Barramundi means "large-scaled silver fish" in English. You must try this fish; it is really popular for a reason: it is excellent! 

Furthermore, If you like coconut, you'll enjoy the Lamington, a traditional Australian dish. A Lamington is a sponge cake square that has been dipped in chocolate or raspberry sauce and then dusted with coconut. I was initially put off by these because I dislike coconut, but they're delicious with a cup of tea in the afternoon!
