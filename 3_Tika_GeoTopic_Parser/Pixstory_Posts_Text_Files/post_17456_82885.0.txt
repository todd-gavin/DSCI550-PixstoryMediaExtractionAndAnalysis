Gini Wijnaldum's Paris Saint Germain 'nightmare' in France continues after being heavily criticised following a defeat to Nantes on Saturday evening.

Ligue 1 leaders PSG were handed a shock 3-1 defeat away at Nantes and Wijnaldum was handed a rare start by manager Mauricio Pochettino.

The Dutchman wasn't included in the starting XI for PSG's huge Champions League win over Real Madrid, but he was given his chance to stake a claim for a starting spot in the second leg.

Unfortunately for the former Liverpool midfielder, he failed to impress the French press and was given a rating of just two out of 10. Lionel Messi, meanwhile, was rated four.

Wijnaldum played an integral role in the Liverpool side that won both the Champions League and Premier League - starting the majority of the matches in those memorable season's.
