A new study suggests that spending time with dogs can decrease stress levels in humans especially children It is more like a relaxation exercise that calms one s mind and is suitable for their health They re like a personal therapist who will understand you better than humans According to an experiment published in the New York times In one group children spent minutes twice a week over the course of a month with a trained dog and its handler They d pet the dog for a few minutes if the dog and children were up for it ask some questions and play In another group children worked on relaxation exercises over the same time frame without any dogs doing things like wiggling their fingers and toes before lying down on yoga mats to listen to a guided meditation A third group served as a control Researchers took saliva samples from all children to measure their cortisol levels before and after the four week trial They also measured the neurotypical children s cortisol levels before and after each session They found that children in the dog intervention group had lower cortisol levels than their peers in both the relaxation and control groups This was not a lesser known fact as the amount of happiness a pet evokes in your mind is ineffable Their selfless nature and caring attitude are far more welcoming than humans
