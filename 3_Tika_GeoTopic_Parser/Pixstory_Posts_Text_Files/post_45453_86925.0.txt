Kalidou Koulibaly (Napoli)
Kalidou Koulibaly, the man in charge of a defensive unit that has only conceded three goals so far, has only added to his growing reputation, which has seen him linked with Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the previous 12 months. The 30-year-old Senegalese player is described by Spalletti as "an exceptional leader."

Marquinhos (PSG)
While the additions of Hakimi, Ramos, Wijnaldum, Donnarumma, and Messi to a roster that already included Mbappé, Verratti, Neymar, and Di Maria may have given Mauricio Pocchetino Europe's most gifted group of players, his captain Marquinhos has been the defensive star for the season.

Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea)
Thomas Tuchel may have been fired from his last two jobs as coach of Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain, but he's proving to be a wonderful match at Chelsea and has worked wonders with many of the current squad members. Antonio Rudiger has been the pick of a Blues defence, and he might have easily been joined on this list by the reinvigorated Thiago Silva or up-and-comer Trevoh Chalobah, all of whom have impressed.

Joao Cancelo (Manchester City)
Joao Cancelo has been one of Manchester City's top players, despite a position transfer, leading the squad in tackles and interceptions. After spending the most of last season at full-back on the opposite wing, the Portuguese has started the 2021 season on fire, looking to put the disappointment of losing out on Euro 21 behind him. For Pep Guardiola's second-placed City, he presently stands fourth among Premier League defenders in interceptions.
