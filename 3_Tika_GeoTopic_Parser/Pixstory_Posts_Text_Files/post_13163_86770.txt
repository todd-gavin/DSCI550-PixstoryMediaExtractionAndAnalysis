What do you do with your extras things You s probably throwing it away but if those throws are efficient and the needs of the people around you are high throwing those things away will probably cause a rift between them Because discarded property is unregulated and ownerless everyone will try to get it sooner and this will cause a rift between them Imagine that this disposal of extra items or even money takes the form of a lot of humanitarian aid and is offered to the masses of the needy automatically on the part of the recipients this aid will encourage a situation of looting This is what happened in our country and it is happening again Receiving help if it persists paves the way for some to accumulate and create insatiable greed Part of the corruption and war in aid countries stems from this In this situation the accumulator loses the value of life and accumulation through looting of unregulated property and without the necessary supervision becomes a way of earning money sometimes conditions of need such as disability war etc become a money making commodity One of the causes of the power struggle in our country is the greed for access to this property to what has been or is going to flow in the name of aid Westerners have come a long way and have a lot of technology experience system capital and prosperity and their waste is feeding the hungry but the consequences are severe because on the other side cannibal groups are formed Who also make their patriotic and religious dignity and values a weapon in the way of looting Eyesight The old man walks by with handcart from time to time I saw him today ringing a bell to announce that he has brought old tools that are useful A few boys and a few girls they ran to handcart two of them were fighting for something today I saw a bad guy pushing another head I remembered the patriotic bullying groups that are now in power This was a small event that explained the state of our homeland well
