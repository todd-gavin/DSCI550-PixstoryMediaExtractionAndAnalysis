Veganism is often the best option for people who want to live a healthy lifestyle but it isn t always the best option for the environment Vegans according to Mike Archer a professor at the University of New South Wales cause greater harm to animals by depriving them of the one thing they need to exist vegetables Plantation farming requires more time and effort than animal farming Wheat and other grains production in Australia resulted in times more sentient animals being slaughtered per kilogramme of usable protein as well as more environmental damage and animal cruelty than red meat production Because Australia has lost more than half of its natural vegetation cultivation to produce these grains necessitates clear cutting native vegetation which kills countless of animals and plants Moreover Veganism has been linked to strokes brain health hair loss and depression according to a WebMD article When one eliminates meat from their diet these symptoms are frequently caused by a shortage of protein iron vitamin B and zinc Vegan meals are deficient in proteins vitamins and nutrients and they can also contain toxic elements such as sugar and oil There are numerous vegan brands on the market that are harmful to a person s health Furthermore according to daily titan while it is true that eating meat is bad for the environment because it produces more greenhouse gas emissions this does not negate the fact that following a vegan diet wastes land that could be utilised to feed more people The livestock industry which breeds cows pigs and chickens uses pasture terrain that is unsuitable for crop production Perennial cropland is used to feed cattle and sustains crops that need to be alive all year Finally cultivated cropland is typically used for vegetables fruits and nuts Vegan diets avoid using perennial land which is detrimental for the environment because they don t use recyclable soil to grow crops that are consumed on a regular basis So a vegan diet can be your preference but it is definitely not the Hail Mary that will save the planet
