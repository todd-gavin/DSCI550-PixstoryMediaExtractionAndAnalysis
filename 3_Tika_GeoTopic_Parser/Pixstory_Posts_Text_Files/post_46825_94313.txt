 Introduction philosopher George Berkeley believed that Locke s Essay did not carry the principles of empiricism far enough Lockes Essay Locke said that a material thing does not necessary has only primary Settings that the material itself defines like color but the mind of someone Instead its splitted into three categories Material Perceive of the Object Circumstances while perceiving Immaterialism Berkeleys Claim was that theres only perception nothing like material itself and it would disappear if no one is looking at it The Idea was based on the splitting of material and immaterial world as one couldnt tell if something is real when only having his own mind to figure it out Thats where Science jumps in The Quantum View of the Theory In Quantum Science objects can exist in different states of being until they are watched by someone which would define a static state of being Conclusion Sciences is not completly contrary to Berkeley as he states its all cause of the presence of Gods Mind This might be interesting for someone to argument about a godly ecistence proven by science as always its up to you what to believe
