Greetings on International Women's Day! ❤️👏🏻

•Out on an endeavour to feature something striking on this day, something that stands out, someone suggested talking to women working in an all womens petrol pump. We are so used to women working as labourers, teachers, doctors, engineers, flying planes even running countries but when it comes to jobs which were so far a ‘man’s  domain” the women do get eyeballs. 

•A women truck/ auto driver will get noticed while men won’t invite attention. So how is it for these women working at the petrol pump and maning it 24/7. 
So I went to speak with the women who work at the gas station, who make their living by working all hours of the day and night. 

•The petrol station was near Moti Bagh, and stands out due to its staff. 

•When we arrived, the ladies were overjoyed to see us and welcomed us as if it were their house. 
We asked the Incharge  if we could ask a few questions because it was Women's Day! 

•We noticed that the petrolpump was running smoothly and that the ladies were working tirelessly.
