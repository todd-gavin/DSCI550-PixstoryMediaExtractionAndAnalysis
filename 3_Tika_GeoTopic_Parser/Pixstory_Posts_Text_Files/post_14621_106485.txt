Most people have never heard of the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis but this rickettsia infects more organisms than any other microbe It is known to infect a broad range of crustaceans spiders mosquitoes millipedes and nematodes and may infect more than million insect species worldwide To what does W pipientis owe its extraordinary success Quite simply this endosymbiont is a master at manipulating its hosts reproductive biology Viruses normally spread by insects may not be transmissible if the insect is infected with Wolbachia This has led to the notion that this infection could be used as a means of biological control Aedes mosquitoes transmit numerous viruses like Zika dengue chikungunya and West Nile In humans these viral infections have no cure and no treatment beyond supportive care so insect control is the best prevention Nonetheless infection can be established by transinfection the process of transferring the microbes from another insect species Many Wolbachia isolates have been screened for those that have the most severe effects on Aedes and several stable insect strains have been established with Wolbachia from Drosophila Cytoplasmic interference is extensive in these strains of Wolbachia To establish a stable population of Aedes outside the laboratory it is important that the infection not impose a dramatic burden on the insect as it must compete with and integrate into wild populations In a promising development Wolbachia infected Aedes mosquitoes are effective at blocking the transmission of both Zika and dengue viruses Experiments in Australia have confirmed the ability of these insects to persist and spread in local mosquito populations validating this approach to insect vector control
