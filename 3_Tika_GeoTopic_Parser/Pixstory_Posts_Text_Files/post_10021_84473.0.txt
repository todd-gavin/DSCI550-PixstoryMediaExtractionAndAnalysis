Newborn babies

Because the mother and the newborn child are thought to be in great danger of jend and evil spirits, special precautions are taken.

Among the Hazaras it is the custom to draw a stick man on the wall near the door of the room where the mother and child are staying. The stick man is drawn with indigo dye, a color particularly effective in repelling evil spirits – and the only details are the nose and two fingered hands. Above the place where the child sleeps, a bisected arc is drawn with the same colored dye. The meaning of this is not known.

Nobody compliments the baby in case evil spirits are listening, and if someone does say anything positive it is prefixed by “in the name of God,” ba nam-e khuda, as a protection.

It is common to burn the seed of wild rue, espand, mixed with the aromatic root of a plant called burbu. The smoke produced is believed to ward off evil spirits. Because of the danger of evil spirits near the house of the newborn child, people who are particularly sensitive to the spirits, or jend, do not go there to visit.

The mother is almost invariably given one of several drugs. It is believed in Afghan folk medicine that the human constitution is either warm or cold, and that certain sicknesses are caused by warmth or cold. The mother is thought to be cold if she has given birth to a son and warm if to a daughter. Accordingly, she is given a drug to counteract each of these conditions. In addition she is given a drug, juwani o badyan, which contains anise and is used in general for intestinal distress.
