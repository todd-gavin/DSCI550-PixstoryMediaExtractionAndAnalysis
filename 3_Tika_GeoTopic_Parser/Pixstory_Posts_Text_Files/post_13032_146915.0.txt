Today is the International Day of Peace. September 21 is celebrated all over the world since 1982. But the people of Afghanistan have been celebrating this day for years under the shadow of war and hoping for a war-free Afghanistan. The citizens of Afghanistan are thirsty for peace, because Afghanistan has spent the last five decades in war.Millions of Afghan citizens are still affected by the war. For this reason, every moment.This year, the expectation of the people and the hope of the people of Afghanistan is that they will not celebrate the International Day of Peace at the height of violence There has been a war since I was born!Yes again. I was born in war, I lived in war, I will grow old in war, but I still hope that peace will finally come and we will smile deeper.â€ŽWar is not a good experience. If you want to talk about it, what do you say?One does not want to be in the middle of a war, but when a war is imposed on one's homeland, one must stand and fight. We are the children of war, a war that could not be abandoned. It should stop and we stopped. We didn't want war and we don't want it, but when it comes, nothing can be done. I have always been and am tired of war, and now that there is a civil war in our country, we are happy and waiting for peace to come and last. You know that we have given more than thousands of martyrs, that means thousands of mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers... the bereaved who will never return... Not only a group of people, but the whole of Afghanistan has paid a price for this peaceI know thisThe end of every war is peace and no war is eternal. The war in Afghanistan cannot be an exception to this rule. Many experts and my people, the suffering children, girls, and women of Afghanistan, are waiting for peace and the permanent end of the war in Afghanistan with pure optimism.Sabira mehtar
