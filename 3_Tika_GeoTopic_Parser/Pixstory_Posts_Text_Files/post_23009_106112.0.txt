A season where Marc Skinner’s Manchester United suffered an injury crisis throughout the campaign, availability became the key aspect of a player. At the start of the season, United had the trio of Aoife Mannion, Millie Turner and Maria Thorisdottir as the only defenders in the CB department. 

In the 2nd game of the season at the King Power Stadium, Turner got injured and as a result, was unavailable until United’s game against Brighton in mid December. But due to an issue with artery in her neck in January, she was sidelined indefinitely and only managed to play 4 games in the WSL. Mannion played every minute of every game in the WSL for United until United’s 3-0 win against Spurs in January and didn’t feature in any game after that due to an ACL injury. 

United signed Irish defender Diane Caldwell on the last day of the winter transfer window but she too was only available for 5 league games. 

Cometh the hour, Cometh the woman! 
Thorisdottir made 20 appearances for the Red Devils this season, starting in 17 of those games. Considered a key player in United’s ‘Play from the Back’ system, the Norweigan has boasted a 83.8% pass completion per 90. The average pass completion % per 90 this season in WSL was 75.4! 
Maria made 101 clearances (5.54 Clearances per 90) this season in the league - 6th most. 

Mistakes were made no doubt but no player is perfect. After the season United have had, where head coach Marc Skinner sometimes struggled to field a back 4 of defenders and had to rely on midfielders Katie Zelem and Hayley Ladd in the defensive roles, having a player fit was a blessing or a miracle and Thorisdottir offered that. There were a few doubts when she first joined United from Chelsea in 2020/21 winter window but it is safe to say that she has proven her worth. 

It is an important summer for Maria as she has been named in the Norway squad for the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 alongside fellow United player Vilde Boe Risa.
