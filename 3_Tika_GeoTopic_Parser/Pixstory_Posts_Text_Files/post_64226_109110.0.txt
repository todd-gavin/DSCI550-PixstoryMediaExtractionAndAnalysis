Most of us meet a lot of new people daily in our lives. Maybe at School/Colleges, Gym, park, Coaching centres, parties, family functions and many more. It means definitely we have to introduce ourself to somebody, somewhere. There is no escape.
Here, this is my first post at Pixstory and I want to introduce myself to you guys but in my own unique way.

The time has come to unreveal my secrets, my supernatural powers, kinda same as superwoman…not kidding I am serious…..ok
but why u laughing haaa..
I am simple girl with simple routine like any other girl…no shakalaka boom boom…
But I can say that I am kind, ready to help someone type person…and i am blessed with two eyes(with specs actually)…nose, two ears…I am very thankful to god…
Not introvert but ambivert….
Want to do many things in my life….
Remain Confused many times….hahah
That's all…I guess…anything left?…
Ummmm…..
Ooo…yah I love Table Tennis…more than cricket…
You know Everyone one is searching for happiness in this world but I can get it by just calling out my name 🤪. And one secret I love my surname more than my name so call me by it and I will spare two more minutes  talking with you😂 
I love to be your friend if you wish….🙂
But yes warning you beforehands, you will never really understand me, will always stand staring in confusion.
Thnx…👐
