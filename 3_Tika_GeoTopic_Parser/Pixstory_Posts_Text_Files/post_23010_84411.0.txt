After United’s 7 game winning streak was ended by Chelsea in the Conti Cup semifinal, there was an understanding among the fans that the 3-1 loss was just a blip and that Skinner’s side would bounce back! A 1-1 draw vs Arsenal and a 1-0 loss vs Manchester City, both in the WSL, ended those hopes. 


The 1-0 loss in the Manchester Derby in the WSL was a warning sign; it is the general concensus that the team’s mentality and in-game management were big issues. 

United managed to undo their wrongs in the Manchester Derby in the FA Cup 5th round as Skinner played Toone in her natural position, i.e., No.10 and started a winger - Galton. The team performed admirably well in the first half and were leading 1-0 at the break thanks to the brilliance of United’s set-piece specialist Zelem. The spectators witnessed a rare 𝐎𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐨 goal from United’s skipper. 

It is safe to say that Weir won’t be the only one whose goal in the Manchester Derbies will be nominated for the Puskas award. 

But tides turned in the second half! Taylor brought in Raso and Weir at HT. Raso’s cross was integral in City’s first goal scored by Hemp. 8 minutes later, due to several individual errors from United players, City found the net twice. White and Weir’s strike helped City achieve a 2 goal cushion over United. Shaw was subbed in at the 78th minute and found the net after only being on the pitch for a few seconds and made it 4-1 in favor of the away team. 

A tough loss for the Red Devils meant their FA Cup run had come to an end. There needs to be an improvement in the in-game management and the mentality of this team, especially when it comes to facing the BIG 3 OF THE WSL - Arsenal, Chelsea, City. 

United have made huge progress this season especially after a tough start to the season but they shouldn’t let the results in the last few games derail them from the aim for the rest of the season - ACHIEVING UWCL STATUS FOR NEXT SEASON.
