With only two weeks left for the release of the new Marvel web series based on the character of ‘Moon Knight,’ which will be played by critically acclaimed actor Oscar Issac. Let me give you some information about the upcoming web series 

Who is Moon Knight?

Moon Knight will be based on a character named ‘Marc Spector,’ who is battling with mental issues but back then Marc was a mercenary with years of military experience later on Spector eventually become the murderous madman because Bushman attempted to kill two innocent archaeologists and to save them, Marc fights against Bushman but Spector was left for dead in the scorching desert of Egypt but somehow Marc made his way to the tomb and died and then be reborn at the feet of a statue of the moon Khonshu as the taker of Vengeance. And from there Marc will take revenge on Bushman and become a Moon Knight and will save the country from other villains because of his superpowers.

Trailer Talk?

After watching the trailer, I understood that Steven is suffering from a sleeping disorder and he can’t tell the difference between dreams and also suffering from multiple personality disorder. There he met Arthur Sorrow who will help him to discover his superpowers and helped him to become a “Moon Knight.”

What to expect from the series?

There is a lot of expectation from this series because if someone read the comics based on Moon Knight, then Marc will have multiple personality disorder where one day he will be Mr. Knight with the suit who will be cool as ice, some other day he will act as Steven Grant who is a wall street wizard and he can be Jake Lockley, a streetwise cab driver who is looking for the criminals in the society he is living in. So, if Marvel pulls off all the personalities with a good interconnected storyline then Moon Knight will be a blockbuster.

Moon Knight will be six-episodes long series that will be streaming on Disney+ Hotstar from 30th March 2022.
