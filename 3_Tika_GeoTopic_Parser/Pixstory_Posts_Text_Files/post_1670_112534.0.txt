It's like you are living under a rock, if you haven’t slurped India’s favorite ‘comfort food’ to beat midnight hunger pangs or if you haven’t fought with your siblings for a bigger share!

For most of us, Maggi outgrew the product identity to represent the rush of nostalgia, the dash of joy & playfulness, so much so that, “What Google is to Search Engines, Maggi is to instant noodles.”

So how did Maggi noodles capture a nation’s (and mind you a nation of 1.3 billion people!) collective imagination? More importantly, how did it change traditional eating behavior in a “rice and wheat” obsessed nation?

In the year 1983, Maggi set its foot in India, positioned as a convenience product for working class women. Till then, the Indian middle class was oblivious to the concept of instant noodles, let alone consideration & trial. The product, definitely had a first mover advantage in the category, but not so much in consumer’s minds. The initial sales figures were forgettable, to say the least.

However, Nestle, not yet ready to give up on the product, decided to decode a real consumer insight. Usually kids coming from school in evening, complained of hunger. Homemade snacks took long to prepare while other options such as potato chips, biscuits were considered unhealthy. Maggi finally had its Eureka moment! It retargeted kids, adolescents and college going students who craved for delicious, easy to prepare in between meals.

After a successful repositioning strategy, Maggi developed a robust brand culture, representing the contemporary Indian spirit, through external and internal cues.
