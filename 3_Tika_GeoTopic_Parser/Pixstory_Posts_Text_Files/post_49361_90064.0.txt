On many occasions, Kim Taehyung has stated that he is left-handed, and other members of BTS have stated the same thing. He does, however, utilise his right hand for a variety of tasks, including signing autographs, indicating that he is ambidextrous.

When you use both your left and right hands equally for activities and both are regarded as your dominant hand, you are said to be ambidextrous. So, how did V become ambidextrous when he was born left-handed?

He would have had to teach his right hand to be equally dominating as his left. This form of instruction isn't very prevalent these days, but it isn't unheard of.

For centuries, it was fairly common for left-handed people to be compelled to write with their right hand. This is because the devil was identified with the left hand, and it was regarded to be devilish to use it dominantly.

Taeyhung revealed that he is left-handed on Twitter via the BTS account. Members have also mentioned that he is left-handed on a few occasions. During an occasion, members of the group were quick to bring out V's left-handedness when they were playing Badminton.

V stated that he is left-handed in another appearance while holding a teapot. So it's no surprise that the world's most popular K-Pop artist was born left-handed. But considering he uses his right hands to do a lot of things like writing and eating makes him a master at using both his hands!
