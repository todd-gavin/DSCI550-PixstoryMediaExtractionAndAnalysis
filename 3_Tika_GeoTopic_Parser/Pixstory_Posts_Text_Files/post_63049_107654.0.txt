NASA's Mars Perseverance rover acquired a new image using its Right Mastcam-Z camera. In the image, a rock resembling a snake head can be seen. The image also shows a round rock that appears to be balancing on a larger rock. Perseverance is currently exploring a river delta region in the Jezero Crater.
