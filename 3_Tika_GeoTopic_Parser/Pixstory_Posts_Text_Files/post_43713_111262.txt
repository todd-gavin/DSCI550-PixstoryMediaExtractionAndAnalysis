Not many people realize that Doctor s Day in India is observed in honor of one of the greatest of our community Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy Dr B C Roy as he is widely known was multi faceted a physician educationist philanthropist freedom fighter and statesman He was Chief Minister of his home state West Bengal for a period of years A rare accomplishment of being both a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Member of the Royal College of Physicians Dr Roy was awarded our highest civilian honor the Bharat Ratna As can be expected there are many lessons to be learned for all of us from such an illustrious life that began on July and ended on July The motto that he lived by Whatever thy hands findeth to do do it with thy might is simple but profound How easy it is to give up and how often we do it whether it is walking the extra step to take care of a patient or to save a life or to find a new way that will work better Perseverance was the hallmark of his life He applied times for admission to study further at the St Bartholomew s Hospital in Britain because the Dean kept rejecting him on grounds of his being an Asian till he was let in subsequently passing with honours A firm believer in service be it to the ailing to the country as a freedom fighter or to his state at a time torn by communal violence famines unemployment and large inflow of refugees he made no distinction between who and what needed his time and efforts and served till his last breath Today when both the country and our countrymen are ailing I urge you to look at broader horizons to the path set out by the greats I urge you to rise above petty political landscapes and mere personal gain Turn firmly to science and service to help one another that to my mind would be the greatest tribute by a doctor to a doctor
