The National side has decided to part its ways with the French coach two years after his induction into the team. The decision came in after Beaumelle decided to resign from his position after his contract ended last week and didn’t get renewed. 


The Ivorian Football Federation (IFI) which is ran by a Normalisation committee confirmed that they were not interested in renewing Beaumelle’s contract.


In the statement released by the IFI they said, “The committee salutes [Beaumelle’s] human qualities, commitment, professionalism, humility and discretion, While welcoming the open-mindedness of the French technician and the good collaboration with the FIF, the committee wishes him a happy continuation of his career.”


Under the leadership of Beaumelle the Elephants failed to qualify for the Football World Cup in Qatar and had a forgettable season at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. These were the things that might have played a role in triggering his resignation.


Also, the decision came two days after former Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba joined the race of becoming the president of the IFI. The Chelsea legend is all set to inject new life into Ivorian football after getting elected. He said, “Finally here we are! I can't wait for the campaign to start. Trust me to give life to Ivorian football if I am elected”
