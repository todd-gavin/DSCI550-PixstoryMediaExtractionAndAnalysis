Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United has won the Player of the Month title at Old Trafford for the second time. Following another magnificent goalscoring game, the 37-year-old iconic forward has been named United's April Player of the Month.

Ronaldo has already won four prizes in United's current marketing campaign, and he expressed 
his delight on Instagram, saying:

“Thanks to all the supporters who voted for me and to all my teammates who helped me 
achieve this award once again.”

“I’m always proud to represent this amazing club and it’s very gratifying to be acknowledged by the Man. United community.”

Despite his team's struggles, the Portuguese star enjoyed a successful month. On April 16, the talismanic forward scored a stunning hat-trick against Norwich City, keeping Manchester United's slim hopes of a high-4 finish alive.

On April 23, he scored in the Red Devils' 2-0 loss at Arsenal. His incredible strike would only 
provide solace as his team lost 3-1 on the day.

On April 28, Cristiano Ronaldo scored an 
excellent equaliser against Chelsea, taking the ball in his stride and smashing it past Edouard 
Mendy.

These incredible exploits were accomplished during a difficult period for the legendary forward, who was forced to leave the pitch due to the death of his son. It speaks something about the veteran striker's character that he is still able to exert influence in the midst of such personal turmoil.

The former Real Madrid striker, who is currently third in the Premier League scoring lists, will be looking to end the season on a high note. His 18 goals in 29 Premier League appearances are only surpassed by Mohamed Salah (22) and Son Heung Min (21).
