South Asian kulfi, frequently referred to as "Indian ice cream," is a popular frozen dish. Along with the Middle East, it is well-liked in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, and India. It is offered in Indian eateries all over the world. 

The dessert most likely developed in the 16th century in northern India, which was then a part of the Mughal Empire. The Mughals modified traditional desserts by mixing condensed milk with pistachios and saffron, packing it into metal cones, and freezing it with an ice-salt slurry. The Himalayan dessert was subsequently brought to the empire's drier regions, giving rise to kulfi. The Persian word for a covered cup is where the name "kulfi" originates

In appearance, kulfi resembles ice cream, but it is creamier and denser. It comes in a variety of flavours, but the most well-known and traditional ones include pistachio, vanilla, mango, rose, cardamom, and saffron. It is most similar to frozen custard sweets in North America. Although it is frequently served on a stick, it can also be consumed from a dish, leaf, or cup.
