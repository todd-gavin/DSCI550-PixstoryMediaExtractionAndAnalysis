This "Speck of the Universe" is the first scientific image from NASA 's Webb telescope – the deepest astronomical picture of the distant Universe.

This first image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date. Known as Webb’s First Deep Field, this image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail. Thousands of galaxies – including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared – have appeared in Webb’s view for the first time. This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm’s length by someone on the ground. 

Today was just the first one. Tomorrow, we will have a lot more.
Welcome to a new era in Astronomy. Everything you see here is a galaxy. We are seeing farther away than 13 billion years in the past...And so much more to come!
