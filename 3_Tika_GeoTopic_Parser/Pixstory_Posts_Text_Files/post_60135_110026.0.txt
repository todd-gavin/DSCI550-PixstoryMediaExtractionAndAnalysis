The final song by late artist Sidhu Moose Wala, which was made public after his passing, has been taken down from YouTube. The Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal is referenced in the song SYL, which was released earlier this week. The song was created by Sidhu and was recorded a few weeks before his passing.

On June 23, the music video's creator, MXRCI, published it. However, when you click the video's link, you see a warning that says, "Unavailable video Due to a legal complaint from the government, this content is not accessible on this nation's domain." Since its release, Sidhu's song on YouTube has received over 27 million views and 3.3 million likes.  

The Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal, which has long been a point of contention between Punjab and Haryana, is discussed in the song, which is focused on the water crisis in Punjab. The song mentions the 1984 anti-Sikh Riots, undivided Punjab, and its videos display the Sikh flag being raised at the Red Fort during the farmer movement.
