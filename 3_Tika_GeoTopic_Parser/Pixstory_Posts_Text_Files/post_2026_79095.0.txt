Democratic Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio Cortez recently stated that Meta, formerly known as Facebook, should be broken up under federal anti-trust law. This comes in the wake of numerous scandals by Meta, which show their immense market power and power over what Americans see.

It's easy to see why politicians would want Meta to be split up; its applications - Instagram, Facebook, and Whatsapp â€“ have billions of users and are widely regarded as the primary means of social networking in both the United States and the rest of the world. For example, even Twitter cannot compete with Facebook's domination in the social media, marketing, messaging, news, and other industries.

What are your thoughts? Should Meta be broken up?
