Liverpool have lost their academy's finest product, Harry Wilson has decided the move on,
the club confirmed on Monday. His move to newly-promoted Fulham has been made
promoted.

The talented Welshman gained praise over in the championship, performing in a
number of positions across the front line and in midfield.

Having scored 11 times and
assisted 18 times in 41 championship appearances, the 25 year-old enters a stage of his
career where he seeks stability.

"I know now that I will be at a club that I will be at for the next few years after a permanent move,that was what I wanted. I wanted somewhere to settle down off the pitch so I can enjoy
it on the pitch."

Wilson claims his patience grew thin, after six consecutive loan spells.

"My first season here has been great, the club has been great with me, I settled in well with
my teammates and set me up for a fantastic year. I have managed to get double figures for
goals and assists, topping it off tonight by getting into the team of the year. This year has
been my most enjoyable season. I have that stability now and have a great year behind me."
Wilson told GOAL.

Marco Silva's team exercised their option to buy for a Â£12 Million deal. This deal gives
Liverpool a 15% sell on clause, which implies that the Anfield club will recieve a part of
Wilson's transfer fee if he is to move on.

"I feel like I am not so young anymore," he added. "When you are younger, loans are great,
they give you experience. My first couple really helped me but you get to a point where you
want to settle down."

By the looks of it though, he isn't going anywhere anytime soon.
