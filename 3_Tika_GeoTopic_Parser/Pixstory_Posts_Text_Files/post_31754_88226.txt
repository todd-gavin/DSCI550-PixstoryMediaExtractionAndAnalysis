Furthermore, we would like to understand what happens to the other bonus, the one for large families with more dependent children, if it still remains at one thousand euros. we ask that the bonuses be made in stages so as to have a graduality according to the composition of the family nucleus given that 1,000 euros may be enough for a single person but certainly not for a couple with two children who, with an Isee a thousand, remain below the poverty line absolute, says Massimiliano Dona, president of the National Consumers Union As for fuel, the cent cut is not even enough to return to pre-war values. If we also count VAT, prices would drop by about one hundred cents. If we consider the official data from the Mite according to which petrol in self-service mode it is sold on average for euros per liter and diesel is sold for euros per liter fuel would drop below the euro threshold but would not even return to pre-conflict levels Gasoline in fact, with the reduction in excise duties, would reach euros when it was in the detection of the i.e. the first following the outbreak of the war in February while diesel would even amount to euros when it was euros concludes Dona
