Chelsea Clinton, a writer, health advocate, and daughter of a former US President has said that An equal playing field must be created for women in politics.

Chelsea Clinton also highlighted the importance of “centering women and girls in story-telling”, such as with the hit TV series Derry Girls, in which she had a walk-on part.
She expressed her frustration in overturning roe v/s wade by us supreme court. She also stated that she had no intention of following in the footsteps of both her parents.

“Although I want that question to be asked of everyone whose last name isn’t Clinton because I think the more people who think, ‘oh, I could run for office, I do want to affect change in my community, the better we all will be.”

Ms. Clinton said data from across the world indicates it is much harder for women to run for office and be elected.

“It’s often harder for women to raise money, which in the United States is an important part of the process although it should not be, harder for them to have equal political coverage from journalists often just because of the space that is consumed by describing what a woman is wearing,” she said.

“We know that not only our norms need to shift on the more obvious points around eliminating misogyny and the language of misogyny but also there are other ways that women are penalized that are not as visible but equally need remedied if we’re truly going to have an equal playing field.”
