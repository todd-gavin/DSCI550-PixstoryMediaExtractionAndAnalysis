Eknath Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra, declared that development and Hindutva are top priorities for the new government as the Shiv-Sena-BJP coalition passed the floor test with a majority of 164 votes in the 288-member House.

Speaking in the Assembly, Shinde sobbed as he recalled the days following the 2019 state elections and expressed his dismay at the way he had been treated.

Shinde claimed that while the dissident MLAs were camped out in Guwahati, the Sena faction, led by Uddhav Thackeray, stormed his home, used abusive language at them, and compared them to animals, insulted me and threw stones at my house while on the one hand sending people to meet with me and have a dialogue (after the revolution). They mistreated us, dubbed us "living corpses," and compared us to animals, Shinde claims.
