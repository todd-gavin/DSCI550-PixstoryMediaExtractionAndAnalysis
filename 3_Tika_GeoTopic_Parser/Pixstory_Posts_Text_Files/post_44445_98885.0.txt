The Serie A side will reward the supporters who braved an infamous reverse earlier in this campaign.

Roma will repay the faith of 166 fans who witnessed their 6-1 defeat to Bodo last October by taking them to the Conference League final against Feyenoord later this month in Tirana.

Jose Mourinho's side saw off Leicester City in the semi-finals to book their spot and fully 
exorcise the demons of a dramatic defeat in Norway this season.

No, the club will restore the faith who made their journey up to the north will be present 
for their shot at silverware.

What will Roma do for its supporters?

It was in October last year that a clutch of Roma fans made their long journey across Europe expecting to see the Serie A side deliver a close content at the very least in Norway, only to leave humbled from their Europa League encounter.

But having gained revenge in the UECL, quarter-finals last month the Italian outfit will 
reward their commitment now by taking them to Albania on their dime.

With limited availability, the club’s allocation will be open to a lottery for season ticket holders.

Is AS Roma in line to make it to Europe next season?

The UECL carries extra weight for Mourinho as his side remains still at risk of missing out on a European finish entirely in Seris A.

Though they are too far off the mark of the Champions League race, they occupy fifth 
heading into this weekend’s fixture, enough for a Europa League spot.

But with Lazio, Fiorentina and Atalanta breathing under their neck, they could well miss out clearly on the domestic front. Meaning that only the UECL victory could be their only 
path to a UEFA Europa League entry.
