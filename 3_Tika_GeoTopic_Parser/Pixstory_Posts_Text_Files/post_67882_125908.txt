Pawan Kumar Sherawat became the most expensive player in the history of Pro Kabaddi League when Tamil Thailavas spent more than crores on him to acquire his services for season It was no surprise that the high flyer got such a huge sum of money considering he has scored the highest raid points in the last seasons of the tournament He scored and raid points in season and respectively He burst onto the scene in season when Bengaluru Bulls unleashed him and in the very first when he got to play the full season he helped his side lift the trophy But before Pawan took the PKL by storm Dubki King Pardeep Narwal had already made a name for himself in the hearts of Kabaddi fans He played a pivotal role in Patna Pirates winning back to back titles in season and He scored the most raid points in season But since season he has fallen behind Pawan In season he scored raid points in season he managed raid points while in the last season for UP Yoddha he scored raid points In the upcoming season both these players will compete once again to top the raiding charts While Pardeep will continue to play for Yoddha Pawan will ply his trade for Tamil Thailavas If we look at the two teams Pawan will have to do the bulk of the raiding for his team which means he will have more opportunities to score raid points There is Ajinkya Pawar in the side as a support raider but he might play the role Bharat played for the Bulls in the last season Pawan might also lead the side which means that there would be extra pressure on him But he is not adverse to leading a team as he led the Bulls in the last season His raid points in the last seasons also reflect that he thrives under pressure
