Abstract 

Aims 

To investigate the prevalence of diabetes-related chronic complications (DRCCs) and its associated factors in Brazilian adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 

Methods 

This nationwide study was conducted in 14 public clinics in 10 cities, with 1,760 patients, 367 adolescents, with 328 eligible for this study. Evaluated DRCCs were retinopathy (DR), chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). 

Results 

Among eligible patients, 184 were females (50.1%), age range 13–19 years, HbA1c 9.6% ± 2.4, aged 8.9 ± 4.3 years at diagnosis and diabetes duration of 8.1 ± 4.3 years. 103 (31.4%) patients presented any type of DRCC. CKD was found in 46 (14.0%), CAN in 41(12.5%), DR in 28 (8.5%) and DPN in 16 (4.9%) patients. One, two or three DRCCs were observed in 79 (24.1%), 19 (5.8%) and 5 (1.5%) patients, respectively, and were associated with longer diabetes duration, higher HbA1c and diastolic blood pressure levels (dBP), use of renin angiotensin inhibitors and lower adherence to diet. 

Conclusions 

A high percentage of patients presented some kind of DRCC, associated with diabetes duration, glycemic control, dBP, adherence to diet. Educational programs should start from the diagnosis to avoid DRCCs in this young population.
