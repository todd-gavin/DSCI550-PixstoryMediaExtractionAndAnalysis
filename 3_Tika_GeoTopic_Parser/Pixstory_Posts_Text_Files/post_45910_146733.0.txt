During Queen Elizabeth II funeral, the entire world came together. International mourners came to the UK to pay their respects to Britain's longest-reigning queen. All five of the former presidents who are still alive were invited, but Donald and Melania Trump did not go. That didn't stop Melania from posting in the queen's honour, and it undoubtedly generated conversation. On the day of the funeral, Melania took to Twitter, attaching four photos of herself and Donald with the queen. "RIP Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II," Melania wrote. " We are grateful for your strength, grace, and dedication for over seven decades. I will always treasure the time we spent together.”However, Twitter had a lot to say in response to the post. One user shared what Barack Obama and Michelle Obama wrote — a beautiful and lengthy tribute to the queen — and said, "Notice the Obama's recognition is all about the Queen and Melania's is her." Another chimed in, "I appreciate the sentiment, but you know she hated you and Don right? Like no really, you know that, right?"Source: thelist What do you think about her tribute?
