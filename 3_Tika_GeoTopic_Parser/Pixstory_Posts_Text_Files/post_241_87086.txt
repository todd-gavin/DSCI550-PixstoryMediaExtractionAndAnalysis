There s another round of transphobic tweets gatekeeping womanhood by J K Rowling but I ll let Twitter keep space for those nitty gritty s I m just here to add more structure to an ongoing conversation in my head that regained some form as I scrolled through the boringly inaccurate attempts to redefine transness and the stale commentary by folks threatened by our power in being who we are Proceed with caution through my stream of consciousness that may gender f k with some cisters While I used to perceive my relationship with femininity as a wound that I couldn t dress I now find it healing in anticipation of me getting closer to being my full self as a gender non conforming trans person It took me a while to understand that there s a difference between not being in alignment with who I am and in the discomfort of internalized patriarchal constructs that masquerade as femininity and how the perceived femininity that is often imposed on us is used to forgive toxic traits of masculinity Those who still believe in derived concepts of boys will be boys seem dismiss how the projection of gender constructed hurt is not restricted to cisgender men It is practiced internalized and perpetuated by all genders Boys will be who you re telling them to become they will hurt and will get hurt in attempts to dominate through unattainable standards of so called strength and power that are used to measure their worth The gender essentialism used by folks like Rowling to demonize forgive idolize personality traits reduces people to their anatomy and dismisses possible accountability for actions What is the cost of centering self determination What is the cost of ending the use of gender as a pre determinant of personality traits I m still grappling to understand parts of dysphoria that aren t always clear by attempting to unlearn the practice of labeling my traits as feminine My femininity is not synonymous with dysphoria and my comfort in masculinity isn t necessarily euphoria it s a comfort in being who I am a point that gender essentialists misuse while attacking trans folks
