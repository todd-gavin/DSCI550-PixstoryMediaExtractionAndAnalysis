In the Ramban area of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, flash floods brought on by heavy rain claimed the lives of two people. 

According to officials, a rapid flood brought on by constant rain drowned away two people, Shamina and her daughter Rozia. 

In the past 24 hours, there has been a lot of rain in the Jammu division, which has caused most rivers, seasonal streams, and other water bodies to swell. 

Jammu saw 189 mm of rain fall in the past 24 hours, the most in the previous 26 years. 

In numerous locations throughout the Jammu division, flooding-like conditions have been caused by mudslides, landslides, and earth caving in the sloppy areas.
