Eid is tomorrow and it is a culture of Old Delhi to wander in the markets on the last night of Ramzan. 

Tonight, if you take a walk in the streets of the walled city, you'll be smelling the aroma of Eid's special Kachori everywhere. These special, delicious kachori filled with daal or in some fabulous places with keema are the first bite at every eid. Halwaais have extended their shops to the roads with a show of sweets & kachoris.

Women are sitting at every corner getting Mehendi drawn on their hands, as it is a sort of a ritual for women at festivals.

Markets are filled with shoppers, ethnic to western to chappals to sneakers, everything will be bought tonight.

People of old Delhi had 30 days to prepare for Eid but it is in our blood, to leave at least one chore remaining for the last night. To be honest, I am among those too as I'll be shopping for some sandals at 2 or 3 in the morning.
