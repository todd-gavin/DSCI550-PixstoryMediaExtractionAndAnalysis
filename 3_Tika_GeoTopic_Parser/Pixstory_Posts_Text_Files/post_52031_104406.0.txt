Jennifer Lopez has taken to Instagram to flaunt her ageless figure in a black string bikini.

The 52-year-old actor and singer marked America’s Memorial Day weekend with a series of photos on the platform, accessorising the swimsuit with a butterfly-print cover up, beige mules, gold jewellery, and a pair of oversized Versace sunglasses.

“Summer mode: activated,” she captioned the post.

Lopez is known for maintaining a clean lifestyle to keep her body in its enviable shape, with her trainer David Kirsh telling Vogue last November that the star is “meticulous about her eating, sleeping, and generally about everything in her life”.

“It’s not just a physical thing – it’s about transforming everything,” he added.

Kirsch said that the mum-of-two – who shares twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband, Marc Anthony – is “very focused and high energy” when it comes to working out.

“We mix some cardio, plyometrics, full body, core and lower body into her workouts – they are very, very intense and she takes it very seriously, which is exciting for someone like me,” he said.

“You say, ‘we’re going to do this’, and she’s like ‘great!’. Her workouts are fast paced. She’s very focused and high energy.”

In a recent newsletter – the same one where she announced her engagement to Ben Affleck – Lopez revealed that the secret to her mental and physical wellbeing is getting seven to nine hours of sleep each night.

“There was a time in my life where I used to sleep three to five hours a night,” she wrote.

“I was in my late 20s and I thought I was invincible.”

But when she had a panic attack due to her lack of sleep, “the physical symptoms I was having started to scare me, and the fear compounded itself”.

Now, she thinks “of sleep like a little time machine”.

“You lay down and you go into a space where you preserve yourself, and then you come out a new, younger person than you were before,” Lopez said.
