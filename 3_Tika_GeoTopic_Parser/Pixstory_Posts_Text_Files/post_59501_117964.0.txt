A letter written by Khatik was sent to union home minister Amit Shah and governor Anandiben Patel on July 19, offering to resign from his post, had surfaced on social media on Wednesday. In the letter, Khatik had cited corruption is his department and the behaviour of bureaucrats in the ministry as the reasons for his move.
With Thursday’s move, unease among three ministers of the Adityanath government, allegedly over transfers in their departments, appears to have subsided for now.
“I have put up my issues before the chief minister and action will be taken on them,” said Khatik after meeting the CM on Thursday evening. On whether action will be taken against the officers he had mentioned in his letter, he said: “I have put up the issues before the CM.”
