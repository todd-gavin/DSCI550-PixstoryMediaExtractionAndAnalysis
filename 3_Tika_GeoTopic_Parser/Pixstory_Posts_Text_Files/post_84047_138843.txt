When I looked around All I could see was smoke we were in a prettier world Everything appeared blur Will you like to dance he asked The second I saw in his eyes I forgot all pain all tension inside Brown hairs Brown eyes Seemed to be a prince who came from another world far away from mine Dressed in all black he smiled Within a second I found our hands intertwined The music was singing it s own song A song of victory A song of love My body followed his Every step taught me how to breathe My hands on his neck and he closed his eyes as if waiting for this second from the beginning of time Forgetting every bit Our body tuned and we danced for ever Those who waited for centuries were together The air flying in contentment Was accompanied by the sky The clouds gathered together to sprinkle the blessings on the Lovers of all time Suddenly I opened my eyes and lost him again forever until he returns from his land To find her who is caged in Pain Agony Wounds and Tears Kaushiki Singh
