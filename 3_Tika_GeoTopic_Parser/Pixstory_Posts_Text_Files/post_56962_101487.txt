All of us would want to be involved in a relationship that stays for long and forever But with passing time understanding this idea varies and depends on how people comprehend it For many it is not always a perpetual bond that is meant to stay they change their priorities and opinions depending on the situation Unlike old times couples don t try to adjust or compromise their love accepting or condoning even if the other partner has wronged them However there s no harm in doing this instead this is the right thing to be done in a relationship that seems abusive to a partner or if the partner is unfaithful Well howsoever fathomable it seems to someone it is always easier said than done splitting with your partner comes with many downfalls and ending a marriage would be the hardest thing for a couple Dream of unconditional love a warm home and financial security that is how every couple creates a picture of their marriage and ending it would mean putting a stop to everything In most cases problems occur for the couples who don t have a prenuptial agreement that would divide the assets such as money and property between both the partners It rises into an acrimonious situation when any partner leaves and the other one would have to suffer alone In most cases it is seen that women are not secure when their marriage dissolves According to the National Women s Law Center more than one in three families headed by unmarried mothers lived in poverty in As most women tend to sacrifice their careers to take care of the home they are financially dependent on their partners During the divorce they get nothing but rather are abandoned by their partners financially and emotionally So a prenuptial agreement should be a priority for couples specifically women
