Pawan Kumar Sherawat became the most expensive player in the history of Pro Kabaddi 
League when Tamil Thailavas' spent more than 2 crores on him to acquire his services for 
season 9. It was no surprise that the 'high-flyer' got such a huge sum of money considering he 
has scored the highest raid-points in the last 3 seasons of the tournament.

He scored 271, 346 and 306 raid points in season 6,7 and 8 respectively. He burst onto the scene in season 6 when Bengaluru Bulls unleashed him and in the very first, when he got to play the full season he helped his side lift the trophy.

But before Pawan took the PKL by storm, 'Dubki King' Pardeep Narwal had already made a name for himself in the hearts of Kabaddi fans. He played a pivotal role in Patna Pirates winning 3 back-to-back titles in season 3, 4 and 5. He scored the most raid points in season 5. But since season 6 he has fallen behind Pawan. In season 6, he scored 233 raid points, in season 7 he managed 302 raid points while in the last season for UP Yoddha he scored 188 raid points.

In the upcoming season, both these players will compete once again to top the raiding charts. While Pardeep will continue to play for Yoddha, Pawan will ply his trade for Tamil Thailavas.

If we look at the two teams, Pawan will have to do the bulk of the raiding for his team which 
means he will have more opportunities to score raid points. There is Ajinkya Pawar in the side 
as a support raider but he might play the role Bharat played for the Bulls in the last season. 
Pawan might also lead the side which means that there would be extra pressure on him. But he is not adverse to leading a team as he led the Bulls in the last season. His raid points in the last 3 seasons also reflect that he thrives under pressure.
