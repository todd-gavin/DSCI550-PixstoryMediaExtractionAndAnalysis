Constitutional Adviser to Bikaner continues....

As events later shaped themselves and the States were finally merged with India, my work on the Constitution suggesting certain changes in Statesâ€™ relationship with India became infructuous and of no practical use. 

Apart from the question of studying the Constitution, I was often asked for my advice on the question of powers to be exercised by the popular ministers of the interim Government and those appointed by His Highness. Some of these ministers were very interesting people. One had been a sub-inspector of police, another was a school teacher. All of them, of course, belonged to the Praja Mandal party. They were friendly to me and I always gave them correct advice according to my judgment whenever they sought it. 

The Prime Minister, Kanwar Jaswant Singh, appointed by His Highness was an amaiable person who often discussed with me his many problems of administration. Most of our time was spent in negotiating with the leaders of the Praja Mandal party about the final shape of the future Government of Bikaner: to what extent the Maharaja should surrender his powers to the popular government, how elections were to be conducted and from what constituenies, whether any weightage was to be given to jagirdars and landlords and whether the franchise was to be direct or indirect. 

Mr. Jai Narain Vyas and Mr. Gokal Bhai Bhatt, the topmost political leaders of Rajasthan, often met us during these negotiations which continued for about three months and finally ended when the State merged with India.
