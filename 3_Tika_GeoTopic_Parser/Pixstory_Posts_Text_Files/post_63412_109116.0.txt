Brazil has been involved in United Nations-mandated peacekeeping efforts since 1956, participating in 46 of 65 peacekeeping operations and deploying 11,669 personnel in total. Brazil’s involvement has changed over the years, from a mainly symbolic participation to an active player in the international peace and security agenda. As Brazil has become more of a leader in this arena, the country’s approach toward the women, peace and security agenda has garnered attention.

          President Sula mandated the establishment of a national defence strategy. Over the years, the Brazilian Armed Forces have been changing in character and structure, but it was not until 1999 that the MOD was created with a civilian Cabinet Minister in charge of all three branches of the Armed Forces: the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. The MOD, however, was staffed by “an agglomeration of foreigners,” meaning that the Ministry was staffed by technicians and professionals from Petro Bras, the Bank of Brazil, and various other government agencies. The MOD will now be staffed by its own professional Defence bureaucracy.
             Located in a peaceful and economically integrated region, Brazil has not had any direct participation in armed conflicts since World War II. As such, the country is internationally regarded as a neutral actor, with the credentials to fulfil so many mandates at the UNSC. Brazil works, including through the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic, for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of economic prosperity in its strategic surroundings, which, according to the National Defence Policy (2012) includes South America, the South Atlantic, African countries bordering the South Atlantic and Antarctica.
