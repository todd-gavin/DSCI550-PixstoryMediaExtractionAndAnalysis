Pogba&#39;s return to Juventus got off to a bad start The knee pain felt during one of the Bianconeri&#39;s last training sessions is actually not a trivial matter The radiological tests have shown a tear of the lateral meniscus of the right knee A specialist consultation will be needed to understand if it will be surgery needed A very important shortcoming for Juve that if Pogba doesn&#39;t need to be put under the knife they will be able to have him back on the pitch in a few weeks, not before the start of the championship scheduled for August If instead an operation were needed, the times they would expand and Pogba would not return before the end of September and the beginning of October, skipping matches between the league and the Champions League. In addition to two matches in the first European competition, the French midfielder would be absent in the big match against Roma on August
