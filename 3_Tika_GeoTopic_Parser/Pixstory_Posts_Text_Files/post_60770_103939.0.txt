Here are ten tips that any presenter can use while learning how to make a boring presentation interesting.

1. Less slide content, more speaking points 
2. Use animation for effect 
3. Make most of you screen real estate  (means Display screens are made in a variety of sizes and aspect ratios, the proportion of width to height. When a presentation doesn't fill the screen, it's due to a mismatch between the presentation file and screen. It's sure to annoy the detail-oriented in your audience)
4. Invest the majority of time in writing good content 
5. Energize the audience 
6. Leave presentation design to professionals
7. Collaborate with others
8. Match the design to the topic 
9. Share follow up information after the presentation 
10. Be authentic, be you

Presentations aren't everyone's cup of tea. But you need to build skills as a presenter to excel in business or your career. It's okay if you're never passionate about public speaking; the goal is to level up your skills.
