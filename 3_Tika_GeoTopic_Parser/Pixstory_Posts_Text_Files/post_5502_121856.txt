The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Idaho in reaction to its law that criminalizes doctors who perform abortions and prohibits all abortions except those resulting from incest rape or ones that will cause the death of the mother The Department of Justice argues that it violates federal law because although there is an exemption for preventing a woman s death during pregnancy there is no exception for circumstances in which an abortion is required to avoid to substantial bodily harm to the woman The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor act is the law allegedly being violated according to the Department of Justice This law mandates that doctors offer stabilizing care to patients At a press conference Attorney General Merrick Garland said When a hospital determines that an abortion is the medical treatment necessary to stabilize a patient s emergency medical condition it is required by federal law to provide that treatment This decision signals the beginning of a torrent of federal litigation against states that will likely follow the implementation of new abortion prohibition laws Evidently the Biden administration is seeking to utilize its vast resources to pursue states in court to overturn abortion legislation at every step and usurp the authority of these states to choose their own abortion laws
