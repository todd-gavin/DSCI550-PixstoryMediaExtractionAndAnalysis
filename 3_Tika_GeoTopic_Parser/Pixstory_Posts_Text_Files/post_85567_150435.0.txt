I went to parlour for the first time in order to cut my long hair.💇‍♀️ But the girl who was working there almost denied it. But my mother who stood strong to cut my hair (she thought that I was not gaining weight since my hair eats all the food I eat :-p), asked her to proceed. With pity face she had cut it.✂️ After 7 months it reached my thighs again. I was super happy. My moms’ test failed.🤩💗 Again the compliments started everywhere I go. I used to hear lots of back talking in super markets, hospitals, bus etc. ❤️‍🔥🤌🏻 I always asked for hair tips and I love to tell when they ask me with a such curious face. It makes me to feel that how I am blessed.😌😇
