 The Nuclear Reactor and the technology they possess is the effort of many people It is a very feasible method to get a large amount of energy Moreover New developments show them to be more affordable and safer and are expected to produce less waste than the current era of reactors We always have to look for stable solutions for our clean energy goals and climate change to reduce carbon emissions On large scale we are in absolute need of fossil fuels Nuclear Energy and renewable energy because this could provide a balanCe to the environment as well as to the economy Importantly prevailing nuclear power plants are a critical part of our advanced nuclear future Keeping the U S nuclear fleet in place for as long as logical helps prevent backsliding in emissions helps maintain our domestic nuclear expertise and buys us the critical time essential to develop deploy and commercialize the next generation of nuclear reactors and other zero emission technologies
