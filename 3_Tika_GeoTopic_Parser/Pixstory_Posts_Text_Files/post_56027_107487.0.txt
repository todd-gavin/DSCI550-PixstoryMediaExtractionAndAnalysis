Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has signed a pledge vowing to make the House of Commons "menopause friendly" for staff.
 
The pledge perpetrates employers to support employees undergoing menopause, by providing access to fans or flexible working.

Sir Lindsay said women ran his office and he didn't want to see them leave because of the menopause. The Commons Speaker said it should not be a "taboo subject" that was "swept under the carpet".The Menopause Workplace Pledge, undertaken by the Wellbeing of Women charity, has been signed by more than 600 organisations including the civil service.

Menopause can lead to symptoms such as hot flushes, sleeplessness, shifts in mood as well as conditions like osteoporosis. It urges employers to recognise that women going through menopause may need support and to talk openly and respectfully about the subject.

Some changes include holding menopause awareness events and enabling staff to request breathable uniforms. Speaking at an event in Parliament, the Speaker joked that when asked to sign the pledge by Carolyn Harris he "had no choice", interpreting the Labour MP as "a force to be reckoned with".

Ms Harris - who has been a long-term campaigner on the subject - said she was "choked and honoured" to see the pledge signed.

Speaking to the BBC, she said she had been "in denial" when she first entered menopause.
"I just worked, I never lived, I never went out, I never went on holiday, I just worked.

"Once I got the treatment I started enjoying life again, I don't want anyone else to miss out on anything - life is for living."
She said menopausal women working in Parliament would now know there was "a system in place to look after them... it is awesome".

This is a statement of the remarkable change that should also be reflected in other offices. Not only menopause but those having problems during periods should also be able to take leave or work in a promising environment. Let there be more changes in offices.
