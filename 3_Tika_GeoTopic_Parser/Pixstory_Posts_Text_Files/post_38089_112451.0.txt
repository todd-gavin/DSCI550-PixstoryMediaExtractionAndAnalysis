Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly asked the club to let him leave in the summer. But could this turn out to be a blessing in disguise for Manchester United as they head into the 2022/23 season? 

Manchester United had a horrific 2021/22 season, to say the least. The signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, and Raphael Varane brought a lot of positivity to the club initially. But things did not go as planned as the Red Devils finished the season trophyless!



Why could Ronaldo's departure be a positive for Manchester United?

Yes, Cristiano Ronaldo's departure could affect Manchester United's sponsorship deals. But at the same time, the Red Devils would also clear up a lot of space on the salary front! Ronaldo currently earns around Â£400,000 per week at United. Hence if he leaves, United can make a big-money signing for the long term! 

Secondly, Cristiano Ronaldo may not suit Erik Ten Hag's plans very well! The Dutch manager is known for his "hard-working" style of play where all the players need to press. Yes, Ronaldo does press! But the Portuguese star is 37 and would not be able to keep this up throughout the game. 

Cristiano Ronaldo has transitioned to more of a target man who likes to stay up front. Hence this could go against Ten Hag's tactics! 

Finally, Ronaldo just has one year remaining in his United contract. Hence, The Red Devils can't bank on him long-term! So bringing in a younger striker would make more sense at this moment for the Premier League giants.
