Mountain biking is a greatly exciting and rough sport that can be enjoyed solo or even as a group. The rugged mountain terrains, harsh desert regions and rocky alleys in many parts of India, provide some of the best trails for biking. While it hasn't yet become a widely popular adventure sport in the country, it is gaining slow yet steady attention. However, it is yet another incredibly recreational holiday activity that you can add on to the list of adventure sports to try out this summer.
