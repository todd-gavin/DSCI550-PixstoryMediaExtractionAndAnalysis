Having missed out on the Serie A title in consecutive seasons, Juventus are looking to get back to the top. For this, the Old Lady have made wholesale changes to their squad in the 2022 summer transfer window. Will the new players help improve the team? 
Players signed by Juventus: Paredes, Milik (both on loan), Filip Kostic, Gleison Bremer, Paul Pogba, Angel Di Maria, Andrea Cambiaso
Players who left Juventus: Giorgio Chiellini, Paulo Dybala, Denis Zakaria, Arthur (both on loan), De Ligt, Aaron Ramsey, etc.
Having lost out on household names in Chiellini, Dybala, and De Ligt, Juventus had to go all out in the transfer window to keep up with their fellow Italian rivals. 
The Old Lady picked up Paul Pogba and Angel Di Maria early in what were statement signings, both on a free transfer. The two former United stars would certainly add more experience and composure to the Juventus lineup.
To add to this, Paredes is another big buy to bolster the midfield. For their defence, Juventus opted for Bremer from Torino. The Brazilian center-back had an impressive 21/22 season that helped Torino finish in the top 10 in the Italian league.
Weakness: Injuries have been Juventus' Achilles heel. Most of their signings have slotted straight into the team but apart from Bremer, the other additions look more like a "temporary fix". Inexperience can cause a problem in the Juventus ranks as the season progresses.
