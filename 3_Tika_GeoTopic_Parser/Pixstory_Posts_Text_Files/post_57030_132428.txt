Coping anything is not such a tedious task only if you know how to do it Dealing with impostor syndrome can become more manageable if you share your feelings Talk to other people about how you are feeling Irrational beliefs tend to fester when they are hidden and not talked about So try talking to others and let it all out Understanding that your abilities are not wasted is essential If you have long held beliefs about your incompetence in social and performance situations make a realistic assessment of your abilities Write down your accomplishments and what you are good at then compare these with your self assessment Besides all this we should believe in taking small steps which really works We should not focus on doing things perfectly the focus should be rational and reasonable instead of delusional You know why self talk is necessary Because it lets you question yourself and develop a deep understanding between you and your mind The question is whether your thoughts are rational Does it make sense to believe that you are a fraud given everything that you know Another thing to do is stop comparing yourself with others If you ll always compare your situation with others it would fuel the feeling of incompetency eventually worsening the syndrome Most importantly don t let your constant nagging and thoughts stop you from achieving your goals Do not let your beliefs hold you back
