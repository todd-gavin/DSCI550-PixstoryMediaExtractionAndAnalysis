‏set A year after the establishment of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the children's playground has become a place of blind silence that frightens people. But I find that even the world of Afghan children has been blocked as a result of the change of the system, the place of recreation and welfare of children.‏The collapse of the republic and the re-establishment of the Taliban have brought about many changes in the lives of Afghan citizens. Changes that are negative in all directions.‏In addition to the fact that with the increase in insecurity and political instability, economic enterprises stopped operating and foreign institutions providing services left Afghanistan.There are no toys for children. This park has become a resort for a group of evil men. which are ruining, now not Afghan children but the Taliban are going to have fun in the parks.
