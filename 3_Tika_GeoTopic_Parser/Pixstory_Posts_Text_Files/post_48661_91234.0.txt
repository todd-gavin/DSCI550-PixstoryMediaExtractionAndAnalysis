The Knicks were fighting for a playoff spot in the regular season.

With the regular season running down, the Knicks visited Derrick Rose's Chicago Bulls as the squad tried to seal a playoff berth.

Carmelo Anthony, who was recently acquired, has yet to completely win over fans, but after this performance, he would have no trouble doing so.

Melo was the lone player for either team to score in the final two-and-a-half minutes of the fourth quarter in an attempt to keep the team alive. He scored five clutch points in the final 48 seconds to tie the game at 91, including a deep three over Taj Gibson to send the game to overtime.

Anthony accomplished it again in the extra session. With 1:05 left in overtime, the team was down 99-95 when Anthony sliced through the lane and scored with a difficult layup to trim the lead to two.

With around 15 seconds left on the clock, the Knicks played tight defense and controlled the ball. Anthony once again played hero, draining a three-pointer over Luol Deng from a few feet behind the arc to lead the Knicks to an incredible 100-99 victory.
