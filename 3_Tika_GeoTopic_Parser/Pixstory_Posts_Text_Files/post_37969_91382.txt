The draw for the FIFA World Cup has concluded and here is how the groups stand All the groups are very evenly matched and we don t see any specific Group of Death just yet But we predict Group C featuring Argentina Mexico Poland and Saudi Arabia could be very unpredictable Group A Group G and Group H also look very open and competitive Hence it is quite possible that every team in these groups would feel that they have a chance to qualify for the next round In a World Cup all the games are important But here is a pick of a few key games that we feel would be the best in the group stage Argentina vs Poland Argentina vs Mexico Group C Spain VS Germany Group E Belgium vs Croatia Group F Portugal vs Uruguay Group H These big matches could help determine who tops the group and who gets eliminated early in the group stage as there is no room for error in such a high profile tournament Possible qualifiers from each group Group A Netherlands Senegal Group B England Euro Playoff winner Group C Argentina Poland Group D France Denmark Group E Spain Germany Group F Belgium Croatia Group G Brazil Switzerland Group H Portugal Uruguay
