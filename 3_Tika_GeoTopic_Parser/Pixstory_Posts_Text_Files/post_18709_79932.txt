A scene like this had perhaps not yet been seen Or rather not with such an ending During the match between Turin and Udinese which saw the bianconeri win when the Buongiorno grenade was replaced he did not immediately head towards the side of the pitch as usual but he took a short walk in front of the referee to get his attention and take off his shirt An apparently meaningless gesture In reality, the 22-year-old Torino defender who was already warned would have liked to get the yellow card to miss the next match with Venezia and be there against Juventus the following week The referee did not fall for it and did not caution the player but only invited him to hurry towards the exit of the field A mockery for Bongiorno who is still at risk for the derby obviously as long as mister Juric deploys him on the field
