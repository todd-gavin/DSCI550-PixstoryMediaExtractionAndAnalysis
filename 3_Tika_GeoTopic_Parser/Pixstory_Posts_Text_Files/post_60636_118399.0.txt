My Hero Academia is now in the midst of celebrating a major anniversary for the manga, and the series has debuted a cool new poster for the series to help celebrate! Series creator Kohei Horikoshi might be gearing up to end the manga's run within the next year or so, but the franchise itself seems to be enjoying more popularity than ever. The manga release is working its way through the final war between the heroes and villains, and the anime is getting ready to come back with its highly anticipated sixth season, so it's certainly eye opening to see just how far the franchise has come.

My Hero Academia first launched in the pages of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine back in July 2014, and thus this month kicks off the eighth anniversary of the manga series. With over 35 collected volumes of the series under its belt at the time of this writing, and with many more to come as the manga continues, series creator Kohei Horikoshi celebrated the milestone with a special new poster that shows off a huge spread of the manga's heroes and villains. 
Although it seems like My Hero Academia's manga could go on forever, Horikoshi has noted to fans on a few occasions that he really is getting ready for the end. Noting in an emotional message to fans along with Volume 34 of the manga, Horikoshi stated the following, "I feel like I can finally see the goal in sight," Horikoshi began. "It's a rather strange feeling getting to this point. In the past, I would just be drawing without a single care [for the future], but now I wonder just how many more times can I draw these characters? Change is scary as you grow older. Well, I really shouldn't dwell on that! Until next volume then!"
