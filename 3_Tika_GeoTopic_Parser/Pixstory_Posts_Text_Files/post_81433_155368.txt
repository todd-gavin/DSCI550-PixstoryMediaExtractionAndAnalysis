Matchwinner Bukayo Saka said he drew on his experience in the Hale End Academy to adapt to the artificial pitch away to Bodo Glimt on Thursday Our opponents had racked up straight home wins in European competition before tonight but Saka s first half bundled goal changed all that Afterwards the forward who lined up alongside fellow academy products Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah said the pitch took a bit of getting used to Yeah it did You know it was skidding across the floor really fast and stuff like this But that s not an excuse you know a lot of us have grown up on it Myself at Hale End I played on astroturf pitches a lot So it s no excuse you know we just have to play our game and get on with it It s a very difficult place to come and we left here with three points so we have to just take it and focus on Sunday now
