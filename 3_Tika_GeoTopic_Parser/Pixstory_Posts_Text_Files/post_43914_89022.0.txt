Juventus and Paulo Dybala’s 7-year love story seems to be nearing towards its end. As per reports the Argentine recently met with club officials but couldn’t agree a new contract, which means, he is likely to become a free agent once his current contract with Juve expires in June. 

Previously, Manchester United and Tottenham have shown interest in Dybala and since the 28-year-old is only just entering his prime, he’s likely to attract a lot of suitors given then he’ll be up for grabs for zilch. 

In this article, we will take a look at five clubs Paulo Dybala could join after leaving Juventus:

1 - Tottenham Hotspur

In August 2019, Spurs nearly signed the Argntine playmaker, having agreed a deal worth reported £64.4m with Juventus, only for the Serie A club to then call off the transfer, as they couldn’t find a replacement for Dybala in time. 

With Harry Kane being linked to Manchester City, Spurs could look at Dybala as a replacement, even though the two players have a very different playing style. 

2 - Manchester United

Another Premier League side perennially linked to Paulo Dybala, the Red Devils are in all sorts of troubles. Even though they have one of the best attacks on paper in the league, the team lacks cohesiveness and creativity. 

Dybala knows a thing or two about that, and could very well help ease the burden on the likes of Bruno Fernandes as well as Paul Pogba - if the latter stays at United in the near future. 

3 - Inter Milan

Having played in Italy throughout his career, if the 28-year-old indeed does decide to prolong his stay in the Serie-A then Inter Milan would be no doubt, an attractive proposition. 

The Nerazzurri are in a transitional phase, and with Eden Dzeko heading towards the fag end of his career, Dybala would be at home at the San Siro.
