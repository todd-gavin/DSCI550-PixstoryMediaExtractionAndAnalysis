It s quite unfair that Eto o only stayed at Barcelona for four seasons despite having the best career of his life and scoring a Champions League final goal The African footballer left the club after appearing in games and scoring goals Thiery Henry Despite being past his prime Henry was able to have an impact on the game by playing on the left wing and scoring a half century of goals He was nearing the end of his career at Barcelona but that didn t stop him from scoring goals and intimidating defenders with his electrifying runs And imagine how many goals he would have scored if he had played for Barcelona in his prime He did however win the Champions League and score goals in games Luiz Suarez With two more goals Suarez would have become the second most prolific player in Barcelona history trailing only Lionel Messi It was unjust how he was treated in his final year at Barcelona the Uruguayan won the Pichichi award in a league dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and fans still doubted his ability Suarez quickly adapted to his new surroundings in Barcelona scoring goals in his first season He went on a goal scoring binge becoming the club s all time leading scorer with goals in appearances Lionel Messi He doesn t need an explanation for what he did for the club which is regarded as one of the greatest gifts to a club He was a quiet player who scored goals for fun debuting at the age of and going on to have a trophy laden career and goals What s more surprising is that his goal total exceeds that of Barcelona s second third and fourth highest scorers combined No other player in football history can achieve this milestone he was insane scoring goals in just games in the season It appeared Messi would end his career at Barcelona but financial concerns forced him to leave the club to free up some wages and the greatest player in history left his childhood club for PSG featuring in games and registering goals
