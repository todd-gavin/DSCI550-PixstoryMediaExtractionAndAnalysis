BTS s Jin is literally a Webtoon character IRL Jin isn t called Worldwide Handsome for nothing So it s not surprising that he has inspired several Webtoon characters Most famously he is the alleged inspiration behind True Beauty s male lead Suho He also has had multiple Webtoon characters explicitly modeled after him with BTS s Webtoons WE ON BE THE SHIELD SAVE ME and most recently FATES CHAKHO With the latter s release ARMYs were conflicted on whether or not the characters looked like the members Still everyone agreed he was handsome AF and many confessed to having simped over the character Hwan Now Jin is proving just how much he and Hwan really look alike On September Jin traveled from South Korea to Los Angeles California presumably to work on his solo album KSJ ARMYs were in awe of Jin s new look He showcased his fluffy auburn hair Some wondered what the new style reminded them of only to realize it was technically Jin himself Jin s new look greatly resembles his Webtoon character s design in FATES CHAKHO Some even suggested that Jin resembles the main character of yet another Webtoon Could Jin possibly bring to life Under the Oak Tree s Riftan Calypse if ever adapted for K Drama Jin s visuals are truly no joke He is so handsome he is really a Webtoon character come to life
