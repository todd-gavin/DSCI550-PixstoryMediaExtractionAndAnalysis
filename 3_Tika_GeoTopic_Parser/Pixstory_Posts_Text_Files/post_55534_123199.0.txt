As CNN says, it's Australian fish 'n' chips if it's wrapped in yesterday's news. 

You're hungry, the sun is shining, and the water is fresh. Where should I turn? You can almost always expect fresh fish served with salt and lemon and wrapped in yesterday's newspaper or other white packaging because Australia has some of the best seafood in the world.

Or you might even go for salt and pepper calamari if you like sea food. 

It is quick and easy to make: the squid or calamari is covered in salt-and-pepper batter, then deep-fried. This pub staple is often served as a snack with a side salad and dipped in sweet chilli sauce.
