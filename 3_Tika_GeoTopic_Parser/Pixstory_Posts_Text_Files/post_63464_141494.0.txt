Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is banking on Marcus Rashford to help the club win the Premier League title this season.

Ten Hag has set Rashford a 20-goal target for the season to help push Manchester City all the way in the title race.

The Dutchman has made him one of his main focuses as he bids to bring the good times back.

Rashford, 24, boasts three goals and two assists already — compared with five goals and two assists in total last season.

A source told The Sun: “The manager wants Marcus to be United’s No 1 striker and lead the line up front.

“He believes Marcus has the ability to become one of the world’s best and wants him to express himself in matches.”
