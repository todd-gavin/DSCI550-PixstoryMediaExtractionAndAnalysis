Serie A champions have reportedly earmarked Arsenal defender William Saliba as a potential alternative if they fail to sign Sven Botman from Lille this summer. 

According to Milan News, the Rossoneri are currently trying to secure a deal for Botman this summer, but have shortlisted Saliba as an alternative if they fail to do so. The defender was offered to the club back in January but a move failed to materialize. The report also states that Torino defender Gleison Bremer is also being closely watched by AC Milan. 

Saliba spent the entire 2021-22 season on loan at French club Marseille, where he went on to win Ligue 1’s Young Player Of The Season award. The Frenchman has yet to play a game for Arsenal since joining the club from Saint Etienne back in 2019. 

Last month, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was asked about Saliba’s future at the club following speculation that the Spainard did not have the defender in his plans moving forward. Arteta quickly put those doubts to rest by stating that the Frenchman will have a part to play in his side next season. 

He said, “We made the right decision. He has to come back. He has the experience necessary to be competitive with us. If he had stayed with us this year, with one Premier League match a week with Ben White and Gabriel, he wouldn’t have had half the playing time he had with Marseille, that’s for sure. For his growth and what he can do next season that wouldn’t have been good. William wasn’t with us because he wouldn’t have had the playing time to gain experience. That’s it, there’s nothing else.”

“I will be back with Arsenal.” Saliba commits future to Gunners amidst AC Milan interest.
