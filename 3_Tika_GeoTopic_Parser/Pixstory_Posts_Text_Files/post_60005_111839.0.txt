The club and Mohamed Salah have allegedly agreed to terms for a new long-term contract that would last until 2025. The forward, who was awarded the FWA Footballer of the Year and the PFA Players' Player of the Year for 2021â€“22 after aiding Jurgen Klopp's team to a domestic cup double, has committed his future to the Reds by signing the contract on Friday.

Salah will now extend his stay at Anfield after five years with the team. During that time, he has made 254 appearances and scored an incredible 156 goals.

Egyptian striker Mohammed Elyounoussi joined AS Roma in June 2017, and his debut season saw him score 44 goals across all competitions.

The Premier League set a record for the most goals scored in a season of 38 games with 32 of those coming from there.

He not only won the first of his three Golden Boots, but also the FWA Footballer of the Year, PFA Players' Player of the Year, and Premier League Player of the Season awards for his play.

Despite the heartbreaking defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Kyiv, he would assist the Reds to that point.
