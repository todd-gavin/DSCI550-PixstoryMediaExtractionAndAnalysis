Kieran Tierney


Not every signing of Unai Emery is a waste. Arsenal found the gem in Kieran Tierney and also a captain material. The player joined Arsenal from Celtic in 2019 and played a big role in winning the FA Cup finals for Arsenal. However, fitness has been a concern for the player. The Scottish international missed most of the season due to injury but was able to feature in 22 games in the Premier League for Arsenal. In 22 games, the player had three assists and a goal.
