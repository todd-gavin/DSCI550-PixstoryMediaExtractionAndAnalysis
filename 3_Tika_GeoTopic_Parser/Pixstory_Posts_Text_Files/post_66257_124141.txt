Every once in awhile and very rarely for me a book comes along that just absolutely leaves you breathless As someone who always and I do mean always knows how she feels about a book and just what to say about the characters and storyline I found Snake and Naomi s book leaving me absolutely speechless In fact I ve taken two full days since finishing it to digest and figure out what I wanted to say It s THAT good First let me say if you haven t read the other two books in this series Escaping Conviction Book or Fighting Conviction Book go read them It isn t necessary to the overall storyline but it ll help fill in gaps and give you a much better understanding of the overall story arc and the side characters Breaking Conviction is a book about choices It s a book that asks you to look inside yourself and decide when is enough enough This book forces you to look at the tough choices we have all had to make though not all of us will ever find ourselves in Naomi s shoes and to admit that we ve all made mistakes The true measure of our worth is in how we come back from those mistakes how we rectify them how we move on I enjoyed Naomi s character growth and her strength her backbone her feistiness I loved watching her strive to do the right thing by Thea and loved that no matter what her daughter came first
