By Kalim Ahmed Amidst the ongoing Russian military offensive in Ukraine a second long video clip is widely being circulated on social media as visuals of the Russian invasion of Ukraine This video has been posted on Twitter with the hashtag worldwar Journalist Dheeraj Choudhary has also tweeted the video with the same hashtag Link Computer generated video We had a close look at the video and noticed a few anomalies that hinted the video was not genuine but computer generated The planes that are visible in the video are not actually moving They seem to be in motion due to the movement of the camera and the flashing of the lights At seconds when the camera zooms onto one of the planes it is clearly visible that these are not modern fighter planes When we broke down the video into keyframes and ran one of the stills through Yandex reverse image search it led us to a post on Instagram uploaded on October This itself proves that the video is unrelated to the Ukraine crisis The comments on the video also suggest that it is computer generated As per Newschecker the original creator of the video is Boris J A who is a D animator and has uploaded several similar videos on his Instagram Boris s YouTube channel has the same video uploaded with his watermark Link Hence a computer generated video was shared as visuals from the Russia Ukraine conflict
