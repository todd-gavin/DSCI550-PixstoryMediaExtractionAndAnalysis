Bungo Stray Dogs being one of my favourite anime and Dazai being one of my favourite characters of all time, I had to make a post about it. The duality of Dazai is mind blowing, the way he's funny, handsome, and one of the strongest members there is and his methods of attempting suicide are as hilarious as he is, its is a great action and comedy packed anime which is not very long, highly recommend!! Also, I know that they aren't a couple bht Dazami Osamu and Nakahara Chuuya have great chemistry âœ¨
Here are some funny panels from the anime.
