I am a women
A woman I hit the last wire and say
See me as a person who is skinned by you
Neda I am the air I am the voice of our generation
Although I'm looser than I'm

Although my sex is stronger than ever
Do not look at the thin stems of my old tree
I have always believed that I am equal to you
If your arms are strong, I am a mother

I tear the mask and think of a solution
I fill the dark night with stars
Neda I am the air I am the voice of our generation
Although I'm looser than I'm
