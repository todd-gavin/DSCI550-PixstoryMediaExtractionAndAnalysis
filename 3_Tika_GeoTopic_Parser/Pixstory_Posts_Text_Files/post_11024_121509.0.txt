The day after journalist, fact-checker and co-founder of Alt News Mohammed Zubair was arrested, his lawyer Vrinda Grover told a Delhi magistrate’s court that the first information report (FIR) had been filed based on a complaint from an anonymous Twitter handle.


The informant’s “details are here”, the prosecutor countered.


Nevertheless, the following day, the government reportedly sent the microblogging site a notice seeking details, including IP log details (which provide analytics), registration information, connected email and device used by the informant-handle, a Twitter user with the name Hanuman Bhakt and handle balajikijaiin.  


The account appeared to be deactivated, before reappearing briefly. Weeks later, an investigation by The Wire found that the handle’s recovery email id belonged to a convenor of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, and the handle was among a network of over 700 accounts that had for over two years tried to incriminate Zubair and his Alt News co-founder Pratik Sinha by portraying them as “Hinduphobic”. 


Meanwhile, after his initial arrest on 27 June, six FIRs against Zubair emerged in Uttar Pradesh, most filed between 2021 and June 2022 but lying dormant, including three for an accurate fact-check he did in 2021 of a modified image of a mosque shown as being bombed. 


The charges in these six pertained mainly to promoting enmity, and deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings, but different police stations sought custodial interrogation for what Grover would call an “omnibus investigation”—three police stations issued 91 notices to Alt News seeking their entire records and accounts. 

Between his arrest on 27 June and release on 20 July, police accused Zubair and Alt News of receiving foreign funds, despite the site’s payment gateway operator Razorpay itself announcing that only domestic donations had been enabled.
