Hailey Bieber is an unabashed Y2K fashion fanatic. The Miu Miu campaign star frequently incorporates vintage jewels into her relaxed uniform in a way that feels both modern and effortless.

Meanwhile, Hailey's beauty looks frequently include hairstyles from the 2000s that wouldn't look out of place on Lizzie McGuire. Her fashion choices – think micro underarm bags and low-slung jeans – are reminiscent of Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie's kitschy aesthetic back in the day. Even when she's wearing a simple T-shirt and jeans, she can't help but choose a pair of jeans that are too big for her.

This week, while accompanying her husband Justin Bieber on his Justice tour, the 25-year-old took her love of retro style to new heights. The model was photographed walking alongside Justin, looking as if she had just returned from the 1990s.
