Even though US Vice President Kamala Harris called the US resolve to defending NATO members "ironclad" on Friday, it was clear during her visit to this country on the alliance's eastern border that fresh troop deployments and air defence systems aren't enough to ease anxieties. 

Harris was asked by a Romanian journalist what the chances are that the battle between Russia and Ukraine will spread to Romania, a former Soviet satellite state that has been attacked by Russia several times throughout its history. 

"I can't predict on what Putin's future behaviour could be," Harris remarked.

It was as plain an evidence as any that the endgame of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion remains a mystery, leaving countries like Romania waiting to see what he'll do next. The harsh sanctions imposed by the West, including new economic measures announced on Friday, are unlikely to sway his mind, according to American officials. 

Following a week of stuttering meetings between Russian and Ukrainian authorities, Harris expressed scepticism about further diplomatic attempts.

â€œFrom the beginning, the United States has been attempting sincerely to engage in diplomacy," she said. "From everything that we know and have witnessed, Putin shows no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy."

CNN reported that she acknowledged the pain tough economic sanctions might mean for Americans, though couldn't say when the burden would be lifted.

"There is a price to pay for democracy," she said. "Got to stand with your friends."
