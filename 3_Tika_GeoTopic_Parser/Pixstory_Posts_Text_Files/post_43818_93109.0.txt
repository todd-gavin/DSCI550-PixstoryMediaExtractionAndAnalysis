The head coach was pleased with the Spaniard's recent performance against Levante, but does not believe he is capable of carrying the squad.

Despite agreeing that Pedri is "an amazing player," Xavi insists that Barcelona are not reliant on him.

Pedri put up a strong performance to help Barcelona win 3-2 against Levante in their most recent La Liga match, which he concluded with his third goal of the season.

Due to a hamstring injury, the 19-year-old missed the first half of the season, but since his comeback in January, the Blaugrana have won nine games and drawn one.

Xavi praised Pedri's performance against Levante and believes he has the ability to make a game-changing impact, but he dismisses the idea that he is carrying Barca in the same manner that Lionel Messi did before his departure last summer.

He told reporters, "I wouldn't say that." "Look, he's a fantastic player. Don't be stingy with your compliments to him. He's a player that intrigues me and has the potential to make an impact.

He scored a fantastic goal [against Levante], but we don't believe there is any reliance on him.

Xavi even mentioned Frenkie [de Jong] and Nico [Gonzalez]'s efforts as well.Â 

It's not always possible to play wonderful football. As said by Xavi,

Barcelona's victory over Levante was their eighth in a row in La Liga, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Luuk de Jong both scoring as they closed the distance on leaders Real Madrid to 12 points.

The Catalan club is also undefeated in 15 league games and still has a game in hand on the Blancos as they pursue an unexpected title victory.

Xavi's team is also chasing Europa League gold, with the second leg of their quarter-final clash against Eintracht Frankfurt scheduled for Thursday at Camp Nou.
