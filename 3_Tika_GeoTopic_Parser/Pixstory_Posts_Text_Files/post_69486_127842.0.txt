In Ladakh, nature can surprise you in a variety of ways. Pangong Lake is the highest saltwater lake in the world, rising to a height of over 4,350 metres. The barren mountains that surround it stand in dramatic contrast to its water, which appears to have been tinted blue. The Pangong Lake stretches over 160 kilometres, with one-third in India and the other two-thirds in China. 
One of Leh Ladakh's most well-known lakes, Pangong Lake gets its name from the Tibetan word "Pangong Tso," which means "high grassland lake." This place is so beautiful that you could spend hours admiring it. Pangong Lake is renowned for changing hues, appearing variously blue, green, and red. Don't forget to visit the Pangong Lake if you're planning a vacation to Ladakh anytime soon. There, you will encounter beauty that is beyond words to adequately express.
