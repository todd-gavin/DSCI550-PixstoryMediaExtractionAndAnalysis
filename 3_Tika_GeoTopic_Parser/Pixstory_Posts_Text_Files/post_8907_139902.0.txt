In Retirement continues.....
In 1956 I again went to Amritsar to collect funds for the D. A. V. College which was started there that year. With the help of Mr. C. L. Anand, the tireless General Secretary of the D. A. V. College and Lala Brij Lal, the Organizing Secretary and an enthusiastic worker in its cause, and other co-workers, we re-organized the different D. A. V. Institutions, started building the D. A. V. School, Lahore at Chandigarh and a D. A. V. College at Amritsar and the Brahm Vidyalaya at Hissar. The membership of the D. A . V. College Society was also increased and its rules and regulations revised and reprinted. The office was re-organized and brought up-to-date. 
Occasionally during this period I also attended the meetings of the Punjab University Syndicate and its different committees, some of which, with the kindness of the then Vice-Chancellor, Dewan Anand Kumar, were held at my house in New Delhi. I had been elected a Fellow of the Punjab University by the Law Faculty probably in 1935-36 and became a Syndic a few years later. 
Dr. A. C. Woolner, a great orientalist, and Sir John Meynard, a great administrator, were ideal Vice-Chancellors deciding all questions that came before the Senate or the Syndicate on academic grounds alone. When Mr. Afzal Husain became the Vice-Chancellor, communal consideration crept in the distribution of the University 
patronage. Sir Abdir Rahman my colleague on the bench, succeeded him and put things aright.
