The Italian luxury sports car manufacturer Lamborghini has launched the Huracan Tecnica in India today.
The Lamborghini Huracan Tecnica is a two-seater track-focused performance car that was unveiled globally in April 2021. Now, the company has launched the car in India.
The Lamborghini Huracan Tecnica is placed between the Huracan STO and the Huracan Evo RWD. When compared to both the models, the Tecnica is equipped with cosmetic tweaks and other additional features. The power train remains unchanged.
