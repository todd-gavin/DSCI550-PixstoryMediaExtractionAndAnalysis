It was my parents wedding anniversary and me and my sister decided to arrange a small dance routine as a small gift But the thing was that me and my sister we were busy with our own studies and activities that we didn t get enough to prepare so we started to choreography one prior to the celebrations we chose a very long song which made it very difficult to choreograph the routine but we were very stubborn on our decision and yet decided to continue with it by the time it was late in the evening we had run out ideas and dance steps not able to think anything to we gave up and decided to perform the dance as we have choreographed We were confident enough that we would be able to dance as agreed to do The next evening me and my sister were very much mentally prepared to dance but little did we know that our parents had also invited some guests over Me and my sister freaked out because we were not prepared to dance in front of them at all I started to feel anxiety I was just not expecting it But now by this time I had no choice other than dancing in front of everyone After a while guests were done with their snacks and were all ready to watch us dance Which I was not soon the music started to play and after a few steps I was all blanck I could not remember a thing it got very awkward for as everyone was watching me it got very embarrassing for me
