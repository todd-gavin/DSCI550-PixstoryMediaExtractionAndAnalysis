Geoff Dyer s The Last Days of Roger Federer is not written in his last days but has a lot to say as its title portrays He speaks of the work of writers painters footballers musicians and tennis players who have uniquely shaped his thoughts and life He looks into the previous work of these people and the emotions they experience when they see the sight of the last days of their lives The irony lies in that Dyer s book begins with an end His book tells us how one can live life happily by savouring art and beauty In his book he says So let s celebrate the fact that I ve finally seen Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger s The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp The extraordinary thing was that I d been able to do my business living a normal life with this huge Blimp shaped hole at its centre For all this time I d been an incomplete person What if I hadn t seen it In the same way nothing happens if you don t read Jane Austen or listen to A Love Supreme but your life will be defined in some ways by these and other lacks Speaking of the poetry and poets who gave the best works of their lives Dyer writes At any poetry reading however enjoyable the words we most look forward to hearing are always the same I ll read two more poems The words we truly long for are I ll read one more poem but two seems to be the conventionally agreed minimum
