The first trailer for Winnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey has been released, being equal parts unsettling and comedic. Nothing is truly sacred in the realm of film making, and that is evident with the slasher makeover of the beloved childhood character.
 The story of the movie follows Christopher Robin who has left for college abandoning Winnie The Pooh and Piglet causing the two to revert to their primal animalistic instincts in order to survive, with Eeyore being the first victim of their primal hunger.
 The trailer shows how without the influence of their human friend, the two have turned wild and feral.
 The film is evidently made on a very tight and small budget as showcased by the costumes of Pooh and Piglet, played by Craig David Dowsett and Chris Cordell behind masks that make it impossible to take the horror-slasher incarnation of the two characters as anything more than a goofy comedy.
 Describing the tone of the movie, director Rhys Waterfield told Variety that the slasher aims to balance both the absurdity and ridiculousness of such a wacky concept with a sense of genuine terror and horror as the legendary stuffed animals embark on a brutal bloodbath, motivated only by feral hunger.
“When you try and do a film like this, and it’s a really wacky concept, it’s very easy to go down a route where nothing is scary and it’s just really ridiculous and really, like, stupid,” Waterfield said. “And we wanted to go between the two.”
 From the looks of it, he succeeded. The concept is absurd but has a genuine sense of terror in it, the movie, from the trailer not so much, mainly due to the ridiculous appearance of the two dear stuffed animals turned killers. 
 A highly wacky idea, the trailer makes you want to go to theaters and watch the movie just to see whether such an idea would ever work out. This looks like a movie which will either be amazing or horrible, there is no middle area. Winnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey currently does not have a release date.
