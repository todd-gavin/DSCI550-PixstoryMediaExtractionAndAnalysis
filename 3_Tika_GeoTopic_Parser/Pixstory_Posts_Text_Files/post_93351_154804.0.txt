Paramore condemns alleged homophobic incident occurred at the band’s Salt Lake City show on Tuesday.
Taylor Shelton and Dayle Hand, a queer couple, were verbally harassed by a man as he makes some derogatory comments about the couple. Soon, the situation became out of control and EMS also got involved.
Paramore posted a statement on social media on Wednesday and wrote that they only became aware of the situation after the show. “Had we seen any of this happening, we would have stopped the show until the situation was under control.” 
After apologizing to the fans once more, the statement ended by saying, “To make things as clear as possible: Paramore shows are meant to be a safe place for people. If you can’t respect that, do not come.”
