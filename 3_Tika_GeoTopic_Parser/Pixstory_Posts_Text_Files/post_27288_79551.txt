It is one of the lungs of Milan perhaps the most chic certainly the most central Close to the fashion district is the park in via Palestro today Indro Gardens It is the first public park in Milan wanted by the Austrians in an English garden where you can discover little jewels botanical and architectural You can let yourself be surprised by the centuries-old trees such as a monumental metasequoia or by the oaks, cedars and rows of horse chestnuts Or you can be fascinated by the seventeenth-century Palazzo Dugnani or the Museum of Natural History and the dome of the Planetarium that the Italian-Swiss publisher Ulrico Hoepli first commissioned Portaluppi and then donated it to the city To run, walk, let the children play or even just for a snack or a coffee Go there It&#39;s worth it
