All K Pop idols are trained for a very long time to cope with anything that the music industry could throw at them whether it s malfunctions on stage public events or even how to respond to fans Yet sometimes things are completely out of the idol s control and training forcing them to think on their feet Recently SEVENTEEN s Vernon has been praised for his mature response to a question during a global interview SEVENTEEN recently returned from their tour in America While they were there the members not only played in front of thousands of screaming CARATS But they also did some promotions through interviews and videos In particular Vernon Seungkwan and DK visited the American radio station Sirius XM to chat about all things SEVENTEEN including the members friendship how they write their songs and much more From the very beginning netizens were not impressed with the interview explaining that the interviewer seemed to have not done much research They believe he chose to ask very standard and generic questions to the members such as how they were formed Of course despite the basic essence of the questions the members answered the questions respectfully In particular Vernon took the lead in answering many of the questions and his true personality shone through as he was polite and detailed Although netizens were willing to accept the more basic questions one was asked that did not sit right with them as it referred to fellow K Pop group BTS It is common for many K Pop idols to have BTS mentioned in global interviews but netizens have deemed it disrespectful as it always seems to be comparisons or trying to get groups to speak negatively about BTS This interview was no exception When you started the band there s no way you expected that you d be up there just like BTS That you d be at the same level as BTS
