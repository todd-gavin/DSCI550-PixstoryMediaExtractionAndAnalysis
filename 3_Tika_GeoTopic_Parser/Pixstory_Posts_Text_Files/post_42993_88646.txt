The kids after returning from playing the Homeless World Cup now had friends from around the world Even though some of them couldn t talk in English but they did understand each other sometimes they d talk to them in broken English These tours abroad led to the development of these kids in many ways It helped them mature a bit more and when they returned from playing the Homeless World Cup some of them didn t want to go back and wanted to stay We thought about how we could help these kids who wanted to stay with us and the best way was to get them educated as they weren t regular football players at that time This first started out in We made them study English and also to learn computer skills as this would help them a lot further on Today we can proudly say that some of these kids have done their PHDs Masters and under graduations they re employed now Being able to help these kids beyond the realm of football has been our biggest accomplishment When we re able to even help one kid it has an impact on the other underprivileged kids as well this enlightens a belief of hope in them that they too can achieve great things in life Hence they are able to develop their own dreams and desires I still remember that in we played on grounds that weren t in proper grounds a journalist came to me after a state level tournament and told me about the conditions of these grounds She said that the kids could get hurt in such grounds First I was a bit sad myself but then I replied that till now no kid has been injured and that we try our best to clean the grounds I told her that if she still thinks we are at fault then I apologise She clarified in the end by saying that she thinks we re doing a wonderful job with helping these kids from many far off areas who hadn t even been to a city before
