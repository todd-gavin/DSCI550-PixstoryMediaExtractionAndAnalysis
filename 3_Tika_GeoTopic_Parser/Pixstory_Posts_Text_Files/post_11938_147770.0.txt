Everyone enjoy their favourite cold beverage and their favourite Netflix show while suffering from cramps and period pain . Although it may seem like a good idea , but the truth is - doing this could make your period worse ! It is advisable to stay away from cold meals and beverages while on period . ❌
But is this advice right ? Why do cold drink hamper our system ? Let's unveil what lies beneath . 🤔
They are caused due to the excessive contractions of the uterine and abdominal muscles to discharge the menstrual fluid out of the body . The muscles in the ovary and the vaginal walls tense up . These muscles cannot stretch further , which is why it leads to discomfort . ✅
Consuming cold beverages during periods makes the cramps worse because of Prostaglandins . Prostaglandins , which is a natural chemical  found in the body , cause the uterus to contract in order to shed the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) . This is how you get your periods .
While most may feel absolutely okay after consuming cold drinks , some may experience severe cramps .
