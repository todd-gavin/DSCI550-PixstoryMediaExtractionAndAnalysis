But still why was I not ecstatic Well as my bestie cum bro told me was that I was never this over the top guy And that I always had thoughts of people who did not get their visa or did not get the university they wanted We all busted our asses off This process makes you do that But despite all the hard work fate has its twisted ideas Not everyone is lucky like I am Not everyone is as privileged as I am I didn t do anything different I followed the same rules Just that luck was on my side and things worked out God has been great to me and my family now that I come to think of it All the spirits have been smiling at us I every day think of those who did not get what they wanted those who wanted the same thing but for some reason could not get what I got They are always in my thoughts and I often say to myself it could have been me And one simply cannot just ignore this feeling it is real I try to be as empathetic as I can be because applying to pursue an education abroad is draining on more levels than one could imagine I try to help out anybody with this dream of theirs with whatever I can offer from prepping them up for IELTS to advice or even help them write a Statement of Purpose I am in fact happy to do so I feel that it is my duty in a way to help them out as the heavens above have been grateful to me and honestly this is the very least I could do for anybody And to be honest working towards studying abroad is a short in the dark Contd
