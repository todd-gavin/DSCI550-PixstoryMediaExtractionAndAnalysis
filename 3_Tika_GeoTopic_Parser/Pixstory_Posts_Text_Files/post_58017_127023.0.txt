India is a nation of dreams and hopes that has  continuously risen and grown despite all the challenges it has faced . 
We have moved forward and reached new levels of success . 

But Many Women in our country have still not experienced freedom . They are not free to choose and make their own life choices.
We have to make our country a better place and safe place for women. Only then will our country be able to reach its potential.

Happy 76 independence day
