As happened at the start of the European Championship when Hungary arrived five minutes from an incredible qualification in the group with Germany Portugal and France the Italian Marco Rossi coach of the Hungarian national team is receiving compliments from all over Europe including Italy But there is a big but to all this In fact, if Hungary first in its Nations League group ahead of Germany, Italy and England, he continues not to be considered as a real coach in the Bel Paese In the sense that no one has ever called him beyond the CN series before and now He confessed it himself in an interview with Corriere della Sera I didn&#39;t go beyond the C on the bench in Italy I was forced to emigrate and the turning point came Perhaps my limit I say what I think he said adding After the to England many compliments but for me never no offer I was about to give up then Hungary adopted me Hungary has a very glorious past in football it was one of the most valid and feared teams up until the 1970s It never managed to win a World Cup but in participation it came second twice And after poker foisted on England in the Nations League there was great euphoria perhaps higher than that of the European Championship where we arrived minutes before qualifying in the group of Germany Portugal and France Hungary thrives on football but largely no one has experienced the glories it was For this reason there is great pride
