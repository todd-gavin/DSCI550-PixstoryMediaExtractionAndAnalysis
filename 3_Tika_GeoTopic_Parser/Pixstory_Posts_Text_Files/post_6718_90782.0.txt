This video is also viral on Facebook with the same claim.

Rukmani Riar first came into the limelight in 2011 when she cracked the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams with an All India Rank 2. She then became the second Punjab-born District Collector in Sriganganagar in January 2022.

Fact-check
We reached out to Rukamni Riyar who denied these claims and called them “completely fake”.

Upon reverse-image searching frames from the video with relevant keywords, the earliest instance of the same video that we could find was on YouTube dated December 19, 2020.

The video is captioned “New Rajasthani Marriage Dance 2020 | New Marwadi Dj Song | भाभी जी का ऐसा डांस आप ने नहीं देखा होगा” and does not claim that the woman in the video is IAS officer Rukmani Riar.

We also found a post on Facebook dated June 13, 2019. It is captioned “राजस्थान के शेखावाटी क्षेत्र की जाटनी ने इतना बढ़िया डांस किया सर के ऊपर रखे हुए गिलास और मटके का बैलेंस बनाते हुए” which translates to “The Jatani of Shekhawati region of Rajasthan danced so well, balancing the glass and pot kept on top of her head.”

We compared stills from the two videos and found they are the same.
