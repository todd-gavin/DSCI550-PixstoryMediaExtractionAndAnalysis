The majority of facilities falsely state that the lion cubs that take part in the petting activities are orphaned although this is not usually the case A research states that while there are only lions in the wild there are between and that are maintained in captivity on roughly farms for commercial breeding and keeping These cubs are bred in captivity on demand to supply these petting farms with a constant supply of lion cubs the statement reads Big cats especially young cubs sleep for several hours each day However they become worn out when required to engage with paying customers for eight to ten hours a day Cubs must be habituated before they can interact with people in a safe manner This entails taking the cubs away from their mother as soon as possible so that they can be raised by people Honestly not a good idea Leave the wild alone
