Lt. Gen. B.K. Bopanna, PVSM, AVSM, VSM, (Retd.) of my Regiment has always been kind and helpful in discussing the Chinese style and attitude to negotiations during the Joint Working Group meetings regarding the disputed Sino-Indian boundaries. I am grateful for his insights and for the anecdotal information, some of it humorous. Lt. Gen. B.S. Malik, PVSM, AVSM (Retd.) of the 5th Gorkha Rifles was most kind to discuss the Sumdorong Chu incident of 198h-87.

Finally, my thanks to Ms Ajanta Dutt and the late Mr. Tapan Ghosh, for their efforts towards making this readable.
