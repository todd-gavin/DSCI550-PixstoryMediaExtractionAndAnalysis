Come on, now! All those things you mentioned are super hypothetical. In fact, your arguments make more sense for guns than they do for phones, but moving on.

We're forgetting that we are still under the aftershocks, if not still in the middle of the pandemic. The last two years have digitalized everything. From jobs to learning. People are no longer clinging to traditional ways of doing things. Kids should be taught on phones and computers because that is what will be demanded out of them when they'll go out in the field for jobs. We can't teach them with chalk and board when it's not efficient for their future!

Having a phone will foster creativity among kids. In fact, phones should not only be allowed but also be used to enhance learning. That's what the time demands.
