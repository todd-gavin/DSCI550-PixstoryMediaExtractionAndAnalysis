Sushmita Sen was heard talking about the horrible incident. There were a lot of people around and the 15-year-old boy thought Sush would not notice who touched her. However, Sushmita is a formidable force all by herself. Sushmita grabbed his hand and pulled him to the front. She was shocked to see a little boy of 15 doing such a thing 

Sushmita Sen said that she would have taken strong action against the person had it been someone else. However, it was a boy of 15. She grabbed him by his neck and took him away from the hullabaloo. She told him that if she would make a hue and cry his life will be over. The 15-year-old boy quickly started denying that he did anything. However, Sush gave him another chance to acknowledge what he did and then the boy apologized. Sushmita asked him if he knew his life would be over? The boy said that he won't do it ever again. Sushmita asked him to leave. She understood the difference between the 15-year-old boy not being taught about how wrong his behaviour is.
