Recently I've visited this beautiful place with my family . Me and my cousins enjoyed a lot it was a good time that we had spent together. It offered numerous scenes that soothes our eyes! üòç I think Nature is the best buddy of humans, nothing can beats it, the beautiful scenes it offers , that pure air , that experience can never be explained it just can feel. It's loveliness will never ends , but increases with the passage of time. Whenever we recall that experience it gives a smile on our face it provides us joy. 
I've spent my whole childhood in pachmarhi it is such a beautiful place , free from the urban junk. It is the hill station of Madhya Pradesh it has numerous of places to visit some of the most famous places are bee fall , dhupgarh , rajendra giri , pandav caves , duchess fall , apsara vihar , priya darsahni , mahadev , gupt mahadev , jata Shankar and many more. All the places have its own history and it holds it's own significance. Even the whole town is beautiful it self. The outer  pachmarhi's roadside scenes are again beautiful people used to go for long drive just to see that beauty. During a particular period of time, mostly during vacations pachmarhi got filled with tourists even the hotels get fully occupied, then people used to stay in matkuli and other resorts that are 30-40 kilometres far from the town. 
Apart from this pachmarhi is also famous for the belonging of lord shiva and devotees of lord shiva used to visit mahadev temple for the couple of time in a year.
