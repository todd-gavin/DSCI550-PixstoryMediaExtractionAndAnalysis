According to the Department of Interior, Native American children were renamed, taught not to speak Indigenous languages, and had their hair chopped at 408 boarding schools in the United States that imposed assimilation throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. 

CNN reported that the agency released a long-awaited report on the federal government's historical efforts to assimilate Native American children into White American society by taking them from their families and robbing them of their languages and cultures. 

The research, which is part of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, explains some of the conditions that students faced, provides a list of boarding schools around the country, and identifies more than 50 designated and unmarked grave sites.

The federal government used "systematic militarised and identity-altering methodologies" on children and teenagers at these schools, including giving them English names, haircuts, wearing military or other uniforms, and prohibiting them from speaking their native languages or practising their religions, according to the report. 

According to the report, those regulations "were frequently enforced using corporal punishment, including solitary confinement, 'flogging, withholding food,... whipping[,]"slapping, or cuffing."

No child deserves this but this is a sad reality which was buried for too long. When kids are targeted in the society, it’s a new low!
