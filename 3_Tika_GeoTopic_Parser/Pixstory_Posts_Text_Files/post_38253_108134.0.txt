Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo could be leaving the English club in the summer as per La Repubblica. As per the report, the Portuguese international has informed his agent Jorge Mendes about his feelings as a summer exit looks likely. 

The Red Devils failed to qualify for the 2022/23 UEFA Champions League tournament after finishing 6th in the Premier League. This is reportedly the biggest reason for Ronaldo's departure from the club. 

Cristiano Ronaldo finished the season as United's top scorer with 24 goals in 38 games. However, the goals tally was quite low compared to his previous seasons with Real Madrid and Juventus. 

As per reports, Jorge Mendes is understood to be searching for potential offers around Europe, with two clubs have expressed interest in his services.

Roma and Sporting Lisbon are the said clubs who have shown their interest in the Portuguese superstar. However, at this moment, it looks unlikely that Ronaldo would be willing to move to either of the clubs. 

Erik Ten Hag had stated in an earlier press conference that he hopes that the Portuguese international would stay at the club. However, there is yet to be an official confirmation from the Ronaldo camp about the same. 

It has to be seen if any of the European giants decide to bid for Cristiano Ronaldo in the coming days.
