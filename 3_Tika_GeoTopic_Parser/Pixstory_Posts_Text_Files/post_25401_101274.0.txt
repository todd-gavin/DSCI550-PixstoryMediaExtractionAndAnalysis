I feel like with work from home and online classes, all of us had to suffer a lot but I and a lot of people around me, rather than giving all their time to work or studies, have tried exploring new options and opportunities, a lot of them got internships or learnt coding or photoshop, or cooking or singing. And skills like these, they give you memories for life, and marks or percentage isn't the main goal of students now, it still is for a lot of them, but they aren't afraid to try their hands out in the creative fields.
