The Messi vs. Ronaldo argument shows no signs of slowing down, with football fans all over the world still trying to prove who is better. David James, a former Manchester City goalkeeper, is the latest to join the debate, choosing Cristiano Ronaldo above Lionel Messi.

The Manchester United star is one of the most decorated players in football history, having won many trophies in various European leagues as well as on the international scene. David James says that he has admired the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's tremendous achievements over the years.

"I admire the success of Ronaldo, when you look at it, that's the best career ever," the Englishman said on the latest episode of the TOI Sportscast podcast (via Times of India).

"I don't think there is a debate anymore. He is the best player of all time. There is no question about it. The record speaks for itself," he added.

Last summer, the Portuguese great, like Lionel Messi, swapped teams, securing a high-profile return to Manchester United in August. So far in the Premier League, he's scored 12 goals for the Red Devils, bringing his total to 96 goals in the competition. David James thinks it would be incredible if the Portuguese scored a century of goals for the club this season.

"However, maybe this is a testament to the PL, Ronaldo has had 5-6 seasons now with Manchester United, granted at the beginning of his career he wasn't playing every week."

"I think he's 4 goals shy of 100 goals in the PL for United. If he gets to 100 it's going to be phenomenal but what we are seeing is Ronaldo, best player ever, in a Manchester United team literally fighting for 5th place. So that tells you even the best player doesn't guarantee you the title," he added.
