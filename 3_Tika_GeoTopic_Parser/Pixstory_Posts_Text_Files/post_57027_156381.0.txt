In any form of psychological fear, you tend to develop some common issues that are mostly present while experiencing symptoms of any phobia.
These are four relevant points to be discussed here.
Firstly the person will have intense and unreasonable fear. The fear of the object or situation is persistent and out of proportion to an appropriate level of fear.
There is always an anticipatory anxiety, an individual with a phobia tends to dwell on or dread future situations or experiences involving the object or situation they are afraid of.
Many people with phobia actively avoid the feared object or situation. Some go to extreme lengths to avoid the thing they are afraid of.
The phobia interferes with day-to-day activities: The fear the individual experiences has to limit their everyday life in some way for it to be diagnosed as a phobia.
