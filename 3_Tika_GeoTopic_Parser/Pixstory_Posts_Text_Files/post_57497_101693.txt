Maya Angelou was an American poet and her writings gave a voice to countless women who wanted to speak with courage It is very well said that Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken it s how she did it all She moved through the world with unshakeable calm confidence and a fiery fierce grace and abounding love Angelou s Phenomenal Women is the image she wanted to create for every woman so that they can fight against stereotypical ideas that set certain standards for how a quintessential woman should look like Maya in her poem asks those women to adhere to their real identities and embrace them In the beginning lines of the poem when Angelou says where her secret lies to a group of curious women The secret she mentions here are those unravelled charms of a woman that she keeps with her even if it doesn t fit into societal ideas Through her poem she redefines femininity and instead asserts that the idea of femininity is subjective With a hidden subtly in the poem she speaks about the body image of a woman and how she should not be concerned about her physical characteristics Angelou s Phenomenal Women is very relevant today She very well portrays an ideal woman who is perfect even if she doesn t fall into the set definitions of being an ideal woman
