Everyone needs a motivation in their life time to time so that they have the energy to work and for me it comes by listening music Whenever I think that there is stress of work or a life I prefer listening to my favourite playlist so that I can divert my mind and think with up a peaceful mind Listening to music keeps like I am in a different place or lives in the music it calms my mind and give me a refreshment so that I can continue my work or life It motivate me to work to do everything I am not able to do or feel that I will not be able to after listening music I think that I will be able to because it fills me with and energetic energy so that I can keep going on
