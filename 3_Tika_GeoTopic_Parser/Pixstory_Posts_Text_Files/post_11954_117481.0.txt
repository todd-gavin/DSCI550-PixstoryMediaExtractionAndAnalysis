The issue of abortion is widely disputed in our Society , a Hotly Debated topic and is considered taboo because it has to do with sex . 

I believe that it is a womanâ€™s right to choose whether she wants child or not . I have Seen Many people are against abortion because of religious or moral beliefs . People Don't understand What abortion actually Means ! The abortion is performed when the child is not developed . 

Let's keep all the things aside ! First of all , in many scenarios , an abortion is necessary and it would be wrong not to let the mother choose an abortion . 

Let me Give example - if a woman is raped , is she expected to keep the child ? Of course not ! Even if the mother decided to have the baby and support it , for the rest of her life she will be burdened simply because she was a victim . ðŸ˜¶

Abortion in India has been legal under various circumstances for the last 50 years with the introduction of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in 1971. The Act was amended in 2003 to enable women's accessibility to safe and legal abortion services .

I'm really not saying That It is Wrong Or right ! But i really Want to say that People should not force any women to go through abortion ! You know when a Woman gets to know that she is pregnant , She gets connected with child Emotionally and Mentally ! For Eg - If during Pregnancy period , the family got to know that its a girl child ! And if they are not much educated ,  They will simply Force mother for abortion !  This Is Soo much painful for the mother and the child . This is not acceptable ! ðŸ¥º

Non Of Us , not even the society has this much right to force any women for abortion ! People should get this thing in minds ! 

IT'S HER CHOICE , LET HER DECIDE ! 

Tell me in notes what are Your views about it ! ðŸ˜¶ðŸ’­
