This is what I learnt from Warikoo People Procrastinate not because they don t have enough Time but in reality it s because they feel think they have not enough energy Your Time is your Energy allocation Write down all your task in a piece of paper When you write down all the things that needs to be done it gives your brain a signal that these tasks are important in your life so your brain take decision to complete that task accordingly Devide Each task into any one of these categories Urgent Important Do it right away Urgent Not Important Delegate it to others Not Urgent Important Schedule for later Not Urgent Not Important Do not do it Identify Most important Task When you decide which task is most important to you then you start prioritising your actions towards the completion of tasks Make plan for next day When you make plan Road map in advance it saves your time in execution of that plan Comple tasks only from the plan Don t get distracted by external forces ask yourself will you do it if this is the last day of your life Review what you ve achieved at the eod Reflection helps your brain grow yourself you will know more about yourself When you complete something it gives you a sence of achievement
