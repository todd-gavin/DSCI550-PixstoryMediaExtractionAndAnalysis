In the wild pandas normally only have one cub although in captivity twins are more common If a mother panda has two babies in the wild she will only feed the stronger of the two The other is left to its own devices This is due to the fact that a newborn cub is extremely vulnerable Cubs begin eating bamboo around the age of months but they are fully reliant on their mothers until then Female pandas in the wild do not have enough milk or energy to care for two cubs When a cub is around a year and a half old it stays with its mother until she s pregnant again The cub will stay with its mother until it is two and a half years old if the mother does not become pregnant Not very good mothers now are they
