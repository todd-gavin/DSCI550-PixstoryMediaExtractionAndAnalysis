Andreas Christensen hampered Chelsea's defensive options in the FA Cup final by refusing to be selected on the day of the match.

Christensen, who is set to join Barcelona on a free transfer at the end of the season, was an unexpected omission from the team that lost to Liverpool on penalties at Wembley on Saturday. He was not injured and informed Thomas Tuchel of his choice the next morning.

He was said to have been unwell during the week and had advised Chelsea's head coach that he was not fit to participate. Last Wednesday, Christensen started Chelsea's victory over Leeds.

Tuchel made no mention of the Liverpool centre-injury back's before or after the game. When Christensen, the Denmark international, left the team hotel, his teammates claimed to be surprised and perplexed.

It's uncertain if Christensen will start against Liverpool, but reports claim he will be a replacement. However, if he hadn't started the final, he would have been a contender to come off the bench at Wembley when Thiago Silva was injured early. Silva persevered and finished the game, but the 37-year-old walked out of Wembley with a pronounced limp.

Tuchel will have an opportunity to speak about Christensen before Chelsea's match against Leicester on Thursday. Chelsea's defence will be weakened further when Antonio Rüdiger joins Real Madrid. However, the club's head coach stated last week that the Dane's choice to join Barça has had an impact on his performance.

Chelsea had two verbal agreements with Christensen for a new contract, but both times the defender changed his mind. Later, the athlete recruited new representation who wanted to start again with the discussions. Chelsea's board of directors adopted a different approach.

At Stamford Bridge, the issue has not gone down well. Despite the fact that Rüdiger is also departing on a free transfer to Real Madrid, there is no animosity against him.
