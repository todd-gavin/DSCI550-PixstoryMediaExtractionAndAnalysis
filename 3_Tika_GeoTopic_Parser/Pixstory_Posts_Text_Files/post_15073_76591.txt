Did you know that every citizen therefore you too produce around kg of textile waste every year This is confirmed by a survey by the European Commission More than kgl of the total is disposed of in landfills or in waste-to-energy plants or exported to non-EU countries The European objective is to reduce quantity of this waste that ends up in landfill Mattresses and upholstered furniture are a separate chapter but no less relevant from an ecological point of view Most of this waste ends up in landfill but a mattress can be recovered up to its weight Anticipating the European indications in Italy from January the management of textile waste will fall within the EPR Extended Producer Responsibility framework thus involving producers, importers and distributors in the recycling and recovery chain. As part of these dynamics linked to recycling, Federdistribuzione has therefore promoted the creation of two national consortia Ecoremat and Ecotextiles dedicated respectively to the management of discarded mattresses and upholstered furniture and to the management of textile waste. I think this is good news that goes in the right direction
