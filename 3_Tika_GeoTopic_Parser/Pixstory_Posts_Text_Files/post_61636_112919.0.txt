Liv Morgan won the women’s Money in the Bank ladder match to kick off the Money in the Bank pay-per-view last night and she co-headlined it by cashing in the contract to win the SmackDown women’s championship from Ronda Rousey.

Rousey handed her the title, hugged her, and appeared to say “you deserve it” before raising her hand and leaving the ring. She seemed legitimately happy for her.

You almost can’t help but feel that way for Morgan.

Morgan came up in the 3 member Riott Squad, while the other 2 members are seemingly gone from WWE, Liv has always been a fan favorite, and people have been waiting for her to win the big one for a while now!! 

And fans were electric after Liv had scaled the summit of WWE
