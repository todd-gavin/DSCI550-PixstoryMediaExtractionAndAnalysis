They re never okay with your unhappy face instead they would lick your tears if they find you crying The most gentle beings They re so innate they don t make you think what other people would think about you Instead they would make you nonchalant as they are barely caring about the world around them They would never say the wrong things to anger or discourage you during bad times On the contrary every sound they make would be favourable for you Hence the best listener and partner They don t have an agenda like humans They would accept your grieving or unhappiness but stand with you in the hour of need Unlike other therapists they would not work on appointments instead they would always be available to take care of you Most importantly they would not judge you for what you are and what have you done to deserve the situation Instead they ll just let you rub their bellies
