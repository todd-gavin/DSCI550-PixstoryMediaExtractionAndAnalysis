Kareena Kapoor Khan, Malaika Arora, Amrita Arora and Karan Johar snapped at Manish Malhotraâ€™s house in Bandra. The Bollywood besties Kareena and Malaika were seen in an all-black outfit and clicked together. On the other hand, Amrita picked a floral dress and teamed it up with a yellow jacket and stilettos. Karan Johar wore an abstract playsuit. We presume that table has been set to discuss the Gossips of Bollywood.
