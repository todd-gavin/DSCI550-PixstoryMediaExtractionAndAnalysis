I'm surprised! If we wear a hijab , will the problems of the country be solved? Theft, murder
Corruption
Violence
kidnap
Bribery and. . . Is solved
The principle of Islam in Saudi Arabia has liberated its people, so why can't we go anywhere because of this hijab? Under the pretext of this hijab, we are forbidden from sports, from duty, from education
Today, this Islamic Emirate, which is called Islam, is mentioned on TV screens. Women do not wear hijab, they do not smell the smell of heaven at all, there is no peace in the grave, and so on.
Now we do not want this paradise to be a compulsion and the word of the grave remains a personal thing, I and I have no personal freedom today.
