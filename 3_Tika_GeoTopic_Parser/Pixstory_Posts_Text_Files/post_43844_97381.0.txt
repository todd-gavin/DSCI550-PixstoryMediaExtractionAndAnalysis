Mikel Arteta joined Arsenal on a four-year deal from Everton on August 31, 2011 for a cost of
£10 million. On September 10, 2011, against Swansea City at the Emirates Stadium, he made
his debut.

On the same day, German defender Per Mertesacker made his first appearance for Arsenal.

Arsenal triumphed 1-0 thanks to a poor clearance by Swansea goalkeeper Michel Vorm, which
fell to Andrey Arshavin, who made no mistake in slotting the ball home. Meanwhile, Arteta
impressed in midfield with his bursts of speed and diverse passing ability. Within two minutes,
he had Aaron Ramsey set up, but the latter was unable to keep his shot on goal.

When Arteta made his debut, who were his teammates and where are they now?

Wojciech Szczęsny – GK

In 2006, the Polish goalkeeper joined Arsenal's junior ranks. He made his debut in a 2-0 home
win over West Bromwich Albion in the Football League Cup third round. In the encounter, he
made two crucial saves, the first to deny Danny Graham from close range and the second with
a low reaction stop later in the game.

After a couple of seasons on loan at Roma, Szczesny left Arsenal permanently in 2017. After
that, he joined Juventus and is still playing in Turin.

Bacary Sagna – RB

From Auxerre, the French full-back joined Arsenal in 2007 and stayed until 2014. He went on to
play three seasons with Manchester City.

Sagna recently played for the Montreal Impact of
Major League Soccer before retiring from the game in 2019.

Per Mertesacker – CB

In his debut month as an Arsenal player, the German centre-back quickly adjusted to his new
surroundings, appearing in every Premier League encounter. In 2018, he retired from
professional football as an Arsenal player, but stayed on as Head of Academy at the club. He
has held the role since then.
