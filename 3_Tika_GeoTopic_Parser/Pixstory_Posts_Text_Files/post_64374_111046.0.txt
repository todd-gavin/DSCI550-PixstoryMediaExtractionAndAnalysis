The emotional changes and maturity that a woman experiences in her 20 to 30s is quite significant. I feel like it even shapes you into the person you become in life. Of course, it's not just the changes that matters. But also your attitude towards those changes, how accepting you are of yourself, your self-awareness, emotional and social intelligence. All of these crucial favtors go through a major ramp up at this stage in most women's life. There's also an increased attention to the self in the sense that a woman tries to understand her body, who she is and her identity. It can be a beautiful process.
