I have always been fascinated with street art because of how diverse it is. I have tried interpreting the artist's motive behind the art whenever I come across one.

But some of my friends call graffiti vandalism of private property. While I agree that painting someone's wall is considered illegal, is all graffiti vandalism?

For my photography assignment I wanted to explore some of my city's street art projects and its cultural significance.

Before getting into what I explored, let's talk about the significance of street art in itself. What does it do?

1) Improves a Place's Aesthetics
2) Tool for Freedom of Expression and Art
3) Represents Culture
4) Political and Social Activism

Not all street artwork is vandalism. Some street art projects are funded by the government and some others are initiatives taken up by independent organizations in collaborations with various artists. 

For example, the 'Malleshwaram Hogona' project, which I explored as part of my photography assignment fascinated me. It's a project which was started by 'Bengaluru Moving', an advocate for sustainable mobility. I loved the combination of colours and the diversity in art style. Each piece conveyed a story rooted in the area's history, culture, and as tribute to the local workers.

Back to our question of whether graffiti is art or vandalism, in my opinion even if graffiti is considered illegal in some contexts, it still stands as an effective medium for communicating powerful social messages and a tool for political resistance.
