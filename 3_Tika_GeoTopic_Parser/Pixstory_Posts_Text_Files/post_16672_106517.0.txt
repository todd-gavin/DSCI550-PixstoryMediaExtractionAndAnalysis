Yami Gautam recently posted about her fan-girl moment with Kiran Bedi. Sharing a picture with her on Instagram, the actress wrote, “My fan-girl moment with one of my strongest inspirations since I was a little girl growing up in Chandigarh! I shall never forget how an already well planned city transformed further for the best, when ma’am got posted there! Door to door cops used to visit every home & ensure our safety! Strict night patrolling was introduced even in the most remotest parts of the city! It was truly an honour meeting Dr Bedi yesterday at #goafest2022.” 

when asked Yami if given an opportunity would she like to play Kiran Bedi onscreen, here’s what she said. “Why not? Provided of course it’s a really good script and with ma’am’s permission,” stated Yami.
