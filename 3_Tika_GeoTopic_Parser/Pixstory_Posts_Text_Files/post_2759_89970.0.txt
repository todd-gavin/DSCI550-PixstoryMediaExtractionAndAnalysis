When the pandemic shows no signs of ending any time soon, the mask has become a life-saving devise around the world. It is surprising, then, that American mask manufactures are not making money. Many are closing down due to cheap supplies from China. Sadly, many of them knew there was competition from Beijing and yet had started manufacturing masks as a conscientious gesture. The government can help them, but only to an extent.

At the beginning of the century, there were hardly any mask manufacturers in the US, and some had to campaign to create a domestic capacity, when the whole industry was based in China. After the swine flu, there was an uptick in mask manufacturing in the US in 2009. But once the crisis was over, there was no demand: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/business/dealbook/american-mask-makers.html

Therefore, at the start of Covid-19 in 2020, there were only ten companies producing masks within the country. (Bigger firms like Honeywell and 3M had outsourced it.) Fewer than 10 percent of N95 masks used in the country were manufactured in the country. The coronavirus outbreak again compelled a rethink and new production facilities came up within the US borders in a very short time. Some saw a business opportunity, some social responsibility. 

In the first year, despite controversial campaigns against masks, there was good demand thanks to scientists and policy-makers’ appeals. But, once again, by 2021, alarm bells were ringing. Flooding the market were cheap imports from China (which had nationalized this business after the outbreak). Moreover, the success of the vaccination program also affected the demand. On top of that, there were supply chain issues, hurting the US firms that manufactured abroad.

As a result, more and more mask manufacturers in the US are closing shop, shutting down production, laying off workers that were hired less than two years ago:

President Biden’s call this month for relying more on American-made goods can help them: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/04/biden-demand-higher-share-us-made-parts-government-purchases/9367650002/ However, the government did buy their stocks, but there was a limit to its procurement. 

Given that it concerns national security, the business should be protected against the ups and downs of the market.
