Northern Ireland will meet Kosovo at the Pristina City Stadium on Thursday, looking for their first
win in Group C2 of the UEFA Nations League.

Kosovo was denied a second consecutive Nations League triumph on Sunday when they were
defeated 1-0 at home by Greece.They had previously defeated Cyprus 2-0 in the group's
opening match on Thursday.Kosovo has now lost four of their previous five home games, with
the exception of a 5-0 win over Burkina Faso in March.

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland struggled to find their feet last time out, drawing a goalless draw
with Cyprus.Last Thursday, Ian Baraclough's squad was defeated 1-0 by Greece in their group
opener.Since a 3-1 friendly win over Luxembourg on March 25, Northern Ireland has failed to
win any of their past three games in all competitions, losing twice and drawing once.

On Thursday, expect a low-scoring encounter between the two nations, and while each will like
their chances of taking all three points, we expect the spoils to be shared on this occasion.
