Here s a simple way to tell if you have a true friend almost like a friendship test and it comes from Oscar Wilde A true friend is not someone who will stab you in the back However someone who will stab you in the back And isn t that exactly what a friend is A friend isn t someone who says I ll be there for you no matter what A friend is someone you trust to call you out when you do something wrong A friend is someone who can put you down A friend is someone who can keep you safe from your worst self If friends ever sneak up on you and gossip about you behind your back They re not going to betray you A friend will be loyal to you precisely because they know when to attack you when to stab you in the front when to protect you and prevent you from being your worst self and thus believing in you and holding you to your better self That s a true friend
