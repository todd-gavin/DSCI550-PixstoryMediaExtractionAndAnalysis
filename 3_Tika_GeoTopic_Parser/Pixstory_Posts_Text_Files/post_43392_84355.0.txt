Pasoori is one of the beautiful creations of Coke Studio 14.. The vocals of Ali Sethi and Shae Gill feels so soothing and I think "love" is the only thing that comes into my mind while listening to this masterpiece ❤️
But is it only a love song? Or is it a revenge song? Maybe a combination of both? Maybe a Vengeful Love Song.. 🔥

Love the way it goes-
"Agg lavan majboori nu
Aan jaan di pasoori nu
Zehar bane haan teri
Pee jaavan main poori nu.." 

It means-
"Set fire to your worries
To waiting and to hurries
If your love is poison
I will drink it in a flurry" 🖤
