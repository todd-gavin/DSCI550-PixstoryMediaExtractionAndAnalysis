Since the start of 2022, the D.C. area’s pizza scene has absolutely exploded with new outposts for crushable thin crust, coal-fired pies, hefty Detroit squares, and New York-style slices. The latest crop of contenders includes takeout-only shops, food hall stalls, Italian trattorias, and flashy or more casual destinations to get a pizza fix.

1. Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana

The iconic New Haven-style pizza parlor out of Connecticut opened its first-ever D.C. area outpost at Bethesda’s Westfield Montgomery Mall last month. Founded nearly 100 years ago, the cult chain maintains a devoted New England following for its chewy, coal-fired pies with a thin, oblong crust and charred finish. A second area location is en route to Alexandria.

2. Underground Pizza

Maryland’s secretive new pizza project specializes in hefty, Detroit-style pies cooked in a rectangular steel pan and finished with homemade tomato sauce, fresh pesto, hot honey, and imported Parmesan. Popular picks include “The Roni Boi” topped with pepperoni cups and “The Woodlands” with all types of thyme-roasted mushrooms. Open Thursday through Sunday for takeout and delivery. Another Underground Pizza sits in Baltimore.

3. Andy's Pizza Adams Morgan

2465 18th St NW
Washington, DC 20009

The New York-style hitmaker blows Adams Morgan jumbo slices out of the water with a fresh new outpost at the top of the neighborhood’s nightlife strip. Best-selling options include its pepperoni pies and a white pizza with mushroom and onion (drizzling Mike’s Hot Honey on top is recommended). A pizza dough undergoes a 72-hour cold ferment, producing a crisp crust and a slightly sour flavor on stone deck ovens. Andy’s fifth location introduces a bottled cocktail program with colorful spritzes and creations from top bartenders. Open for dine-in or order online.

4. Mario's Trattoria

2444 Wisconsin Ave NW
Washington, DC 20007

A nostalgic red sauce replacement to Surfside entered the Glover Park fold in January, bringing the neighborhood a new option for oven-baked pizzas, calzones, and homemade pastas that rely on family recipes. Framed team photos pay homage to its namesake restaurateur, Mario Jelencovich, who was a star goalie for the University of Maryland in the late ‘60s. Open for dine-in and takeout.
