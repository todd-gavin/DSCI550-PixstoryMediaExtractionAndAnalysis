People are getting so dependent on social media that they spend the majority of their time there rather than undertaking any substantial or productive job. Relationships are becoming weaker as more people choose online talks over face-to-face interactions.

Social media has mostly lost its original function of fostering deep connections and catching up, and have instead devolved into a platform for sharing updates about the hot spots we attend. We lose sight of the distinction between appearance and reality somewhere in our quest to present the picture-perfect life.

People present their lives on social media as "perfect," and they compare their lives to others' and see themselves as lacking. It lowers their satisfaction levels and causes problems with self-esteem.

Kids are getting to know about things they shouldn't at their stage because there's no stopping the internet. Young girls are getting into adult businesses, young men are becoming politically violent.

Social media is sucking the life out of our generation.
