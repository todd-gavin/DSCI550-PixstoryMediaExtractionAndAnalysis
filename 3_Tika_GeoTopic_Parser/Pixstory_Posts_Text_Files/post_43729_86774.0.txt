Barcelona is keen to bolster their team this summer by identifying low-cost possibilities in goal, defence, and midfield before going all-in on a top-level center-forward.
It's no secret that Erling Haaland is Barcelona's top target, but the Norwegian's signature is in high demand. Manchester City and Real Madrid are reportedly interested in signing the striker.
If they fail to land him, they'll turn their attention to another number nine. Alexander Isak, Karim Adeyemi, Lautaro Martinez, and, most recently, Robert Lewandowski has all been referenced in a report by Diario Sport.
The contract of the Bayern Munich marksman expires in the summer of 2023, and negotiations to extend it have yet to begin. As a result, he might be available at the end of the season.
And what a player he is: in 35 games for the German club this season, he has scored 42 goals in all competitions. He'd give Xavi Hernandez's Barcelona team a strong goal threat.
Despite the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang this month, Barcelona may be able to use Lewandowski more frequently. Because Martin Braithwaite and Luuk de Jong are expected to leave Camp Nou during the summer transfer window, the club will need to sign a new striker.
Lewandowski isn't the only striker on Barcelona's radar; the Blaugrana are also considering signing Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak. However, if Lewandowski does not sign a new contract with Bayern Munich, he may fit inside their budget while also being available.
Barcelona may have a higher chance of acquiring Lewandowski than Real Madrid, according to the source, which could be due to Benzema's presence in the first-team setup. Barcelona, on the other hand, appears set to sign a striker for the third time in a row.
