Shia LaBeouf has come forward to dispute the assertion that he was fired from "Don't Worry Darling" Director Olivia Wilde opened up for the first time about his departure from her film. The actor claims he chose to leave the production because he didn't feel the actors were given adequate time to rehearse. Wilde says creating a safe, trusting environment is the best way to get people to do their best work.
Actor Shia LaBeouf has denied he was fired from "Don't Worry Darling". He sent Variety screenshots of text messages in which he says he told director Nicky Wilde he'd have to back out of the film. The actor's representatives declined to comment on the story prior to its publication.
The pair discussed his exit from "Don't Worry Darling" in person and via text. The film was later recast with Harry Styles, and LaBeauf said he was gutted by the decision.
Olivia Wilde allegedly texted Shia LaBeouf multiple times after he quit "Don't Worry Darling". She also alludes to tension between him and Florence Pugh, who plays his wife in the film. In one message, she says she is "heartbroken" and "not ready to give up on this yet". In another, she tells him, "You don't have to be in my movies but don't ever doubt me". The texts were sent before production learned what Shia's immersive method entailed.
In texts, she says she is heartbroken and wanting to figure this out. Will you let me know if you're open to giving this a shot? I quit your film because your actors & I couldn't find time to rehearse, she writes to Tobey. I am still persona-non-grata and may remain as such for the rest of my life, she adds. She also asks that you forgive her for the failed collaboration.
"My failings with Twigs are fundamental and real, but they are not the narrative that has been presented," Shia LaBeouf writes. "I am humbly asking, as a person with an eye toward making things right, that you correct the narrative".
