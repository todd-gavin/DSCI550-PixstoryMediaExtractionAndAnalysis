There is no sourness in here. Olivia Rodrigo is once more single.
After several months of casual dating, the 26-year-old DJ Zack Bia and the 19-year-old singer of "Drivers License" reportedly called it quits.
According to a source who spoke to US Weekly, "their romance sort of fizzled." "They weren't seriously dating, but they hadn't seen one other in a while."
A insider reportedly stated, "There were no conflicts [between them], they both have separate work schedules and distinct buddy groups," according to Life & Style, who were the first to break the news of the separation.
When the two were seen strolling through New York City together in April, Bia had his arm slung over her shoulders, sparking the first relationship suspicions.
A few months after it was said that she broke up with Adam Faze, there were romance rumours involving Bia, who was previously romantically associated with Madison Beer.
Rodrigo previously had a romantic involvement with her co-star in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, Joshua Bassett. Fans believed that Bassett was the subject of much of Rodrigo's debut album Sour, placing the singer's love life in the spotlight.
