Today india is celebrating 75th independence day 
Everyone at their houses are hoisting the flag 
August 15 instils a feeling of patriotism in every citizen of India as it marks 75 years of independence in the nation. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

As the country celebrated Independence Day 2022, the whole country is gripped by patriotic fervour after seven and a half decades of freedom.
Today that is on this occasion of 15th August is marked as  'Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, commemorating India’s independence from colonial rule after two centuries of oppression and suppression at the hands of the British.💯❤️

Tiranga consist of three colours which include saffron on the top signifying strength and courage of the country to be filled in everyone. White in the centre embodies peace and truth of country . 🇮🇳🇮🇳
The green colour at the bottom shows the fertility, growth and auspiciousness of the land.
For me Tiranga is a symbol and pride of my nation...❤️
The Ashoka chakra also called Dharma Chakra is placed at the centre and has 24 spokes signifying that there`s life in movement and death in stagnation.💯💯
But as you hoist at home do not forget to respect it 
One should never hoist the National Flag Tiranga in an inverted manner - the saffron band should not be the bottom band but at the top ....💯
A few other things to keep in mind are - do not display a damaged tricolour, don't let the Flag touch the ground or the floor or trail in the water, 
And never fasten the tricolour in any manner that may damage it just take care of these things..
Don’t let any tiranga be thrown at the ground in bad manner on roads ,etc 🇮🇳
Lastly, the Indian Flag should not be flown from a single masthead (top part of a flagpole) simultaneously with any other Flag....🇮🇳🇮🇳

Happy independence day to everyone🇮🇳💯❤️
