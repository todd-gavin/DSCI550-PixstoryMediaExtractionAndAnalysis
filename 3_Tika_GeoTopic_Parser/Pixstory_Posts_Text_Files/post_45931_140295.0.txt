During the course of the rule of the Queen for seven decades, Queen Elizabeth II visited US presidents save Lyndon B. Johnson in support of the "special connection" between the US and the UK that had been formed by two world wars. 

The most unexpected meetings were undoubtedly those between the Queen and President Trump in 2018 and 2019. 

As BI reports, Trump's first state visit to Britain was demoted to a working visit because of how divisive he had become politically. This meant that there would be no pomp, grandeur, or royal ballroom feast. 

In fact, the president's 2018 visit sparked such a backlash in London's streets that Prime Minister Theresa May was compelled to shift the location of her dinner for him to Blenheim Palace, 50 miles outside the city. He was not given permission by the House of Commons to address the nation as Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and other foreign leaders had. 

Trump received his most degrading taunt from Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who permitted demonstrators to fly a huge orange balloon depicting the president as a grumpy, obese baby in diapers holding a cellphone in his tiny hands.

Well now that was one for the books!
