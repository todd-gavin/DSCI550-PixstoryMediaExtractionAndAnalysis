Walking on eggshells in a toxic relationship.

Walking on eggshells. If you haven't heard the term before, you can probably tell right away what it means in relation to toxic people. Sometimes the people we are with, are so emotionally unstable, abusive and fragile that we end up tiptoeing around their moods as to not "break anything". Any "mistake" in our
actions can lead to a full on blowout. We don't know when or why they are upset, so to be safe we change ourselves and the way we react to them. This can be damaging, as
we lose our sense of self as well as our confidence. Here are just a few signs that you might be dealing with a fragile person.



* NEVER BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE THE PERSON'S MOOD
* NOT FEELING AS THOUGH YOU CAN BE YOUR AUTHENTIC SELF AROUND THEM.
* THEIR SILENCE PUTS YOU ON EDGE, BECAUSE YOU ASSUME YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG
* YOU  SILENCE YOURSELF BECAUSE SPEAKING UP ALWAYS BACKFIRES
* TIPTOEING AROUND THEIR EMOTIONS TO AVOID A BLOWOUT
* YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO LOSING AND ALWAYS BEING AT FAULT
