Amber R Cordola Hsu Nathan D Wong Abstract Background and aims Patients with diabetes mellitus DM are at an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome ACS however the factors predicting those at highest risk are not well understood We identified risk factors in those with DM that best predict high ACS risk based on a multiple endothelial injury biomarker algorithm Methods We studied adults with DM from a clinical registry with measures of a coronary artery disease prediction algorithm CADPA score identifying year ACS risk from nine markers Stepwise logistic regression provided odds ratios for the relationship of age gender and individual risk factors not part of the CADPA algorithm with the likelihood of a high risk CADPA score Results We studied adults with DM women ages to mean age years Of these had a low intermediate and high risk CADPA score From stepwise logistic regression women were less likely to have a high risk CADPA score odds ratio OR confidence intervals CI p while age per standard deviation SD OR p body mass index BMI per SD OR p hypertension OR p current smoking OR p hsCRP per SD OR p and triglycerides per SD OR p were more likely to have a high risk CADPA score Conclusions Age men hypertension BMI current smoking hsCRP and triglycerides are key factors in those with DM associated with higher ACS risk Sources
