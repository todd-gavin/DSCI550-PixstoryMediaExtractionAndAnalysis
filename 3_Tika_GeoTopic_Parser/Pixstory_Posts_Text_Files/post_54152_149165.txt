On September at pm UTC NASA s DART mission Double Asteroid Redirection Test will be the first to deliberately and measurably change the motion of a significant body in our Solar System In other words it will smash into an asteroid The mission will provide the first test of a technique that could be used in the future to redirect any asteroids we detect on a collision course with Earth A binary pair of space rocksDART was launched on November its destination a pair of asteroids in orbit around each other million kilometres from Earth The larger asteroid in the pair is called Didymos and is metres in diameter The smaller asteroid just metres wide is called Dimorphos The two orbit each other at a distance of kilometres and one orbit takes close to hours These asteroids pose no risk to Earth and have been chosen as the target for DART partly due to that fact But also importantly because the asteroids form a binary pair it will be possible for astronomers on Earth to assess the results of the impact As the asteroids orbit each other the sunlight reflected off them increases and decreases varying systematically over the hour cycle of the orbit Astronomers using powerful telescopes from Earth can monitor this variation and see how it changes from before to after the collision The physics is simple the mission is notThe physics sounds simple and it is Hit one thing with another thing to change its motion But the mission execution is very complicated When DART reaches the asteroids it will be million kilometres from Earth after a month journey The spacecraft has to use autonomous targeting using images of the asteroids it acquires as it approaches DART needs to recognise the asteroids by itself automatically lock onto Dimorphos and adjust its trajectory to hit it Read more
