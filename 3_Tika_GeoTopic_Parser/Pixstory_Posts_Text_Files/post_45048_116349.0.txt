PSG wants to keep Lionel Messi until 2024 despite the fact that his contract with them expires in 2023. Lionel Messi has already been notified by PSG that they intend to extend their offer to him by one more year, according to Marca's Parisian sources.

What is Messi and his group saying in response?
Responses to proposals that have not yet been transformed into comprehensive offers are still premature. The plan is to hold off until after the World Cup. In his second season at the club and during the World Cup year, PSG thinks Messi might explode.

According to PSG president Nasser Al-Khelafi, Messi is largely responsible for the club's €700 
million in revenue. Ten new sponsorship agreements were signed as a result of the Argentine's arrival, and as the club's commercial director Marc Armstrong noted, the arrangements were more lucrative with Messi.

According to the PSG President, regions where we could make deals for between €3-5 million 
are now between €5-8 million, making a significant impact and also Presnel Kimpembe, 
defender for Paris Saint-Germain, is expected to join Chelsea during the summer transfer window, according to the most recent information.

According to recent rumours, PSG is willing to sell the France international for the right price.

Kimpembe might be interested in reuniting with manager Thomas Tuchel, who is apparently eager to do so at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea and PSG are reportedly in talks with the capital club, which is willing to let him go, according to ESPN's Julien Laurens. He says he can't understand why this transaction wouldn't go through because both the Blues and he want a fresh challenge.
