The Premier League champions have a contract in place to recruit the prodigy Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund this summer, according to an exclusive storey in the Daily Mail by top Manchester City journalist Jack Gaughan and colleague Craig Hope.
Personal conditions have apparently been negotiated, and the framework for a transfer is set to be signed off by the club's authorities, according to sources in Germany close to the deal.
According to the article, the 21-year-old has a £63 million release clause in his Dortmund contract, and it's thought that when this cost is added to the amount Mino Raiola is projected to make, plus signing on fees, the total outlay will be 'towards £100 million.'
Despite interest from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid is thought to be City's biggest competition for the striker's signature, with Los Blancos poised to continue their pursuit of the striker. However, the media report that there is a growing anticipation across Europe that the Dortmund attacker, who has 80 goals in 79 appearances, would play for City next season.
The Haaland family has a connection to the club, since Erling's father, Alfie, spent three years in Manchester from 2000 to 2001, captaining the team on occasion until suffering a leg injury that reduced his playing time. Haaland would be housed in the city throughout his recovery.
Following the news breaking on social media, former Norwegian footballer Jan Aage Fjortoft, who is widely considered to have close ties to team Haaland, sought to calm speculation by quote-tweeting that there was "NOTHING new to report."
Making a move for Haaland will surely help to fill the void left by Sergio Aguero's departure – and considering the family's City connection, it feels like it was meant to be.
