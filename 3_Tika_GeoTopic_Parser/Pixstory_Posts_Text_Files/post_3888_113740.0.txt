Although it’s been many years since I graduated, I distinctly remember the incredible dosa served at the café of my college. Incidentally, I went to a college that was particular about referring to their eatery as a “café” and not a “canteen”.

The café was best known for its hot and crisp dosas that were served with a variety of fillings. But the menu was diverse; whether you fancied a decadent chocolate dessert or a bowl of piping hot masala noodles, there was something for every palate.
