Supporting AFC Talk’s post, wrote a piece on Fabio Vieira earlier in the week.

When Fabio Vieira was announced as a signing for Arsenal FC, it came at a surprise for two reasons:

1. No rumours or links building up
2. Perhaps not being a priority signing during the transfer window

His very first touch was a croqueta dribble past his man - Santi Cazorla & Iniesta made this move famous. His second action was a nice collect of an air ball and release to Jesus to the right hand side. Alongside some nice touches, he had two shots which were unlikely to go in but he was decisive to take them.

The best moment was a lovely low-driven diagonal pass which was intercepted at the last moment.

Although not successful, Vieira made this right-to-left pass a weapon at Porto. This will be the first of many passes for us. Elite teams may look to stockpile players of Vieira’s quality in the next few years (a prediction), so when the price and availability was there - we were ready. ESR is perhaps Ødegaard’s direct cover, but we now have a player who can play potentially four positions (CAM, CF, RW, LCM) at any one time with different effect. You don’t miss out on quality like this and time will tell on his success with us. Portugal are producing players of high midfield quality in recent years, so if Edu and Mikel think this is a move this squad requires, then I’m excited.
