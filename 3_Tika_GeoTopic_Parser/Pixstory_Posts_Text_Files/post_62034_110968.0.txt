Novak Djokovic produced a masterclass in grass-court tennis on Wednesday at Wimbledon, where the top seed breezed to a 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 second-round victory against Thanasi Kokkinakis.

Djokovic was imperious from the start against the World No. 79, striking the ball cleanly from deep and moving smoothly around Centre Court in one of his most complete performances of the year. The six-time champion broke the Australian's serve five times on his way to a two-hour victory that extended his winning streak at SW19 to 23 matches.

I’m very happy with my performance today, said Djokovic in his on-court interview. I thought I started off very well, very solid from the back of the court, made him work for every point that I managed to get his serve back in play. I tried to work him around the court, bring a lot of variety in the game.

It was not easy to serve because of the wind, it was very swirly today on the court, so tough to toss the ball. But I think from my side overall, a really high-quality performance and I’m very pleased.

After he was pushed to four sets by Soonwoo Kwon in his first-round match on Monday, six-time champion Djokovic spoke of needing time to adjust to the surface in his first grass-court tournament of the season.

One game was enough for the six-time champion to click into top gear on Wednesday against Kokkinakis, however. Djokovic broke the Australian in the second game and didn’t look back, winning 45 per cent (40/88) of points on return in a high-quality display.

He did not face a break point until he was serving for the match at 5-2 in the third set after some late Kokkinakis resistance.

Djokovic’s next assignment in his bid for his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title is a third-round clash against countryman Miomir Kecmanovic.
