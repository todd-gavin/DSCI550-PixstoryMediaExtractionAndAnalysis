It was £100million man Jack Grealish who sparked the comeback against an undeterred West Ham when Manchester City were trailing by 2 Jarrod Bowen Goals. 



26 year old Grealish came to Manchester City from Aston Villa as the most expensive English player ever in 2021. But, in Pep’s City, Grealish is not allowed to shoot !!! Fascinating but true, and cruel for a player who is playing as a winger. In 26 matches, he has scored only 3 goals, no wonder, for a forward who doesn't shoot. He has taken only 45 shots in total in the entire league season!!!


If we compare that to Bowen, who gave West Ham 2 goals lead in that match does the same job and has scored 12 goals, from 35 matches, taking 78 shots in total. Grealish has got only 3 assists too while Bowen has got 10 in his name, the reason why he is in the Player of the season nominee list. 


In 2019-20, at Aston Villa, Grealish has taken 73 shots from 36 matches and scored 8 goals. But, in Pep’s plan, Grealish is allowed only to receive passes, and keep possession, De Bruyne is allowed to shoot. That is why, he has got 74 shots from 29 matches, and 15 goals.  £100million for holding the ball and passing??


If we look at another player of similar position, from outside the Premier league, Vinicius Jr of Real Madrid has taken 79 shots from 34 league matches, scoring 17 goals and assisting in 10 goals. 


In modern football, left footed players play at right wing and right footed players at left so that they can cut inside from line and go for goal. But, Grealish can't do that unless Pep gives permission. We have no doubt that Pep is a world class manager. We know the story of Theory Henry of France being substituted for not following his plan. But, sometimes, managers also need to believe players, their talents that make them valuable and use it beyond the plans, so that they do magic - because football is beautiful as it's played by thinking players.
