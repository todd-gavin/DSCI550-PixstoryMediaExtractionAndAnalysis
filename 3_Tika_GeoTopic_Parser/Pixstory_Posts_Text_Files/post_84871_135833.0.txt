Manchester City have agreed a deal of £17m to sign Borussia Dortmund defender  on a five-year contract. The deal consists of an initial payment of £15m plus £1.7m in add-ons. 
The signing will reinforce the Premier League Champions’ star-studded defense, which already has the likes of Ruben Dias, Aymeric Laporte, John Stones and Nathan Ake. Akanji has been allocated the No.25 jersey for the Blues. 
The Swiss defender has spent four and a half years at the German club, having made 158 appearances since January 2018. He also has 41 caps for his national side and will serve as another option for Pep Guardiola, who will be eyeing a third consecutive Premier League title and his first Champions League trophy at the Etihad Stadium.
Akanji feels City have been one of the top sides in Europe over the past few years, and it’s the right time for him to take up a new challenge in his professional career. 
Akanji said: “I am delighted to be here and can’t wait to get started. City have been one of the best teams in Europe over the last few seasons. They are brilliant to watch, play an exciting brand of football and compete for trophies year in, year out, so coming here feels like the perfect next step in my career”. 
The centre-back also expressed his excitement to work under the renowned manager and further test himself in the Premier League. 
“Pep Guardiola is an exceptional manager and this is an exceptional squad of players, so this is an exciting opportunity for me. I am really looking forward to testing myself in the Premier League and I will do everything I can to help this club be successful,” he added.
Man City are currently ranked No.2 in the Premier League points table with 13 points in their bag after playing five games. They will next lock horns with Aston Villa on Saturday (September 3) at Villa Park.
