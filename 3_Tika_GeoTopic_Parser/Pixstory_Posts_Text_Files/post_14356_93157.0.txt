Been thinking a lot about pay gap that we still see in football. I was super impressed by how FCB Femeni are attracting huge crowds to the stadium and slowly we are seeing more and more conversations happening on social media (which will eventually translate to viewership too). 

According to an article on The Guardian, A survey conducted by RunRepeat found women’s football should get a 296.7% increase in the UK if on TV, while in the EU the increase could be as high as 358.7% and 304.6% in the US.

We often hear people say it doesn’t attract big sponsorship money. How do you see this change and where can we find the next set of big push coming from? If the money comes in, there’s little reason for the women’s football not to change beyond recognition. 

FCB Femini remains a fantastic case study and I hope they can push more and raise the bar with pay too for everyone to follow!

Today, women want to be seen as equals more than ever before. And another line has been drawn in the sand in the fight to be accepted as equals!
