Manchester United legend and Skysport football pundit Roy Keane has urged Premier League defenders to be cautious of Manchester City’s summer signing Erling Haaland after the 22-year-old sensation shone brightly in his first game of the season against West Ham United on Sunday, August 7.
 
The Norwegian forward exhibited an outstanding display netting a brace at the London stadium – with the first coming from the spot in the 36th minute before slotting home into the bottom-right corner beyond the reach of the advancing Alphonso Areola five minutes past the hour mark to claim his second goal.

The erstwhile Dortmund striker’s mouthwatering showpiece has however caught the eye of Roy Keane who was full of praise and admiration for his goalscoring prowess, labelling him as a highly precarious forward who will pose a big threat to opposition defenders as the season wears on. The Irish pundit also believes in his ability to notch outrageous goal-figures and he is now rooting for Haaland to deliver 30 to 40 goals in the ongoing campaign. He told skysport during the post-match conference.

“People doubted he’s going to settle into the Premier League so quickly. Great quality, great run, and great movement even last week we’ve seen in the Community Shield. He’s going to get chances. We’ve seen it today. People are talking about 20 odd goals. The fact that he’s taking penalties, it could be 30 or 40 goals or whatever because he’s going to get chances, he’s going to get chances. If he stays fit and healthy, he’s going to get chances with the quality around him. So good luck to the defenders up against him.”
