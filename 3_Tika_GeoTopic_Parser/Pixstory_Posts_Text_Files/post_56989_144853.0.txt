Prejudices have been a part of our world since it was made, so there's nothing that will be completely unfettered from the shackles of diplomacy or harm.
The same is the case with award shows; with time, they have gained relevance and importance and earned enough sponsorship and money to create a big event, but despite this showing off, there are still some fair and relevant award shows and ceremonies that are not tainted.
They are relevant enough to acknowledge the talent with their critical skills; even winning them is not more accessible, no matter how filled your pockets are with money.
Award shows are mostly business, but to some extent, there is a part that is not always touched by unbiased voting or selection.
Artists and their work still get importance through awards if their work is worthy of the honour bestowed upon them.
Besides, prejudices will always prevail, but the work will always speak for itself.
