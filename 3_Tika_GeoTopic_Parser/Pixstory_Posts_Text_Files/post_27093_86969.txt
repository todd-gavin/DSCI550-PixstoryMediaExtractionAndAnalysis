Tick Tick Boom Life is incredibly fleeting a quote about it js Life is short as the falling of snow and we never know if we re doing enough in our life or not Jonathon Larson s life shows us that Jon was an undeniable genius and I guess it only had to take another genius to portray his character to absolute perfection Andrew Garfield is a revelation in his own way in this movie he is as Jimmy Fallon described him Un be lie vableeee in this portrayal From the word go the film grasps you in its incredibly arresting narrative Andrew is a breath of fresh air that we all needed As an actor I have to say this This movie is a MUST WATCH for all the artists out there It doesn t matter what art painting singing dancing acting writing whichever art you pursue TICK TICK BOOM will give you more drive to pursue it to forget about all worldly pleasures and problems and immerse yourself into your art It may be my artistic bias but this is the best movie of and the first really worth it musical to watch after Hamilton Lin Manuel Miranda has proven his immense talent time and time again but this according to me is Lin at his peak Art is seeping out of every single moment of the movie which makes you drool over the fact how well made and how well acted this movie actually is Jon s life was glorious and tragic but to anyone who knows his story you are already inspired to do more because there s not much time and to those who haven t seen this film or know his story this is your moment this is your sign to watch a once in a lifetime experience
