 x PL matches have been played and we now break for the international friendlies for a couple of weeks As an Arsenal fan myself there s a lot to love and enjoy about the current Arsenal form Expectations for the start of the season have been surpassed so the question for this team is how far can it go There are plenty of tests to come Liverpool have had a mixed start with injuries and aging players in the midfield many were expecting another two horse race with Manchester City Salah is playing wider with x league goals in starts he is yet to fire Nunez is adapting to a new league and Klopp is adjusting his system There is time for Liverpool to produce form and I expect them to kick on if they can get their best together Manchester City are in superb form with Erling Haaland stealing all of the headlines The debate before the season will have been how City adjust their system to a striker as Pep Guardiola is famous for a striker less front attack Those questions are currently being answered and I expect them to lead the title race soon Tottenham Hotspur have made a fine start winning games ugly The addition of Richarlison looks smart Manchester United and Chelsea have new coaches at the helm so it will be interesting to see how they develop before the World Cup Ten Haag has brought discipline and Graham Potter is expected to introduce an efficient and youthful model The top sides on paper will regularly swap positions throughout the season but could another face make it complicated for those sides Brighton and Fulham have made strong starts but can they continue their form beyond Christmas This could be the most competitive season yet
