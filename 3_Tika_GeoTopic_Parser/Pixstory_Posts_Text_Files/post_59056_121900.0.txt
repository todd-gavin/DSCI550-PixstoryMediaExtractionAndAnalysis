Because it was the second anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. Heretofore then, August 15 is celebrated as India's Independence day. This year will be marked as the 75th Independence day of the nation.

The urge to achieve independence started in the year 1929 when Jawaharlal Nehru as the Congress President gave the call for ‘Poorna Swaraj’ or total independence from British colonial rule.

So, how did August 15 become India's independence day?

Lord Mountbatten had been given authorization by the British parliament to transmit the power by June 30, 1948.

However, as per C Rajagopalachari’s memorable words - If he had waited till June 1948, there would have been no power left to transfer. 

Therefore, Mountbatten preponed the date to August 1947.

With this, he claimed that by advancing the date, he was ensuring that there will be no bloodshed or riot. 

As per Mountbatten’s inputs, the Indian Independence Bill was introduced in the British House of Commons on July 4, 1947, and passed within a fortnight. 

It provided for the end of the British rule in India, on August 15, 1947, and the establishment of the Dominions of India and Pakistan.
