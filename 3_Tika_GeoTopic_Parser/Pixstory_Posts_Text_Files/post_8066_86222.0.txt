As Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine last month, China insisted there was no comparison between Ukraine and Taiwan. On February 23, the Chinese foreign ministry insisted "that Taiwan was not Ukraine." Beijing also emphasized that Taiwan was an "inalienable part of China's territory," unlike Ukraine, an independent country.

But citizens of Taiwan are wary. Several media outlets have been carrying news articles on how China may follow pressure tactics and embark on an all-out assault. Perhaps sensing this unease, the Biden Administration sent an unofficial delegation led by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen to Taiwan to discuss "regional peace and security". In other words, the security of Taiwan. (https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2022/03/01/2003773950)
 
But there are several differences between Ukraine and Taiwan. While China has a historical position on Taiwan as a lost territory that must be united with the mainland as part of "One China" principle, Ukraine was an independent nation recognized by Russia and other countries of the world, with a seat in the United Nations.
 
Taiwan experts are noticing several parallels between China's and Russia's "infiltration and destabilization tactics." For instance, Russia has been accused of stoking unrest in Ukraine for years in the restive regions and weakening Ukraine government's authority over its territory. China has been following "united front" tactics by infiltrating various sections of Taiwan society. China's violation of Taiwan airspace has also been very clear last year, much like Russia did in Crimea in 2014, later this year in the Donbas region of Ukraine.

Beijing may ramp up the rhetoric with increased efforts to undermine the sovereignty of Taiwan in the coming months as the world gets occupied with Russia and Ukraine. But some experts hope that severe sanctions and sustained efforts to “punish” Russia may alter China’s future plans.  Ultimately, how Taiwan and the world will deal with China's efforts at harassing Taiwan on the political, diplomatic and military front will determine its future.
