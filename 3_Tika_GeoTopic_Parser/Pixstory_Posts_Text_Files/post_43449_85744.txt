Went to my favorite Cafe with my favorite friend whom I met after months Ordered this lovely carrot and almonds cheesecake and spent the day eating and talking our hearts out To say it was the most happy I ve ever been in the past few months would be an understatement I got to meet my bestie eat a delightful dessert and capture a cute picture What a win win situation
