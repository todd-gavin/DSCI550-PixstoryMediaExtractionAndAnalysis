David Seaman.Who else to start off the team than David Seaman and his beautiful ponytail? Seaman won the FA cup with Arsenal a total of 4 times but most famously pulled off one of the greatest saves of all time when he managed to claw Sheffield United striker Paul Peschisolido’s close range header away from goal in the 2003 semi-final. Signed from QPR for a GK record fee of £1.3m which many saw as excessive at the time, Seaman became a part of the famous 1-0 to the Arsenal defence, keeping 23 clean sheets and conceding just 18 goals in the 1990/91 season.He had sharp reflexes, excellent positional sense, commanded his box and most importantly of all, had a tremendous moustache.Finishing his Arsenal career with 564 appearances and 8 trophies, Seaman is most certainly an Arsenal legend and becomes the first player to make my team.#PixstoryArsenal #Arsenal
