Sensational feat of Italrugby which conquered the Wales field to conquer the first victory in the VI Nations after a streak of defeats that lasted many years. The success arrived in extremis with a great play by Ange Capuozzo who slalomed from the middle one minute from the end defensive field and almost reaches the goal on the right-footed out before giving Padovani an easy run under the posts The overtaking was then completed by Garbisi&#39;s conversion Italy still finished last just behind Wales but regained impetus and enthusiasm in view of the next editions of a prestigious but really stingy event The best way to silence the skeptics and those who would like to exclude the Azzurri from the VI Nations
