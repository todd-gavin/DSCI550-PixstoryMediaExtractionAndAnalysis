An audio clip is circulating on WhatsApp with the claim that former Tata Steel managing director and Padma Bhushan awardee Jamshed Irani slammed Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut. WhatsApp has flagged the message as “forwarded many times.” In the audio clip, a man who claims to be Irani, says that the central government and the Supreme Court should take action against Raut for threatening Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut to not step into Maharasthra. He blames BJP’s adversaries – Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi – for being in cahoots with Raut and advises that the president’s rule should be imposed in Maharashtra. It must be noted that the man has used foul language at several points in the clip.

This clip has been circulating at least since 2019.

Tata Steel refutes audio clip
In 2020, Raut had indeed made derogatory remarks against Ranaut. However, the viral clip was not made by industrialist Jamshed Jiji Irani. At 1:35 minutes, the man in the clip identifies himself as “Jamshed Salamat Irani”. Alt News has uploaded the relevant portion below.

On February 22, Tata Steel’s official Twitter handle refuted this claim. The company had debunked the claim in 2020 as well.

Moreover, had Irani made the statements attributed to him, it would have made headlines. There are no credible news outlets that have reported on the audio clip.

To sum it up, a viral audio clip dating back to at least 2019 resurfaced again. The social media claim that former Tata Steel MD and Padma Bhushan awardee Jamshed Irani slammed Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut was debunked by Tata Steel’s official Twitter handle.
