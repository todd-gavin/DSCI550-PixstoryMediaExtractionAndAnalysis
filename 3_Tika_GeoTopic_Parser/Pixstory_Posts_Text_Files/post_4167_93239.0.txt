Good food equals a good mood. I am not a fan of burgers but sandwiches 😃 any day any time😁 
Let me share with you the recipe for a Grilled Cheese Sandwich 

Take 4 pieces of bread, butter one side of them generously.

 Heat a pan and grill two slices.

Layer your favourite cheese slices (for example cheddar or mozzarella)on top of the bread slices.

Close the sandwich with another bread slice and turn it over to let it crisp up.

Add three more cheese slices on top, place another bread slice, flip and grill.

How easy is it? You could also add some chicken pieces or veggies in between 😁 I would mind if it's cheesy😉

What are still doing here? Go make a sandwich and make your tummy happy Or else order one 😁
