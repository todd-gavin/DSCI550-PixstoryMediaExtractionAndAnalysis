The importance of social media in the constantly evolving world of football.
Football debate is incredibly subjective and broad, there are hundreds of interpretations and understandings of every single game.
Social media offers a great platform for those interactions, but it comes with its negatives, as well as its positives.
Trolling and abuse are unfortunately rife throughout social media, even appearing in the most sensible of debates. This understandably discourages some from sharing their opinions.
However, football is a game that thrives on those opinions. Those different interpretations of events help us grow our knowledge of the game, and learn to understand each scenario with different view-points.
For example, one game could throw up a few different ways of thinking, that not everyone would have known before. The tactical approach, how the team sets up, how they choose to make their moves.
The mental approach, the way each player thinks and plans their moves, the way they approach their environment, their team-mates and of course, the opposition.
The events of the game are also of course key, while more basic, but just as important. To analyse and share your opinion on what actually happened in that game is crucial.
For that reason, a social media platform free of abuse and the fears of trolling is very important. Being able to share your opinion in a free and welcoming environment only encourages more debate and more intelligent conversation on the game we all love.
Conversation is a massive part of why football is so widely followed, and it's crucial we allow that conversation to thrive.
