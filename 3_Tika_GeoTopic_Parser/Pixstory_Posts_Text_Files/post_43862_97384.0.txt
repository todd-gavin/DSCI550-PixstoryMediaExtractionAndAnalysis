Everton Football Club are reeling in the depths of the Premier league's relegation zone. In a
season where everything has gone wrong for the Toffees, 25 year-old midfielder Alex Iwobi
remarks this latest period as possibly his best at the club. As a unit, Everton have rarely impressed but Iwobi claims his individual game has been up on the rise.

"My first couple of years here weren’t the greatest, but this is my best period at Everton, I
want to use it as a platform to kick on and make more positive memories with this club. I
want to win something with Everton – and do my best for the club."

Everton signed Iwobi from Arsenal in 2019, paying a fee of £30 Million to the Gunners.

"My main concern is what I’m doing for my teammates and the manager and staff. Am I
working hard for them? Are they happy with what I’m giving? But, of course, it is nice to hear
about the praise."

The first couple of years under Carlo Ancelotti weren't great for Iwobi, who struggled for
playtime.

"But my focus now is on these six ‘cup finals’, then we can think about next season. Our
problem has been a lack of consistency and, more recently, little mistakes have cost us."

Since Frank Lampard's hiring the Nigerian international's displays have been on the up.

His
two most recent outings against Leicester City and Liverpool were his best games in quite
sometime.

"But the fans have been excellent and if we continue giving everything, especially the way
we feel at Goodison, we will pick up the points we need. "There is a lot of belief in the squad,
we are ready to fight," he concluded. "Even the players not playing, their mentality has been
professional and elite."
