When will Vikrant Rona release for OTT streaming in both the original Kannada and dubbed Telugu languages worldwide?

We have had some colossal productions emerge from India over the past nine months, including KGF Chapter 2, RRR, Vikram, Beast and of course, Vikrant Rona.

Vikrant Rona premiered in theatres on July 28th in more than 3000 cinemas across India, following several coronavirus-related delays to both the production and release.
Unfortunately, not every excited fan would have been able to travel to their local cinema to watch Vikrant Rona on the big screen, so when will the movie release for OTT streaming?
The Kannada version of Vikrant Rona is scheduled to release via the ZEE5 network on Friday, September 2nd.
A specific release time has not been confirmed, but the movie is expected to be made available from 12 AM IST on September 2nd.
