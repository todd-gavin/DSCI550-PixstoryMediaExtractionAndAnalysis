Bandai Namco Studios have officially revealed Tekken 8, announcing it during Sony's State of Play stream on September 13 post its tease last month. According to Tekken 8’s producer Katsuhiro Harada, the trailer for the game was taken directly from a certain part in the current work-in-progress Tekken 8’s story mode, played on PlayStation 5. 
 
On Sony’s Playstation blog, Harada said “In other words, all the character models, backgrounds, and effects are the same ones that are used in-game. Although this was captured from the story mode, it is not a pre-rendered movie made for the trailer but rather real-time rendered footage, running at 60 frames per second, similar to how you would experience the game in versus battle modes. (Of course, some of the effects, dialogue as well as the camera angle is currently being updated and may change when the game launches)”
 
He further added “The Tekken series has always been known for the dramatic pre-rendered movies from its story mode. And in addition, we also have plenty of other exciting content from Tekken 8 we would very much like to show you. However, for our first announcement, we chose to focus on the content that showcases the quality of this game on PS5.”
A release date for Tekken 8 was not announced with Bandai Namco simply telling people to “stay tuned” for more information. While Tekken 8 was only announced for PlayStation 5 during the showcase, it has since been confirmed for Xbox Series X|S and PC through Steam as well.
