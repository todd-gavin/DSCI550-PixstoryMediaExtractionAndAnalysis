Body positivity believes that everyone deserves a good body image, regardless of how society and popular culture define ideal shape, size, or appearance.
We have been exposed to such unrealistic expectations of fitness, body shape, etc. It has shaped our viewpoint and perspective according to that. It took a lot of time to change my perspective and love my body for how it is, to change my food habits to nurture my body instead of starving it to 'get' the ideal body. However, I am glad that I am at a place in my life where I focus on my habits to maintain my body. 
The pressure to be positive can rapidly become toxic. This toxic positivity might not help one's self-esteem or body image. In reality, it may be counterproductive, as it can lead to mental health issues such as depression and body dysmorphia and eating disorders, and other issues in the long run.
