Sympathy BY PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR I know what the caged bird feels alas When the sun is bright on the upland slopes When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass And the river flows like a stream of glass When the first bird sings and the first bud opes And the faint perfume from its chalice steals I know what the caged bird feels I know why the caged bird beats his wing Till its blood is red on the cruel bars For he must fly back to his perch and cling When he fain would be on the bough a swing And a pain still throbs in the old old scars And they pulse again with a keener sting I know why he beats his wing I know why the caged bird sings ah me When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore When he beats his bars and he would be free It is not a carol of joy or glee But a prayer that he sends from his heart s deep core But a plea that upward to Heaven he flings I know why the caged bird sings Considering that Paul Laurence Dunbar was an African American poet writing at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries poor bird s oppression represents the oppression of all African Americans during this period In other words the speaker of the poem uses the image of the locked up bird to give us an understanding of what it feels like to live without freedom And judging from the bird s experience it s zero fun This is why Paul Laurence Dunbar s poem Sympathy is so informative The poem doesn t mention the word race or racism once but through its description of the caged bird we understand exactly what it felt like for people like African Americans who were denied basic freedom of rights
