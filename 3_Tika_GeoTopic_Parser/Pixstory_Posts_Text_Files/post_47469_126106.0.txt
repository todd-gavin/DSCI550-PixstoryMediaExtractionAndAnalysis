Raphinha - 5.5

Not a good game for the new signing. He was very nervous with the ball and could not be seen for most of the match. 

Robert Lewandowski - 6

It was a dissatisfying day for the Polish striker as he could not find a decent supply source of balls despite being unmarked for most of the time inside the opposition box. 

Ousmane Dembele - 5

Like Raphinha, Dembele too was totally neutralized by the opposition full-backs in this match. 

Ansu Fati - 7.5

Ansu Fati changed the dynamics of the game as soon as he stepped foot on the pitch. 

Sergi Roberto - 2

Did not have a significant impact on the game after coming on. 

Frenkie De Jong - 8

After coming on, Frenkie De Jong was all over the pitch and he created 2 great chances proving once again that he is still one of our best players. 

Franck Kessie - 7.5 

Franck Kessie’s inclusion gave us the physical presence in the midfield that we longed for and he was great as well. 

Pierre Emerick Aubameyang - 2

Aubameyang had like 4-5 touches in the match and thus it would be wrong to judge him based on that.
