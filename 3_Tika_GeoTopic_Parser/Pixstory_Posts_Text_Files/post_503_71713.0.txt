White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci have no absolute answer when asked if omicron could be end of covid 19 pandemic. 
Dr Fauci said itâ€™s too soon to predict.

"It is an open question whether it will be the live virus vaccination that everyone is hoping for," Fauci said via videoconference at The Davos Agenda virtual event.

Yet, Fauci said there is still no guarantee. The only hope is no new variants appear. 

"I would hope that that's the case. But that would only be the case if we don't get another variant that eludes the immune response of the prior variant," he said.

Still, even if omicron does emerge as the final variant of Covid-19, it is unlikely that it would mean endgame for the virus entirely, Fauci said. Rather, it will remain present in society at an endemic level.

"Control means you have it present but it is present at a level that does not disrupt society," Fauci said. "That's my definition of what endemicity would mean."
