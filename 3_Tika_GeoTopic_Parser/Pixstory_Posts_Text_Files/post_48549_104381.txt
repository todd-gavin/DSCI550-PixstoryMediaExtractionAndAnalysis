This is so very offensive to label all Christians to be against Christ In fact no Christian is and if they are they re not Christians at all What the government has done has nothing to do with people like me We are just out here trying to do God s work without expecting anything in return Good work of American churches often go unnoticed by the masses due to the flawed politics of America Churches feed and clothe poor people A lot of churches run shelters for the homeless All in America Church members teach job skills or help immigrants learn English volunteer to provide foster care or offer tax preparation assistance They tutor schoolchildren and help them with their mental health What you made was a very generalized statement which has more to do with social evils than christians We are American Christians and we re proud of it
