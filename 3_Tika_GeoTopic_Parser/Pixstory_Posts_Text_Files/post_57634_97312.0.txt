On Thursday, Joe Biden asked Congress for $33 billion in funding for supporting Ukraine as the war entered a new phase. Amidst the unrelenting brutality of Russia in the war, this decision would help Ukraine in many ways.

A proposal was also announced to allow the US authorities to liquidate the assets of Russian oligarchs. It was further added that the money from the seized assets would be used in funding Ukraine. 
"The cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression will be more costly if we allow it to happen. So we either back Ukrainian people defending their country or stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities in Ukraine," Biden said.


The plan was further defined, explaining the division of money for assisting Ukraine.
Biden's funding request includes $20 billion in military assistance for Ukraine, $8.5 billion in economic aid and $3 billion in humanitarian assistance, among other pots of money, such as $500 million to support the production of U.S. crops to address the global food shock caused by the war.
