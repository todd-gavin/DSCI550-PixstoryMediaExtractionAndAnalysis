Vegemite on toast is a popular breakfast, lunch, or anytime snack that requires no effort. Vegemite, like British Marmite, is manufactured from yeast extract rather than vegetables. 

Any Australian will give you a different answer when it comes to the secret to the perfect vegemite on toast. Not only is the butter-to-vegemite ratio idiosynchratic, but so are additives like cheese, avocado, or honey. 

With that in mind, skyscanner recommends Core Espresso on Darby Street in Newcastle. Core Espresso recently gained national attention for providing deconstructed Vegemite toast, but this essentially means you can play around with the ingredients to your heart's content.
