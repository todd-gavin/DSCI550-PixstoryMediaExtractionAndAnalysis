Camila Giorgi&#39;s path to the WTA tournament in Eastbourne ends in the semifinals, the last tournament on grass before Wimbledon The Italian was clearly beaten by Jelena Ostapenko with the result of just over an hour of play The match was one-sided with Camila Giorgi in the throes of the competitive aggressiveness of the opponent who is good at responding best to all the jokes of the Italian who has not been able to play her game as she has done so far in the tournament The dream therefore stops one step away from the final which Ostapenko and Petra Kvitova will play winner of the other semifinal against the Brazilian Haddad Maia who came from games without defeat
