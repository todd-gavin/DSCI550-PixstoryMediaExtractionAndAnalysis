But as it happens in war, the euphoria was shortlived as we lost a SAP Jawan Kanhaiya Singh on 24th September, 2008, after a landmine blast on the main Rohtas-Adhaura road also near Soli in another operation. But that is the subject of another story since it later led to one of the the biggest operations carried out till date on the Kaimur Hills which then had been named as ‘Operation Vidhwansa’ having been carried out with meticulous planning in several phases with a large number of forces camping on the Hills for days together with all equipments including Satellite phones starting from the 4th October, 2008. 

This offensive was also followed by an exercise of involving the community in the policing activities which was named as Sone Mahotsava. The Community Policing Project which drew its inspiration from the rich history and heritage of the region was especially popular with the local population who later took it upon themselves to fight the influence of the Maoists with the assistance of the Police. 

Fire and the forest concluded.
