With day 5 of tonsillitis keeping me down, I find myself craving heavier soups. As I slowly recover, I can slowly move off a fully liquid diet, but solids are still off the table. This corn chowder is the perfect in-between, and it's so warm and comforting, it's like a hug in a bowl. 

Corn chowder is a chowder soup prepared using corn as a primary ingredient. Basic corn chowder is commonly made of corn, onion, celery, milk or cream, and butter. Additional ingredients sometimes used include potatoes or squash, salt pork, fish, seafood and chicken. In the United States, recipes for corn chowder date to at least as early as 1884. Corn chowder is mass-produced as a canned food in the U.S. But where's the fun in canned food? 

Today, I'm going to share with you my go to recipe for corn chowder. I've been making this recipe since 2007, yup, even before I hit double digits! This recipe is from a cookbook my father gifted me. Back in 2007, we were in different countries, so he sent this cookbook. I made as many recipes as a 7 year old me could to stay connected with him. I still have that cookbook to this day, and I still use it as much as possible.
