Love is something that comes to us all of a sudden when we least expect it . At times it's so sudden that we simply fail to understand that we are actually in love . It happened to us . It has happened to you too when you were lost , broken and chasing things . ðŸ’”ðŸ¥º

We think we are too broken to be mended but little did we realise that broken things can be beautiful too . Love is not about chasing , it's about cherishing . In the process of finding ourselves we realise that the love we share with our beloved is strong enough to bring the best out in us . We understood the fact that we don't complete but compliment each other . ðŸ’”

Love is not enough at times because love is about understanding not just your partner but yourself . It is to difference between what you needed and what you wanted . ðŸ¥ºðŸ’”

We fail to understand real love because more than once we get busy chasing a mirage . Lost and flawed and we hardly know how to keep up with the love that demands nothing but togetherness . ðŸ¥º

We get stubborn in love when we should just let it flow . The fire in Agastya matched the passion of Rumi but if love isn't about chasing then it isn't about confining too . Love is freedom, that sets you free . Sakshi taught Agasthya the true meaning of love and you realised love doesn't always mean being with each other . Rumi realised that too .

Love is to keep alive the passion for each other while nourishing our individuality . We should never chase nor confine it and that's when we realise love is all about being beautiful together even if broken . ðŸ¥ºðŸ’”
