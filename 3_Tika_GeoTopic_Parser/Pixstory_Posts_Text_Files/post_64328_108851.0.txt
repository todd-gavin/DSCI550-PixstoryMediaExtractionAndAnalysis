Our endeavor has been to ensure that law makers bring in nuanced legislation to deal with man-made disasters so that the perpetrators of future crimes of this nature are not spared by merely invoking Section 304 A IPC.
A petition for proposed legislation for prevention of manmade tragedies in public places was presented to the Union of India. In 2009, the Law Ministry forwarded AVUT’s petition to the Law Commission, directing it to come out with a law to deal with such disasters on priority basis. In 2012, the Law Commission published a consultation paper on dealing with man-made disasters. AVUT’s endeavor is to get this legislation passed on a priority basis.

AVUT in working for a Fire Safe Delhi has filed a PIL in August 2018 in the High Court of Delhi, with specific regard to deficiency in the manpower in Delhi Fire Service. The matter is pending adjudication.
