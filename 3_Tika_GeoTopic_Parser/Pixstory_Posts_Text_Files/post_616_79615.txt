Her melody her voice lives on A few days earlier when Lataji was admitted to hospital many people wrote about her memories There was a lot written about on this platform as well I realised all women irrespective of their age seem to have one song in their Lata playlist Lagja gale Everyone even young Girls seem to love that song It expresses love and deep emotions like nothing else The depth the yearning everything expressed in this song After listening to this song I wonder who did she fall in love I am sure she must have sometimes in her life The song will remain as an ever lasting anthem of love and she will be remembered always Rest In Peace nightingale
