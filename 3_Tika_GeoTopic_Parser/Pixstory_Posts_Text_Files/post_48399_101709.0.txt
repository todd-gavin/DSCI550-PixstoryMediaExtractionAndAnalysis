Got a tough day? That's all right. One of the sayings I believe in my life is that this too shall pass because I have felt it. The pain, sorrow, happiness everything will pass. New instances come by and you get to experience them yet again. So cry, laugh, and move on. Life can be complex but you can make it easy! 

Good day
