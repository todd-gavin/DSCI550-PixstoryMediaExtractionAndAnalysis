The beach is my favourite vacation spot. A beach vacation allows me to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Like many others, I yearn to hear the waves crashing on the beach and to feel the soft golden yellow sand beneath my feet. I adore going to the beach!
Batu Ferringhi is my favourite beach resort. I'd love to capture the scene on Batu Ferringhi beach on paper one day. Many activities are taking place in the sea and on the white sandy beach. People are out walking or picnicking under shady trees, children are collecting seashells on the beach, and some are building sandcastles. Regardless of what they say, everyone seems relaxed.
