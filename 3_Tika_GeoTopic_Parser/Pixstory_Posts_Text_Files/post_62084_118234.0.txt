Paulo Dybala has agreed to join Roma on a free transfer following their decisive move last night.

The Giallorossi did not want to lose out on the 28-year-old to the incredibly interested Napoli and so they made a desperate lunge last night, offering the Argentinian forward a three-year contract worth €6m net per season. This seems to have proved convincing enough, and Dybala is now on his way to the Eternal City.

As reported by Gianluca Di Marzio, Dybala has accepted Roma’s three-year contract offer and will soon become a part of Jose Mourinho’s squad. The transfer will be finalised in the coming days, with medicals likely to take place later this week.

The 28-year-old Argentinian forward will be an exciting addition to Mourinho’s frontline in Rome, being a hardworking and creative second striker who’ll likely work well with Tammy Abraham. In 293 appearances for Juventus, Dybala scored 115 goals and provided 48 assists
