I always hear unpaid internships pay you in experience but I just don't understand what kind of experience. Is it providing us with any more experience than a regular employee who gets paid? Is that why we should take it because we have an upper hand on the paid employee when it comes to experience? And does that experience guarantee a valuable job for us? Will it give us something extra ordinary?

The way employers or people who support unpaid internships talk about it, it sounds like humongous achievement. So if the experience is not as larger than life as it is described, why should one work for free at all?
