At least 6 people were killed and around 30 injured earlier today during the 4th of July parade in Chicago's Highland Park.

Highland Park police described the shooter as a Caucasian man between the ages of 18 and 20, with a small physique and "longer" black hair. Chris O'Neill, commander of the Highland Park Police, said that he is sporting a white or blue T-shirt.

Police identified the 22-year-old Robert "Bobby" E. Crimo III as the person of interest. He is thought to be operating a silver 2010 Honda Fit with an Illinois licence plate number DM80653. Crimo is regarded by police as "very dangerous" and armed. They're still looking for him.
