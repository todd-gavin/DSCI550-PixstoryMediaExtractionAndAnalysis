In a heartwarming moment a 12-year-old boy scored a goal for Shakhtar Donetsk in a charity match. After suffering from one of the worst periods of his life, Dmytro Keda got the opportunity to make his dream come true.


The young boy had to flee his hometown of Mariupol in Ukraine following the war. After spending three weeks in constant threat from the Russians, they managed to escape the city.


Later, the Mariupol boy got the opportunity of fulfilling his dream of playing for Shakhtar Donetsk. The 12-year-old was substituted in the final moments of the game against Lechia and he managed to score the winning goal for his team. 


As soon as Keda scored the goal all the players on the field including the ones in the opposition applauded Keda’s goal and even raised him on their shoulders in celebration. It was a beautiful moment commemorating the important goal of the tournament.


The match was a part of the Shakhtar Global Tour for Peace which featured teams like Olympiakos, Lechia, Fenerbahce and Hajduk Split. All the money earned due to the tournament will be donated for the welfare of the people of Ukraine after the Russian invasion.
