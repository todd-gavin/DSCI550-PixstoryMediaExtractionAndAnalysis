Every third Friday of the year is celebrated as Stop Cyber Bullying Day and people around the world use this day to make people aware of Cyber Bullying and how to tackle it.

Stop Cyber Bully Day is an annual event that brings millions of people together from around the world to celebrate and promote a truly diverse and inclusive internet.

To be honest, I didn’t know about Stop Cyber Bullying until footballers like Jordan Henderson, Declan Rice, Ben Mee, Harry Maguire and Kasper Schmeichel joined together with leading online abuse charity, The Cybersmile Foundation and creative agency ten toes to highlight the real-world implications of online abuse.

And the message from all the footballers is very clear which is, “It’s too easy to forget that words communicated online can have the same impact as words communicated online.”
