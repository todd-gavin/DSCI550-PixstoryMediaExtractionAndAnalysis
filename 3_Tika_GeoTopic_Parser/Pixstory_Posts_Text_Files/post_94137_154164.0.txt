[TW: Suicide, Death]That is when in 2016 YWP; started working on mental health awareness through numerous events, campaigns and accessibility to it. The four pillars that holds up the organisation are mental health awareness, acceptance of mental health by uprooting stigma, intervention and prevention. In 2017, the organisation got registered as a NGO under the Indian Trust Act, 1882. We have a peer support department which involves a group of psychology background candidates who are trained by professionals and they give mental health first aid for those people who seek support and help. The team has onboard professionals which include counselling psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists. They have been part of the department after an intricate process of selection. The organisation also offers the therapy at a subsidised cost for those who are really in need and also provides free sessions for those who join the organisation. The team comprises of 80 volunteers with 10 department heads guided by the two Founders. The organisation was successfully able to publish 10+ research papers till date. Those who want to get help could connect with them via email, Instagram as it is an online peer support. Till date, the majority of people who approach us have got support for various problems they face during their adolescent period such like education pressures from peers and family, relationship problems between parents and children and among partners, problems related to past traumas and how financial problems take toll on one's mental health. A word from Founders The usage of "committed suicide" needs to change as it seems a crime has been committed, the phrase is not a right. Instead we can say death because of suicide or death due to suicide .
