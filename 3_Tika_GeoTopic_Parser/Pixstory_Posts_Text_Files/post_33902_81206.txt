At the end of the match between Genoa and Salernitana, the Grifone coach Alexander Blessin spoke like this in the post-match press conference. and on the counterattack we took l For the boys to go to half-time it was tough We could have made it clear then we defended badly Maybe we were already with our thoughts in the locker room and instead we had to play for them with perhaps the only chance we had they scored we didn&#39;t defended well on that occasion In the first half but also in the second we won many balls The team fought and gave everything but we have to improve because when we take the ball we mustn&#39;t lose it On Destro there was a clear penalty not conceded but there was a clear tear in the jersey After seeing the picture it was a clear penalty I don&#39;t want the players to make theater if a player fell it was a penalty Right was disturbed he continued the play but the foul was clear I&#39;m so sorry because it makes me wonder why they didn&#39;t even ask the VAR I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t like these things The result doesn&#39;t satisfy me The point made in Rome we could have exploited with a win I&#39;m not happy with the result I don&#39;t live on the moon I know very well the standings and the points we have My team gave everything for me it deserved the win We conceded a few goal chances to Salernitana and that gives me a positive feeling about the team There are still matches we will never give up As long as there is hope we will give everything to save ourselves Credits profile picture twitter Genoa
