There is no disputing that cell phones are now a necessity than a luxury. In actuality, life is unimaginable without a phone. I do think everyone should have them but it also concerns me when I see kids so absorbed in them that they forget to do anything else. And it's not just studying they compromise on but even the basic things like eating or playing outside.

Even in schools, cell phones have become more of a thing for competitiveness than something you'd use for emergencies. Recently, the issue of whether or not to allow cell phones in schools has gained a lot of attention. I wanted to know all yours thoughts on it. Do you think phones should be allowed in schools?
