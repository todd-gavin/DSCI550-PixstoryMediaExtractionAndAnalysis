‌Recent images that have emerged pose many questions to the UK residents? It clearly shows that contrary to what Boris Johnson claimed there has been a party as the image shows wine in Johnson's hand, and food on the table, Johnson is standing in a circle with at least eight officials pictured-no social distancing followed-that too in a time when the social gathering was banned. 
‌
‌The first question to be addressed is Why hasn't he been fined for this? He was not given a fixed-penalty notice by the Metropolitan police for attending this gathering. He has been issued a £50 penalty for a different gathering, his birthday party on 19 June 2020-this event happened on 13 November 2020.
‌
‌The possible explanation offered by Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, on Tuesday was that Johnson had just come to raise a toast to Lee Cain, his retiring head of communications, whose leaving celebration it was. According to Guardian, some of them present in the event said that Johnson instigated the event and he was present throughout. 
‌
‌Some say this is not even a party- well that's not the people gathered and the raised glasses, and a table littered with bottles of wine and spirits, plus takeaway food reveals. Not to forget the law we had at that time, during England’s 28-day “circuit-breaker” lockdown, allowed indoor gatherings of people not in the same household under only a handful of conditions, mainly very particular ones such as funerals, wakes, and in situations where children live between two homes. Even to work meetings which this doesn't seem to be, there should be a clear gap of two meters maintained.
