Hot take feminism is not really about men This movement has always been about whoever needs it about marginalised genders basically That does not include cis men for the simple reason that they are not oppressed worldwide on account of their identity as men That does not mean that feminists are saying that men can t have a hard life or be subject to various other oppressive forces it just means that women and non binary people have been historically viewed as inferior and if you believe in justice it stands to reason that we would need a movement to combat the pernicious sexism that leads to things like rape culture or the gender wage gap Alas feminism is one of those words that has now become so divorced from its original meaning thanks to right wing distortion and consistent bad faith misreading
