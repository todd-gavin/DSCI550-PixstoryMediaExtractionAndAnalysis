Volodymyr Zelensky is quite in the news for a while now since the Russia Ukraine conflict. He has caught a lot of people's interests so far. Let's talk a little about him, shall we?

Before the commencement of his political career, Zelensky was a comedian all over the Ukraine TV shows. Not only that, he was also a dancer who actually won the Ukraine's Dancing with the Stars contest. Alongside, he worked as a voice actor, and an actor in the show called, 'Servant of the People.' 

Only after that in 2019 did he run for presidency! That's how much people liked his show, and his party was called, 'Servant of the People,' obviously! Not only that, he also does have a law degree! Come on, what an all-rounder!
