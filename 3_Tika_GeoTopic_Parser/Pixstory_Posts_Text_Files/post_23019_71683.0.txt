Manchester United men’s team fans must have heard this question alot - HOW CAN MANCHESTER UNITED UNLOCK PAUL POGBA? 
My answer would be - " Sign a Hayley Ladd-esque player"

Now let’s shift our focus to the women’s team and maybe rewind our clocks back to the second half of the 2020/21 season. United’s CDM Hayley Ladd was struggling with fitness; she was unavailable for the league game vs Brighton which United lost 1-0. This loss resulted in United eventually missing out on the top 3 of the FAWSL and as a result UWCL football for next season. 

Against low blocks, you need a CDM so that your full backs, along with the wingers, can stretch the defense out wide which would give your midfielders and strikers to take advantage of the space. Brighton player a low block in that game and United failed to penetrate it.

Now, I know that she was one of the many players who were unavailable for that fixture but Ladd is a player who United need for each and every game as they do not have an alternative to Ladd in the midfield. 

Fast forward to the start of the 2021/22 season; new manager Marc Skinner found it difficult to field a balanced midfield due to which Ladd did not start for the first few games. United found it difficult to fire all guns blazing because in the absence of a CDM, Skinner had to field an XI with a double pivot which hampered United’s chances upfront. Fast forward to December 2021 - Hayley Ladd is getting regular gametime & the team are looking positive. 

United are currently on a 4 game winning streak, having kept a clean sheet in all of those games. So what made United improve? The inclusion of Ladd. 

Hayley's inclusion is a calming presence in the midfield as players like Zelem who struggled in the absence of Ladd, look rejuvenated now just because they can play their natural game without having to play the role of a CDM.
