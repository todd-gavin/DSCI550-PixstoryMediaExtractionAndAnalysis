Like the coming of taliban there are many other things that happened in my life that break me into pieces 💔 make me hate my self, hopeless!! But I accept it as a bad experience, as a part of my life and just move on I didn’t let that feeling destroy the other chapter of my life because there is no one to love u but just yourself! 
Love yourself, be king to yourself 
You need you! 💝

📍What has shown most in recent months is the Taliban's treatment of women. The Taliban have challenged the presence of women in many political, social, economic and educational activities. Girls' schools have been virtually closed in many provinces, and women active in the cultural and social spheres and the media have become unemployed and homeless.

The emergence of these problems for this segment of society has been very difficult and has been accompanied by reactions. But apart from discussing women's demands, Afghan women today are not happy mentally and emotionally.
