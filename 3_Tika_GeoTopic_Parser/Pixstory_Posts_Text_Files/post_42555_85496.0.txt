“Spirit of India,” it’s the name of the restaurant in the movie, and these three words perfectly matched the vibes of the movie. Director Manjari Makijany is known for the movies where she explores the Indian Culture but with the touch of Hollywood in it.
The movie starts with the scene where Rhea (Avantika Vandanapu) is working in her family restaurant with her father (Abhay Deol as Arvind), Grandmother (Meera Syal as Asha), and with her little brother (Aryan as Rohan). 
The story entered in the first act when a new guy in High school named Max (Micheal Bishop) becomes a friend of Rhea because of their mutual interest in Dj. They started making music for the Holi festival but somehow things fall apart between Rhea, Max, and Arvind. 
Now, Rhea’s grandmother and her friends (Molly, Watson, and Ginger) motivated her to make music and convince her to take participate in a DJ contest (Battle of the Beatmaster). 
Will Rhea take part in the competition, Will things get sorted out between Rhea and her father, Will Rhea listen to her inner voice and do what she wants to do? To get all of the answers you have to watch this movie. 
Things I liked about the movie are:- 
1. The music of the movie is very good and will soothe your heart. 
2. A few scenes where we got to know more about (how to use the DJ equipment) are very well shown. 
Things I didn’t like about the movie are:- 
1. The sequence of the DJ competition is very dull and never gives you the adrenaline rush you want. 
2. If the movie becomes predictable then many people will lose interest and will start checking their phones. Predictability is a big no for me. 
3. To attract the Indian audience, the director made the character too Bollywood-ish and actors got nothing much to do in the movie.
If you want to watch something light-hearted content with a mix of Bollywood and good music in it then you should watch ‘Spin’. You can watch ‘Spin’ Disney+ Hotstar.
