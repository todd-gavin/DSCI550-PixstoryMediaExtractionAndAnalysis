Christianity teaches good, some of it. But it cannot be ignored that like most abrahamic religions, it has been relentlessly cruel to fellow christians and non christians. And no, I'm not talking only about how a vast majority of its expansion happened through violence, colonization and persecution – which makes it one of the most violent religions in the world – but also what's written in the scriptures.

Angels will cast anyone who does not follow God into the fire (Matthew 13, 41–42).

Jesus did not come to bring harmony, but division, according to Luke 12:51–53.

Acts 5, 1–10: God terrorises a couple for keeping some money after selling their land.

Those who are haughty or boastful, or who defy parents, homosexuals and others are all worthy of death, according to Romans 1, 24–32. People who do not do these acts but support those who do are also guilty.

God will send severe delusions so that we will not believe and will be doomed, according to II Thessalonians 2, 11–12.

Only death may bring forgiveness, according to Hebrews 9:13–22.

I Peter 3:20: God wiped out the world with a flood, except for eight people. Noah and the ark aren't merely found in the Old Testament.

Revelation 4:11 says that God created everything for his own enjoyment. Hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanoes, parasites, illnesses, cancer, and AIDS are just a few examples of what he created merely for his enjoyment. Everything was created by God and for God's delight.

God's chosen are predestined (Ephesians 1, 4–5 & 11). There is no such thing as free will. There is no way to make amends. Before the world was created, your fate was decided. Your doom or salvation was decided long before you were born.
