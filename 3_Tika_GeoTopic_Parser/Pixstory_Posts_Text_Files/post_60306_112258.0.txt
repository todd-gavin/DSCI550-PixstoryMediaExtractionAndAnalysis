On Day 2 of the postponed fifth Test against England, Jasprit Bumrah, the batter, was in full destruction mode as he crushed Stuart Broad for a 35-run over.

In the 84th over of India's innings, Bumrah went all out against Broad, hammering the England bowler to all parts of the park for 29 runs while Broad also delivered five wides and a no-ball.

Broad currently holds the unfair record for most runs allowed in an over in the history of Test cricket.

By one run, Bumrah broke the mark set by the famous Brian Lara (28 runs in an over), which stood for 18 years.

In a Test match against South Africa in 2003â€“04, Lara scored 28 runs off left-arm spinner Robin Peterson, including four fours and two sixes off six legal deliveries.
