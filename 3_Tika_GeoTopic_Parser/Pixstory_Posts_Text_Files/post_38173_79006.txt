The Marina Machans were looking set for their first ever win against East Bengal but a late goal from Lalrinliana Hnamte broke the hearts of the Chennaiyin FC fans The draw leaves Chennaiyin with points from games and in th position The Blues started the Indian Super League season strongly with two wins from their opening two games The acute defending and key wins had certainly made head coach Bozidar Bandovic a fan favourite in the eyes of the Chennaiyin F C fans But recent results have seen the fans turn on the head coach From a lack of goals to not playing key players it looks like the recent results have made Mr Bandovic clueless Everything just looks like a repeat of last season when Csaba Lazlo s side faced the same difficulties And with just games remaining for the Marina Machans the task of making the playoff looks a lot tougher Bare in mind everything is still in Chennaiyin FC s hands but the Blues have to start stringing wins together if they need to qualify for the top four CFCs next games are up against Mumbai City FC FC Goa Odisha FC Jamshedpur FC Kerala Blasters and ATK Mohun Bagan Hence there is no easy game remaining for the Marina Machans Chennaiyin would have to at least win four out of their six games to have a realistic chance of making it to the playoffs but even then their negative goal difference would not help Vladimir Koman is the highest scorer for CFC with just goals But the midfielder was injured in the game against East Bengal and it is not known when he would return The signing of Lukasz has been disappointing to say the least and Nerijus Valskis is yet to score since making his highly anticipated return to Chennaiyin So who is going to score the goals against Mumbai City FC Is Mr Bandovic going to rely on Suhail and Ninthoi again Or will Joby Justin finally be given a chance
