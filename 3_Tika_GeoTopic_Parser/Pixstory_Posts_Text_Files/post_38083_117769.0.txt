Cristiano Ronaldo is looking to leave Manchester United in the summer. Bayern Munich has emerged as one of the favourites to sign the Portuguese international. But as per their CEO Oliver Kahn, things don't look very positive for the Number Seven! 

Oliver Kahn talked about Bayern's possible new arrivals at a recent conference with the media. The former Bayern goalkeeper said, "Cristiano Ronaldo too, right!? We’ll have more talks, we’ll see. Transfer window is open for some time."

The former German international would then add, "As highly as I rate Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the greatest, a transfer wouldn't be a fit with our philosophy." Hence Kahn made it clear that it is unlikely that Bayern Munich would sign Ronaldo. 

However, with Robert Lewandowski gone, Bayern Munich do need a focal point in their attack. Ronaldo is someone who can easily fill the gap and get as many goals, if not even more than Lewandowksi. 

Ronaldo wants to leave United as the Red Devils have failed to qualify for the Champion League this season. To add to this, the Portuguese star also feels that the English club would not be challenging for the league title this year. However, United manager Erik Ten Hag has come out and stated that Ronaldo is in his plans for next season. Hence it has to be seen what would happen in the next few weeks.
