It's unclear who exactly popularized sharing blurry photos with followers, but in 2021, other celebrities, including Beyoncé⚡, Dua Lipa😍, Harry Styles 💜, Ariana Grande❤️‍🔥 and Olivia Rodrigo🥹 have all followed the trend.
The pandemic changed the way people use social media😌, and while Instagram is still a place for occasional glamorous, filtered photos🖼️📸, now more than ever people are finding joy in intentionally posting flawed content.🌀 In 2021, Instagram users openly find comfort in trauma memes🫣, casually assemble random photo dumps📸  and showing their true selves on main.❤️‍🔥
 I put up one of my blur photos which is one my favourite .🤌🏻
Hope you liked it !!!💕
Do tell me in the notes and share your blurred photos.😍🌀
