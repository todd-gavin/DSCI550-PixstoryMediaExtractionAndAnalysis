If you found yourself on Twitter last month after Elon Musk announced he’d secured a deal to buy the social media platform for $US44 billion ($A61.4 billion), you might have seen the latest iteration of one meme-able phrase doing the rounds: “Men will literally [insert action] instead of going to therapy.”

In the case of the world’s richest man, the “action” was some version of “buy a $44 billion dollar app”.

Past versions of the sentence have joked that men “will literally spend two decades trying to colonise Mars” (another Musk reference); “invent Facebook”; “dress up like a bat and fight criminals and costumed villains by night” or “watch hours of James Gandolfini going to therapy” instead of talking to a trained mental health professional themselves.

The phrase, which has gained traction over the past two years, is a signal of how much of a “deal breaker” a partner who attends therapy has become in modern dating.

Take, for example, recent data from popular dating app Hinge, which found that 86 per cent of singles were more likely to go on a second date with someone who, on the first date, mentioned they saw a therapist, and 97 per cent would prefer to date someone who actively takes care of their mental health.

The prompts allow singles to finish sentences like “therapy recently taught me …”, “I feel more supported when …” and “my self-care routine is …” and add them to their profile.

“We’ve found that Hinge singles have learned to take their mental health more seriously, which for many means seeking out therapy,” Logan Ury told The Oz.

“Singles who are prioritising more meaningful connections now want to find someone who has ‘done the work’ and is ready to connect in a deeper, more authentic way.”

The theory is that a man who has seen (or is seeing) a therapist is more emotionally open, more willing to communicate, and not so steeped in the culture of toxic masculinity that he sees therapy as a weakness.
