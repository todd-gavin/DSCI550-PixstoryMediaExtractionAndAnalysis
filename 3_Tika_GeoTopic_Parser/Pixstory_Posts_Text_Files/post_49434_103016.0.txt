213 mass shootings have taken place in America in 2022, out of which 27 were school shootings. Let that sink in. 213 shootings just in the first four months of 2022. Do we not see the problem? (Souce: https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting )

America's gun laws are messed up, and on top of that is the argument that "we need good guys with guns to stop bad guys with guns." More I think about it, more it infuriates me. Where were the 'good guys with guns' during all of it? America has a history of school shootings. The U.S. ended 2021 with 693 mass shootings, per the Gun Violence Archive. The year before saw 611. And 2019 had 417.

And even after all of this, our police is not prepared to deal with an occurrence like this? Schools have shooting drills, students are prepared for it – which is unfortunate to say the least – teachers are prepared for it but the police still stays back?

It's not an unfortunate incident, it's a systemic failure. Our cops are coward, an army of them couldn't go after one young boy barging into a school with a gun. It is shameful and embarrassing and it costed little children and teachers their lives. Countless of them throughout our history.

It just doesn't make sense why they were not trained for this. And there's only one answer to it : because they don't care. Police exists to oppress us, not protect us. They will kill a black man for speeding, they will kill women for having an abortion, they will kill mentally ill folks but dangerous criminals is who they give a pass?
