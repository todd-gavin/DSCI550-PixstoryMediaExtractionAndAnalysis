Toxic help.Have you ever heard about this phrase. At a recent event, I met a therapist and asked her how would talking to a therapist be any different than talking to a friend. She told me something very interesting that how someone close to you can help but the help will be toxic. Like how people tell you snap out of it, it’s ok happens to everyone, I have seen worse, compromise. It is really true. I recently told someone I am not well. Instead of asking what the problem was pat came a reply. “Let go, blah blah blah.” Hello really . I am not well means, I have had headaches, health issues which needed crazy, scary investigations, some are still pending. So people before giving advice, snap out and know the real issue. I know all of us love to dole out gyan, but it’s not needed all the time. Sometimes we need matter of fact things. Like asking the other person what happened, what he or she actually means before jumping the gun. How many of us have gone through situations like this . When you are screaming to be heard by your loved ones and they are on their own trip. Giving you anecdotal evidences how you are magnifying your problems- however unrealistic the analogies are . We all do this . To the people we love. To our children particularly, belittling their struggles, telling them we know better, tell them how we have dealt with worse . Sometimes I feel while your family and friends are very very important but a professional can surely be a better help. So next time if someone tells you he/she is “not well” stop giving your gyan, he or she might not be actually well.
