Talking about my reading habbits let me tell you some great sources for reading online. I have a very few hardcopies of books, I only buy the books that I've already read (online/borrowing) which I loved so much so that I can reread it again and again so I buy my own copy of that book. According to me the pros of reading online far outweighs the cons of it (if there's even any cons). Also the reason I started reading online in the first place and got addicted to it is, it is accessible to everyone. Everyone who knows how to use internet and knows how to read that is.
So some resources to access books online and see great content is listed below, trust me there is far better content online then you'll see anywhere, if you know how to find it.

Wattpad. So while surfing the internet my 15 year old self found this gem and I'm still using it. There are a great many stories from some great writers as well as amateurs. If you think it doesn't have good content then you haven't dived deep enough. You have to look for great content like a needle in a haystack but it's all worth it. Also there are story in many languages, I'm currently addicted to a Polish one.

Kindle. You think you have to pay to use kindle? That's just not true. Browse Goodreads and find a book you want to read and download it from internet in .mobi format.

Audiboi. It's like audible which contains audiobooks but have free content. You'll love the experience of audio books.

Webtoon. Best app ever if you like graphic novels and korean light novels cause most official webtoons in this are based on korean light novels or translated. 

NovelUpdates. Great place to find asian novels(Japanese/Chinese/Kr etc). These contain fan translation and also official translations.

This is it for today's post. Thank you.
