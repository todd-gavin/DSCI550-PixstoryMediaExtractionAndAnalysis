From 2001 to 2012, Manchester United had many vintage defenders, and ten of them stood out above the rest. They have produced iconic midfielders, and some of them have left their mark on
the club.
United have a long history of producing world-class players at every position; this article highlights one of the best midfielders from 2001 who has had many memorable moments withthe club. The top ten players who have played in the centre of the park at Old Trafford are listed
below.
10 Bruno Fernandes
Manchester United were looking for a playmaker who could pull all the strings from the middle ofthe park and play alongside Pogba, whose game was fading with the passage of time. United signed Bruno Fernandes from Sporting, and the move paid off: in his first season, he ended upscoring 12 goals, and the following season, he scored 28 goals and was named player of the month.
He is now one of the most essential midfielders, having made 134 appearances and scoring 51 goals as a playmaker.
9 Paul Pogba
Pogba had a tumultuous relationship with the club; during his first stint, he didn't get much playing time and was eventually sold to Juventus. Manchester United broke their transfer record in 2016 when they paid Â£89 million to bring French midfielder back to Old Trafford. However, he was fantastic in his first season before falling down the hierarchy pyramid due to injuries.
Pogba was crucial in many games and had a significant impact; he scored in the Europa League final in 2017, as United won the trophy, and he was named UEFA Europa League Player of the Season. He left the club in an unusual manner after making 226 appearances and scoring 36 goals.
