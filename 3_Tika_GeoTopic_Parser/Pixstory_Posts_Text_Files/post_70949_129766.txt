It is very difficult to assess the actual damage done to human psyche by Anurag Kashyap s latest creation Anurag Kashyap s USP is his deep rooted affinity to the violent hinterland of North India where guns rule over the vast stretches of godforsaken parched bloodthirsty land Into this trigger happy No Country For Old Men that Kashyap created over the years came the soft gentle supple tender Manmarziyaan in Anurag Kashyap and his Manmarziyaan leading lady Taapsee Pannu are back together with Dobaaraa okay I promise no more dobaaraa entendres This time the end result though again relatively free from the Kashyapian quality of violence is far less satisfying than Manmarziyaan In fact Dobaaraa is pretty much catastrophic and by far the most garbled incoherent film that Kashyap has thrashed out in his illustrious career Where does Dobaaraa not go wrong That is a much tougher question to answer than the reverse The degrees of plunging fortunes that Dobaaraa experiences in the course of its two hour fifteen minute running time are epic The film alas is far from epic The very basis of the time travel theme is shaky A boy witnesses a murder in his neighbour s home at exactly am hence Do Baaraa get it What follows from there is indescribably tragic in ways that have nothing to do with the characters So what is Dobaaraa about This question may take hours perhaps days or even weeks and months to answer For all we know Dobaaraa may one day be recognized as one of the great classics of world cinema But let s not jump and here comes Kashyap s favourite instrument of creativity the gun Future interpretations notwithstanding Dobaaraa seems to be a monstrous misfire with Taapsee Pannu struggling to lend a semblance of credibility to a screenplay that jumps from the era of the VCR to the laptop without humour or irony Antara Pannu is connected via an old television set with a boy named Anay who wears Terminator T shirts and snoops around an adulterous neighbour s home whose door is always ajar in spite of the murderous activities inside Dobaaraa is near bankrupt in vision and humour It s all meant to be taken dead seriously even when Taapsee Pannu playing a nurse with a nose ring shows up on screen as Taapsee Pannu playing a doctor without a nose ring
