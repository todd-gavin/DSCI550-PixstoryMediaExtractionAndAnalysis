I don t even feel the need to explain this song This is self explanatory Feminists are angry we have the right to be The things we go through every day of our lives men wouldn t survive for a week Have you ever walked a little faster After midnight when you re all alone Have you ever pulled your jacket tighter While pretending that you re on the phone Have you ever held your tongue When someone tried to call you baby If you say a word he s gonna call you crazy Well I have and she has too We all know that it s not all men We all know that it s not all men But it s some of them So we hold our breath baby nonetheless We say no but they still hear yes Blame our clothes and it s not all men But it s all women So we hold our breath baby nonetheless Have you ever blamed yourself for drinking Thinking maybe you re the reason why Have they ever said that you were lying Cause he s handsome and he s way too nice Have you ever felt like you were beaten but they left no bruises If you tell the truth they say his life is ruined Well I have and she has too We all know that it s not all men We all know that it s not all men But it s some of them So we hold our breath baby nonetheless We say no but they still hear yes Blame our clothes and it s not all men But it s all women So we hold our breath baby nonetheless And their words are like a bad tattoo Too prude She was asking for it Trust issues bad news She was fucking boring She was such a whore and ugly in the morning And it s not all men but it s all women But it s all but it s all women But it s all but it s all women Morgan St Jean
