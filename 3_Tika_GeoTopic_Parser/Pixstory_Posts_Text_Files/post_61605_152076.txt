In a recent sit down interview with Mas Lucha in Mexico City Distrito Federal Mexico Andrade spoke I learned about the gossip initially via social media with many headlines saying The guy fought this guy and all that Everyone usually stays in the same hotel on Wednesday for Dynamite until the Thursday after I trained in the gym and then a guy reached out to me and asked if I had heard about the altercation and I was like What When What happened I learned that there was an issue between Kenny Omega amp CM Punk The two of them have always greeted me well and I got nothing bad to say about them and the same thing goes for The Young Bucks Matt amp Nick Jackson They are all good with me but I did have one issue with a wrestler I am going to say his name it was Sammy Guevara I had an issue with him because he once came to the locker room and complained that we hit him too hard It s wrestling solve it in the ring If I hit hard hit me hard too I learned that he came in and that he accused me like a little girl After I learned about it I spoke to him and asked if he had an issue with me but he said he did not and that s all there was to it It s funny because not even in WWE For example Sheamus likes to hit and all my respect for him because he loves to hit hard and loves the strikes He is wild Even The Miz likes to throw strikes Not even John Cena complained about me so if he did not complain imagine this kid who is just starting but there s that Shortly after the interview Guevara tweeted You are a jobber A favor hire Be grateful bitch though it was not clarified if this was in response to Andrade s comments
