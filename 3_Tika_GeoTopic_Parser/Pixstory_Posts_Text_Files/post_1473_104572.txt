I can t decide which is the best part of a holiday being on holiday or coming back and discovering amazing things you merely passed by At the costa de la luz in the white andalusian town of Rota is a delightful path of poetry great poets of andalusia hometown heroes ines and their words on the walls as you stroll along the historic parts of town Poetry belongs to the streets they say It s not all roses and geraniums as the photos will have you believe I have discovered that some of these greats evolved from anarchists and political revolutionaries into tacit supporters of dictatorships to stay alive I have decided btw looking out into the atlantic ocean as the sun sets is the best thing to do on a holiday
