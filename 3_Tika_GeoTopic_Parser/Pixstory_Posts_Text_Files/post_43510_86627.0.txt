When it comes to the K-Pop industry, sometimes it can be seen through rose tinted glasses. Below all of the glitz and glamor that is seen on the screen, the life of an idol is tough, and the difficulties and pressures start from being a trainee.

One of those groups that has been through it all is BIGBANG. BIGBANG has been around for years after debuting with YG Entertainment in 2006, the group has still witnessed the harsh realities of being an idol and the pressures that come with it.
One person who has recently been vocal about the industry is BIGBANG'S T.O.P.
Recently, T.O.P sat down for an interview with Prestige Online, where he spoke honestly about the hardships in his life, the impact of art, and the future of BIGBANG. The musician also spoke about the issues within the K-Pop industry, and many believe it might have been the reason for him leaving YG Entertainment earlier this year.
