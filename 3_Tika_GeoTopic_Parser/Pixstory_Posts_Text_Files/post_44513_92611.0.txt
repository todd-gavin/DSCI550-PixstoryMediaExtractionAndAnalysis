Shinji Kagawa says that Sir Alex Ferguson's unexpected retirement has left an impression on
him during his brief stint with Manchester United.

The Japanese international joined from Borussia Dortmund, where he was well regarded during
his time there. In his debut season with the Premier League giants, Kagawa appeared in 26
games. Ferguson, though, ended his managerial career shortly after that great campaign.

After guiding United to another Premier League triumph, the Scot chose to step down after
nearly two decades in command. When David Moyes took over, he continued to use the
playmaker, but the thrill of working with Ferguson had worn off, and the 33-year-old returned to
Dortmund barely two years later.

Ferguson had worked hard to entice Kagawa from Germany, and he was eager to learn from
him. His departure, and the way in which it occurred, was unexpected by the players, and it left
the Japan international wondering what would have been.

He said to De Morgen: "I had the honor of working with Ferguson for a year, which was an
incredible experience. I hoped to work with him for a longer period of time, but fate had other
plans.

"I didn't realize it at the time, but I was working with such a legend. Now I have a much better
understanding of who he is. To be honest, I enjoyed my first year at Manchester United. We won
the title, although it was mostly due to Robin van Persie's endeavors.

"The transfer to England was not always simple, and there were occasions when I had
uncertainties. A new language, system, coach, and atmosphere are all being introduced.
Ferguson departed after my first year, something I had not anticipated”.

The difficulties that United has faced since Ferguson's departure have been obvious to
everybody.

Their highest Premier League result since Alex’s departure is second, however they've ended
outside the top four on several occasions under various managers.
