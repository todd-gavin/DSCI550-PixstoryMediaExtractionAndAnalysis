 A new addition to the Planet of the Apes franchise is on its way. The new film titled ‘Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ will pick up several years after the conclusion of the events of 2017’s ‘War for the Planet of the Apes’. Taking to their social media, the official page for the movie revealed both the first look as well as the cast and release date for the film.
They wrote on their Instagram page “A new saga begins. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” picking up many years after “War for the Planet of the Apes,” starts production next month and stars Owen Teague, Freya Allen, and Peter Macon. Directed by Wes Ball, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” arrives in 2024.”
Production is said to be starting soon with director Wes Ball. Josh Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Patrick Aison will write the script.“Planet of the Apes is one of the most iconic and storied science fiction franchises in film history, as well as being an indelible part of our studio’s legacy,” said 20th Century Studios president, Steve Asbell.
“With Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, we are privileged to continue the series’ tradition of imaginative, thought-provoking cinema, and can’t wait to share Wes’ extraordinary vision for this new chapter with audiences in 2024.”
Unfortunately no other significant details about the film have been made public, with its plot being kept tightly under wraps at this time, it is also unknown whether Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will directly connect to Caesar and his apes or tell some other story altogether.
Planet of the Apes, based on the epic 1963 science fiction novel by Pierre Boulle, was first adapted for the screen in the 1968 film starring Charlton Heston, which became a sci-fi icon and spawned four sequels and two TV series. Tim Burton directed a 2001 reboot, and Fox relaunched the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. To date, the films have grossed $1.7 billion globally.
