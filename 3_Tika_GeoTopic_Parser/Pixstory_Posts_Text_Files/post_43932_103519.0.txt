Roma are willing to listen to offers for midfielder Jordan Veretout - who is linked to Premier League clubs Newcastle United and Tottenham. The Italian club are willing to let Veretout go for as little as Â£8.5million. While the midfielder has a contract up until 2024 at the club, Mourinho is ready to let the midfielder go.

The ex-Villa player featured for Roma 50 times this season, scoring 4 goals and assisting 10 goals. The midfielder enjoys a respectable career at Roma, having joined from Italian side Fiorentina on loan in 2019 and then permanently in 2020. He has been involved with 38 goals for the club in 131 appearances and has been capped for France 5 times.

Veretout would be a valuable addition to both teams. At Spurs, he would be unlikely to start but would provide quality cover as the squad would be competing across multiple fronts.

However, Veretout would be sure to start at Newcastle, and the prospect of joining a club with serious financial firepower could be an exciting prospect as well.

Newcastle were able to change their fortunes with midfield signing Bruno Guimares and would be hoping history repeats itself with the signing of Veretout.

Would Veretout consider Tottenham or Newcastle to be the more appealing destination? Only time will tell.
