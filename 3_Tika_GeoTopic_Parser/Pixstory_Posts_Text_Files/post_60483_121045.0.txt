tvN’s new Wednesday-Thursday drama “Adamas” held a press conference online on the afternoon of July 26th. Director Park Seung-woo, Ji Sung, Seo Ji-hye, Lee Soo-kyung and Heo Sung-tae attended the event.

“Adamas” tells the story of twin brothers fighting against evil to unveil the truth behind a murder that happened 22 years ago in order to clear charges of their biological father, who was accused of killing their stepfather.
Ji Sung plays a dual role, the bestselling mystery novel writer Ha Woo-shin and the Central District’s special forces prosecutor Song Soo-hyun, who have identical appearance but opposite approaches in what they do. Seo Ji-hye transforms into Eun Hye-soo, the only daughter of a hospital director, who is said to have grown up as “a flower in a greenhouse”.

Ji Sung and Seo Ji-hye reunited through “Adamas” after MBC’s drama “Kim Su-ro”, which aired in 2010.
Ji Sung said with a smile, “It’s been 10 years since we last met each other. We’ve been healthy and doing well for the past 10 years, so it’s nice to see each other again. It feels new.”
Seo Ji-hye boasted their extraordinary chemistry, “It’s not easy to work with each other twice. It was nice to meet him after a long time. It felt comfortable, and I think there must have been a synergy effect.”
Upon hearing this, Ji Sung praised, “The reaction when we acted together in the past came out. It was so great. But still, standing in front of the camera was Eun Hye-soo. That alluring charm seemed to tell the time. Ji-hye’s appearance was so beautiful.”
