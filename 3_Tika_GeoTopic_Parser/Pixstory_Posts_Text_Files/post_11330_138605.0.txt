What you eat can determine your looks, feelings, and overall wellbeing.
But how do you improve your nutrition? You probably already know that you need to eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, but you might be looking for small ways you can be healthier.
Here are seven easy ways to improve your diet and overall nutrition today.
1 Choose Whole Grain over White Bread ; 
One choice you can make to start eating healthier today is by choosing to eat whole grain over white bread. Did you know that white bread doesn’t contain all the nutrients that a grain kernel has? White bread contains endosperm (a type of starch) but lacks whole grain bread’s natural vitamins, nutrients, fiber, proteins, and fats. With these health benefits in mind, you can see why simply switching your bread from white to whole grain can help you eat healthier

Another way you can start being healthier today is by cooking more meals at home.
