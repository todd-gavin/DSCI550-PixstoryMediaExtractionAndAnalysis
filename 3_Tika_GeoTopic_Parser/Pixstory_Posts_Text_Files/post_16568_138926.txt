An entertainment news report in Andra Box Office states that there s absolutely no question of Vijay Deverakonda returning a single penny of his remuneration to anyone as he has anyway taken no more than a minimum advance on the film as he had expected it to be a huge superhit at the box office just like everybody else associated with Liger So the star was banking more on getting a major share of the profits which was alas not to be The report categorically states that anything to the contrary is absolutely fake as Vijay s case is similar to that of Aamir Khan in Laal Singh Chaddha with both losing their time and money and their effort going down the drain
