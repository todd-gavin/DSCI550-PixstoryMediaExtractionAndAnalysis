La Joya, last night said good bye to Juventus as it was his last game at home for The Old Lady.
During his tenure for Juventus he has managed to score 115 Goals and rake in 48 assists. He is the  9th highest top scorer in history of the club. He won 5 Serie A League titles and also 4 Coppa Titles along with 3 Supercoppa. He leaves the club as a legend and his name will always be remembered by the fans. As this chapter ends he'll have to decide which club he'll join the next season.

Dybala was in all tears as he bid farewell to the fans and everyone were on their feet applauding the player.
