It is very fashionable to make President Trump look bad all the time. People seem to keep forgetting that he's done more good for America than most leaders. But then again, it's also the easiest way to get clout and popularity.
Like I mentioned in one of my other posts, the president has drawn international attention to China's imperial ambitions, human rights violations, and role in allowing the coronavirus to escape from Wuhan. Trump has also demonstrated how the WHO's ties to Beijing exacerbated the problem.
They like to make him look like a villain, look like the worst person to have ever descended the face of Earth but the truth is that in their own unique ways, millions of Americans have profited greatly from the Trump administration. Military veterans agree that the Trump administration has significantly improved the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Great American Outdoors Act has allowed for long-overdue park maintenance and enhancements, which have been made feasible by the Great American Outdoors Act. Those convicted for nonviolent offences or who have incarcerated family members applauded the First Step Act's reforms.
People constantlyÂ  claim that they don't care a damn about Mr Trump, yet the obsession never seems to end.
