Hunger in the South

By Pablo Neruda 

"Woe in the charcoals of Lota, I see:

The dishonored chileno in a black corrugation

Rifling the bitter recesses,

Dying or living, born to the pitiless cinder

In a posture of kneeling, felled

Between bogs and black powder,

As a world might create and undo itself,

For only a winter's survival of coughing,

Or the step of a horse through the pitch-colored water,

where lately

The perishing knives of the stripped eucalyptus have fallen."


Neruda is trying to tell the people of how the Latins were getting treated at that time during the civil war. Vivid images passes through your head while reading the poem. He uses consonance in the line "between bogs and black powder" which makes you remember of that line and makes you think about ashes, dust and dirt.
