Just watched the movie named “Thar” starring Anil Kapoor, Satish Kaushik, Fatima Sana Sheikh, and Harshvardhan Kapoor and one thing I want to say about the movie is, that the movie is “Brutally Refreshing.”

Thar is based on the backdrop of Rajasthan (1985) where all of the sudden, one local man named ‘Suva’ was brutally killed by an unknown killer and to solve this case, the director introduced us to two policemen, Surekha (played by Anil Kapoor) and Bhura (played by Satish Kaushik).

There is a new boy who just came into the Village named Sidharth (played by Harshvardhan Kapoor) and he introduced himself as a businessman of antique products.

During the investigation, Surekha finds out that Suva and his three friends (Dhanna, Panna, and Kanwar) do the smuggling of Opium. They buy opium from Pakistan and sell it in Delhi.

A few days later, police realized that three friends of Suva are missing from the village and the two main suspects in the case are Sidharth and a Pakistani smuggler, Hanif Khan.

The remaining of the movie is all about the investigation will Surekha and Bhura be able to find the murderer or not? 

Things I liked about the movie is the suspense factor of the movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting of all the actors is top-notch and as a director and viewer, I noticed how beautifully the director used the Brown color in the whole movie.

One thing I didn’t like about the movie at all is, that there is too much use of cuss words, and felt unnecessary in many scenes.

“Thar” is available on Netflix and if you are a fan of crime thriller movies then Thar should be on the top of your watchlist.
