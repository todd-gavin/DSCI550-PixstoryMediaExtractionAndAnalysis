I think the only good aspect of colonialism is that we have a universal language The only aspect of universality I love is English English as a language the status it acquired connects people worldwide We know many languages are trying to overtake English yet remain a failure Why is it so Because English as a language is a whole dynamic we know some people claim its ownership and make rules yet each nation has its own rules and words that they add into the vocabulary and yes it had been accepted too I am not taking this moment to joke about any accent but to put forward my opinion that the American accent is the coolest I do respect the decision in taking out the universality of the language and its pronunciation to a side and imbibing the changes that it took shape Accepting African American Linguistics Dialects from various parts of the world South Asian accents and so on America does have a great role in it as we stood up for our language and many of our writers including Walt Whitman and T S Eliot refused to accept the traditional norms in English of course Alice Walker for writing a whole book rejecting the pronunciation fallacy of the language These protests have given a platform for everyone worldwide to have their diversity in this universal language
