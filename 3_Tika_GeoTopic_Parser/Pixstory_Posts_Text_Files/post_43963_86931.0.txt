Diogo Jota
Diogo Jota was supposed to be the backup to football's most deadly front three, but he ended up breaking it up. The Portuguese is now a sure starter for Jurgen Klopp, providing more speed on the ball than Roberto Firmino while still preserving his winger qualities. Something has connected with him up front, as evidenced by his goal totals.

Patrik Schick
Schick has doubled down this season, scoring at a rate only the very top can match after scoring the greatest goal of Euro 2020 - an amazing 55-yard lob over Scotland keeper David Marshall. So far, 18 goals have been scored in 18 Bundesliga appearances for a Leverkusen team that has thrived under new manager Gerardo Seoane. The Czech striker is the ideal all-rounder: swift, strong, and cunning in the air. It'll only be a matter of time until bigger teams start calling.

Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea)
While many people think of the Belgian as burly and muscular, which he is, his sheer brilliance is an underappreciated aspect of his game. He can effortlessly turn defenders, is always in the right spot, and his chemistry with other forwards - Lautaro Martinez last season, Mason Mount this season, and even Eden Hazard at the international level - is based on his efforts to play to the strengths of others as well as his own. He's risen to become one of the world's top players in the last two years.

Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan)
Lautaro Martinez, Romelu Lukaku's partner in crime last season, has adjusted quite well to the loss of such a productive assist up front with him, demonstrating that he is the whole package, even on his own. The Argentinian possesses the strength, hold-up play, quickness, and awareness to succeed in the final third. Because he's still only 24, he has plenty of room to grow and improve.
