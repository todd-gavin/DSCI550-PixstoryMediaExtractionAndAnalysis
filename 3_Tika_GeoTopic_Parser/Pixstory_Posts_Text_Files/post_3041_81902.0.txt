President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is confident that his government will control inflation that has hit an eye-popping 50%, the highest in two decades. It was runaway inflation and widespread dissatisfaction with the government twenty years back that Erdogan’s party the AKP, came to power.

It’s not that the government has not tried to ease the pressure on the hard-hit country. Erdogan had announced lowering of taxes on grocery and other day-to-day use items from 8% to 1%. A few weeks back, he had announced an increase in minimum wages and civil servants’ salaries and pensions.

But the promise of the economy improving has not happened, even as he roams the world to broker peace between Russia and the West to striking deals with the UAE securing investments and funds.

Many observers blame Erdogan for his out-of-the-box economic policies. In fact, he is accused of forcing the central bank to reduce interest rates going against conventional wisdom. The Turkish lira lost 44% of its value last year after his refusal to raise rates as inflation consistently climbed. 
Erdogan has often claimed that raising rates actually worsens inflation rather than reducing it.

All these have contributed to him losing the popular support. 

Workers have been striking work demanding higher wages across the country. These could be alarm bells for the embattled Erdogan who has ruled his country for nearly two decades now and is up for election mid next year. There have been at least 56 worker strikes in Turkey between January 12 and February 10, according to the Labour Studies Group, an independent research initiative.

Erdogan has lost several elections in the last few years and is under pressure to deliver. But success on the economic front is eluding him so far. The opposition has often accused him of being an authoritarian leader, but he has held his own for many years. He may be losing ground.
