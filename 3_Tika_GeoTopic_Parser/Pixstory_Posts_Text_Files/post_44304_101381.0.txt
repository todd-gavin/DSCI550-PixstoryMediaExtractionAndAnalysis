Carlo Ancelotti believes Gareth Bale will receive the proper send-off for his Real Madrid career
when he plays his final game for the club on Friday at the Santiago Bernabeu. A man who
arrived in Spain as the most expensive player in the world in the summer of 2013 has had
plenty of highs with the Blancos, including three La Liga titles and four Champions League triumphs, but he has also had plenty of lows.

Bale's recent struggles with form and fitness have raised questions about his commitment to the
cause, with a loan spell at Tottenham in 2020-21, and he has been jeered on a regular basis as
he prepares to become a free agent in the summer.

It remains to be seen what the future holds for Bale, who is expected to continue playing at the
age of 32, and Ancelotti wishes him well ahead of a final home game against Real Betis.

The Blancos boss has said: “It's not important if he plays, what's important is Bale is a part of
the history of this club.

“He'll always be in the memories of Real Madrid fans. He has written some great chapters; we
have to recognise that.”

Bale hit the ground running in Madrid after being signed from Tottenham, scoring 22 goals in his
debut season, including memorable efforts in the Copa del Rey and Champions League finals.

He went on to make 250 appearances for Real Madrid and score 100 goals, making him one of
the most successful British imports to Europe.

Along with his domestic and continental titles, Bale has also won the UEFA Super Cup and the
FIFA Club World Cup three times while in Spain.

A collection of 15 trophies over nine years
suggests that he has been a success story, but he has only made seven appearances this
season and there is no guarantee that he will play against Betis.
