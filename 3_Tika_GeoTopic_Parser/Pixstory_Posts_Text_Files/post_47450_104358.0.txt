The 2022 UEFA Nations League kicks off this week and will see the Czech Republic host Switzerland at the Sinobo Stadium in their group opener on Thursday.

Last year, the Czech Republic was one of the European Championship's surprise teams, reaching the quarterfinals. They will not compete in the World Cup this year after losing 1-0 to Sweden in the playoff semifinals, and will instead focus on winning the Nations League. In the previous season, the host team won their group with 12 points from six games, and they will now compete in League A for the first time.

Switzerland, like its hosts, advanced to the Euro 2020 semifinals before losing on penalties to Spain. After a good qualifying run, they have won automatic qualification to the World Cup and will now focus on preparing for it over the next two weeks.The A-Team advanced to the 2018 Nations League semifinals, falling 3-1 to eventual champions Portugal before losing on penalties to England in the battle for third place.

Czech Republic vs Switzerland: Prediction

Lacking some craft and quality in the absence of both Barak and Schick, the Czechs are not best equipped to take the step-up in class at the moment, and may find adjusting to life in League A particularly challenging.

Now acknowledged as one of Europe's top footballing nations, Switzerland can therefore make their better attacking options pay - getting their latest Nations League campaign off to a successful start.

Prediction: Czech Republic 0-1 Switzerland
