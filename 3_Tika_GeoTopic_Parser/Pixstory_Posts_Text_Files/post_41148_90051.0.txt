The Red Sox are removing their 254-foot Black Lives Matter billboard from behind Fenway Park, facing the Massachusetts Turnpike, after almost two years. 

Boston Herald reported that the Red Sox' executive vice president of social impact and executive director of the Red Sox Foundation, Bekah Salwasser, told the Herald on Thursday that the organisation has been proud of its support for the Black Lives Matter movement, but now wants to use that signage to promote the foundation's 20th anniversary. 

The billboards will be changed in the coming days.

“We felt it very important to take advantage of one of the most prominent tools this organization has, which is this billboard, to really shed a light on and celebrate the 20 years of incredible impact the Red Sox Foundation has had across New England,” Salwasser said. 

With the nation mourning the loss of George Floyd in July 2020, Red Sox executives believed they were joining a significant movement. 

Team president Sam Kennedy issued a rallying cry, urging members of the Sox front office and fans alike to work toward racial justice and multicultural inclusion in their communities. 

The Red Sox unveiled the billboard to show their support, which was later accompanied by a giant banner in the Red Sox bleachers and a permanent BLM sign in the outfield. 

Despite overwhelming support from the majority of their fans, the group was inundated with hostile phone calls from a "vocal minority" of people who didn't appreciate the sign.
