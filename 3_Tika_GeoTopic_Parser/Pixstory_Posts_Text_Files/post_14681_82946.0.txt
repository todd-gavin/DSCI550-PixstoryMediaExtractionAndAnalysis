Around 5.81 lakh healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) in the state have received the shots nearly 40 days after prophylactic doses for special-category beneficiaries began. 
More than 30 lakh HCWs and FLWs in Maharashtra have received their second dose. 
According to state data, Mumbai has the highest booster coverage among FLWs and HCWs, with 58,145 injections administered to HCWs and roughly 71,158 shots provided to FLWs as of February 19. With 35,556 booster shots to HCWs and 41,837 booster shots to FLWs, Pune district ranks second on the list. 
Thane, Nagpur and Nashik are the only other districts on the list that are now performing well with the preventive doses.

Laxity among beneficiaries, according to Dr. Patil, may have hindered booster coverage. "However, I strongly encourage all HCWs to volunteer for the precaution doses," he stated. 
In terms of routine immunisation coverage, the district reported over 5,000 recipients receiving Covid shots on Sunday (CoWIN data till 7pm). So far, 1.71 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin, and Sputnik V have been delivered in Pune, with 94.85 lakh first doses, 74.19 lakh second doses, and 2.18 lakh precaution doses.
