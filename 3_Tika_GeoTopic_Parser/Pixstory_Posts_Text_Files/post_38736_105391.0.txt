Courtois won the 35th La Liga with Real Madrid. The Belgian finished 2nd in clean sheets with 16, behind Alex Romero who kept 19 clean sheets. 


In the recently concluded Champions League match, Courtois was like a goliath between the sticks. He thwarted out dangers from Mohamed Salah, Luis Diaz, Sadio Mane and co. He made acrobatic saves left and right to deny Liverpool players. He made a total of 9 saves in the match and he made 7 crucial saves inside the box to deny Mohamed Salah, who was the main dangerman of the Liverpool attack. He made 1 aerial save too. Out of 40 passes which he made he had successfully made 21 of them taking his percentage to 53%. 


Courtois ended up with most saves in the tournament with 59 saves and finished 3rd, tied with Edouard Mendy and Odisseas Vlachodimos with 5 saves. 


Courtois proved his naysayers wrong, silencing those who had criticised him in England. With the UCL, he proved everyone wrong. With Real Madrid investing on Aurelien Tchouameni and beefing up their defense with signing Antonio Rudriger, one can expect Real Madrid and Thibaut Courtois going to win the UCL for 15 times. Thibaut joins the likes of Iker Casillas, Keylor Neves in the hall of fame of goalkeepers who won the Champions League.
