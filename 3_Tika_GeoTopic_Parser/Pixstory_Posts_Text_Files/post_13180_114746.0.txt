Hackers who called themselves the "Cyber ​​Army of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan" claimed to have hacked the website of the Ministry of Defense.

Their announcement states that "the official website of the Ministry of Defense of the Ta-Ash Takfiri terrorist group named mod.gov.af was taken out of reach and destroyed by the cyber army of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan."

This site belongs to the Ministry of Defense of the previous government.
Hackers claim that after the fall of the previous government of Afghanistan, many government websites, including the websites of the Citadel and the Presidential Affairs Department of Afghanistan, were unavailable and are still unavailable.

In the last 12 years, these websites were considered as the main sources of information of the previous government of Afghanistan and contained a part of the archive of the last 20 years.
However, some websites of the former government are still accessible and in the hands of the Taliban.

According to the claim of hackers of the "Cyber ​​Army of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan", the attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense took place at 04:30 on the morning of the 18th of Cancer.
The Taliban have not yet commented on this matter.

The "Cyber ​​Army of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan" has said to the Taliban, "Wherever you go, we are sitting in secret, whether you are in Quetta or Kabul!" wait for us."
This is the first time that hackers have introduced themselves with this title.
