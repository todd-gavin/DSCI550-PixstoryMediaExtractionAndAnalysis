If Chelsea completes the purchase of Sevilla center-back Jules Kounde, according to The Telegraph, they may part ways with four senior players. This summer, the team could lose Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Kepa Arrizabalaga, and Michy Batshuayi.

The four players already mentioned will reportedly be allowed to leave, according to Tuchel. But it will be interesting to watch if they are able to entice any reasonable offers. Not every team on the continent can afford a player of that value and their pay bill.

Napoli is reportedly interested in Kepa after the Spaniard was dropped to the backup position after Edouard Mendy joined the team. Chelsea might find it difficult to recoup the Â£72 million they paid to acquire him.

Kepa Arrizabalaga still has three years left on his contract, so there is still time to loan him out and try to get him a job. If Chelsea approves of a transfer, The Sun has created a list of the bookies' odds on where he would finish up next season.

The list is dominated by Serie A teams, but a few La Liga teams are included as well, including Athletic Bilbao, Kepa's old squad. Due to the departure of their first-choice goalkeeper this summer, Napoli are the clear favourites at 4/6.

Juventus, the second favourite at 5/1, would only want Kepa as Wojciech Szczesny's backup. Nice, the sole squad from Ligue 1, is the longest shot on the list at 6/1, while Lazio, who had been the side most firmly associated with Kepa over the past year, is now a long shot at 7/1. Atletico Madrid is last in the rankings and is listed at 20/1, with a return to Bilbao listed at 12/1.
