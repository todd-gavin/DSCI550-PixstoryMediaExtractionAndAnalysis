Now coming to Richa Ghosh, emergence of Yastika Bhatia as a wicketkeeping option alongside Pooja Vastrakar’s finishing skills have played a major role in her ouster from the main squad. She has played quite a few impact knocks in her 14-match short career in the format. 

However, Unfortunately, she got only one T20I against Sri Lanka and her 18-ball 11 led to her not making it to the squad. 

Well, but a player of Richa’s calibre should always be a part of the squad at least given that she is one batter who can make things happen when the chips are down. Out of 12 innings she has batted so far, Richa has scored at a strike-rate of 130 or more on five occasions which clearly indicates that she is made for T20 cricket. 

But unfortunately, she, along with, Poonam Yadav will be missed in the Commonwealth Games. Nevertheless, they have been named in the stand-bys and an injury to one of the players from the main squad might just be a blessing in disguise for the team as they will get a chance to prove their worth in that case.
