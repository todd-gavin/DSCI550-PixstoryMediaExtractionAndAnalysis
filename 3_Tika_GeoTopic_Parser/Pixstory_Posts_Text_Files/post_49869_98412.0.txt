The draft by Samuel Alito has created quite a stir in the nation. We all know does this will politically lead to the states. Republicans had made their stand on abortion almost clear. What will be the consequences of Roe v/s Wade?

If Roe v/s Wade be overturned, the power structure will change. It will be a victory for social conservatives who have strived to bring the fight to the state level for decades. Overruling Roe would mean the abortion issue would go back to the states. In the era wherein all politics is driven by the conversation in Washington, overturning Roe would significantly shift the power centre to state capitols.

In particular, there could be a lot of emphasis on governors. While governors cannot pass abortion legislation on their own, they can veto or sign a bill into law with dramatic consequences for those seeking an abortion in ways a member of Congress cannot.

But nowhere in the country will this topic likely dominate on the campaign path than in Michigan. In 1931, Michigan banned abortion and that law is still on the books. Roe supplanted that law, but if Roe goes away then it will shortly be law in that state again. Incumbent Governor Gretchen Whitmer has pledged not to enforce the law, as has the stateâ€™s attorney general. Both are Democrats who favour abortion rights and both are up for reelection this year. But of course, they will face Republicans who call for enforcing the 1931 law.
