Both cinema and literature are a reflection of society.
Instead, cinema is a part of the world of literature that manifests and reflects a particular time in history.
Although a film is visual, it is concocted and created from a script or adapted from a written work of literature, making it just another way to narrate those written tales.
Well, to put it in other words, "literature is an art which is developed through writing while cinema brings those writings to life through sound, music, visuals, and actors. Literature has all the meanings hidden in itself that are used to develop a film. Though both are somehow interdependent, both need to be studied to understand a movie based on a piece of literature completely. Moreover, literature has always been a great inspiration for cinema worldwide."

Even movies and documentaries can be looked into and analysed the same way as criticism would do to a piece of literature.
Besides all the differences and similarities, some prefer wandering on the journey of imagination with what they created through reading literature. But, at the same time, some would visit the imaginative world through the visuals created by someone else.

Adaptation from a piece of literature is another way cinema uses literature while being a part of it.
Like J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility all were taken from the written work but tried to put in visuals to make the image clear and easy to visit.

Nevertheless, cinema and literature are linked together and would always go hand in hand as both reflect society.
