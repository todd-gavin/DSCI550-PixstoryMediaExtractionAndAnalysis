Tuesday, the Congress criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his comments at the global dairy conference, claiming that Tribhuvandas Patel, V. Kurien, and the outstanding cooperative institutions they established were solely responsible for the "white revolution."
Prime Minister Modi stated that since 2014, "our government has worked ceaselessly to boost the potential of India's dairy sector" in remarks made following the opening of the IDF WDS 2022 on Monday.
India produced 146 million tonnes of milk in 2014; today, that number has increased to 210 million tonnes, a 44 percent increase, according to the prime minister. "Today, its result is visible in terms of milk production as well as the increased income of farmers," he added.
In response to Prime Minister Modi's comments during the summit, Congress general secretary for communications Jairam Ramesh tweeted, "Jagadguru of Jhoot is now claiming to have made India the world's greatest milk producer, which it became in 1998."
The former Union minister said, "The White Revolution was totally due to Tribhuvandas Patel, Dr. V. Kurien, and the wonderful cooperative institutions they established."
In his speech at the summit, Prime Minister Modi stated that while milk production is increasing globally at a pace of 2%, it is increasing at a rate of over 6% in India.
In the previous three to four years, our government has directly sent nearly Rs 2 lakh crore to the bank accounts of small farmers, he had claimed, making India's per capita availability of milk significantly greater than the global norm.
According to what he had claimed, a sizable portion of this sum was credited to the bank accounts of dairy industry-related farmers.
According to the prime minister, India currently produces the most milk in the world thanks to the labour of small farmers and their livestock.
