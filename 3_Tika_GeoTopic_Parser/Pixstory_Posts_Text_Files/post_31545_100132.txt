Understanding how a molecule in a biological fluid can reach and interact in a few minutes with the sensitive interface of a device a trillion times larger is a puzzle that has given rise to intense scientific debate in recent years Solve the riddle and pave the way to the development of increasingly effective electronic bio sensors what researchers of the Institute of crystallography and Cnr Ic of the Institute of photonics and nanotechnology Cnr Ifn of the National Research Council have done in collaboration with the Department of Chemistry Pharmacy Pharmaceutical Sciences and Interuniversity of Physics of the University of Bari The research was published in Advanced Science international journal with a very high impact factor In the asymptomatic phases that precede the onset of serious pathologies such as tumors, neurodegenerative diseases or COVID, only very few biomarkers or pathogens Their timely detection would truly allow for early diagnosis and would radically transform the medical approach from curative to preventive, explains Luisa Torsi, full professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Bari and new vice president of the scientific council of the CNR who coordinated the research. ultra-diluted molecules in a fluid using existing nanometric devices is possible but requires weeks or months since the probability of encounter and interaction between a biomarker and a nano sensor both of dimensions of the order of the nanometer billionth of a meter is infinitely low in the volume of a sample of blood or saliva to be analyzed a tenth of a milliliter Surprisingly, several recent experiments have shown that if instead of a nano device sensors are used having millimeter interfaces carpeted with a very large number of one thousand billion capture antibodies, it is possible to detect the presence of a single molecule even in tenths of a milliliter within a few minutes how to free a single fish in Lake Garda and then be able to find it again By developing a model based on Einstein&#39;s theory on the diffusion of particles subject to Brownian motion and using it to explain new experiments we have found a convincing explanation all enigma of the so-called diffusion barrier explains Scamarcio professor of Physics at the University of Bari and associated with the Cnr Ifn creator of the research
