I have witnessed many women who have been playing their parts so clearly that they never want or get that opportunity to unveil some hidden roles where life was hard for them.

All the women tend to mould themselves so well in their situations that their past experiences and horrors always remain unknown.
Sometimes they would have tried to put light on their pain and despair, but there's no one to lend their ears, or maybe they don't want to hear it, so it becomes unheard.

This patriarchal society never lets a woman speak about her fears and terrors. And hence they choose to get accustomed to whatever is happening with them presently without shedding any light on what they endured earlier. But they eagerly wait for the time where they can vent it all out either through her writing or just by saying it.
And when they begin doing so, there would be a plethora of memoirs, the life stories of those women who got the courage to reveal and share it all.
