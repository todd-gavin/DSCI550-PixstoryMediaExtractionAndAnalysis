AND HE DID IT! WHAT A FIGHTBACK! 

Down by 13 points going into the second game, Sen played like his life depended on this match! What intent! What commitment!

Coming to the match point, Sen beat Ginting in a close net game to the right of court, Ginting returned softly, the shuttle was stuck in the net, which sent the Indian camp into a frenzy as Sen went down with emotion and glee!

India now have the much needed 1-0 lead going into the second game. Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty now go up against Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sukamuljo in the first of the two men's doubles.

Stay tuned for the crucial second match as India closes the gap in the historic finals!

Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž
