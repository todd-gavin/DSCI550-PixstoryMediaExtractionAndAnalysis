Rain Fact: Rain Speed
The maximum speed of a falling raindrop can differ from 18 to 22 miles per hour. Water, for the most part, tumbles to earth at a low speed; this is on account of raindrops having special shapes that build the impact of atmospheric friction. If this atmospheric friction doesn’t act against the downpour, each drop would come down at incredible speeds and can cause a lot of harm.
