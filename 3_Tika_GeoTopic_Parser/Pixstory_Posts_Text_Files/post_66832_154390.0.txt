Verstappen became a back-to-back champion in confusing circumstances as - while the completion of only 28 of the 53 laps at Suzuka meant he should not have had enough points for a coronation - he took the required maximum points tally.
That is because the rule on reduced races and points - new for this year following a 2021 Belgian GP that saw half points scored despite only a handful of laps behind the Safety Car - has been written in such a way that it produced a result that was not intended.
The race being between 50 and 75 per cent long should have meant Verstappen scored 19 points, which would not have given him the title even after Charles Leclerc was demoted from second to third behind Sergio Perez. But article 6.5 of F1's sporting regulations says that reduced points only apply if a race is suspended "and cannot be resumed".
As Sunday's race did finish, race control had no option but to follow the written rules and hand out full points, making Verstappen the champion, much to the surprise of the Dutchman, Red Bull, and every team on the grid.
"I think it's a mistake that wasn't included after the issues in Spa last year," Horner told reporters after the race.
"We were under the strong impression that only with 75 per cent of the race completed would full points be scored.
"So we felt we were going to be one point short. But, in the end, Checo's move on Charles nailed Max the championship. So you can see his surprise, the team's surprise. But what a wonderful surprise."
The FIA has indicated it will review the rule, which is expected to be rewritten.
