Matt Beard, the manager, and Missy Bo Kearns, the midfielder, spoke to GOAL ahead of the 
Prenton Park presentation on Sunday.

The FA Women's Championship trophy will be delivered to Liverpool Women on Sunday, with a large crowd expected for their home match against Sheffield United.With a 4-2 win against Bristol City earlier this month, the Reds clinched the championship and promotion to the FA Women's Super League.

The trophy will be handed during Prenton Park's home match against Sheffield United on Sunday.

To allow as many supporters as possible to attend both the Women's game and the Men's 
Premier League encounter with Everton at Anfield, the game will begin at 12:00pm BST (kick off 4.30pm BST).

Beard paid praise to his team in an exclusive interview with GOAL this week, saying that they 
had recovered well from the disappointment of losing out on promotion last season.

Beard has already had success with Liverpool, winning two WSL titles during his first stay with 
the club between 2012 and 2015, and he is pleased to have achieved promotion at the first time of asking this time.

"I consider myself fortunate to have been allowed to return. I had several talks with other teams, but it was a no-brainer once I found out Liverpool was interested in me.

Sunday will be a very memorable day for Missy Bo Kearns, a teenage midfielder.

The 21-year-old Scouser, a product of the club's junior system, has been one of the outstanding 
players this season, garnering distinction with England U23s, captaining Liverpool, and being 
widely projected as a future WSL star.

Kearns, who came up through the same programme as men's first-team player Curtis Jones, was a member of the team that lost out on promotion last season, and he credits Beard and his staff with ensuring that this year's squad was ready to succeed.

She says, "We deserved it." "This season, we've played a lot of teams off the park and shown a 
lot more unity."
