‌Biden had called for a new era by cracking down on ghost guns. He also showed his intention on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Gun manufacturers never take responsibility for the violence and death happening around America and hence this industry should not be promoted. Biden has called on Congress for stricter gun laws. 

“These guns are weapons of choice for many criminals,” Biden said in the Rose Garden, holding up gun parts while condemning the homemade weapons. “We’re going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice. And when we find them, put them in jail for a long, long time
‌
‌These new laws allow law enforcement offices to track down illegal guns used for violence. Biden calls for gun control but stricter gun laws are a hard path until republicans change their minds. Even if democrats show their full support still need 10 votes from Republicans. America and guns should be an issue of the past. The gun culture we developed sadly makes it even worse. 

‌As the crime wave worsens, Americans continue to purchase guns in record numbers. So stricter gun laws and legal guns were given through strict surveillance are an option to prevent crimes.
