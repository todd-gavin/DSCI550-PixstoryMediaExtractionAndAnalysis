Nobody said children should grow up ungrateful. However, how fair it is to burden children under the baggage of what is your responsibility? That's not how you teach them gratitude, that's called teaching them submission.

You putting the burden of your own duties on children who don't even understand what it means is absurd. Telling them what they got does not come easy and telling them they should stop having their own personality because you provided for them are two different things.

Let's not even start about how tone deaf it is. The narcissism of the fact that you want your children to be guilt ridden for having their opinions different than yours, or demand their submission because you did what you were supposed to? You gave them birth, they did not ask to be born. You brought them into this life, it's your moral and basic responsibility to look after them! You are not doing a favor on them! Stop expecting them to fall in your feet because you did what was expected from you. If you want to make slaves out of your kids just because you are providing for them, don't have children. Taking advantage of their naivety and innocence to feel superior is gross.
