I have always wondered as to why political subjects comply with the exisiting political structures despite feeling discontent.

Several philosophers have attempted to answer the question of unsurprising conformity people show as citizens.

Among them Michel Foucault's theory of Panopticism is usually taken as a powerful analogy to explain power and its influence.

Imagine being held captive in a prison cell. You cannot see what other inmates are doing. However, there's a tower in the middle of the prison ground observing each and every prisoner. You know you are being watched constantly. That possibility of surveillance instills fear in you. Hypothetically, even if you're not being watched, the presence of the tower itself will make you comply to its expectations out of fear of punishment.

According to Foucault, much of modern society and political structures are based on the analogy of the panopticon. Citizens become passive political subjects because they conform to the norms dictated by existing power structures because they fear that defiance would get them punished by the institutions that watch them all the time.

Do you think this is an apt analogy to explain why people comply even if they are not happy with how they are being governed?
