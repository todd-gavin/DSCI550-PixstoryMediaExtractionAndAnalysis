Believers are expected to love one another, because "love is from God,". One of the benefits of having a strong relationship with Jesus Christ is the ability to act kindly toward others. 

"I was born of God and know God," says the individual who sincerely loves God. This last statement has two distinct ideas. A Christian believer who has been "born of God" is a saved Christian believer (John 3). As a natural and expected result, that person will develop a deep relationship with Him. As a result, that person comes to "know" God. Without being born again, a person cannot truly love God. Without God's love, no one can truly love others. Those who show holy love demonstrate that they are saved.

Believers are to "love one another." This reflects both the commandments of Jesus (John 13:34–35), and John's prior teaching on recognizing a life influenced by Christ (1 John 2:7–11).
