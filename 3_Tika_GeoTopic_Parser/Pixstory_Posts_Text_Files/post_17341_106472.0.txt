Zinedine Zidane is now the favourite to replace Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain after a breakthrough in negotiations between the former France star's representatives and the Ligue 1 champions, GOAL can confirm.


Despite a return to domestic success this term, the Parc des Princes club have been looking to move on from the Argentine and install a new manager in charge ahead of the upcoming campaign.

Former Real Madrid boss Zidane, one of the most decorated coaches of the past decade from two spells in charge of Los Blancos, has long been linked with the role - but has now edged closer to the position amid a reportedly eye-watering offer.

What will Zidane bring to Paris Saint-Germain?

Having been out of club management since his second departure from Santiago Bernabeu in 2021, the Frenchman would bring one of the most fearsome managerial records in the game to Paris.

During his first spell in charge between 2016 and 2018, Zidane won La Liga in his maiden campaign and a remarkable hat-trick of Champions League finals, boasting a superb 70.47 per cent win ratio during his tenure.

It is that European nous that may appeal above all else to PSG, who are yet to add the biggest crown in continental club football to their trophy cabinet.

They came up short once again this season, after a sensational last-16 loss against Madrid where they collapsed dramatically against Los Blancos, in what may well have been the beginning of the end for Pochettino.
