I remember. 
I remember lying on my mother's lap, ranting about my day.
I remember rushing to the door as soon as I heard my father's footsteps. 
I remember picking a fight with my sibling and clearing the coast as soon as we heard our mother's, "What's going on?"
I remember celebrating all the festivities together with family and those mouth-watering dishes.
I remember my grandparents' big warm hug that radiates homely feeling.
I remember rushing to my class in fear and anticipation, hoping the teacher hadn't come yet. 
I remember the whispers, chuckles, laughter, gossips, those emotions, the crowded canteens, busy corridors, eventful evenings, noisy playground, sweaty students; those warm classrooms.
I remember the lengthy lectures and the exhausted sighs. 
I remember living without a lot of worry in the moment.
I remember with a sense of acute nostalgia.
I remember.
All too well.
