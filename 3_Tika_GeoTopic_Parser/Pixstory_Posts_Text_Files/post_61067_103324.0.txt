The Emerging Global Vision of a “Health Promoting school”

One that is constantly strengthening its capacity as a healthy setting for living, learning and working.
  
      It focuses on creating health and presenting important causes of death, disease and disability by helping school children, staff, family and community to care for themselves.
It equips school children to take informed decisions over circumstances that affect their health and create conditions that are conducive to health. (WHO - 2008)
Creating a health promoting school means applying new ways of positive thinking. It strives to incorporate health into all aspects of life at the school and in the neighborhood community even for nearing the Goals of a Nation.
