Gambia and South Sudan are set to meet at the Stade Lat Dior in Group G on Saturday as they begin
their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaigns.

Gambia are coming into this fixture after a respectable draw against United Arab Emirates last Sunday.

Gambia are in tremendous form, having lost only one of their last 8 matches.

South Sudan has seen a recent upturn in form.
 After having lost all five matches in 2021, they’ve begun
2022 well with 2 victories in 2 matches. These come at a crucial time as they are set to face competition
in making it to the African Cup of Nations this year.

Sadly, South Sudan have not featured in the competition ever and will be looking to make their debut in
the tournament.

Gambia vs South Sudan: Probable Playing XI

Gambia: Jobe (GK); Colley, Sanneh, Touray, Gomez; Marreh, Jallow, Bobb; Ceesay, Barrow, Jobe
