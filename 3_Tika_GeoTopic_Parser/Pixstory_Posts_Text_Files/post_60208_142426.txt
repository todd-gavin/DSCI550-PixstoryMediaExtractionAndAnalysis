Every time he wanted to see his girlfriend an electrician in Bihar would briefly shut off the village s power supply for a few hours This bizarre behaviour led to the locals busting the electrician For a long period the Purnia district s Ganeshpur village experienced frequent power outages until the locals noticed that nearby villages weren t affected according to The Tribune The villagers decided to look into it since they felt something was off and they quickly discovered what was going on In the end it turned out to be the work of a local electrician who was merely trying to see his lover under the cover of night When the power supply went down once more the locals used the opportunity to bust the two at a nearby school The man admitted that he would turn off the power for the entire town for a few hours whenever he wanted to meet his girlfriend He was attacked by furious villagers who also tonsured the suspect and paraded him through the community The villagers didn t report the electrician to the police The event has come to our attention but we won t take action until we receive a complaint said Vikas Kumar Azad in charge of the neighbourhood police station to The Tribune The story does have a satisfying conclusion though As decided by the community the man was married off to his girlfriend in front of the village elders and panchayat members We can only hope that Ganeshpur Village won t have any more power outages
