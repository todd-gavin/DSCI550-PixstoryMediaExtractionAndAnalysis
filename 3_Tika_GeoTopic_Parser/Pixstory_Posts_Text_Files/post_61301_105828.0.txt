Liverpool have been linked with a swoop for Darwin Nunez, as per Sky. 

Darwin Nunez, 22, is one of the better goal-scoring prospects in Europe. He scored 34 times for Benéfica this past season, including goals against Liverpool, across the two legs of the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals. 

Nunez is also liked by Manchester United. The Red Devils are looking to sign a striker, after Edinson Cavani left the club on a free transfer. The Reds on the other hand, are looking to replace Sadie Mane. Moreover, with the futures of Roberto Firminho and Mohamed Salah in unclear waters, it makes sense for Liverpool to strengthen their frontline. 

Mane has refused to commit his long-term future with the former Premier League champions beyond the next season. That said, he has been heavily linked with a move to Bayern Munich with the German champions looking to begin talks with Liverpool this week. Mane is said to be valued at £30 million. 

Nunez is currently valued at £85.5 million and the source reports that the Kop will not spend excessively for the 22-year-old. The Uruguayan is set to move on from Benéfica this summer but where will he end up? 

United or Liverpool?
