As we can see certain glimpses of life post covid 19 where the cases and death rates have declined and also the mask mandatory are coming to an end in few open areas. 

But in this post covid period while we look into the emotional well being of adults 65 years and older, they are at the risk of experiencing critical illnesses quite often. 

Many of the elders are still precautious on the virus and have been mostly at home for the past 2 years. Their fear or measures of precaution increases as they get to know someone who has contracted the virus or someone who have passed away due to covid. 

“As with all transitions, moving into a post-pandemic lifestyle will take some time to adapt,” Dr. Michael G. Wetter, PsyD, FAPA, a diplomat and fellow for the American Psychotherapy Association, told Healthline. 

“If people feel more comfortable wearing masks even when there is no mandate, they should feel free to do so until they feel comfortable in not wearing one,” Wetter said. 

A recent story from Kaiser Health News detailed the anxiety, depression, and other emotions felt by older adults the past 2 years. 

Now, they face the decision whether to continue to play it safe or to throw a little caution to the wind and try to enjoy the years they have remaining. 

“At the beginning of the pandemic, many older adults hunkered down and used a lifetime of coping skills to get through this,” Bonnie Olsen, PhD, a clinical psychologist at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, told Kaiser Health News. “Now, as people face this current surge, it’s as if their well of emotional reserves is being depleted.” 

Olsen recommends that younger adults watch for signs older adults are withdrawing or shutting down emotionally. 

“When people start to avoid being in touch, then I become more worried,” she said.
