Acknowledging the real possibility of war, Vice President Kamala Harris wrapped up a weekend of outreach to European allies with a push to bolster the West's resolve in confronting Moscow with crippling sanctions as increasingly dire signs suggest Russia's Vladimir Putin plans to order an invasion of Ukraine.

In a burst of diplomacy at the annual Munich Security Conference, Harris tried to make the case to American allies that rapidly escalating tensions on the Ukraine-Russian border meant European security was under direct threat and there should be unified support for economic penalties if the Kremlin invades its neighbor.

We are talking about the potential for war in Europe. I mean, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what were talking about, Harris told reporters before her return to Washington. Europe, she said, might be at its most perilous moment since the end of World War II.

It's been over 70 years, and through those 70 years â€¦ there has been peace and security," she said. "We are talking about the real possibility of war in Europe.

President Joe Biden was to meet with his national security team later Sunday in Washington to discuss the unfolding developments. Harris planned to participate while flying back from Germany. Before leaving Munich, Harris and her team briefed them about her meetings and exchanges at the conference.
