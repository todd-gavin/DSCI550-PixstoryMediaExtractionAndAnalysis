I made a return to one of my all time favourite venues in Delhi last night Auro Kitchen Bar The artists were Indian origin Singapore rapper Yung Raja who opened for main headliner Ambika Nayak aka Kayan Seeing as my younger brother is a huge fan of Kayan there was no other option but to go with him I m glad we went too It was some good quality time and we ll surely remember this night for the rest of our lives The reason Auro is one of my favourite venues in Delhi is because of the caliber of artists and DJ s they include in their monthly roster Also in my opinion their sound system is by far the best in the city As an audiophile it s something I really appreciate So if you re looking for a place to hang out a night out on the town if you will be sure to check out Auro Kitchen Bar You ll find it in Aurobindo Marg Hauz Khas Right adjacent to Summerhouse Cafe It is also right opposite Riyaz Chicken Corner The place where we go and eat affordable biryani so that we don t need to spend any money on food inside any of these places Lastly the artists were par excellence If you re into indie hip hop you ve either already heard of them or will very soon
