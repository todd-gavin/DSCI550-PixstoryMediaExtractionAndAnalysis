#1.  Records of the past, effects on the present:
Record's never seem to directly impact games like this one. Or any games on the
professional stage for that matter. But having a mental advantage, or past insight into how
your opponents set up is very important.

Crucially enough for these teams, their last date with destiny wasn't very long ago. The
player's have been through this before, home and away. Tuchel's plans have worked before,
albeit with a considerably stronger team and against a worse Madrid side. Ancelotti has
history with Chelsea too, but that'll hardly be of any relevance.

Besides, the Italian was left back in Spain after testing positive for Covid 19. Tuchel by the
way, has never lost a game against the Merengues for any team he's coached in the past,
having won twice and drawn on four other occasions.

Another shocking statistic which may come as a surprise to Madrid fans â€” Chelsea have
never been beaten by Real Madrid in an official game (non-friendlies that is). The game is
not all about numbers and records of the past.
They however, play a role in developing or clouding one's judgement against the other team.

A wide range of ideas, physical qualities and mind games on show. Only those who've been
there and done that before can boast to Expect what is to come. Experience counts for a lot
more than what one might think.
