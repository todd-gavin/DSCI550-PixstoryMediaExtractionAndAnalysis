Manu said At the start of the round I wasn t reading the greens well But I sorted that out later on and began rolling in the putts I didn t hit as many greens today but was just off the green on many occasions and I made good chip putts there I ve been consistent through the week especially with my ball striking I m just following my process and staying in the present by taking it one shot at a time The two par saves on the th and th came at crucial junctures today that kept my rhythm going and contributed to my good score I feel as long as I m putting well I will have a good chance in the last round Amardeep Malik the overnight sole leader by two shots mixed five birdies with two bogeys on Friday The year old Amardeep capitalized on three of the four par s chipped in for birdie on the th and landed his approach within a foot for a tap in birdie on the th Malik s long range birdie putts narrowly missed the pins on the last two holes Malik said I played well and had a good round but just didn t make a lot of putts I missed a lot of birdie opportunities on the front nine But rest everything was good The key going into the final round would be to just focus on what I m doing and also draw inspiration from the good memories of my two previous wins at this course Even though it was a lot cooler today and not energy sapping like the previous two rounds the wind was big enough a challenge to drain one mentally My father has been following me on the course for the last two days He s come to the course after four or five years So I m looking forward to him being around in the final round too as family support is always comforting Chandigarh s Abhijit Singh Chadha is in fifth place at nine under
