What is now one of the most incredible places in Salento was once a site for the extraction of bauxite which was active until the mid-years The Bauxite quarry is located in Otranto near the lighthouse of Punta Palascia and Monte Sant Angelo and today it is one of most attractive tourist attractions in the area And yes the foot you see in the photo is mine because I just couldn&#39;t resist and last summer I went to visit this place There was a hellish wind and the red sand got into my nose into my ears and I has soiled all the clothes but the eyes have been dazzled by the beauty of the place The extraction of Bauxite in this deposit starts in and ends in As a consequence of the abandonment, the infiltration of water into one of the layers of the karst ground has created in the crater of the quarry a wonderful emerald green pond
