 Boast no more so very proudly Do not let arrogance come out of your mouth For the Lord is a God of knowledge And with Him actions are weighed Samuel To call yourself a devotee while such prideful words come out of your mouth is not being a devotee This is the exact reason Jesus is the greatest man to ever live for He never let arrogance seep into his divinity like us worldly beings Arrogance takes you away from God never towards Him The number of sins we knowingly and unknowingly commit yet believe that we re better than the Lord s greatest devotee His son Him Jesus is great because of His humility because of the fact that He never called Himself great But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him Daniel May the Lord show us the way away from pride and make us humble and grateful Amen
