Gibraltar and Bulgaria meet at the Victoria Stadium on Thursday, both looking for their first
victory in Group C4 of the UEFA Nations League.

Gibraltar's poor run of form continued on Sunday, as they were defeated 2-0 by North
Macedonia.The victory came after a humiliating 4-0 loss to Georgia in the group's first matchup
last Thursday.Gibraltar has now gone 19 games without a win in all competitions, dating back to
a 1-0 triumph against Liechtenstein in October 2020.

Bulgaria, like the hosts, struggled to find their feet last time out, losing 5-2 at home to Georgia.

They had previously been held to a 1-1 tie by North Macedonia in their respective group
opening.Since October 2021, Bulgaria has gone winless in each of their previous six games,
with two draws and four losses.

Gibraltar vs Bulgaria: Prediction

All things considered, Gibraltar is likely to struggle for goals and points this season, and we
anticipate that trend to continue on Thursday. Bulgaria isn't in very strong shape, but the past
World Cup players should be able to earn an easy victory.
