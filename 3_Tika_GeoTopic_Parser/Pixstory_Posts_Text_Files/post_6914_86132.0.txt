As the civilian death toll grows unabated in Ukraine, thousands of Indian students are on the way to Poltava from Sumy in Ukraine. Around ten buses arranged by the Red Cross are ferrying the Indian students to Poltava – a city in central Ukraine – from where they are expected to board trains to Western Ukraine.

In the past several days, Sumy has witnessed intense shelling and fighting between the Russian and Ukrainian troops. “We had a Whatsapp group, and we were told to reach a spot near the hostel. Most of us could reach the spot, but some Indian students couldn’t reach on time, and because of this, they were left behind, and the bus took off without them. I hope that those students are also evacuated at the earliest,” said Abdul, a student of the Sumy State University in Ukraine.

The students who were on board the Red Cross bus told The Probe that the buses stopped at multiple checkpoints on the way between Sumy and Poltava. “Some local Ukrainian civilians are also travelling with us in the bus. The Ukrainian forces have been stopping the buses at multiple checkpoints to ensure that there are no Russians amongst us to cause trouble. So far, the journey looks safe, but in Sumy, there was continuous shelling and bombing before the ceasefire was announced,” said Rawoof, a student who was on board the bus to Poltava.

Mohammed Abdul Bari, another student who spoke to The Probe, said that many students who were in the process of being evacuated the first time almost stepped onto the bus but had to back off after the ceasefire was compromised. “Earlier in the morning, we were being evacuated because they agreed for a ceasefire, but as soon as a girl boarded the bus, they had to immediately get off the bus as the ceasefire was compromised the first time around because of which we got stuck.”
