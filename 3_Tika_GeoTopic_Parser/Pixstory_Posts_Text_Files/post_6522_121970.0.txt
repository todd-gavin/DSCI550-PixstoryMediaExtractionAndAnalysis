In the backdrop of the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, several social media users have shared an image of Nobel laureate Dr Amartya Sen along with the following statements: “Sri Lanka is ahead of India in Happiness Index, Sri Lanka is doing far better than India in Hunger Index, Sri Lanka has done better than India in GDP Index too.” Due to the nature of the graphic, viewers can misinterpret these statements as quotes by Sen.

Alt News has received multiple requests on our WhatsApp helpline (76000 11160) to verify the authenticity of this claim.

It must be noted that the timeline of the alleged statements is not clear. Several users claim that Dr Sen’s statements date back to one year (1, 2), while several others claim two years (1,2,3,4). Twitter user AreyBangdu shared a graphic in question and claimed that these statements were made two years ago.

A screenshot of AreyBangdu’s tweet has been widely shared on social media. Facebook page Kashmiri Pundit posted the screenshot and garnered over 1000 likes and 345 shares. Another page called Pradhanmantri Meme Yojana posted this screenshot and garnered 1500 likes and almost 300 shares.

Some tweets have also cited Dr Sen’s 2013 book ‘An Uncertain Glory: India and its Contradictions’ which he had co-authored with welfare economist Dr Jean Drèze.

The Sri Lankan Economic Crisis
According to a BBC report, many experts blamed the current crisis on former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his failed attempt at providing for the domestic markets. At the end of its civil war in 2009, Sri Lanka imported more and exported less, which led to an increase in import bills while the exports remained low. Consequently, Sri Lanka ran out of foreign currency. Mr Rajapaksa was also criticized for introducing tax cuts, which led to a massive decline in government revenue.
