Constitutional Adviser to Bikaner begins....

AS IT IS often said the future is not for one to see; it shapes itself. 

A new turn came into my career at this stage. 

The Maharaja of Bikaner had offered me the post of Prime Minister on the retirement 
of Mr. Panikkar. I had written to him that so long as I was in Kashmir service I could not take up any other assignment. On 
the 10th February 1948 he again wrote to me as under: 

“The question of your coming to Bikaner is not very much affected by my offer of responsible Government to my people. Of course with the advent of responsible Government there will be no question of your coming as Prime 
Minister of Bikaner or as Dewan. With a popular Prime Minister in a popular Ministry I am of the opinion that the Dewan appointed by the Ruler will never work. Two swords cannot remain in one scabbard. I strongly feel that, new popular Government of Bikaner will require the mature advice and experience of someone like you to assist them and to keep them on the right 
track as they will have little experience in the administration, 

As you know, my Prime Minister Mr. Pannikar is leaving us probably in May and I want 
at my side an administrator of your eminence and experience. I shall there for be grateful if you kindly let me know your decision as soon as you are in a position to do so. Sincerely hoping that you will be able to come and assist us in our new responsible task.” 

As soon as I arrived at my country house at Pathankot I wrote accepting his kind offer. One the 15th March 1948 His Highness 
telegraphically asked me to join his service at the latest by the 20th of March. 

To be continued....
