Radja Nainggolan, a former Inter midfielder, claims he told Romelu Lukaku not to leave the Nerazzurri for Chelsea last summer. Lukaku moved for a second stint at Chelsea in a €115 million deal after leading Inter to the Scudetto last season, but has struggled to match his brilliance at Stamford Bridge this season.

In an interview with FanPage, Nainggolan said that he advised his former Belgium international teammate to fight the move, claiming that if he had stayed at Inter, he could have been the best striker in the world.

“I’ve always said that for me, at Inter he was the best striker in the world because there was a game plan, a coach and a team made for him,” ex-Roma star Nainggolan declared.

“I think that if he had stayed at Inter he could have been the best striker in the world for another four or five years. I told him this and say it again because that’s what I think.”

Lukaku joined Inter from Manchester United in 2019 and scored 64 goals in 95 games, while he has only 12 goals in 38 appearances for Chelsea.

Kai Havertz, a Germany international, has been starting in the center-forward position more frequently recently and has created a number of chances for himself and his teammates.

Lukaku's long-term future has been the subject of speculation since the player spoke out in December about his role in the Chelsea club and his move from Inter Milan, where he was a popular figure and key member in a title-winning side.

The 28-year-old caused a stir when he told Italian media about his dissatisfaction with Chelsea, how he never really wanted to leave Inter, how he would have stayed if the Italian giants had responded to Chelsea's interest with a contract offer of their own, and how he was 'hurt' the Italian giants didn't try harder to keep him.
