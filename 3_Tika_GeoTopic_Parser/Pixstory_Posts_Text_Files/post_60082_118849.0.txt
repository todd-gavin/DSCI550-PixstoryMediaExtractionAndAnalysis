The win of Draupadi Murmu in the presidential election was celebrated as a historic moment by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

According to the home minister, the election of a Santhal lady from a relatively backward region of India as president is a significant success for democracy because it is the first time in the 75 years since India's independence that a woman from that group has held the office.

The home minister said the BJP has "always successfully tried to follow the untrodden path and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has moved this ahead" while discussing how the party has always focussed on choosing presidential candidates from the weaker parts of society.

"Abdul Kalam, the missile man, became president while former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was there. Everyone was shocked; how could the BJP elect Abdul Kalam as President? But the guy who defended the nation and made a name for himself in science will only help to improve the country's reputation. Ram Nath Kovind, a Dalit who comes from the poorest family, became president after Modi was elected prime minister, according to Shah.

He added that many people still do not recognise the significance of the position held by President-elect Murmu in her native region. The election of Murmu is also a fitting reply to "those who talk about tribal empowerment, cause division in society, and only care  about politics."
Murmu's win was a response that real empowerment could not be reached by words alone but by such actions.
