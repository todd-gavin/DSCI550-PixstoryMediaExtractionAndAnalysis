I made a joke yesterday, and jokes on me I made a typo in it and changed the meaning of the joke entirely. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That being said, it does take us to an interesting conversation. Was Jesus Christ white as portrayed in many western media?
Jesus spoke Hebrew and Arabic. He was proficient in a number of regional languages and spoke Hebrew, Aramaic, and Egyptian. Afro-Asian languages make up the Semitic family ‚Äî Arabic and ancient Egyptian are some of these languages. The language of the Ancient Hebrews is also Semitic.
Egypt is home to the first known depiction of Jesus. He has some African ancestry, if not all of it. At the time of Jesus, Hebrews never referred to themselves as Jews in any historical context. Even some churches in Southern Europe include images of Mary and Jesus that are of African descent. 
Jesus may or may not have been black or brown, but he was most definitely white as concluded by many historians.
