I turned in February this year only so that was the first time I got chance to donate blood I ve donated it once only till now as women can anyways donate every four months They checked my blood group my weight and my eligibility to donate blood and I was eligible I used to be scared of needles as a kid but not anymore I just laid there on the bed and i have this habit of looking away even if I m not scared I won t look at them needling my skin and taking out blood So it hurt for initial couple of minutes but then it didn t After the process was completed I was given refreshments and it was an amazing experience overall for me My mom however was that pleased with it she told me not to do it again as I m already weak or so she thinks But months have almost passed and I might donate again in june now
