Background Depressive symptoms and mood disorders are associated with a host of physical conditions However it is inconclusive whether depressive symptoms are also associated with cancer onset The aim of this study was to investigate whether depressive symptoms are associated with cancer incidence in a large population based sample of men and women Methods This study examined data from waves two HUNT and three HUNT of the Tr ndelag Health Study HUNT Depressive symptoms were ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS D cancer onset was identified via linkage with the Cancer Registry of Norway death records by the national Cause of Death Register CDR and information on lifestyle and demographic factors was self reported Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test associations Unadjusted age adjusted and multivariable best models accounting for smoking education marital status and current employment are presented Results Men and women n men were followed from baseline over a period of person years During the year study period there were individuals with incident cancers and deaths n attributed to cancer For men with depressive symptoms developed incident cancer during the follow up period whereas among those without depressive symptoms developed incident cancer Following adjustment for age depressive symptomology was not significantly associated with risk of overall cancer onset nor among prostate colon or melanoma subtypes Depressive symptoms were associated with an increased risk of bronchus and lung cancer both before HR CI p and after adjustment for age HR CI p However further adjustment for additional possible confounders explained this association For women with depressive symptoms developed incident cancer during the follow up period whereas among those with no depressive symptomology developed incident cancer After accounting for age depressive symptomology was not associated with risk of overall cancer onset nor among breast colon lung and bronchus or melanoma subtypes Source
