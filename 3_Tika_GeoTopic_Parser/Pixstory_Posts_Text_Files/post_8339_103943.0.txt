Rafael Nadal proved his ‘King of Clay’ status as he beat Novak Djokovic in a commanding manner 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6(4) in the French Open Men’s Quarter-finals, late night on Tuesday.

13 times champion Rafael Nadal came back from 2-5 down in the 4th set to beat World No. 1 and defending champion Djokovic and reach the semifinals at Roland Garros for a record 15th time.

Officially, it was a quarterfinal set-up, but the way both the champions had played against each other made it look like a perfect grand finale event from the quality of play to the quality of effort and the atmosphere that it had created in the packed gathering at Roland Garros.

In the post-match presser, Nadal said: "To win against Novak, there is only one way — to play at your best from the first point to the last and tonight has been one of those magical nights for me".

Rafa, however, maintains he can’t know for sure whether any match at Roland Garros might be his very last at a place he loves, a place he is loved!

For now, if he keeps winning and keeps executing the way he did during his memorable quarterfinal victory over his old foe, Djokovic which began in May and ended in June, Nadal will have more chances to play.

Rafa is now 110-3 for his career at the place. Two of those came against Djokovic, including in last year’s semifinals. This time, however, he made sure Djokovic remains behind him in the Slam count with 20!

It's worth noting here that Nadal broke their three-way tie with Roger Federer at that number by capturing the Australian Open in January when Djokovic was not able to play because of his Covid-19 vaccination saga.

Without an iota of doubt, Rafael Nadal is the most inspiring athlete ever. Living with a foot injury at age 36, having far from ideal preparations for French Open, playing against his great rival and the No. 1 in conditions unfavourable for him, and still ending up on the winning side.

Truly remarkable, a champion of all virtues !!
