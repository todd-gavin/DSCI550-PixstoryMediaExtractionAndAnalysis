Gregory, the father figure of Australian
 sporting dynasties, died at the age of 74.

Born in Wollongong in 1845, he will be forever etched in the annals of Australian cricket folklore for that moment in 1877 at the MCG against England when he led Australia out in what became the first cricket Test ever played.

Gregory and four of his seven brothers all represented New South Wales in international and intercolonial matches. Dave was NSW's tenth First Class captain, and his brother Ned had captained the state six years before.

At the age of 31, Dave Gregory led an Australian team of six Victorians and five New South Welshmen against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from March 15 to 19, 1877, in what is now known as the first Test match.

He was the first of 46 Australian Test cricket captains, with wicketkeeper Tim Paine currently leading Australia in his first Ashes series.

He died in Turramurra, north of Sydney, after a life that was so influential in the development of Australian cricket.
