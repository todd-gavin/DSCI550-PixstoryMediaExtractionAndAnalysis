Burak Yilmaz, a veteran Turkey player, was kicked out of the World Cup qualifiers after missing the target with a penalty kick that would have tied the play-off with Portugal on Thursday.

Following Otavio and Diogo Jota's first-half goals, the Lille striker, 36, had hauled his club back into the game with a goal to make it 2-1.

But, with just six minutes left on the clock, Yilmaz sent a shot into the stratosphere, much to the relief of Portugal, who went on to secure the game through Matheus and book a spot in the final versus North Macedonia.

What has been said?

After the game, which saw Yilmaz earn his 77th cap and register a 31st goal for his country, the experienced frontman announced that he will be heading into international retirement.

He told reporters at the end of an emotional night for all concerned: “I don’t know how I didn’t score, I'm still in shock. We upset our country. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. This was my last World Cup chance. As of today, this is over.

“I said to myself it was a definite goal when we got the penalty. I started thinking about the future. I am disappointed because I never thought about missing it. I'm sorry. I'm going to score this penalty every night of my life, maybe without sleep, in my dreams.

“I wouldn't want to quit after a game like this, but I don't think it's right to continue. Thank you to my coaches. My decision to quit is not emotional. I make this decision logically. If extreme, unbelievable situations occur, then I will help.

“Our country needs to pass the flag on to our young friends. The new generation, the new structure. This is the right thing. My decision is not a result of disappointment, nor is it about a penalty. I think our brothers will do what is necessary from now on.”
