Q So what care should we take A We have to learn to live with the virus and start our life back So schools are important If the child is not well or someone in the family has Covid dont send the child to school Covid approprate behaviour has to be followed We all need to remember there were more grave threats to our children prior to covid we all still did send our children to school as we have learnt to live with those threats by taking appropriate steps Development of the kids not just education but social emotional development and development in other domains of life is only possible through physical schooling So I will say one of the most grave damage Covid has done is by closing of schools children have lost their important two years of learning which will affect them in one or the other way in future We have to keep our irrational fears aside and send kids to schools It has been proven world wide Only India has had such a prolonged closure of schools Its our duty to protect our children but its also their right to get better education Q We often come across these WhatsApp forwards in family work groups talking about one immune booster concoction or other for children How far should we trust this information A Within this pandemic we are fighting another pandemic that is infodemic misinformation pandemic Misinformation is on all social media platforms Any path breaking discovery or magical pills which is forwarded on whatsapp should make us wary Also information has to be from authentic sources like news organisations or bodies like ICMR or government other than that we should trust nothing Don t trust anything specially the ones which say in the end to share it with as many people as possible The key is to have a healthy lifestyle eat healthy wake up in time sleep in time Having some sort of physical activity Have a balanced diet and make sure your children do the same
