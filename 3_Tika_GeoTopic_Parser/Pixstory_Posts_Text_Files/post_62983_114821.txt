I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation I will quote to you brethren a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest boyhood which is every day repeated by millions of human beings As the different streams having their sources in different paths which men take through different tendencies various though they appear crooked or straight all lead to Thee The present convention which is one of the most august assemblies ever held is in itself a vindication a declaration to the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita Whosoever comes to Me through whatsoever form I reach him all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me Sectarianism bigotry and its horrible descen dant fanaticism have long possessed this beautiful earth They have filled the earth with vio lence drenched it often and often with human blood destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair Had it not been for these horrible demons human society would be far more advanced than it is now But their time is come and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honor of this convention may be the death knell of all fanaticism of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal
