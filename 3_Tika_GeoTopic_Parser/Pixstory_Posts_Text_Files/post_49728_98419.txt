Canada comments on the Roe v s Wade situation in America Karina Gould minister of families children and social development of Canada said that American women will be able to obtain abortions in Canada if the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade and leaves the abortion law to the state level When asked about the same she said I don t see why we would not If they people come here and need access certainly you know that s a service that would be provided Gould also expressed her concern about Canadian women who might be affected by overturning Roe v s Wade One of t concerning factors here is that there are many Canadian women who maybe don t live near a major city in Canada but will often access these services in the United States she said I m very concerned about the leak yesterday I m very concerned about what this means particularly for American women but also for Canadian women Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau used Twitter to ensure his support for women s reproductive rights without precisely mentioning the leak from the U S Supreme Court The right to choose is a woman s right and a woman s right alone he said Every woman in Canada has a right to safe and legal abortion We ll never back down from protecting and promoting women s rights in Canada and around the world There would have been no problem if everyone allowed women want they wanted and doesn t bring their beliefs into the state and the judgements but we all know what most states will do if they have the power Source CBC
