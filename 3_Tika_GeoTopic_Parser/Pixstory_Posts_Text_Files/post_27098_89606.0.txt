According to The Hollywood Reporter, Netflix's Marilyn Monroe biopic (starring Ana De Armas) has officially been rated NC-17 for sexual content.

Director Andrew Dominik has previously predicted that the film would get an NC-17 rating, stating:

"It's a demanding movie. If the audience doesn't like it,
that's the f****** audience's problem. It's not running for public office. It's an NC-17 movie about Marilyn Monroe, it's kind of what you want, right? I want to go and see the NC-17 version of the Marilyn Monroe story."

Dominik also said Netflix "insisted" on hiring editor
Jennifer Lame (Tenet) to "to curb the excesses of the
movie," which includes a rape scene that was also in
Oates' book
