Meat as a protein source isn't the healthiest, study after study suggest. Plant-based protein is considerably superior to animal-based protein. Plant-based diets are often considered to be healthier. In fact, according to a 2017 review published in the International Journal of Epidemiology that looked at 95 studies, eating five servings of plants per day reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke slightly, and increasing that to ten servings per day reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by 28% and overall death by 31%.

You won't be any worse off if you replace all that animal protein with an equally diverse diet of plant-based proteins like nuts, seeds, and beans. This is due to the fact that these foods have a similar range of nutrients.

Andrea Giancoli, a certified dietician in California, claims that plant-based proteins are considerably healthier than their meat counterparts because they have the same nutritional profile. That's because they pack more nutrients into fewer calories per pound. They also contain fibre, which is absolutely lacking in animal proteins. The only nutrient a lot of plants don't directly produce is Vitamin B12, but there are very easy alternatives to get it.

Switching to a plant based diet is practically win-win. You dodge cardiovascular diseases, don't hurt animals, get the right nutrients and the food is damn delicious!
