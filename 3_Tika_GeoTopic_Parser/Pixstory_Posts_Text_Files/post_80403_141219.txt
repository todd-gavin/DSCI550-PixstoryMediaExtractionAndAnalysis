Not playing in Europe may have been a blessing in disguise Arsenal could solely focus on the Premier League without the struggles of resting players for midweek fixtures as much as their rivals like Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur This led to an overall good season for the club The Gunners missed out on Champions League football by only a couple of points However the Gunners did secure fifth place meaning they have qualified for the Europa League Now in the current campaign Arsenal are so far managing well in the Premier League as well as in Europe losing only one game to Manchester United Despite that loss the Gunners have won every game they ve played Arteta has been backed and given the funds to bring in his players to play his style of football Players such as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus joined the London club this Summer and have gelled in quickly Arsenal have an identity now and are a formidable opponent for any club Whether Arteta can guide Arsenal to a fourth Premier League title will depend largely on the world cup Arteta will hope all his players remain fit and don t get injured during their time away He will also have to get his squad back together after what will be an emotional world cup for many of them and re focus them on the league Managers like Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp are better suited to these sorts of challenges as more experienced coaches soit will be interesting to see how Arteta compares to these managers Ultimately Mikel Arteta will have a tough challenge ahead of him and although he has all the potential to win aPremier League title with Arsenal it is unlikely this will be his season
