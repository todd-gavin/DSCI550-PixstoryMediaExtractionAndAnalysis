Embassy advised not to travel in Kyiv and instructed those travelling from western parts of Kyiv to return to their respective cities.

As you are aware, Ukraine is under martial law, which has made movement difficult… We are aware that certain places are hearing air sirens/ bomb warnings. In case you are faced with such a situation, Google Maps has a list of nearby bomb shelters, many of which are located in underground metros,” the Indian Embassy said in its advisory.

More than 20,000 Indian nationals, including students, are staying in different parts of Ukraine.
India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said :  "We are facilitating the return of all Indian nationals, including Indian students, as required."

With Ukraine closing its airspace, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is sending teams “to the land borders… in Hungary, Poland, Slovak Republic and Romania” to assist in the evacuation of Indian nationals stranded in the country.While Russia is attacking from eastern side, these countries share boundaries with Ukraine in the west.

Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the colleges have conceded to hold online classes, so the students can leave the country without worrying disturbance in their studies.

“Our Embassy in Ukraine is functional and its advisories should be followed carefully,” said a source.
