Naman Chawla a resident of Bahadurgarh, Haryana is a Journalism student and since the beginning of his teenage years, he found a way to get eloped from his fear and sorrow through the art of writing.

While growing up he realised that writing down his feelings always gave him satisfaction and peace no matter if it was his happiness or sorrow. 

He got his primary education from a government school and experienced a childhood fear and grew up being a silent kid but got a virtue of playing with the words to pen up the chaos happening inside him. Along with his academics, he is also a co-author of Anthology (words of paradise), Just Because I Smile, and Words of a Scribbler along with this he has also performed in many open mic shows.

 His Instagram handles baleful_soul has so much poetry that is written by him.

Currently, he is writing his poetry book.
"When your heart aches feed it love as much as you can 
Don't be a bugbear for your thoughts", he said 
Poetry is an essence of beauty and he loves to have insight into classical poets life's  path and he lives his life with a quill and paper with him every time.
Charles Bukowski and Emily Dickinson's life gives him a full-fledged arcadia.
