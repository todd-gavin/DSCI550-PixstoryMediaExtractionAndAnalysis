Amid what seems the countdown to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, French president Emmanuel Macron made a last-ditch effort to avert the military action, brokering a meeting between US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The two have agreed ‘in principle’ to meet, but given the increasingly belligerent stance from both sides, the meet – if it takes place at all – is not expected to resolve the crisis.

Amid continued heavy shelling in eastern Ukraine, Macron burnt some midnight oil late Sunday and got the two leaders to agree to a meet, but it seems only tentative as of now. The summit schedule and agenda will be decided when secretary of state Antony Blinken meets Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov this week.

There were no indications of the start of any preparations. The Kremlin spokesman said it was “too early” to talk about plans to organize any summits: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/21/world/ukraine-russia-putin-biden  

The White House press secretary meanwhile repeated that the US is committed to pursue diplomatic options but added that the talks could happen only “if an invasion hasn’t happened”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/20/ukraine-russia-invasion-sanctions-blinken/ 

The added comments, in tune with the repeated remarks from the US officials that Putin has made all preparations to strike, do not inspire much faith in the talks. From the other side, it is not words but deeds that create tensions. As a precursor to the military action, Russia held military drills in neighboring Belarus, deploying 30,000 troops there. It had promised to remove them by Sunday. They have not moved yet. Russia has placed more than 150,000 soldiers at the Ukrainian border – said to the largest military buildup in Europe since World War II.

The summit, if held, will have to consider Russia’s demands – already rejected by the Western powers – that they guarantee NATO won’t allow Ukraine and other former Soviet countries to join it as members: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-boris-johnson-europe-emmanuel-macron-2b7c2949ae3168effce9d0cb2584bb32 It also wants them to stop weapons deployments to this tiny neighboring country and roll back NATO forces from Eastern Europe. The other issue at the meet could be the “strong” sanctions the US is threatening on Russia as deterrents.
