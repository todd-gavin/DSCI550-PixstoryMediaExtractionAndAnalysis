We get frustrated and tensed over many issues at a certain point in our life It gets go intense that we feel this is the end of everything Even after the incident we clung to it Yes this is completely unintentional up to some point but after some point clinging on to memories or people is intentional Those thoughts or people that damage your mental health aren t good for you still you hold on because you possibly don t k ow what s next You are not able to accept that change happening to you Learning to let growth hence resonates with growth as you leave certain aspects to find new realms of yourself You have a very different and fulfilling life because it s all about what you want You are not obligated to anything or anyone Letting go makes you grow New aspects and change always result in the growth of a person so never be afraid to go in search of new lands
