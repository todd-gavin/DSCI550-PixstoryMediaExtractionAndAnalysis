I m not much into Opera even though I admire the skills that get into it I don t hate it but I don t love it I don t mind listening to it sometimes here and there but it s not something I plug into myself But I also think opera doesn t have the same essence as it used to have during the times of our grandparents My grandfather believes it has lost much of its cultural significance and cutting edge aspect Yes it is significant in the modern art world but it no longer has a driving influence on entertainment or culture which is unfortunate It has an unjustified reputation for being elitist reserved only for the affluent or upper society or snobbish and cerebral It s none of the above It s a type of entertainment and it s no different than going to the movies to be entertained I m curious as to what all of your opinion on opera is
