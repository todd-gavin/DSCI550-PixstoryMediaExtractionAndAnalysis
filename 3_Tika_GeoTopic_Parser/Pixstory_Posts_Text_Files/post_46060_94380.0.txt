From getting your feet washed on Holy Thursday to donning your best Easter bonnet to baking hot cross buns, thereâ€™s guaranteed to be a moment you remember. 

Some traditions, like visiting with the Easter bunny or attending a pastel-drenched parade, may already be a part of your holiday. Others, such as sending Easter lilies, decorating an Easter tree, or heading outside to fly a kite on Good Friday, may be new fodder for your celebration. 

One which comes to my mind is Easter lilies. Easter lilies have long been associated with purity and hope in civilizations all around the world. The flowers are thought to have grown where Christ's blood and tears fell during his crucifixion and in the Garden of Gethsemane following his betrayal. 

And how can we forget the eggs! There's a reason we're still dying Easter eggs today: it's a tradition passed down from generation to generation. With these cute Easter egg decorating ideas, you can put your own spin on the ritual.
