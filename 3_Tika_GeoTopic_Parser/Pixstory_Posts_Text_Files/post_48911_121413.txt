Both companies and consumers frequently use the two labels Vegan and Cruelty Free interchangeably however they do not mean the same thing It can be difficult to navigate the cruelty free and vegan beauty world but I ll try to make it easier for you What s the difference between vegan and cruelty free Short Answer Cruelty Free refers to the absence of animal experimentation whereas Vegan refers to the absence of animal derived substances or by products as well as being cruelty free However companies mislabel a product of being vegan even if it was tested on animals So if you re actually looking for products that are truly vegan you might have to do your research well Isn t it illegal for brands to lie about being cruelty free vegan Unfortunately there are no legal or standard definitions for the terms cruelty free and vegan This means that businesses can use these labels in whatever way they want without fear of repercussions or accountability This is why it s critical that we understand what these designations signify and who might be trying to mislead or deceive us There are now four certifying organisations that all audit and accredit cruelty free and vegan companies and goods When you see their logos on product packaging it implies that the issuing organisation has confirmed that the product company does not test on animals and does not contain animal products or animal derived ingredients See Cover Photo
