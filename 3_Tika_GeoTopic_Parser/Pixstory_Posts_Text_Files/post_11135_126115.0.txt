There's a reason why rice is among the most commonly eaten grains all over the world. It's super versatile, and can be adapted to complement a wide range of flavor profiles and dishes. Plus, there are many varieties to choose from (more than 120,000, if you want to get technical!). Food & Wine reports that rice comprises a staggering one-fifth of total calories consumed globally. 


White rice, also known as enriched rice, is one of the most popular types. White rice is refined rice, meaning it has been milled to remove the outer husk, bran layers, and germ. Despite its prevalence, white rice tends to get a bad rap because of how it's processed, especially as compared to its more nutritious whole grain cousin, brown rice. You may have heard white rice described as a "bad carb" or source of empty calories. However, is it worth skipping over it completely?

There are some surprising side effectsâ€”both good and not so good. 

1 You may have more energy ;
White rice is a source of carbohydrates, which is the main source of fuel for your body," says Manaker. "Plus, many varieties of white rice, at least in the U.S., are fortified with B- vitamins that may help support energy levels as well."

According to research published in the journal, Nutrients, all the B vitamins, with the exception of folate, are involved in at least one step (if not more) of the energy-production system within the cell. With that being said, it is essential to get a dose of each B vitamin for gaining energy. And, too little of it will limit your body's energy production, which can potentially have a negative impact on your metabolic and general health.


2 You may ingest arsenic ;
Arsenic has been found in rice, so when you consume this grain, you can be ingesting this element too," she says. Although white rice is lower in arsenic than brown rice, it's still important to avoid consuming too much and to vary your grains.
