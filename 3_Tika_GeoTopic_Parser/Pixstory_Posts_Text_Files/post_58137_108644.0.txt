It is the Taiwanese version of the Japanese manga by the same name . The manga written by Yoshiki Nakamura  was very popular among shoujo manga fans . The Taiwanese version does justice to the manga  characters and is fun and engaging .Though not very famous you(it came out in 2011) should check it out . With the opening theme by Super Junior M being my favourite.It stares Siwon and Ivy chen in lead roles.
