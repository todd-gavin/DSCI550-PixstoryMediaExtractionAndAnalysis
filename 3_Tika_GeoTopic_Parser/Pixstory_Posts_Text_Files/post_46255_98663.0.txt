Do you ever wake up and you remember all the stuff you have to do , and you just want to hide under the covers and not come out ?? Well , I can feel you because i too feel this ! 😅🥱

For me ? it’s a task to get myself off The bed when the alarm rings . 🥱

But One thing we cannot Deny is *The tone of your morning will determine the tone of your day* ! Yaa That's True ! ✅
you also have the power to start your day on a super positive note each and every day .🌸

So today , I have brought to you some tips to start your day positively , right from the moment you wake up :

1 Stay Away From Your Sleep .
2 Think Of 5 Things You are Grateful For .
3 Meditate For 5 Min .
