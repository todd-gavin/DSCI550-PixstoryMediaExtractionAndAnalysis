I once read somewhere in a Narcissistic relationship more than the abuser the victim suffers Narcissistic abuse is emotional abuse where the abuser is suffering from a mental condition called narcissistic personality disorder or NPD We might feel we all live in a Narcissistic world but let s blame social media and the casual approach of people toward mental illness Some victims who suffered from NPD may sustain lifelong damage and might need serious help and counselling to survive and overcome the abusive episode Narcissism is a personality trait narcissistic personality disorder is a mental illness According to Mayo Clinic a person with a narcissistic personality disorder has an inflated sense of their importance a deep need for excessive attention and admiration troubled relationships and a lack of empathy for others Survivors or victims of NPD often struggle with symptoms like PTSD and chronic PTSD The victims also tend to develop anxiety and depression and feel completely lost and hopeless losing a sense of self worth and living under constant stress According to data provided by Healthline NPD may affect up to of the population and is slightly more common in men than women People suffering from NPD often have problems in multiple areas of their life including work and personal relationships For the victims of NPD it does get difficult to diagnose the ongoing abuse cycle especially to pinpoint what they are experiencing as NPD abusers often twist and turn reality to victims trying to suit their own needs often engaging in intense love bombing after abusive incidents and convince their victims that they are the ones who are abusers Physically also NPD victims suffer symptoms including headaches stomach aches or body aches After experiencing Narcissistic abuse they also have difficulty sleeping and feel stressed about what happened and find it difficult to shut off their brain at night Also victims end up having nightmares that haunt them for days afterward Hence it s important to achieve diagnostic clarity for narcissistic personality disorder and find effective treatment so abusers can help themselves and save themselves from the toxic abusive cycle of Narcissists
