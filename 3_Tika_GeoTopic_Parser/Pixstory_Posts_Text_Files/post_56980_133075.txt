Although the idea of toxicity should not prevail the lesser observed sight of fandoms is often ignored The sights where most of the fans are kind open and generous and instead fan communities are places of genuine acceptance this still makes the fandom worthwhile despite whatever fuss has been created because of the toxic fandoms The point I want to put here is adopting a fan identity or deeply investing yourself in something is not necessarily wrong I mean negativity will exist no matter how long we support good and genuine ideas that could only be annihilated when we ultimately discourage or stand against every wrong happening but it never happens There are always two sides to everything and so is the case of fandoms we can t just go on blaming it to fan identities and feeling personally attached to something it happens with everything in our life not just celebrities or the famous stuff we know What I mean here is that people always feel threatened about everything they love whether their family or anything Well the act of defending should not reach the heights of threatening or prosecuting someone using social media or any other medium There should be a fine line between everything which should be considered even during this whole idea of adopting a fan identity and defending someone
