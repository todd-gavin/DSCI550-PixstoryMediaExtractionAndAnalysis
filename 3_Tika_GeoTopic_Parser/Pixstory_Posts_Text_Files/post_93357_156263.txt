 I will have a great day Everything will be fine Take a deep breath and stop Calm down No need to react on each and everything Try to understand other s point of view as well YOU can also be WRONG many times Be patient Wait Don t get angry Be quiet don t comment on everything shhhhh Stop criticizing everything See the best in everything and tell it You are the best Just be yourself Self affirmations may appear to be a stupid idea However just following these and repeating them on regular basis truly makes one powerful and positive
