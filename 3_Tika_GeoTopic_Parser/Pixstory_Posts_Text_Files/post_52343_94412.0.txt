A nationally significant heritage-listed building with commanding views of Martin Place is undergoing a three-street facelift that will ensure its preservation for future generations.

The majestic Commercial Palazzo-style building at 343 George Street will undergo staged remediation work over several years, with the total work and project costing around $16.6 million.

The building, which has 11 office floors, ground floor retail, and basement storage, is now home to well-known companies such as Atlassian and Burberry.

"It's where people gather, where we host major cultural events, where we display our largest Christmas tree, and where some of the nation's most enduring traditions, such as the Anzac Day dawn service, take place." It is critical to ensure the long-term viability of the heritage-listed buildings that frame this space and line our newly pedestrianised George Street boulevard.


From the 1850s until its merger with the National Bank in the 1980s, 343 George Street housed the headquarters of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. The building, known as Barrack House, was built in two stages between 1921 and 1925.

Dr Lisa Murray, a City of Sydney historian, described the landmark building as a "significant example of the city's interwar architecture" that should be preserved.

The first stage of work on the Barrack Lane façade will begin in June with remediation of the cement render, concrete, steel and bronze windows, and copper weatherings. This stage is scheduled to be finished by December 2023.
