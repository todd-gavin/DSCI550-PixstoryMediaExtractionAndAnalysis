Abstract Background and aims Gestational diabetes mellitus GDM is one of the commonest medical complications of pregnancy Annexin A ANXA is a protein found in apical surfaces of syncytiotrophoblasts which prevents fetal and placental vascular thrombosis in GDM Apelin is a bioactive peptide which has been linked to GDM The aim of the present study was to correlate macroscopic as well as microscopic changes and immunohistochemical expression of ANXA and apelin in placentae of GDM with maternal and neonatal clinical features and also to compare the results with those in matched controls Methods This prospective observational study was undertaken for a period of one year from April to March It comprised of patients of GDM Gross features microscopic features and intensity and grade of expression of ANXA and Apelin were analysed in placentae of GDM Results Morphological changes detected in GDM placentae included increased immature villi cases increased syncytial knots perivillous fibrin deposition fibrosis of villous stroma presence of nucleated red blood cells and hypervascularity The extent of histopathological changes noted in GDM placentae was significantly higher than that in matched controls GDM placentae showed significantly reduced expression of ANXA and Apelin in terms of grade and intensity when compared with matched controls Reduced expression mild intensity of ANXA was noted in GDM cases whereas apelin expression was of weak intensity in cases Among GDM patients statistically significant association was noted between ANXA intensity and neonatal resuscitation apelin grade and preterm birth as well as low birth weight and apelin intensity and requirement of treatment in sick neonatal care unit Clinicopathological study and immunohistochemical analysis of expression of annexin A and apelin in human placentae of gestational diabetes mellitus Conclusion The placental expression of the proteins ANXA and Apelin is altered in GDM though their exact pathogenetic mechanisms are yet to be understood They can be targets for development of prophylactic and therapeutic agents in future Keywords ANXA ApelinClinicopathological analysisGestational diabetes mellitusPlacenta
