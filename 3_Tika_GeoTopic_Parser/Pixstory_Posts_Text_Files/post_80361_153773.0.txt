Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) faced Reims in a Ligue 1 fixture at the Stade Auguste-Delaune II. However, the outing wasn’t productive for the current table toppers as they dropped two points.
The game was a frustrating one from PSG’s angle as they failed to breach the opponent’s defense. PSG, in the absence of Lionel Messi, could take only 3 shots on target throughout the game.
The game wasn't even controversy-proof as Sergio Ramos’ red card sparked mixed reactions from the fans. Just four minutes before half-time, Ramos committed a foul for which he was punished with a yellow card.
However, his fiery reaction to the referee attracted a second card, eventually commanding him to back off the pitch. This didn’t settle well with the rest of his teammates as they all grouped around the referee for his strict doings.

Marco Verratti, Achraf Hakimi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe were the other names from the PSG side who received yellow cards in the game.
PSG angry about the sent-off
PSG responded angrily after Sergio Ramos received the 28th red card of his career. While manager Christophe Galtier said that he wasn’t convinced with the referee, Ramos’ teammate Danilo Pereira demanded better control of such situations.
Manager Christophe Galtier said: "I am not convinced that the insult [Ramos was sent off for] was even directed at the referee."
“I think the referee needs to handle the situation better. There is no reason for that. It irritates us because we want to play football but like that, it's complicated,” Danilo Pereira told Canal+.
Although the game ended in a no-goal draw, PSG continue to own the No.1 position in the points table. They will next lock horns against Benfica in a Champions League fixture on Wednesday.
