Beyoncé’s 10-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, joined her mom onstage at the 2022 Academy Awards on Sunday night while performing her Oscar-nominated song “Be Alive.”

Blue Ivy was spotted in the group of dancers performing alongside the singer live from Compton, Calif. — the hometown of “King Richard” subjects Venus and Serena Williams.

Fans immediately took to Twitter to talk about the singer and her daughter, who opened this year’s show donning tennis-inspired outfits.

“Be Alive” marks Beyoncé’s first Oscar nomination, even while many expected the superstar to receive a nomination for her work on 2019’s “Spirit,” featured on “The Lion King” soundtrack after receiving a Golden Globe nomination.
