I totally think Harry Potter books are worth reading I am a huge potterhead myself There s a reason why it s called one of the best selling books ever Having sold more than million copies worldwide J K Rowling s Harry Potter has gone down in history as the best selling book series ever Most people in my generation have at least heard of the name Harry Potter But for those who grew up with Harry Potter it was a different experience altogether Even if you do not enjoy the fantasy genre there will be something in there that you can relate to Also since the Harry Potter series is a children s book it s pretty easy to read The Harry Potter book series is a living example that screams Do not judge a book by its cover What some may see as just another silly children s storybook filled with magic witchcraft and wizardry which is not wrong are in for a ride
