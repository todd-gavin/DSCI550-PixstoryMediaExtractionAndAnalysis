To my future lover,
I don’t know where are you, right now. But my heart knows, you will find me someday, and once you find me, i’m not letting you go. Even if you put ketchup in biryani, or like pineapples in your pizza. 
I know I am a difficult person to love, thankyou for dealing with my shit. When i’m feeling low, come sit beside me, get me some chocolate ice-cream and oreos. Don’t try to fix my ‘problems’ just listen. That’s enough.  🦋

If you or i ever mess this up, know that we can still work this out. I know we can. I will look you in the eye and apologise . I will own up to my mistakes. And i hope you do the same, if you ever mess up. We’ll find a way to love again. We will.☺️

There’s a fair chance that my best friend or my dad won’t like you. You don’t have to worry about them. I will give you a tutorial on how to win their hearts. You will be able to do it. I expect the same, just so you know.

And i like my own space, i hope you do,too. So when i tell you that i need some time away from you, it doesn’t mean i’m avoiding you or there’s something wrong. I just need some me-time . That me-time is really important for me and us.

I know i haven’t met you. There were moments when i thought, i had they’ve thoroughly disappointed me. So much so that i am scared of love. I know you might be, too. So when you do fined me, please be patient . That’s all i’m asking for.
Trust me, once i know, you’re the one, i will not let you go, you will be the butter to my chicken . Lets find each other soon.

Love,
Someone who you haven’t met. 💖🥂
