For so long The Bollywood has given us the unwanted and astonishing blockbusters over these many years. Whether its the dialogues, the songs, script, story, scenario; Bollywood has never let the audience down on the hopes but recently the world famous Bollywood of our India has been dwindling recently. I would cut short in the following points:

1. Firstly, Most of the recent movies focus on the comedy genre purely and think that's all what audience aim for but it isn't so whereas Hollywood focuses on giving best in every genre and doesn't stick to only one.

2. Indian cinema has proved itself in giving morals through various movies but most of it are documentaries on the real life of a person rather than making up a fictional one to deliver an extraordinary lesson out of it which is exactly what Hollywood does.

3. Next is the upcoming of various films of the superhero franchise either it could be MCU or DCEU both have done fantabulous jobs since 20 years and will continue doing so. On the other hand Bollywood is considered either ignorant in lukewarm in this manner eand it implies that India is lacking such great fantastic minds.

4. Also a major reason is that Hollywood focuses on showing what's waiting in the future and plot is mainly future tech based while our Bollywood movies keeps on acknowledging about our past again and again so we couldn't say what we can have in the future.

5. The technology is being utilised in a large amount by the Hollywood in movie making such as the use of VFX and CGI. The bollywood is lacking in such fields and need to do more. 

6. Bollywood is also stepping in remakes of Hollywood movies itself which indicates the Hollywood has really got some best of them while Hollywood doesn't do this at all which is lacking point of bollywood.

So in these ways our Bollywood is completely dwindled away in comparison to the Hollywood.
