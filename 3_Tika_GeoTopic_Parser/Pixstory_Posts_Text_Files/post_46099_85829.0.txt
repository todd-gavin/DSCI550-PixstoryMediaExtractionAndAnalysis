"We're now to the stage where at every press conference [President Biden] is asked, 'Will there be a nuclear war?'" said "Saturday Night Live" Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost this weekend. 

Fox News reported that as he invaded Ukraine in late February, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West with nuclear retaliation, stating that any country that interfered would face "such repercussions as you have never encountered in your history." 

"Should we be concerned about nuclear war?" a journalist asked Biden at a recent White House briefing, according to Jost. 

"And he responded, 'No,' because what is he going to say?" Jost continued. 'Hell yeah, man!' says the narrator. 'Jack, start digging a bunker!'

Then co-anchor Michael Che turned to domestic politics.

"While many people who attended last Tuesday’s State of the Union speech wore blue and yellow in solidarity with Ukraine," he said, Vice President Kamala Harris wore brown "to do what she’s done for the last year -- disappear into the background."
