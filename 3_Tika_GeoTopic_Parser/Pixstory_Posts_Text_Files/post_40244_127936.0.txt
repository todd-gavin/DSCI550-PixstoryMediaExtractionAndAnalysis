Black cats appear in the folklore of many more cultures as both good and bad omens. In some European folklore, black cats are considered common companions of witches and bringers of misfortune if they happened to cross your path. 

Moreover, a black cat is also associated with bad luck, and sadly, death. Itâ€™s considered bad luck if a black cat crosses your path, and good luck if a white cat crosses your path. Another family member is bound to die if you spot a black cat during a funeral procession. And it's a bad omen if you see a black cat walking away from you. 

Therefore, having or even spotting a black cat is as inauspicious as it gets!
