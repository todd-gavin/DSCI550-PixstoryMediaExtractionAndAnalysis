Apple added a pregnant man emoji to the latest iOS release for the iPhone. The emoji depicts a man cradling his bloated pregnant belly with his hands. Many supporters of the concept that males can become pregnant have praised this decision, while detractors have been less kind.

The inclusion of this new emoji demonstrates the level of credibility accorded to members of very small, fringe minority groups by many on the left.

The vantage point from which those who look at this from perplexes me. Men cannot get pregnant scientifically - this is unquestionable. However, from a sociological viewpoint, the left views gender norms as social constructs; thus, if a person thinks themselves to be a man and happens to become pregnant, then they are a pregnant man.

The issue with this approach is that it doesn't accept science as a whole, rather, it rejects some aspects of science in favor of sociology. They state that there are men and women, but that scientifically these pregnant men are not men because they can get pregnant. In other words, it conflates the male gender and male sex and states that someone can be both a man and not man at the same time.

Ironically, this pregnant man emoji conjures up images of a man with a beer belly or a man who has overindulged. Although the purpose of this effort is inclusivity, this emoji will be used far more often for men who have had too much food or alcohol, as there are so few males who get pregnant and considerably more men who drink and eat.
