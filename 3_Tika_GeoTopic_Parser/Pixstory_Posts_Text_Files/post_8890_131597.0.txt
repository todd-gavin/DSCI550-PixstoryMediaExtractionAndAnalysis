Looking Back : Life in Retirement 
In Retirement continues.....
After my retirement the Managing Committee asked me to interest myself in its affairs, and do my best to restore its premier position in the educational field in India. This work has ever been very near to my heart and I agreed to take it up provided theManaging Committee office was shifted to Delhi. The Committee 
agreed to my request and the office of the Committee and the Society was shifted to Chitragupta Road, New Delhi, in the premises of the Dayanand Higher Secondary School run by the Committee 
in that locality. 
A new committee was elected after the shifting of the office and I took over as President of the Managing Committee which position I still hold.
It may be mentioned that before I quitted my office as Chief Justice, Mr. K. M. Munshi who was then the Governor of U. P. and Chancellor of the University of Allahabad approached me a number of times and tried to persuade me to take up the Vice Chancellorship of that University. As I had no desire to go over to Allahabad for this work, I politely told him that I had no desire to end my days in the holy city of Prayag and that I preferred my home in the Punjab for my retirement. Similarly, the Governor of the Punjab, who was Chancellor of the Punjab University sounded me, whether after retirement, I would take over as Vice-Chancellor of the Punjab University. I had not the least desire to displace the then Vice-chancellor, a personal friend. 
Thus after a few months of my retirement I took over as the President of the D. A. V. College Managing Committee in the year 1955. The Principal of the D. A. V. College, Ambala, asked me to come and preside at its convocation and prize distribution which I did in the second week of March.
