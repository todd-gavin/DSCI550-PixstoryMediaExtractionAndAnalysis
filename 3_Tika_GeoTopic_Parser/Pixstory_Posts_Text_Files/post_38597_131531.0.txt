Man Utd vs Liverpool-The Battle at OT
On Monday night, Manchester United faced Liverpool in their 3rd game of the 2022/23 season. After suffering setbacks against Brighton, and Brentford, United were looking to bounce back stronger. United had another reason to win the must-win game, Last Season they were humbled by the Scousers 5-0, and 4-0. So United and Erik Ten Hag were looking to avoid that.
United’s new signing Casemiro was unveiled in front of the fans. Erik Ten Hag benched both Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo. In place of Maguire, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez started the match. Marcus Rashford started in the middle. Luke Shaw was also dropped for Tyrell Malacia. Erik Ten Hag went with 4-2-3-1, while Liverpool went with 4-3-3 formation.
The match started with gusto, as the two sides went head to head. Anthony Elanga almost scored the first goal, when he missed an open goal to see the ball hit the woodwork, and go away. Allison was clearly beaten. In the 16th minute, Elanga passed to Jadon Sancho, who showed beautiful skill to bamboozle James Milner, to score past Allison Becker to make the lead 1-0.
In the first half, Bruno Fernandes almost scored an own goal, but it hit the post and Lisandro Martinez showed a great presence of mind and cleared the ball from the danger line. 
In the second half, Elanga was replaced with Anthony Martial. In the 53rd minute, a quick counter, Martial sent Rashford a lovely through-ball who slotted past Allison, to make the scoreline 2-0. Rashford who had a poor form last season, was beginning to show his old self, when he terrorized defences with his dizzlying runs.
In the 81st minute, Firmino had his shot blocked by David De Gea, but he couldn’t do about the rebound, which fell on Salah’s head to make the scoreline 2-1. 
United came out as eventual winners, which saw them rise from 20th in the table to 14th, while Liverpool slipped to 16th.
