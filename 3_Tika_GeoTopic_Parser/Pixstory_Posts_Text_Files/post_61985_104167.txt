She Hulk Attorney at Law is the latest of Marvel projects coming to the small screen It s a shame that the series has already been bombarded with criticism most of which stems from genuine concern for the project s success as many people have pointed out that the CGI of the titular character She Hulk looks nothing more than just a poor body paint However there are also those who are bashing it solely because it focuses on a female superhero She Hulk Attorney at Law starring the perfectly cast Tatiana Maslany is about the life of Jennifer Walters who just wants to be a lawyer but then due to certain events starts turning into a green hulking figure just like her cousin Bruce Banner The release of the show s first trailer engulfed into a debate around the character s lack of muscles and about the show s CGI While most fans are excited about the show s release there are those who shudder away when women are properly represented and regardless of what they may have you believe their thought process does finds its roots in misogyny This series will be joining other shows on Marvel Cinematic Universe s roster with women in lead roles such as Echo and Thor Love and Thunder It is likely that these anticipated releases will face a slew of misogynistic and sexist comments as well However She Hulk is getting even more flak because of the intentional tone that it is taking which matches the character s comic book depiction The MCU as always stands accused to be pandering to the Left because this series stars a woman A STRONG WOMAN This is downright ludicrous as most of Marvel s projects have been male centric in the past This series is a much needed piece of media which empowers a muscular woman on her own superhero journey
