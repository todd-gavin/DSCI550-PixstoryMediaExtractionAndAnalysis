Remove Phone From Bedroom
Place the phone to charge in the kitchen. Allow yourself to go to bed without your phone. If there is an emergency, you will learn about it in the morning. Removing the phone from the bedroom and placing it to charge in another room such as the kitchen, makes it possible to reduce its impact on your sleep.

Get an Alarm Clock
Get an alarm clock instead of using your phoneâ€™s alarm. Although phones can do much, the trade-off of intrusion for convenience is not worth it. Instead, buy an inexpensive alarm clock if you need one to wake up in the morning on time. Put it across the room and set it to the time you need to get up.

Turn off Sleep-Tracking Apps
Some people use their phones to track sleep and wake patterns with various apps or wearable technology. Unfortunately, the accuracy of correlating movement to wakefulness and stillness to sleep is highly suspect.
Moreover, there is no reason to carefully document every movement (or associated awakening) during the night. It may be disruptive to overanalyse sleep.

Make a Buffer Zone
Preserve a buffer zone and minimise light at night. Try to protect the last hour (or two) before bedtime as a time to relax and prepare for sleep. Enjoy some time spent reading, watching television or a movie, or listening to music.

Optimise the Sleep Environment
Consider other ways to enhance your bedroom to make it the ultimate sleep sanctuary. Go to bed when you feel sleepy. If you are awake for longer than 20 minutes at night, get up, do something relaxing, and return to bed when feeling drowsy.

If you are awake in the morning, you might get up and start your day early. Reserve the bed as a space for sleep and sex alone. By making these changes, you will improve the association of the bed as a place for rest.
