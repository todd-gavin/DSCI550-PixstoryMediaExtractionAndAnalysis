The importance of the bench Against Bournemouth Arsenal had Kieran Tierney Emile Smith Rowe Eddie Nketiah Takehiro Tomiyasu and Albert Sambi Lokonga appear off the bench With the addition of five substitutes being allowed this season a strong bench will be crucial for all teams in the league Arsenal will need players who can provide an impact in attack shore up a defence or midfield and change a game plan if neccesary Arsenal s bench can provide exactly that Fabio Vieira was also on the bench against Bournemouth as he returns from injury A player more than capable of providing an impact Should Arsenal sign Pedro Neto from Wolves he will take a place on the bench or possibly push Bukayo Saka or Gabriel Martinelli onto the bench A new signing in the centre of midfield would also likely provide a great option off the bench Mikel Arteta and Arsenal s transfer targets this summer have proved two things One that Arsenal want competition throughout their squad Gabriel Jesus and Nketiah will compete the wingers will compete the attacking midfielders the fullbacks even the centre backs Competition breeds higher levels of performance and benefits the team massively The other thing it proves is Arteta s value of his bench The Spaniard clearly wants impactful options from his bench and any player on it will be eager to prove they deserve to be in the starting line up in the next game Arteta s culture change at Arsenal has created a hungry competitive environment and a squad looking to be their best If Arsenal can achieve their intended signings before the end of the window they will have only furthered that work Arsenal only came from behind to win once last season and part of that failure to impact was the options from the bench Mikel Arteta has very clearly targeted this as an area of improvement and Arsenal will undoubtedly be better equipped when faced with an uphill battle
