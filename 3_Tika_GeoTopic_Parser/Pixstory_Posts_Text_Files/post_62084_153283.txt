Erik ten Hag wants Manchester United to be nastier and smarter as the manager attempts to make them challengers again After United came from behind to beat Omonia Nicosia in Thursday s Europa League group match Ten Hag said he believed they have to add an edge to their play and be more streetwise to avoid needless yellow cards He referenced Diogo Dalot s booking for a challenge on Jack Grealish in the opening moments of Sunday s loss at Manchester City Ten Hag said I know what nasty is in that manner we can progress and sometimes also play a little bit smarter Like we have too many bookings I wonder why we collect so many and I don t understand Like the first booking on Sunday I really don t understand We want to play tough we want to keep the game going and then in the second minute it s already a booking for Diogo Clear it was a foul but a booking Also I saw many other bookings where I think Is that necessary But also take it to the players I have to keep reminding them to play smart but they have to play nasty as well
