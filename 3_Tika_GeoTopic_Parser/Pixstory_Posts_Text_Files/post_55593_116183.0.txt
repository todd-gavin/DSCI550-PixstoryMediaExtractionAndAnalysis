As much as I love Bridgerton, when it comes to period dramas, A Place to Call Home is my favourite! So if you want something other than cliches or if you are just looking for something fresh, try this! 

It is a period drama set in the 50s in rural New South Wales. It follows the fictional life of Sarah Adams (Marta Dusseldorp) as she readjusts to life in Australia after World War II and a mysterious past 20 years spent in France with her husband.

As per collider, whilst settling into her new life back in small town Australia, Sarah becomes well acquainted with the wealthy and aristocratic Bligh family, has several clashes with strict matriarch Elizabeth Bligh (Noni Hazlehurst), and experiences much love and loss throughout the six-season series. Complete with scenic shots of rural Australia and beautiful period sets and fashion, if you likedDownton Abbey,youâ€™ll likely enjoy this Australian counterpart.
