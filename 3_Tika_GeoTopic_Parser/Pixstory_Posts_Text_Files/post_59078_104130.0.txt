In the special screening in New Delhi of Samrat Prithviraj's movie this evening, Home Minister Amit Shah said he not only enjoyed the movie but also got seeped into its importance for Indians.

It's great for the film publicity Home Minister himself talking about a film not only talking but saying it's a good film and watched with family together after 13 years it's a great feat for the film.

And the very interesting part is Home Minister addressing his wife said: "Chaliye Hukum" similar to how the character in the film addressed each other. Could this be any cuter ðŸ¤­

Hope the film does well at the box office. All the best to the team âœ¨
