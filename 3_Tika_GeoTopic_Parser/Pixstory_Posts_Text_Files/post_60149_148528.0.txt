On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to BJP ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and said that his emphasis on "antyodaya" and helping the underprivileged continues to inspire people.

PM Modi has cited his "integral humanism" and antyodaya (uplifting the most disadvantaged) philosophy as the foundation for his government's social welfare policies.
"On the occasion of his birthday, I honour Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Ji. His focus on Antyodaya and helping the underprivileged continues to motivate us. Additionally, he is well-remembered for being a brilliant thinker and intellect "added PM Modi.
