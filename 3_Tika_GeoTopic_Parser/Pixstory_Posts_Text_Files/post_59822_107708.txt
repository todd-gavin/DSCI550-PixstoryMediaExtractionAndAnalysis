I don t think displaying bra straps is a problem Why try to hide the fact that you re wearing a bra It s not like society doesn t know that most women wear them It would be a stretch to believe that all women can afford to purchase a variety of bras to wear under their garments to conceal their bra straps I have two bras one with straps and the other without Bras are expensive and I don t have the finances to buy bras only to appease someone who doesn t want to see my bra strap when I wear a dress or tank top Someone will criticise if I display my bra straps and if I don t wear a bra therefore they should mind their own business and let me go about my business Nobody else s business is my body it belongs to me and only me It s not like you re walking down the street naked if you display your bra strap No woman should be ashamed of her bra strap showing if men can stroll around shirtless with no consequences
