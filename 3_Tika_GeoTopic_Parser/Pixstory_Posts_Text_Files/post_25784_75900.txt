Kunal Shah is the founder of CRED and FREECHARGE He rejected the offer from Shark Tank by saying to his audience that I invest to pay it forward and help enterpreneurs and learn from them I never negotiate on valuation or ownership Shark Tank format doesn t align with my values so I chose to skip it I am happy startups are now part of household conversations Because of the show but I am worried about people thinking startup is all about raising money
