The alveolar surface area of the lungs is vast, being approximately 150 m2 and has an incredibly fine tissue barrier measuring less than 1 Î¼m. This barrier is thin enough for nanoparticles to permeate through it and into the capillary blood system, thus, meaning that nanoparticles can disperse through the entire human body.
There are several negative health concerns resulting from the absorption of plastic particles, particularly micro- and nanoplastics, such as particle toxicity, chemical toxicity, and the introduction of pathogens and parasite vectors.
Particles within this range of sizes can potentially be embedded deep into the lung and then stay on the alveolar surface or translocate to other parts of the body. The absorption of plastic particles through inhalation could lead to lung damage.
