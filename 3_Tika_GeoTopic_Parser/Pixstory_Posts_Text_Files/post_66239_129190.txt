SEVEN combines horror and film noir genres with overconfident rookie David Mills Brad Pitt as the doomed detective of the noir tradition and book veteran William Somerset Morgan Freeman as the desexualized pedantic survivor familiar to slasher movie fans The story follows the archetypal pair as they wind their way through a dark world of urban violence in search of a serial killer Kevin Spacey Mills and Somerset conclude that each murder corresponds to one of the seven deadly sins from the Bible and that the killer is trying to preach his message of religious morality through his murders and the press they receive Even after being willfully apprehended the killer has one final trick up his sleeve a horrific gesture designed to goad Mills into crossing the line between lawful justice and sinful vengeance Dark disturbing and occasionally gory Seven is a psychological thriller that along with Chinatown is among the bleakest films in mainstream cinema history The murders are not shown on screen but the film has a morbid fascination with the pain inflicted on the victims And it depicts a dark universe where the lines between good and evil are blurred There s no question that it aims to be more philosophical than other detective horror films namely The Silence of the Lambs Attempts at deeper meaning might be pretentious or profound depending on how serious you can take Brad Pitt as an actor
