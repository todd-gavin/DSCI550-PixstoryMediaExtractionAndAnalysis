The Justice Department s use of the records for investigational purposes was temporarily halted by a federal judge on Monday who also granted the former president s legal team s request to appoint a special master to review documents seized by the FBI from his Florida home last month The Justice Department argued that an outside legal expert was not required in part because officials had already finished their review of potentially privileged documents but U S District Judge Aileen Cannon overruled them Earlier this month during arguments the judge had hinted that she could be inclined to support the appointment of a special master by asking the department s attorney What is the harm Given that the judge has ordered the Justice Department not to use any of the seized materials for investigative purposes at this time the appointment is likely to slow down the department s investigation into the presence of top secret information at Mar a Lago However it is unclear whether it will significantly influence any investigative choices or the investigation s final result Trump nominated Cannon to the bench in and she stated she would allow the U S intelligence community to continue doing a risk assessment of the materials
