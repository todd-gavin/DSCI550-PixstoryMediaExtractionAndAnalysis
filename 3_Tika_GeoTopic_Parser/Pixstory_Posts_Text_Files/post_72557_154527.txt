Apple s iPhone might make the switch to USB C Apple will be switching to USB C as soon as according to a report by Bloomberg s Mark Gurman In the latest edition of the Power On newsletter he suggests that the iPhone will mark the transition to USB C Currently the iPhone and AirPods support the Lightning port at the bottom for charger and require their own cable Apple has switched to USB C charging for some devices like the iPad Pro and MacBooks While the European Union law will take effect two years from now Gurman says that Apple is already shifting to make the switch to USB C privately The newsletter notes that publicly Apple is opposing the move stating that the strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world Next year s iPhone will probably make the switch and the only iPad that still uses the Lightning port will be upgraded to USB C sometime later this year This means that AirPods Magic Keyboard Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad will be the only Apple products left that will need to make the switch
