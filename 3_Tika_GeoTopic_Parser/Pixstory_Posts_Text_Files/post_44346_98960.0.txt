The Welshman missed the club's Liga title celebrations, but his boss claims it was due to a serious injury. Manager Carlo Ancelotti insists that Gareth Bale's absence from Real Madrid's Liga title celebrations was due to a bad back, not a strained relationship with the rest of the group.

With a win against Espanyol last weekend, Madrid clinched the Spanish league title and celebrated with an open-top bus tour, although Bale was not among the players present. Bale has been a bit part player at Real Madrid in recent years, spending last season on loan at Tottenham and playing sparingly this season due to injuries and ongoing doubts about his dedication.

The Welshman's absence from the bus excursion was interpreted as fresh evidence of his exclusion from the first team, but Ancelotti has defended his player. Bale was not on the bus, according to the Italian coach, due to severe back discomfort that prohibited him from moving, let alone dancing and celebrating with the rest of the team.

Speaking at his press conference ahead of facing Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Sunday, Ancelotti said: "Bale couldn't even walk the day of the Liga celebrations, he's injured. If he was fine he would've been with his team-mates."

Madrid's Liga triumph is the 35th in the club's history, and it also marks an astonishing personal milestone for Ancelotti, who now has all five of Europe's top league titles under his belt, including the Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A, and Bundesliga. After winning all of Europe's leagues, Ancelotti has been linked with a managerial retirement after he departs Real Madrid, but he isn't planning on it just yet.

He said: "If everything goes well here, I would stay until I'm 80, why not? It's an idea I have, the day I stop with Madrid, I can consider stopping.

"I've enjoyed it a lot. Looking for a better team in world football would be complicated."
