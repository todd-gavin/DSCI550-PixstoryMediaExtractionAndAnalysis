Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad launched his own party, the Democratic Azad Force, on Monday, appealing to the people of both Jammu and Kashmir to break down the artificial barriers that have been erected between them.
Azad also unveiled his party's flag, which features three different coloured stripes: mustard, white, and dark blue. Azad told reporters that the mustard colour in the party flag represents creativity, the ability to think, and unity in diversity, while white represents peace and brotherhood.
