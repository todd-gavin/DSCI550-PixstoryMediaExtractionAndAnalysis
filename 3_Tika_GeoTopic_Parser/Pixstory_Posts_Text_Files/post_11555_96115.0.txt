As we commemorate the Earth day today let's cook some cookies to celebrate the day with the earth. 

Ingredients 

1  bag sugar cookie mix, plus ingredients called for on the package 

6 drops of blue and green food coloring 

Directions 

• First the oven needs to be preheated to 375° and then line down two baking sheets with parchment. Make the sugar cookie mix as mentioned on the box. 

• Now take 1/4 of the dough and transfer it to another bowl and use the green dye and mix them together until the apt colour is achieved. The remaining dough can be dyed with blue food coloring. 

• Take out pieces from each color and merge them together and make them into a ball and create an Earth effect. 

• Finally Place the dough that's prepared onto the baking sheets and bake for about 8 to 9 minutes or till the edges are set. 

• After the cookies are fully baked transfer it to another bowl and let it cool. 

• Enjoy your cookies with some milk or your favourite drink.
