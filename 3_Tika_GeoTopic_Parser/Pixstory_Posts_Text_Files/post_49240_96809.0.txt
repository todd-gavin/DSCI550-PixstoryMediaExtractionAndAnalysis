There's a reason why the best and most popular children's nursery rhymes have lasted so longâ€”a few, in fact! They're entertaining, instructive, and almost impossible to forget thanks to their catchy melodies... That's the power of nursery rhymes, and it's why they've been passed down through the generations, some dating back to the 1600s! What counts as a popular nursery rhyme for children? The ones that not only stick in your head, but are also simple enough for a small child to wrap his tongue around with some repetition. Let's take a nostalgic trip down the memory lane and talk about our own childhoods! What was your favourite nursery rhyme as a kid? Mary's little lamb or Wheels on the bus? Or perhaps The Little Piggy or The Muffin Man? And do you still like to hear it? I used to love Bingo Dog Song! Fun fact, a lot of people think that Bingo was the name of the dog but a huge set of people also believe that Bingo was the name of the farmer. What do you think?
