Sometimes specially while doing  things that interests me like theatre activities, dance, extempore competitions make me a complete social being. I talk, I explore, I learn. 
But when with my others hobbies like reading, writing and studying I require a pin drop silence place and do not worry of the world around me. 
So sometimes I am an extrovert sometimes an introvert so basically I am an ambivert. I don't have a big circle of friends but just a triangle or square, just three or four but they are the world to me. I like to improvise and create content specially writing and acting. Another part about being me is I'm a big foodie, like to explore street style food and some basic punjabi or South Indian restraunts. 
Things go right with me with the blessings of almighty and love, support and care of my parents & sister. 
So yes! I 'm Shreya Mudgal a complete pack of enjoyment & seriousness. 
I just enjoy making memories.
