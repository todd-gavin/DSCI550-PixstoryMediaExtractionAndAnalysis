Despite our efforts to bring gender and sexuality sensitization to healthcare providers, there is still a huge gap in accessing our care. 

This is having a negative impact on our mental health, and we aren’t able to access adequate support. 

These same things have been happening for years, but now the tables have turned. 

I am proud to say that I'm now working as a clinic manager in Mitr Trust, India’s first transgender clinic, where we provide counseling services, endocrinology services, free counseling for HIV, gender identity certificates. 

Many people call us when they are at risk of suicide, explaining that there parents aren’t accepting. So we do counseling for parents too. 

I’ve felt very alone in the last 20 years. But I feel that this work with Mitr Clinic is one achievement.
