"Hey, if you're up right now studying, your freaked out worried about your exam, I want you to know that in like a year, three years, four years, five years, this night's not going to mean anything. It's not going to have that big of an impact on your life. Do the best you can do, and if you can't do any better, then get help. But don't torture yourself and worry so much because it's not that big of a deal."
