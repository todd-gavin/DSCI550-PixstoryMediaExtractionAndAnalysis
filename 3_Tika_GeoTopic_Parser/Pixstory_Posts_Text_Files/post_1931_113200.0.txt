Presidential Biden recently sent out a tweet demanding that gas companies lower their prices. The tweet said, “My message to the companies running gas stations and setting prices at the pump is simple: this is a time of war and global peril. Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you’re paying for the product. And do it now.” In response to this tweet, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos replied, “Ouch. Inflation is far too important a problem for the White House to keep making statements like this. It’s either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics.”

Obviously, Jeff Bezos is not wrong.  Gas stations have little influence over the prices they can offer customers. There are various elements that influence the price of gasoline, including the purchase of crude oil, the refining costs, labor and other overhead costs, and taxes.

Obviously, Biden is attempting to deflect criticism from his disastrous policies, which have led to a significant increase in gas prices. It seems as though he is content with deceiving the common person into believing a fairy tale that gas companies can just halve their rates and portraying them as bogeymen when they do not obey. This is emblematic of the Biden administration and reveals much about the level of intellect he attributes to his followers.
