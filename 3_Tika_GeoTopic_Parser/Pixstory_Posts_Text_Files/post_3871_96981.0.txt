It is no surprise that many of us wait until the beginning of the weekend to do as we please. The week that begins on Monday and goes on until Friday is seen as one of unending drudgery, even when we like what we do for work. 

Now that we’re adults, independent in some ways, what stops us from doing something other than the routine during the week? 

On any given day, I do at least some of these things: brew a great cup of coffee, read a few pages of a book, record my dream from the night before, solve the Wordle puzzle, go for a walk in the park as I listen to music, talk to a friend on the phone, or watch an episode or two of a sitcom.

So, I ask you today— what are some fun things (that motivate/inspire/entertain you) that you like to do during the work week?
