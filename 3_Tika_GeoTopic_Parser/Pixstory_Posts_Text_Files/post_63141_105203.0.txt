Started a business a year back and been active since then, the main markets have been the one targeted by instagram. Social media like whatsapp, facebook and Instagram have been the main places where the products have been posted constantly and after a while the sales started increasing due to the awareness in people.

There has been a lot of interation into the business. The more the posts engaged in the applications and people of similar interests they more it got wider. 

Till now it has been a great experience i hope to grow it and reached it to higher scales.
