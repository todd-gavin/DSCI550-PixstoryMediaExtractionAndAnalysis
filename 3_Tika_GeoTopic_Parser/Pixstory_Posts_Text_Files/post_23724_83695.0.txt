WHO epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove has shared an important Twitter thread on the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron, which is more transmissible than the BA.1 strain.
Based on available data of transmission, severity, reinfection, diagnostics, therapeutics and impacts of vaccines, BA.2 sublineage of Omicron should continue to be considered a variant of concern and should remain classified as Covid-19 Omicron, the global health body said.
WHO further said that reinfection with Covid-19 Omicron BA.2 following infection with BA.1 has been documented. The initial data from population-level reinfection studies suggest that infection with BA.1 provides strong protection against reinfection with BA.2, it added.
WHO will continue to monitor the BA.2 lineage and has requested countries to continue to be vigilant, to monitor and report sequences and to conduct independent and comparative analyses of the different sublineages.

Calling on public health authorities to keep a strict vigil over the variant, the WHO has said, “BA.2 sublineage should continue to be considered a variant of concern and that it should remain classified as Omicron."

BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its genetic sequence, including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins. Several studies have shown that BA.2 has a growth advantage over BA.1.

WHO said studies are underway to understand the reasons for this growth advantage, but initial data suggest that BA.2 appears to spread faster than BA.1, which currently remains the most common Omicron sublineage reported.
