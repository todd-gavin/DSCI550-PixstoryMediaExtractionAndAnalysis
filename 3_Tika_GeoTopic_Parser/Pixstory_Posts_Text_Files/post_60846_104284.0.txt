Social media indeed has two sides to the same coin. It has both positive and negative effects. 

It would be an exaggeration to say that the negatives outweigh the positives, however that isn't too far from the truth. Then again, the 'truth' is subjective.

Social media has increased connectivity, enabled businesses and individuals to prosper and has made acquiring education relatively easy.

But social media has also propagated information pollution and has made people victims of misinformation. Privacy evasion and personalization has led to people becoming target of social and political propaganda.

To gain a more thorough understanding of the implications of social media it would be a good idea to take a look at Baudrillard's views on Simulacra in the age of Social media.

There's a Netflix documentary (albeit exaggerated) called the 'Social dilemma', if you're interested in exploring the downsides of social media.
