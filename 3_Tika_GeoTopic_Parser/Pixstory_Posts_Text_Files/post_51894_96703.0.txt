After a mandatory hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Football Innovation Forum (FIF) returns with its second edition on the morning of May 18th in Sevilla, hosted by World Football Summit and Sevilla City Council at a venue just as avant-garde as the event itself; Las Setas de Sevilla. 

FIF 22 will be celebrated on the morning of the 18 May, the same day that Sevilla will also host the 2022 UEFA Europa League final just hours later at 21:00 (CET). The clash will be held at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, just 15 minutes away from the FIF venue. 

This exclusive event, for which 200 attendees have been carefully hand-picked, will give guests a chance to soak up knowledge on everything related to innovation, investment and technology in regard to football, as well as make use of this opportunity to network with highly respected professionals. Sevilla FC’s General Business Manager, Jorge Paradela, or LaLiga Tech’s Head of Product, Fabio Gallo, are amongst a long list of speakers who will be present at Las Setas.
