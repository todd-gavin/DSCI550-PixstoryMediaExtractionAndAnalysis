Manchester United s problem can t be solved by a simple formation change according to me Ole tried this many times during his tenure He tried both the three man back and five The players just aren t comitted They don t give their They lack the responsibility to play for the badge Maguire doesn t deserve to be the captain for this team A proper team should never change for a single particular player it should be the other way around As they say no player is bigger than the club Moving on to the players playing in the formation I believe Telles just isn t good enough defensively to play as a regular Dalot s positioning has been great but he too lacks the final ball Sancho won t be as effective in the middle he s a proper winger and needs to operate on the win The solution for Manchester United is a proper rebuild they should get more players from their academy involved and get a experienced manager The board and the fans need to give the new manager time to get their club back to its original stature It s sad whats happening to this beautiful club the board needs to sort out the problems swiftly by making proper footballing decisions
