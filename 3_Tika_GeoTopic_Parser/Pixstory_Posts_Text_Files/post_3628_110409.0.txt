Video sharing platform YouTube has recently been at the receiving end of netizens’ wrath for the ‘long, unskippable and multiple’ ads that the platform presents to all users using the basic non-subscription mode for viewing.

While the ads on YouTube earlier used to have a skip button, the situation has changed drastically now. And it turned so bad that multiple threads on the microblogging platform Twitter slammed the platform.

Netizens went all out blasting YouTube Ads on June 22, and one of the tweets went so viral that YouTube was forced to respond. In the tweet, the user said that the platform was acting ‘insane’ by forcing users to watch three ads before a video could be played.

The issue of YouTube Ads had largely been doing the rounds on social media platforms after Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s comment on the issue. Musk had said, "YouTube seems to be nonstop scam ads", which netizens readily agreed with. Following this episode, there was a lot of online ranting against YouTube commercials, its premium subscription, and Elon Musk in particular.

BestMediaInfo.com sat down with advertisers to understand their viewpoint and what YouTube should do next to enhance the audience experience.

Tanish Shah, Associate Director, Influencer Marketing and Video Production, White Rivers Media, said that YouTube is currently testing options so as to settle down on whether it should play multiple or longer ads.

“YouTube has to show ads to generate revenue and keep on providing free content. And as it produces more original content, it has to increase the ads. Now the question is whether it would increase the length of the ads or the frequency. YouTube keeps on testing and trying different customer behaviours. I think this series of un-skippable ads is just a testing phase of YouTube as they must be trying to study how people react to this.
