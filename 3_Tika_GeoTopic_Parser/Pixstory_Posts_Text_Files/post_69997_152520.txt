Sometimes i like to read the stars and wonder what s their story Sometimes i like to read the stars and wonder what s their story For whom do they burn inside and shine bright on the outside Why do they guide people When they themselves are lost in darkness Why do they fall and perish Just to fulfill someone s wish When they know the world won t care If one of them went missing Why do they still appear every night That s when I m reminded It s what we all do Not just the stars Why For whom It s a simple story For love From the book Love Hope And Magic
