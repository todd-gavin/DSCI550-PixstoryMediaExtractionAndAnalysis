Torino&#39;s good start to the season continued with a home draw against Lazio A match played well in the first hour by the grenade as underlined by coach Ivan Juric We played an excellent match until then we gave Lazio courage We could have done better in the last half hour and in the last thirty meters The team is growing we need to improve physically but I&#39;m quite satisfied The team responded well despite the difficult moment They are a tough and concentrated group there is a need for more positivity and to entertain the people forgetting the problems Today the Torino attack remained dry and on occasions like this one immediately thinks of ex captain Belotti As a role, Belotti&#39;s replacement exists but in attack you need to have more substitutions and players who can change the game To be stronger we need to increase quality Juric observed in this regard
