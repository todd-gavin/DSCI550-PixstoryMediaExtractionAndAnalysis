Built to honor George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and the first president of the United States, the Washington Monument was once the tallest building in the world supplanted by the Eiffel Tower just five years later. The monument to America’s first president still holds the title of world’s tallest stone structure and obelisk.

After undergoing years of renovations and reopening in 2019, the Washington Monument has raised expectations for visitors with a new state-of-the-art elevator that will efficiently move hundreds of visitors up to the observation deck daily. The minute-long ride up 50 stories to the top of the world's tallest free-standing stone structure includes a video from the National Park Service about what to expect. From the observation deck, you can see nearly 25 miles into the horizon in every direction, including landmarks like the U.S. Capitol, the White House, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington National Cathedral.

Part of what makes traveling in the elevator so historic is that, on the two-minute descent, it offers a glimpse of the interior walls, which are lined with stones that commemorate George Washington, placed by states, civic groups and others. The modern system gives the National Park Service operators better control of the elevator with remote access from the ground.

Before experiencing the new elevator, visitors will encounter another improvement to traveling to the top of the Washington Monument – an upgraded security screening facility at the base of the structure. The new security structure can accommodate up to 20 visitors and has more modern screening equipment.
