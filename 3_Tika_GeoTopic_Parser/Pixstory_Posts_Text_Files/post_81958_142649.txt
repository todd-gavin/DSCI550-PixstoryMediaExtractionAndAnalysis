I love denim If you re anything like me you like your legs to be free Free to dance free to move free to lounge you get it Fitted styles are great and all but they leave much to be desired when it comes to living in the peak comfort of your jeans Not to mention wide leg jeans just look cool and who wouldn t want that Those of you who have yet to take a walk on the wider side may find the look intimidating Fear not there are wide leg jeans for everyone I wore this wide legged black jeans and paired it up with a yellow crop top Tell me how s the fit
