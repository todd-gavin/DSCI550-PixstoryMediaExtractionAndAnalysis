Congratulations to legendary athlete PT Usha for being nominated to Rajya Sabha 

Grew up listening to the tales of legendary athlete PT Usha, I am fortunate enough to have met her on couple of occasions. And everytime she floored me with her humility & simplicity. 

Down to earth sports icon, who is working on training aspiring athletes, I personally feel it's a great choice by the government to nominate PT Usha to the upper house of the parliament. 

Her presence will be a great support for the sporting community and hope she would contribute more in uplifting and seeking benifits, especially for the budding sportspersons coming from the underprivileged and disadvantaged section. 

Hailing from Kerala PT Usha is known for her trailblazing career in track and field. 

She had won 13 golds at the Asian Championships six of which she won at the 1985 Jakarta Asian Championships alone. She also won four golds at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games.

She missed the Olympic medal by 1/100th of a second in the 400m hurdles in the 1984 Games.
