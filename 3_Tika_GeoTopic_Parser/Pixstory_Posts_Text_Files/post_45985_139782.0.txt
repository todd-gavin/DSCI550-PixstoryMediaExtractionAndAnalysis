Three years ago, Zane Lerma-Switzer discovered he was descended from Native Americans on his father's side. Since then, the 20-year-old has been sharing and enlightening others on the well-known social media platform TikTok. 

SpectrumNews reported that Troy-born TikTok sensation Zane Lerma-Switzer claimed that "We are descendants of the Aztecs." "My forefathers established Tenochtitlan in Mexico." 

Lerma-insatiable Switzer's curiosity was sparked when he discovered his Native American roots, and he was motivated to instruct others on TikTok.

“It just came to mind. I asked one of my classmates if they knew the native tribes in Ohio. They said no," said Lerma-Switzer. "We're not teaching indigenous history in schools at all. And that really frustrated me. From that moment until now, my vision has been to educate people."

Now that’s the best use of social media!
