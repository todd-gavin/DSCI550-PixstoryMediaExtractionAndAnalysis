Arjun Kapoor reacts to Ranveer Singh’s nude photoshoot

Earlier today, while promoting his upcoming film Ek Villain Returns, Arjun Kapoor was asked to share his take on Ranveer’s aforementioned photoshoot. Replying to this, he said that people should be allowed to be themselves. He shared that Ranveer has always been himself and never had any pretentions whatsoever. Arjun said, “When he comes in, there’s warmth, there’s enjoyment, there’s energy. Woh unki personality ka extension hain. Unki marzi hain, unka social media. Unhe sahi lagta hain iss waqt to be in that way that he wants to be. He wants to celebrate being comfortable in his own skin. I think we should respect that. Having an opinion is fair. I think trolls ko importance deni hi nahi chahiye zindagi mein because Kuch toh log kahenge, unka kaam hain kehna. Aapko jo theek lagta hain, aapko karna chahiye.”💞

Arjun further praised Ranveer and said, “And full credit to the boy if he is very happy doing what he is doing. If he is not being forced into it, and it’s not being done in a wrong way or crude way, we should respect that. He’s allowed to do what he wants to do and be happy, and he’s making people happy by doing that also.”🫡🫡🔥
