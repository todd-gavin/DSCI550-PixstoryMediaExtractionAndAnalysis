Do you know Indian Sign Language ISL is used in the deaf community all over India But ISL is not used in deaf schools to teach deaf children Teacher training programs do not orient teachers towards teaching methods that use ISL There is no teaching material that incorporates sign language Parents of deaf children are not aware about sign language and its ability to remove communication barriers ISL interpreters are an urgent requirement at institutes and places where communication between deaf and hearing people takes place but India has only less than certified interpreters Show your support learn and encourage people towards learning it
