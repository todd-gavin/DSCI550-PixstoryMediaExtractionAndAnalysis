7 Cristiano Zanetti
Zanetti played for several Italian clubs and made his name in Serie A before returning to Inter when manager Hector Cuper was appointed and becoming a regular player under him. With Inter, he reached the semi-finals of both the 2001-02 UEFA Cup and the 2002-03 UEFA Champions League but was unable to win either. Zanetti spent four years at Inter, making146 appearances and winning the Serie A title.
6 Marcelo Brozović
He was a goal provider for strikers with unbelievable vision with the ball. The Croatian was compared to Frank Lampard because they both had a similar style of play and were versatile midfielders who could play anywhere in midfield. He was the only Croatian to reach the 200-appearance mark in just three and a half years, demonstrating his reliability. However, the midfielder remains the club's most important player, having started 299 games for Inter.
5 Luís Figo
The famous Portuguese player who could play anywhere except defense. After playing for both clubs, Figo was the only player in La Liga history to have more assists than Lionel Messi. This is what enticed Inter to sign the decorated midfielder. However, the player wanted to play in Italy as well, and he established himself in the club for a short time. Figospent three years at the club, winning four Serie A titles and making 140 appearances.
4 Esteban Cambiasso
A sweeper with the tenacity to beat any midfield with his dominant performance and good technique, passing range, and vision. Inter were fortunate to have signed him from Real Madrid, as he excelled at the club, appearing in 431 games and scoring 51 goals. He was key to the opposition's defense. Aside from defending, he scored a slew of goals and was nominated for the FIFA FIF Pro World XI in 2010, and was inducted into the Inter Milan Hall of fame. With Milan, he won five Serie A titles and a Champions League trophy.
