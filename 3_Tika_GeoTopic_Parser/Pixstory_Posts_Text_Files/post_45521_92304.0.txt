After Rafa Benitez left Liverpool in 2010 Liverpool had seen the lowest of lows in the next 6 seasons, in fact they managed to finish only once in a champions league spot during this reign. 

Then came the appointment of Jurgen Klopp and the world is aware of what followed next. But interestingly it was not just the coach who did the wonders. Liverpool was in shambles as a team when Klopp arrived. So what made this transition possible? The answer is The Red’s smart transfer strategy and long-term investment.

 

For a transfer strategy to be successful the key aspect is scouting. Scouting plays an important role as scouts often tell you if the player is suited to the style of play and the system along with his personal abilities. 
The Merseyside club has done this efficiently over the past 6 years. 

The Red’s are not considered to be heavy spenders in the transfer market but rely on their scouting teams to show them quality players. Some of the biggest talents they have bought are due to the reason of excellent scouting which includes the likes of Mo Salah, Virgil Van Djik, Diogo Jota and more recently so Ibrahim Konate and Luiz Diaz who were both on the scoresheet in the recently concluded champions league match against Benfica. 

 

Recently, Former Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger was all praise for Liverpool's recruitment strategy. The Frenchmen said “ I would give 10/10 to the scouts. Nothing was wrong there, from Salah and Mane to Van Djik. Now Diaz- Diaz looks special. They’ve done extremely well, Liverpool”.

 

Without a doubt it can be said that the Red’s scouting and recruitment strategy has been one of the key reasons for them winning the UEFA Champions League, Club World Cup and The English Premier league after 30 long seasons.
