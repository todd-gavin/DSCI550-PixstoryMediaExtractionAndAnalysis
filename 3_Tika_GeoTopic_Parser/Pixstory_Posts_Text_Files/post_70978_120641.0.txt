A more acute bite would have been helpful in DC League of Super-Pets.

The animated superhero film from Warner Bros. and DC debuted in North America with an estimated $23 million, below forecasts. The picture easily won the weekend, which is a plus.

League of Super-Pets is yet another test for the family theatrical market as the box office recovers from the pandemic. The film had hoped to gross $25 million or more in its domestic release. With voice actors Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson launching a PR blitz, the marketing campaign isn't lacking in attention.

As the number of new summer releases declines and there is less competition, Warners anticipates that the film, which cost $90 million to produce and is currently playing in 4,315 theatres, will continue to do well throughout the month of August. Super-Pets had an A- CinemaScore from viewers, which might indicate positive word of mouth.

Jared Stern makes his theatrical directorial debut with League of Super-Pets, which also features the voices of Kate McKinnon, John Krasinski, and Keanu Reeves among others.

Jordan Peele and Universal's Nope, which debuted at No. 2 on the top 10 list overall, earned a healthy $18.6 million during the weekend, bringing its 10-day domestic total to $80.6 million. The sci-fi/horror film had a 58 percent decline (some had predicted it would fall more than 60 percent).
