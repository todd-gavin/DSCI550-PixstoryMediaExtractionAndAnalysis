There are a lot of points you made that I agree with and a lot of those that I don t but saying cancel culture is a new concept is kind of funnily incorrect because it s been here for as long as we can think of Like people have been banished since forever for not adhering to a certain set of beliefs Banished would still a softer term to say what actually happened to people They were killed I mean what do you think colonization was all about I would say cancel culture is a lot like hell for the new generation Back in the day people used the fear and threat of you ll go to hell now it s just replaced by cancel culture However considering you spoke in the right wing aspect I have a lot of things to say about that There s a vast difference between cancel culture and not wanting to engage with someone with bigoted beliefs In some areas cancel culture is necessary The only negative of it is people being cancelled for stupid stuff like not liking a TV show ship or something like that Not wanting to engage with someone who is against the rights of the minorities definitely does not pass off as cancel culture Why must people want to have anything to do with you when you can t even look at them like they re human beings deserving of rights Let s not try to use cancel culture as a cover to defend bigotry
