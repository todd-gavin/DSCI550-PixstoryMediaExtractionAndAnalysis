🚨🚨 BUKAYO SAKA 🚨🚨


Sources close to Bukayo Saka have informed me that he is extremely close to agreeing a new bumper deal with Arsenal. 

The young star has been with arsenal since a toddler and has gone from strength to strength since appearing as a left back under emery - he’s amassed over 100 appearances for the first team and broken into the England national team. 

He’s rise from prospect to indispensable first team player hasn’t been taken for granted by arsenal and they’ve offered the winger 140kpw over 5 years, it’s thought the player is committed to Arsenal and sees he’s long term future with the club. 

This is a real boost for Arsenal tying down one of there biggest assets on a long term deal shows a step in the right direction. 

It’s just a matter of time before we see that contract signed. 

What’s your thoughts on this id love to hear?
