During COVID-19, UNICEF has continued to work around the world to help parents, like Trun and Nu in Vietnam, support their children's mental health and well-being.

Providing a safe, loving environment for your child helps them to grow and lays the foundation for how happy and healthy they will be throughout their lives. #OnMyMind
