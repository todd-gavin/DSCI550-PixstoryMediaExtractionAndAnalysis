Apex predators play a vital role in regulating populations and ensuring that everything in an ecosystem remains balanced. When their numbers dwindle, this can lead to an increase in populations of prey animals, which can ultimately cause damage to the environment and harm other organisms that rely on those populations for sustenance. In some cases, this can even lead to mass extinctions.
For example, the absence of wolves from Yellowstone National Park has led to an increase in bison numbers, which then push out other wildlife species. This is because bison are able to eat more grass than any other animal, meaning they can easily dominate areas where there was once dense vegetation. The consequences of this phenomenon could be disastrous for the earth's ecosystems as a whole. 
If they were to become extinct, it would lead to drastic changes that would be difficult to reverse. We need all the apex predators we can get if we're going to keep our planet healthy and thriving It's important that we protect these creatures because they play a vital role in nature. By understanding their importance and taking action to preserve them, we can help ensure that the earth remains healthy and vibrant for generations to come.
