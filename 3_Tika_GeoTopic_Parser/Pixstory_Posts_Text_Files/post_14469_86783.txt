According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC adults in U S nearly half of them are diagnosed with high blood pressure Recent study shows that if one is happened to have this condition from youth it could effect their brain health during their middle age and further ahead Identifying early risk factors and early changes in the brain will have a major impact on future clinical and public health priorities related to the looming epidemic of dementia Lenore J Launer PhD chief Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Aging told Healthline Participants were followed for years Researchers have looked closely at people in order to understand and analyse the brain changes and early risk factors associated with cognitive issues that can possibly occur in later life Launer the study s corresponding author said the study involved Black and white men and women ages to for about years Launer and team used MRI to examine changes in the brain s structure and blood flow that influence cognition They found that participants who started with a higher mean average arterial blood pressure MAP and those whose pressure was lower but steadily increasing showed less blood flow and more adverse changes in their brains as they aged High blood pressure leads to brain disease Researchers weren t surprised by the findings Because we have known for a while that high levels of blood pressure lead to pathologic changes in the brain measurable even in mid life Launer said She noted that control of blood pressure levels has so far been the most robust and promising candidate to target for the prevention of future cognitive impairment Still it wasn t known if changes from youth to middle age provided additional information about risk How blood pressure affects the brain The best way to describe this is that our brain has pipes meaning blood vessels and we need the appropriate pressure to help with normal blood flow said Shapiro He explained that when blood pressure increases the brain and structures around it begin developing barriers to reduce it Sources
