Over the weekend, NASA engineers fixed leaky seals on two fuel lines of the Artemis 1 moon rocket, preparing for a fueling test to check the effectiveness of the modifications. Space.com reported that on Friday, September 9, engineers working on the enormous Artemis 1 Space Launch System (SLS) megarocket's tail completed the seal replacements, according to a NASA report. The 8-inch line heading into the core stage of the 32-story SLS rocket's hydrogen fuel leak is the target of the repair effort. Because of the leak, NASA had to cancel the launch of Artemis 1, the first unmanned test flight of the Artemis programme, which aims to send astronauts back to the moon, on September 3. Engineers changed that seal, and they also changed the seal on a smaller 4-inch hydrogen "bleed line" that also saw a leak in a scrubbed Aug. 29 launch try.NASA is getting ready for a fuelling test to see if the hydrogen leaks in the SLS rocket have been corrected when the repair work is finished. According to NASA, that test might take place as soon as this coming Saturday, Sept. 17, and it will fill the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket with the 736,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen it requires for launch.
