In the UK Covid infections are rising again as per the recent figures by Office for National Statistics (ONS). One in 30 or 2.3 million people has a virus which is a 32% rise in a week. The culprits are BA.4 and BA.5 the omicron variants.

Even those who have been affected by Covid-19 before are getting infected but the vaccine protects them against serious illness.
Health officials are advising anyone over 75 who has not had a vaccine or booster in the past six months, to get one.

Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: "Across the UK we've seen a continued increase of over half a million infections, likely caused by the growth of BA.4 and BA.5 variants."

Its analysis of England found out infections are increasing and Scotland also has had the highest covid rates in the UK since May. The hospitals in the UK are also in tight condition.

 In England, almost 9,000 hospital beds were taken up with Covid patients on 30 June - and that number has doubled since the start of the month. Data from the other UK nations are not as up-to-date but indicate a similar rise over the last month.
