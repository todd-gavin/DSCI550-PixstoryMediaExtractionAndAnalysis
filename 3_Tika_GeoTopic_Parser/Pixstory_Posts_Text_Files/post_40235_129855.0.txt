Prior to its first flight in less than two weeks, NASA's new moon rocket arrived at the launch pad on Wednesday. 

CNBC reported that many Kennedy Space Center employees, many of whom were not even alive when NASA took astronauts to the moon a half-century ago, gathered in large numbers as the 98-metre rocket emerged from its enormous hangar late on Tuesday night. The rocket travelled the four miles to the launch pad in just under ten hours, drawing up around dawn.

The lunar test flight's planned liftoff is scheduled for August 29 by NASA. Only three mannequins covered with sensors to assess radiation and vibration will be inside the crew capsule atop the rocket. 

The spacecraft will spend a few weeks in an extended orbit around the moon before returning to Earth and splashing down in the Pacific. The full journey ought to take six weeks.
