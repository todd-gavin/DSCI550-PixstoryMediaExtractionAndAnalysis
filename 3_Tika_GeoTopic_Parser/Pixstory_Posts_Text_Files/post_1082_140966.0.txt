Then what about other MPs in Hoiae of Commons ? 
Every MP will have the option of taking an oath to the King when the House returns but are not obliged to as the oath they already took following the 2019 general election was not only to the Queen but also “her heirs and successor”.
Taking the oath is required under the Parliamentary Oaths Act 1866, an MP may not receive a salary, take their seat, speak in debates or vote until they have taken it.
Those elected for Northern Ireland's republican Sinn Fein party traditionally refuse to take the oath as they do not believe in swearing allegiance to the British monarchy. Consequently their MPs do sit in the House of Commons.
