He quickly settled in and developed a strong bond with Verratti. Moura had a breakout season in 2016, scoring 16 goals in 53 games. He left PSG after making 229 appearances, scoring 46 goals and winning four Ligue 1 titles.

#3 Adrien Rabiot
Rabiot spent the majority of his career with PSG, where he won five Ligue 1 titles and a domestic treble in 2015-16 and 2017-18. He was an academy product, and his performance on the field made him a phenomenal player in the academy before any team could pounce on him. Rabiot began his professional career at PSG after being promoted to the senior team.
Rabiot's career blossomed at PSG, and he rose to become Europe's best midfielder. He was a pivotal player in every game for the French club, appearing in 227 games.

#2 Angel di Maria
Many fans believe he was a winger, but the Argentine was used as an attacking midfielder. Di Maria's passing and shooting accuracy separated him from his teammates, as did his vision on the field, which could destabilise any European defence. Di Maria joined PSG after a flop spell at Manchester United, and once he found his groove in France, he developed into a fierce player like he was at Real Madrid.
He scored 92 goals in 295 games for PSG, winning five Ligue titles and reaching the Champions League final in 2020 and semi-final in 2021.

#1 Marco Verratti
Nobody should ever question the Italian midfielder's loyalty. Verratti has been with PSG since 2012 and has been a diligent player for the club. He is the club's most dependable midfielder, and what distinguishes him as a player is his calmness in tight spaces. He is the club's most dependable player, and no one has ever succeeded him.
With his timely tackles, he can break up play or counter-attack, and with his low centre of gravity and balance, Verratti can regain possession in tight spaces when under pressure. With 388 appearances and eight Ligue 1 titles, he certainly makes his mark in the annals of PSG.
