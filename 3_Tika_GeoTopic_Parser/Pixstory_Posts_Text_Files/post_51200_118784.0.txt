In general, negativity is draining and I try my best to surround myself with people that I can connect with positively and that make me feel good. 

Next on my list is inconsistent sleep. I strive off of being well rested. If I don't sleep well or stay up too late, I am usually a mess the next day .

Overthinking goes hand in hand with negativity.

As for screens, I am someone who can feel sick if I am using screens too much .

Junk food is something I have a love/hate relationship with. It makes me immediately feel tired and unmotivated which is what I hate about it. 

Lastly on my list is dehydration. If I am not drinking enough water, I easily get a headache and my overall energy level goes down.
I personally felt that this was a very nice exercise to complete. It made me reflect on what recharges me and drains me. I am also glad to say that I had a harder time thinking of things that were energy takers. It is important to know what makes you feel good and try you very best to do so. Of course not everyday is perfect and you can't do everything each day. As long as I try to incorporate my energy givers in my day, I am proud of myself.
