Actor Emilia Clarke and author George RR Martin have confirmed that a Game of Thrones spin-off series based around Kit Harington's Jon Snow is being developed at HBO. It was reported last week that HBO has started working on the spin-off show that would take place after the events of Game of Thrones with Harington reprising his role.

George RR Martin revealed that John Snow brought the idea of the potential spin off to him and the HBO producers. He also revealed that the project's working title is "Snow". He went on to reveal that Kit Harrington brought in his own team to write the show, and said that he has a fantastic team. 


The show is in a script stage and has not yet been green-lit by HBO.
