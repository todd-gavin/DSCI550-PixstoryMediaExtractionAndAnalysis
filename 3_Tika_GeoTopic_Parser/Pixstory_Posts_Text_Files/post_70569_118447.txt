Kashmir Narratives Myths vs Facts of Jammu and Kashmir comes across as a bold hard hitting piece of work that is devoid of attachments and biases that tend to creep into works of this nature Authored by an established Military Historian Col Ajay K Raina SM the work follows the pattern of his earlier books wherein he has brought out facts tales and anecdotes that have never been told before In this book however he goes a step further and ruthlessly bares the motives agendas and reasons behind some of the biggest misconceptions that willy nilly get associated with the erstwhile State of J K Backed by some real deep research the book covers the issues related to Dogra rule from the middle of the th Century and some of the most important developments that happened in The author while focusing on the events of that era relates them to the present day situation in the region While writing on individual narratives and there are such narratives the author lays down the statement of the narrative does a brief fact check carries out a detailed analysis and then concludes with an endnote The format common to all the narratives being examined is reader friendly and easy to comprehend However what is remarkable is the amount of research that has gone into the work In addition to the usual works that are invariably quoted in any work related to J K there are some unique quotations that if read in greater detail separately can throw open a new world to the seekers of knowledge about J K
