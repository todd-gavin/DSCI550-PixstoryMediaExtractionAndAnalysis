Anonymity isn t always bad though I mean online abuse should be annihilated in every possible way but everything cannot be put on concealed identity There are clear instances where people with genuine accounts do or say things to harm people so if we are talking about online abuse it should be something that needs to be entirely seen Instead anonymity gives some people a right to say certain things clearly and loudly that cannot be put on social media otherwise Like it protects people from exposing repression corruption and hate and allows stigmatised and abused communities to find safety and support when revealing their real world identity could tell them to harm These are all good reasons to preserve anonymity but there is also a lighter more cultural case It enables people to join new communities and explore the full creativity levity and absurdity of today s internet without those identities overlapping or contradicting each other
