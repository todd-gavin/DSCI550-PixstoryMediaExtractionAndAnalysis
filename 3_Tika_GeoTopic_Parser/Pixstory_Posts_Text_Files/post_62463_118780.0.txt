Siberian tigers are the biggest cats of the world, insanely huge and dangerous. But that's not the answer. They are dangerous but there's a set of tigers that's more. The deadliest maneating cat.

The tigers that are most deadly to people are typically thought to be those in the Sunderbans. Since these Bengal tigers were not systemically hunted like other tigers, these ones have no innate fear of people. People who enter the mangrove wetlands illegally are definitely entering dangerous territory because tigers will attack and kill people just like they would do to any other animal.

In the Sunderbans, between 70 and 80 percent of residents work as fishermen, honey collectors, or crab hunters. To gather honey and pollen, these folks must go into the woodlands. And that's where they become the easiest prey to one of the most ferocious animal alive. In fact, they are so fearlessly, they get into villages in search of their favorite human meat. One of the reasons is that we are easy prey.

Tigers of Sunderbans hold a record of being the biggest man eating tigers of the world. They are something out of your worst nightmares. The Sunderbans' Mangrove Swamps' tigers are thought to be the deadliest tigers alive.
