Consumers are the largest economic group in any country. They are the central point of all economic activities. The ultimate aim of production, storage and distribution is to ensure consumption of goods and services to the satisfaction of the consumers. Consumer awareness means being conscious of having knowledge about the various consumer production laws, redress mechanism and the consumer rights which include right to protection of health and safety from goods and services that the consumer buy, right to be informed about the quality, price, potency, purity and standard of good, right to choose the best from a variety of others, right to get representation if there is any grievance or suggestion, and right to seek redress against unfair trade practice or unscrupulous exploitation.
