Congress finally voted to end normal trade relations with Russia. Now America can impose steep hikes on imports such as steel and aluminium products from Russia and Belarus. America also bans imports of oil. This is a huge blow for Russia. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi resonated with millions is she said, "Putin's aggression and barbaric war crimes have horrified the world and demand a strong response."

According to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, "Russian President Vladimir Putin must be held accountable for the detestable, despicable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine: the images we have seen coming out of that country... are just pure evil."

The legislation intensifies Biden’s hand in applying new trade penalties to Russian goods and puts the president’s ban on energy imports into law, signalling it will likely stay in place until well after any end to the war in Ukraine.

NATO and USA could restrict Russia to a core that Putin will stop his disastrous act. Yet NATO and USA can act only on a humanitarian basis considering the citizens of Russia, unlike Putin. This one autocrat is destroying two countries; his own and Ukraine. This is going to affect the Russian economy by almost 15 per cent. Putin is inflicting a lot more trouble on Russia than he imagines. Shutting opportunities for Russia through his perilous acts.
