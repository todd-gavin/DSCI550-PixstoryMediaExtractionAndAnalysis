After playing nine seasons for Real Madrid C.F., Casemiro is finally leaving the club and he will join Manchester United immediately.

In the nine years, he played 336 games and won 18 silverware in total, where he won:-

5 UEFA Champions League 
3 Club World Cups
3 UEFA Super Cups
3 La Liga titles 
1 Copa del Rey
3 Spanish Super Cups

As. a Real Madrid fan, I started watching football in 2014 and when I got mature as a football fan then I realised how important Casemiro was for the team and why he is an important part of our “holy trio midfield” which also includes Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.

When Ronaldo left Real Madrid, as a fan I thought that who will score goals for the team but eventually, Benzema took that spot.

When my Idol, Sergio Ramos left the club, then again I thought, who will become our leader in defence but in the same season Militao and Alaba filled the void of Ramos and we won 3 trophies in the 2021-2022 season.

Now, when Casemiro is leaving the club to join Manchester United, again I am thinking that which player will step up and fill the void of Casemiro. Camavinga and Tchouameni are the main contenders to fill the spot of Defensive Midfielder but will they succeed or Real Madrid will make a new signing to replace Casemiro?

As a fan of Real Madrid, I want a player like Rodri (who plays for Manchester City) to join Real Madrid but who am I? Just a fan and decision-makers are sitting in Spain and have a football knowledge more than me.

At last, I want to say to Casemiro that you are leaving this club as a legend and Madridistas will forever miss you.
