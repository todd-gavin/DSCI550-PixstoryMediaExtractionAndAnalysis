Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo are traveling to Louisiana Friday to highlight investments in high-speed internet through the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Act, a White House official confirmed to USA Today Network.

Harris and Raimondo will arrive in Lafayette before traveling to Sunset, a small town in St. Landry Parish, for the event.

They will be joined by Gov. John Bel Edwards.

“I am excited to welcome vice president Harris to Louisiana on Friday and am honored that the White House has chosen our state to highlight the importance of broadband connectivity to rural cities and towns during her visit," Edwards said in a statement.

"Communities all over Louisiana will benefit from increased investments in and attention to broadband connectivity," he said. "We are ready to embrace opportunities to bring this important internet infrastructure to areas that need it so that we can improve our economic competitiveness, educational opportunities and quality of life.”

Louisiana Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy and New Orleans Democratic Congressman Troy Carter were the only members of Louisiana's congressional delegation to vote for the Infrastructure Act last year.

Cassidy was one of the architects of the bill, while Carter helped craft the language on the House Transportation Committee.
