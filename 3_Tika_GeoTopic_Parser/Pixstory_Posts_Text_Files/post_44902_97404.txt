Mathieu Flamini There isn t a greater narrative in any where are they now list than Flamini s He concluded his playing career with spells at Crystal Palace and Getafe after calling halt on his second Arsenal stint in But long before he retired as a player he co founded GF Biochemicals a geo energy firm on which he now focuses His commercial pursuits have proven extremely profitable though he has downplayed suggestions that he is now a multibillionaire He and Ozil co founded a sustainable vegan wellbeing personal care firm in and he is an avid environmentalist Growing up by the sea I could see from a very early age the impact of plastics in the water on the beach he told the Guardian in August It s horrendous and makes you realise that if we don t change something the place where we live won t be liveable any more I was very aware of everything very curious I always told myself If I do something else later on outside football I want it to be around sustainability Theo Walcott Walcott is back where it all started having moved from Southampton to Arsenal when he was years old in He scored goals in appearances for Arsenal but when Saints scored at the Emirates in December he still applauded Scoring a goal no matter who you play is one of the best feelings and I scored many goals here he said post match But playing for Southampton is a massive thing for me so to score a goal why not Why wouldn t I celebrate
