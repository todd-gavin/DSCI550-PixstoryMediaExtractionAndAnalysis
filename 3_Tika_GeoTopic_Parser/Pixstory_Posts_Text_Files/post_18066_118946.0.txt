Keke Palmer doesn't seem to be amused by the recent social media debate equating her career to Zendaya's.
A Saturday tweet gained attention for saying that Palmer, who is now starring in Jordan Peele's Nope, and Zendaya's apparent disparity in public appeal is "one of the clearest examples of how colorism plays out in Hollywood." Although Palmer and Zendaya were both child stars, Nope is being referred as in certain quarters as Palmer's breakout performance, according to the Twitter thread.

On Sunday, Palmer tweeted , “A great example of colorism is to believe I can be compared to anyone. I’m the youngest talk show host ever. The first Black woman to star in her own show on Nickelodeon, & the youngest & first Black Cinderella on broadway. I’m an incomparable talent. Baby, THIS, is Keke Palmer.”
