West Ham complete the signing of Swansea City Midfielder Flynn Downes 
Premier League side West Ham United have completed the signing of Flynn Downes from Swansea City for an undisclosed fee. It is believed that West ham will pay an initial £9 Million but the sum may rise up to £14 Million. The 23-year-old midfielder has been a ‘Lifelong Hammer’ as clearly specified in West Ham’s official statement and manager David Moyes had him earmarked for quite some time now. 

“It’s a surreal feeling to have joined my boyhood club. I feel like I’m dreaming,” Downes said to West Ham’s site. 

“It’s been my dream since I was a little boy to join this club – it’s an absolute privilege. This is my club, so I couldn’t be more delighted.

“I’m glad to be here and I can’t wait to get started.

“I want to be the best I can be and this feels like the perfect opportunity to test myself against the very best players in the Premier League.

“I’m so grateful for the opportunity to be a West Ham player.”

Flynn Downes is an Ipswich Town academy product. He joined them in 2006, made his debut in 2017 and moved to Swansea City only last summer where he shined and made a name for himself. He has nearing 150 career appearances (148) and is more used to playing as a Central or Defensive midfielder. Although he does not have many goals or assists to his name He can be best described as a gifted passer, great tackler and strong and conbative all-round player. 

Given the strong interest we have seen in the transfer market for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice lately, many are considering Flynn Downes as their Declan Rice replacement, in case Chelsea end up signing the Englishman in the near future.
