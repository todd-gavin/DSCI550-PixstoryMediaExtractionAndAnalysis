This time Knicks seem to be dedicated to a great game. They've been locking some good players for the team. After Isaiah Hartenstein, Jalen Brunson, they made sure to not let one of their own slip away. According to ESPN, Mitchell has agreed to a four-year, $60 million contract with the Knicks. The NY Knicks are working to keep their team together despite not signing a marquee player this offseason.

In 25.7 minutes per game over 72 games, Robinson averaged 8.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks while shooting 76.1 percent from the floor. He was signed by the Knicks in the second round of the 2018 NBA Draft, and despite struggling with injuries, he has grown into a reliable starting centre for the team.
