Former Wallaby Israel Folau is set to return to international rugby union for the first time since 2018, after being named in Tonga's squad for July's Pacific Nations Cup and World Cup qualifying.

"He's going to bring a lot of experience to the table," Tonga coach Toutai Kefu told ABC Radio Australia.

"His presence is going to be one of the most exciting factors we're looking forward to."

Folau played 73 Tests for the Wallabies before Rugby Australia terminated his contract in May 2019 for breaching its code of conduct.

Folau later took Rugby Australia to court for unfair dismissal, resulting in a multi-million dollar settlement. 

However, he's now able to represent his parents' homeland, Tonga, due to changes to World Rugby's eligibility laws.

"It would have been at least a couple of years ago that we started having conversations about him possibly representing Ikale Tahi," said Kefu.

"It was quite informal back then — it was just an informal chat — and then, as his three-year stand-down approached, when that was going to finish there was a possibility of him playing Sevens to qualify for us and he was open to that. 

"But then, fortunately, they changed that rule in November and he didn't need to go through that route anymore. All he had to do was stand those three years down and he would qualify straight away."

Folau is currently playing club rugby for the Shining Arcs in Japan under former Waratahs coach Rob Penney.

"He has a whole new set of skills that we haven't had before," Kefu said.

Tonga has also named former All Blacks back Charles Piutau in its squad under the changed eligibility rules.

"Things seem to be coming together at the right time," Kefu said.

"We've still go some more individuals to come into the squad, so it's only going to get better."
