A new report claims that Dhaakad, starring Kangana Ranaut and Arjun Rampal, was shown the exit door in Mumbai theatres within one week of its release. The action film had a disastrous start and received mixed reviews. The film clashed with Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 starring Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani.

Dhaakad appears with 'no watch options' on the ticket booking app Book My Show. This means that no shows are available for moviegoers to book. The film is also limited to a few screenings in New Delhi. Dhaakad was reportedly released on a large scale, with approximately 2100 screens.

Dhaakad premiered on May 20th, with approximately 2100 screens. By Sunday, May 22, approximately 300 screens, primarily single screens, had pulled the film. Since Monday, the number of screens has been reduced even further. Top Gun: Maverick, starring Tom Cruise, had an early release on May 26 and was out of many theatres by Thursday. " It is Kangna Ranaut's ninth flop film in a row, a very bad phase for a performer who is actually one of the best in Bollywood.
Queen was my favourite Kangna Ranaut film.
