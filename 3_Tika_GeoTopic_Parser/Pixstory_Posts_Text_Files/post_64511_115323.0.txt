I would like to thank a lot of people who came into my life and made me realise that i could be positive even if they are the cause to my aggression, i can stay calm even when people expect me to be a part of their conflict. I could stay silent when they are shouting at me. I can listen their each & every word with extreme patience when they speak all the shit on my face. I could be always humble and pay attention to their mentality when they act foolishly...i can freely choose my words in anger but they spill out all the poisonous words they tried to hide inside of their beautiful face.
Sometimes it's the silence that helps me to win the war. I know when to use my words. I also know when to keep my mouth shut. ü§ê
I am just a learner.
