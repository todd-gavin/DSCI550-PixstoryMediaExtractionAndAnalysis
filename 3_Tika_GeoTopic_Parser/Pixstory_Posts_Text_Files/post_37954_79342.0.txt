With just five months remaining in his Barcelona contract, it is clear that Dembele would be leaving the club as a free agent at the end of the season. Hence the club board had asked Xavi to focus on other players and not to play the Frenchman as he does not have a future with the club. 


Xavi Hernandez takes a U-turn on Ousmane Dembele

As per Marca, Xavi Hernandez has taken a U-turn on the future of Ousmane Dembele. The Barcelona manager is reportedly open to featuring the player in his side. 

Barcelona recently unveiled the signing of Adama Traore to the fans. But the event was marred by club president Joan Laporta using the opportunity to talk about Ousmane Dembele and stating that it would be difficult to see him play for the club again. 

But regardless of what Laporta had to say, Xavi is now wanting to bring the winger back to the first-team setup. The Spaniard had earlier stated that he would not be picking Dembele. 

The reason for Xavi's U-turn is that Ousmane Dembele is very close to the new signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The duo has played together for Borussia Dortmund earlier in their career.

To add to this, Adama Traore would need some time to settle into his role with Barcelona. Hence the manager feels that Dembele could help both the players transition into the team. 

Another potential reason is the fact that Xavi is aware of Ousmane Dembele's discontent at the club. Hence he feels that this could bring disharmony into the dressing room. 


Xavi to set to have a meeting with Laporta


As per the report, Xavi Hernandez is set to have a meeting with his fellow coaches about the Ousmane Dembele situation. Following this, it would be decided if the player will feature or not. 

It is also being stated that Barcelona president Joan Laporta would be attending the said meeting as well. Hence it has to be seen if a solution is reached regarding Dembele's future following the meeting.
