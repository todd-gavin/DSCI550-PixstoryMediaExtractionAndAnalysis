Vijay Mallya, a wanted businessman who was found guilty of contempt of court in 2017, was given a four-month prison term and a Rs 2,000 fine by the Supreme Court on Monday. He was also told by a panel chaired by Justice U U Lalit to return the US$40 million he had sent to his children with 8% interest within four weeks, or attachment proceedings will be brought against him.

On May 9, 2017, the Supreme Court found Mallya in contempt on two counts for ignoring a request that he completely declare his assets and for flouting a Karnataka High Court decision prohibiting him from transferring those assets. The court determined that had not revealed the transfer of US$ 40 million to his children after receiving it in his account.

When the court handed down his punishment on Monday, it stated that since it had previously found Mallya guilty of contempt, it was necessary to punish him appropriately to uphold the authority of the law. It further stated that he shown no remorse.
