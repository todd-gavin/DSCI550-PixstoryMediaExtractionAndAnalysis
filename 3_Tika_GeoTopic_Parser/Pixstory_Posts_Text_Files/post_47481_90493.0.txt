Lionel Messi, Argentina's blue-eyed youngster, made his international debut on August 17, 2005, in a friendly match against Hungary at Budapest's Puskas Stadium.

Messi entered the game as a late substitute in the second half. In the 64th minute of the game, he came on to replace attacker Lisandro Lopez. Despite being reduced to ten men, Argentina won the match 2-1 thanks to goals from Maxi Rodriguez and Gabriel Heinze.

What was intended to be a perfect debut for the then-Barcelona wunderkind quickly turned into a nightmare when he was sent off only two minutes after taking the field. But, since that disastrous start, Messi has gone on to become the most-capped Argentine player of all time, with 151 appearances under his belt, as well as the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 76 goals.

Let's take a look at the players who wore the Argentina jersey on Messi's first international appearance.

From 2004 until 2009, the Argentine goalkeeper spent five seasons with Atletico Madrid. He retired in 2016 following a season with Huesca in Spain's second tier. Between 2004 and 2006, Leo Franco only appeared in four international matches for Argentina. He also tried his hand at managing Huesca after they were promoted to LaLiga at the start of the 2018-19 season. However, due to poor performance, he was fired in October.

Scaloni, Argentina's current head coach, just led his team to the Copa America 2021 triumph, which also occurred to be Messi's first senior title. During his playing career, he represented clubs like as Deportivo La Coruna, West Ham United, and Lazio. After two seasons with the Atalanta Falcons, he retired in 2015. Between 2003 and 2006, Scaloni appeared in seven international matches for Argentina.

The renowned Argentina defender played for River Plate, Napoli, and AC Milan, among others. Before retiring in 2007, Ayala played in 116 international appearances for Argentina. In December 2010, he announced his retirement from club football.

Ayala was hired as a football coordinator at Racing Club in 2011, but he was fired in 2013.
