Story It s a kind of quiet and peaceful here this night just me and only me That s peace for me Certainly the word peace does not come to my mind when i think of all the noise in this world Feeling peace is a sense of healing and this is the place i found a sense of peace I feel so calm fearless and safe here and i think this is that inner peace that begins with knowing all is well look at the water shimmering by light of moon i think like it speaks to me I m drawn to this quite space The water is large but it draws me close and i feel so peace and serenity When i look at the scenery around me There is something in the gesture of weeds the water It has a certain kind of expanse peaceful vibes These mountains look like they are hiding someone form me and that someone is giving me peaceful vibes The trees blowing the air and the air making me so into that i feel comfortable with myself The moon has nbsp no doubt at its nbsp fullest brightest and most fantastically dazzling I think nbsp nbsp like the moon understands what it meant to be a human I guess it understand what i talk to her and makes me feel so peaceful and this is the time when i realise how much we need peace in our life and how important a gift it is The water weeds these trees grasses mountains and the moon are like a symbol of peace for me
