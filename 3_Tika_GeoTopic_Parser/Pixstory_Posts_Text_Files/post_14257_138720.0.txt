Despite both clubs being Champions League regulars over the last decade and beyond, this is their first competitive meeting in 25 years and the first time the clubs meet in the European Cup. Juve have dominated their past encounters, remaining unbeaten and winning the last six games. Read on for more pre-match stats.


HISTORY LESSON | Juventus have played Paris Saint Germain a total of eight times in all UEFA competitions, the most recent being in February 1997, when Juventus were 3-1 winners to complete a 9-2 aggregate win in the two-legged UEFA Super Cup - that win in Palermo made it six out of six against the French club for the Bianconeri, who also beat PSG 3-1 on aggregate in the 1992/93 UEFA Cup semi-finals.

ELEVEN IN SUCCESSION | Juventus are making their 11th successive appearance in the UEFA Champions League group stage and a 23rd overall – an Italian record, four more than Milan, and have reached the round of 16 every season since 2013/14.

A DECADE OF DOMINION | This is PSG’s 15th UEFA Champions League group campaign, their 11th in succession - one short of national rivals Lyon's unbroken run of appearances from 2000/01 to 2011/12, and have reached the knockout rounds in all of their last ten seasons in the competition, last failing to progress beyond the group stage in 2004/05.

A WALK IN THE PARC | Paris Saint Germain have won 42 and lost only six of their last 65 European home games, although four of those have come in their last 15 matches at the Parc des Princes.

PARISIAN TRIO | The current Juventus squad contains four former PSG players but with injury ruling out Angel Di Maria's participation only three, Leandro Paredes, Moise Kean and Adrien Rabiot have travelled to Paris.
