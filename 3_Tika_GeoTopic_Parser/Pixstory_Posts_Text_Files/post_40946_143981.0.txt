Elly Conway: Who is she? That question is becoming difficult to address. As per Hollywood Reporter, the straightforward response is that Conway is a rookie novelist whose upcoming spy thriller, Argylle, has already been made into a blockbuster film starring Henry Cavill, Ariana DeBose, Bryan Cranston, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Dua Lipa in her movie debut. Industry reports claim that the purchase, which cost Apple a stunning $200 million, only secures one movie, possibly the start of a new film franchise. “When I read this early draft manuscript I felt it was the most incredible and original spy franchise since Ian Fleming’s books of the ‘50s,” director Matthew Vaughn (Kingsman franchise, X-Men: First Class) gushed when the project was announced in August 2021. “This is going to reinvent the spy genre.”That might be the case, but the statistics are unusual for a debut author. Conway hasn't even published a book yet; the release date for Argylle was originally set for September 29 but has subsequently been moved to March 30, 2023.What do you think about it?
