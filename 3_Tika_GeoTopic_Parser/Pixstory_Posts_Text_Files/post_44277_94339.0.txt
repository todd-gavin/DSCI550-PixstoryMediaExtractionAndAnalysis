Juventus almost missed out on the highest prize in European football seven years ago, a fact
that still bothers Spanish striker Alvaro Morata, who believes that if VAR had been available at
the time, Juventus would have won the 2015 Champions League final.

In Berlin, Juve were defeated 3-1 by Barcelona, with goals from Ivan Rakitic after four minutes,
Luis Suarez after eight minutes, and Neymar with the game's final kick. Seven years ago,
technology was not as widely used in refereeing, which Morata laments because he believes
Juve could have won that game.

What did Morata have to say?

In an interview with DAZN, Morata said: "With VAR, Juve would have won the final against
Barca.

"I always think that, with VAR, they would have given us a penalty and we would have one more
Champions League at Juventus. Life is like that."

Why do you think Morata believes VAR may have saved Juve?

Morata is irritated by an incident in the 67th minute of the final at Olympiastadion, when Paul
Pogba was brought down in the penalty box by Dani Alves. The referee ignored Juve's
protestations, and Barca seized the lead through Suarez two minutes later.

Speaking about life in Turin, Morata told DAZN: “Everyone plays for his future at Juventus, in
games and during training sessions.

“There is a long queue to come here and it’s normal to be judged in every game. I am giving my
all to win for my teammates and the fans.

“I am happy to be here. My sons ask me to sing the club’s anthem every morning, I am happy,
but I’d be happier with a trophy.”
