After the Buffalo shooting yet another mass shooting that left 19 school children dead in the deeply pro-gun state of Texas. Texas is a state of Republican senators with the laxest laws and who will answer to the death of innocent children? 

 The incident had put pressure on politicians but do we expect a change-we never had one in Texas so our expectations are very low. 


Nearly 10 years after a man slaughtered 20 children and six others in an assault on the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, and four years after 17 were murdered at a Florida high school, laws purchases and ownership have not significantly changed.


The US is a lobby of guns-all kinds-high end assault rifles to semi-automatic pistols are widely available. Arguments are sprouting yet again in the US but for how long? Texas hosts the annual convention of the country's leading pro-gun lobby, the National Rifle Association.

Scheduled to speak at the convention are former president Donald Trump, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and other prominent Republicans.

Ted Cruz even spoke for the 2nd amendment even after this tragic incident.


The US racked up 19,350 firearm homicides in 2020, up nearly 35 per cent over 2019, and 24,245 gun suicides, up 1.5 per cent. At 6.1 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in 2020, the firearm homicide rate was the highest in a quarter-century. Mass shootings have also risen, according to Everytown.

"Since 2009, there have been 274 mass shootings in the United States, resulting in 1,536 people shot and killed and 983 people shot and wounded," the group says.

The country is overpowered with guns. US firearms makers produced more than 139 million guns for the commercial market over the two decades from 2000, and the country imported another 71 million.

That includes high-powered assault rifles, which can be found for $500, and 9-millimetre pistols that combine ease of use, high accuracy and semi-automatic triggers with prices as low as $200. Even in this condition, many protect guns, what for? For this disaster? To take away the life of innocent children who came to school for education?
