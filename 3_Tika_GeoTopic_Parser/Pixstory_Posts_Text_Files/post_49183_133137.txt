There s no doubt that the world has changed a lot in the past few decades We ve seen an explosion in technology and our lives have become increasingly automated However there is a downside to all of this modernization it s creating a imbalance in society This principle of modernity has led to an obsession with change which has robbed us of our traditional values and beliefs We ve lost sight of what s important in life and we re starting to lose touch with our roots Not to mention it has changed the basic programming of society From what people these days refer to as gender roles to gender as whole We have come to think revealing your body disrespecting our armed forces or doing drugs is something cool It is only creating chaos What have we become Tradition is a valuable source of guidance for us as humans It teaches us how to live with each other and with nature and it provides us with guidelines for how to behave in different situations It can help us avoid making the same mistakes over and over again and it can help us find new ways to improve our lives Yet we have almost thrown it out of our daily lives There are some systems that are good as is and they don t need to change We can live harmoniously that way We have seem to forget the ways of God in trying to grow as a society
