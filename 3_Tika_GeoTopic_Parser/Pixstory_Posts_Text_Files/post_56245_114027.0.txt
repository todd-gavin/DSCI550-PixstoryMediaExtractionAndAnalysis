The MP for Bury St Edmunds has resigned from the government saying "the country and party deserve better". Junior minister Jo Churchill said she had "resigned with a heavy heart" in her resignation letter. 

She joined a prospering list of ministers who have quit, or who have published statements opposing Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson had said he was not aware of any accusations against Mr. Pincher before authorizing him to the Conservative Party's whips' office; which he later changed. 

Ms. Churchill has resigned as Minister for Agri-Innovation and Climate Adaptation at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

In her letter to the prime minister, she said: "Recent events have shown integrity, competence, and judgment are all essential to the role of prime minister, while a jocular, self-serving approach is bound to have its limitations."

Lincolnshire MP Victoria Atkins has also resigned from her role as justice minister citing concerns over "integrity, decency and respect" within the government.

The Louth and Horncastle Conservative representative will proceed to serve her constituents as an MP.

In a letter posted on social media, she told Boris Johnson she "can no longer pirouette around our fractured values".
The prime minister is fighting to stay in office, amid a ripple of resignations from his government in protest at his leadership.

Ms. Atkins said it was with "sadness and regret" that she was standing down from her position as justice minister.

She stated: "Values such as integrity, decency, respect, and professionalism should matter to us all.

"I have watched with growing concern as those values have fractured under your leadership.
