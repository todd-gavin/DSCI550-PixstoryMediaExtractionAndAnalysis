On the eve of the game, two England fans were reportedly arrested in Munich city centre for giving the Nazi salute, which is banned in Germany for the obvious reasons. 

Munich's fire department rushed out to a city centre hotel after an England fan lit a flare, which spread smoke through the building, triggering the smoke alarm.

Police in the City of Dreams were also twice called at one of the city's famous beer bars, where a group of around 300 England fans were disturbing the peace, as is their modus operandi. 

On Monday, England head coach Gareth Southgate said he hoped the behaviour of England fans won't embarass them, but hopes that they show support to the English Team. 

Officially, England fans have been allocated 3,466 tickets for the match at the Allianz Arena, but there are fears thousands more could get in having used fake information to buy tickets from the German FA.

England fans are always more aggressive than the opposition and are generally considered as hellraisers. Recently last year, the English fans beat up Italian fans, after Italy defeated England in the Euros final. 

England is slated to face Germany in German FA at Allianz Arena. 

If the reports coming out of Munich are true, then this is a sad day for football fans all over the world.
