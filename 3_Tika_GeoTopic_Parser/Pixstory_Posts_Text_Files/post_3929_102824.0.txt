Mental illness is becoming more acceptable in general among people through awareness and it is also in the emergence of being treated with the same importance as physical health. 

But the scenario is never the same at every place. Mental health as such when compared to the developed and developing place is being treated differently. 

Here the focus stands on how mental health and mental illness are being frequently discussed among the parents and children in Kerala household. 

Mental illness can be caused due to many psychosocial problems and this can reduce the quality of life for the patient and for the family members. This could also create a social distance formed by the society towards the patients and the family members. 

The stigma attached to mental illness is still prevalent in the state and this affects not only the patient but the family as well. This stigma makes it more difficult for children to open up on the problems they face to their parents and this happens through generational cycles. This keeps the parents unde the pressure of not exposing the hard side of life and the mental stress they undergo and keeping their weak side to themselves which is why the vulnerability experienced by both parties are not being shared or opened up on. 

If a child shares their problem or puts forward the need to seek help of a therapist, the parents suggest coping mechanism of going for supernatural practices and religious beliefs than taking the professional help.
