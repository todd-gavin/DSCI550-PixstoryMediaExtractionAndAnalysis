Hey guys well I m Harpreet Been an Indian citizen for years months days welp yet I don t have my Voter s ID card I enjoy designing and painting it helps unleash the Lil demon of creativity inside me Apart from these I am addicted to the HARRY POTTER franchise the marvel universe and anime yes I m an adult and I watch anime So lemme just introduce myself in a cheeky way I might be as sharp organised and coordinated as Hermoine not sure tho though she d probably scold me for wingardium leviosa as brave as Harry as mischievous as the Weasley twins or even as awkward and clumsy as Neville at times If I d go introducing myself in Marvel ways then ill just say I AM GROOT phew that was hard I m also somewhat of Akimichi Choji from Naruto despite being round other traits that I share with him are I m polite to others and am always up to help The downside similar to his is I sometimes lack confidence but according to me one who has weaknesses isn t weak but one who stays with weaknesses stays weak so I d like to overcome this I also spend my time savouring the food playing games and trying to study I m somewhat shy at the start but thanks to the pixtory team I got to introduce myself on such a great social app id like to work and increase my social points hehe and get away with my awkwardness Ping me up if y all wanna be friends or acquaintances
