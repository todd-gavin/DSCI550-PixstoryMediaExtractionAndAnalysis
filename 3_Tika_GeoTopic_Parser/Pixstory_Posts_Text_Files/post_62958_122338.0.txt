I always plan on doing a lot on my weekly offs. Maybe a trip, or going out with friends, going to a game, looking for career opportunities. Basically anything that would make my day productive but I always end up wasting it doing absolutely nothing

It sucks, to be honest. It makes me realize just how burnt out I truly am. Life has become too busy. I used to have a lot of interests when I was younger, I was always busy doing something but now it's just me looking for reasons to lay down and do nothing.

Have you guys been through such a phase too? I could totally use some advices. The killing my time guilt when I could be productive is not always pleasant.
