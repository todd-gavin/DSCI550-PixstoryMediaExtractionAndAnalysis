Ricky Gervais has rightly said Just because you are offended it does not mean that you are right My intention was never to paint American Christians as evil but it was to point out the fact that their interpretation of their religion is contradictory to all their actions It is very easy to pin things like these on the government but very difficult to underline and understand that the actions of the government are in line with the populist opinion regardless of whether it is right or wrong And these populist agenda of American Christians to worry more about an unborn fetus rather than assuring safety of school going children by implementing or adhering to strong gun control laws is a perfect presentation of how the government is nothing more than a puppet to the populist opinion You mentioned that churches clothe and feed the poor but conveniently left out the part where there have been plethora of cases of Priests abusing children and assaulting Nuns No matter how many good deeds are carried out they will never be able to wash out the sins of hurting God s own children and scarring them for life An institution which lobbies mandatory birthing of an unborn fetus which does not even have conscience and goes on to molest and abuse the same children and deny rights to women from all walks of the country is singlehandedly responsible for LGBTQIA community to feel unsafe in their own homes with their families can never be adjudged as good regardless of the Good deeds it might do One right does not make up for a lifetime of wrongs
