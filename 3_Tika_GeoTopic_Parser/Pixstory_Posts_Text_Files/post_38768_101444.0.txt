David Raya


Erik Ten Hag plays attractive football, with continuous pressing and fluid formations, and he is known for playing out from the back. David De Gea has been an outstanding performer for United for 10 years. He is one of the best shot-stoppers, but his ball distribution is what may get him in hot soup. Compared to Ederson of Manchester City, his pass completion is only 69 per cent compared to Brazilian 88. With Dean Henderson opting for a move this summer due to game time which he did not get at United, expect United to go for David Raya. His ball distribution skills are what caught the eye of the United officials. He ranks 96 percentile in passes which he had launched more than 40 yards. David De Gea has to again turn back the clock if he wants to keep his place in the first team. 


Borna Sosa


Sosa also known as the Croatian Beckham, has got the attention of Ten Hag. With Luke Shaw and Alex Telles not hitting the ground running, United could dive into the market to find a replacement for these two. The Croatian is known for his assists, having made 8 of them this season. The Croatian is dangerous from the dead ball situation. He has bags of skills and speed in his arsenal to dribble past players at ease. 

Jurrien Timber


The young versatile defender was the mainstay of the ETH era at Ajax. His ability to play as a centre-back and right-back suit United. Aaron Wan Bissaka is expected to be sold, you can expect Timber to join as the right-back position due to his ball-playing ability. Standing at 5ft 9, his height could be a hindrance in the Premier League, where the games are more physical. So expect Eth to use him in the right-back role. He is good with goals too as he has scored 3 goals for the Dutch Champions.
