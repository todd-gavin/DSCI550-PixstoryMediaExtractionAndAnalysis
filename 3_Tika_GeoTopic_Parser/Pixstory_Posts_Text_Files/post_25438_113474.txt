there isn t crack in this book there s fucking heroin My rating Ana put her whole thrussy into this one this book was a thicc motherfucker but i read those pages like my life depending on it i was addicted from cover to cover it became unhealthy i was losing control sleep and my fucking mind because i couldn t get enough let me make one thing fucking clear Jules carried this entire book i fucking love her she s so fiery it s honestly inspiring i had a lot of laugh out loud moments with this book and it was due to miss girl josh ok i experienced a lot of emotions when it came to him at times i wanted to fuck him and other times i wanted to beat him senseless this book became one of those books in which i fell for the female lead harder i love josh and jules dynamic they still had that fire even after that got together and i loved that shit the josh and alex scenes were also so so cute like omfg the bromance i gotta say i felt like chapter was no unbelievably unnecessary for this book like the shit that happened in that chapter felt so out of pocket that it made me feel a lot differently about certain characters than i did in the beginning that s why this isn t rated a full stars nonetheless i really enjoyed the book and story it feels like every book is getting better and better with this series like i can t wait for twisted lies because the few scenes we did get with Christian already had this gorilla grip throwing punches i NEED book already it has released but I m just waiting for the hard copy
