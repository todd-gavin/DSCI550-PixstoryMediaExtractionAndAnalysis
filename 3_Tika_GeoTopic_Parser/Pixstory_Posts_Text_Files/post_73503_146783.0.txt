We shall live in peace
We shall live in peace
We shall live in peace, some day
Oh, deep in my heart
I do believe
We shall overcome, some day
This is a section of Pete Seeger's protest song We Shall Overcome, which was written during the American Civil Rights Movement and reflected the feelings of people all around the world. Girija Kumar Mathur adapted the song into Hindi for use in India and gave it the title Hum Honge Kaamyab. These lines have become the hymn for optimism and the struggle for universal liberty, from the Bangladesh War of Independence to the anti-war movement opposing the Vietnam War to Roger Waters of Pink Floyd emphasising the problem of the Gaza Blockade.
The desire to live in a peaceful world where no child has to grow up believing there is no other option than the violent environment they are compelled to live in is what binds us all together.
