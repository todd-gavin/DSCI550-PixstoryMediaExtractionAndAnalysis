Space Force is being decommissioned by Netflix.

After two critically derided seasons, Netflix has cancelled the Steve Carell comedy from The Office creator Greg Daniels. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the announcement comes after Netflix tried a creative makeover of the costly comedy in its second season, relocating production from Los Angeles to Vancouver in an attempt to cut costs. Along with Daniels, a co-showrunner was hired in the hopes of expanding the series' creative potential, similar to how Carell and Daniels' The Office did over its tenure. 

However, this was not the case, and season two received mixed reviews.

Space Force was co-created by Carell and his former The Office showrunner Daniels, and was inspired by former President Trump's order to establish the Space Force as the sixth military branch. 

Space Force, which was picked up straight to series in January 2019, set a record for talent pay at the time, as Carell's deal for the series reached $1 million per episode when fees for co-creating, executive producing, and performing were factored in.
