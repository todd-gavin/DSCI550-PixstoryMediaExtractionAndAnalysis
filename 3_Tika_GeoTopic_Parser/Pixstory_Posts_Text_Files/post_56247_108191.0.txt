Thousands of protesters have out protesting in the streets of London to demand action from the government on the cost of living crisis.

Workers marched to Parliament to call for adequate pay and conditions as part of the event organized by the Trade Union Congress (TUC).

The union has called for a "decent pay rise for public sector workers" and a £15 minimum wage.

A Treasury spokesman said it had "stepped in to ease the burden".

He added that the government was "helping eight million of the most vulnerable British families through at least £1,200 of direct payments this year - and giving every household £400 to help pay their energy bills".

The TUC said its research indicated workers have lost almost £20,000 since 2008 because pay has not kept in stride with inflation.

Inflation is a real crisis for the people of the UK. People have been suffering and their demand is of the utmost fair in this surge. This is what a country is supposed to do when inflation soars-make sure that their citizens are safe and do their best so that they are least affected by inflation.
