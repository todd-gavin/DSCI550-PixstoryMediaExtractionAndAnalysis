Andre Gomes, a midfielder for Everton, has finished his one-year loan to Lille of France, the club stated.
Gomes has been a member of the Toffees' first team for 100 games since arriving at Goodison Park in the summer of 2018, first on loan and then permanently. The Portuguese international, though, has lost favor in recent years and is battling to rediscover his best form after breaking his ankle against Spurs in November 2019.
The 29-year-old Gomes hasn't appeared in a single match for Everton this year; the only time he has been as an unused substitute is Tuesday's 1-1 tie with Leeds United. The Portuguese international, though, has struggled to regain his natural form since suffering an ankle fracture in a match against Tottenham Hotspur in November 2019, and has fallen out of favor over the past couple of seasons.
There was little likelihood that Gomes would receive regular playing time under Frank Lampard because Everton dramatically strengthened their midfield before the transfer window closed with the additions  Gueye from Paris and Garner from Manchester United.
It is still unknown what proportion of his projected £112,212 weekly salary will be paid by the Blues for the rest of the campaign and how much will be paid by Lille, who are now in eighth position in the standings.
Since his return earlier in 2022, the 29-year-old's relationship with boss Frank Lampard has dwindled. Even though there isn't a buy option attached to this loan agreement, the Blues would want Gomes to succeed because he still has two more seasons remaining on his contract and will try to persuade Lille to purchase him outright.
The Portuguese international has played for the Toffees in 100 games across all competitions, making 100 appearances for the Blues during that time, contributing two goals and seven assists. However, he has been largely flummoxed in England, where the pace and physicality of the game have seemed to pass him by.
