After no other bids were submitted before the deadline this week, the United Kingdom and Ireland will host Euro 2028.

According to the Times, Uefa will make a formal decision to nominate Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as hosts on April 7, barring a last-minute surprise, with the full application process to be concluded by Wednesday March 23.

On April 7, Uefa will make a formal decision to designate Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, barring a surprise last-minute admission. It will also set a deadline of the end of the year for receiving the essential government assurances, and if those are not received by then, the tournament will be re-bid.

Turkey had pushed Uefa to explore a proposal for 2028 or 2032, but it appears to have been ruled out.

Russia had been planning a candidacy for the tournament in six years, but after the invasion of Ukraine, that plan was shelved.

For the 2028 edition, Uefa is scheduled to extend the European Championships to 32 teams, though none of the five host states will qualify automatically due to new criteria.


Rejected bids:

Russia â€“ On June 12, 2021, Alexej Sorokin, the director of the organising committee for Euro 2020 host Saint Petersburg, requested that Russia apply for Euro 2028 or 2032. [18] However, as a result of the sporting suspension, UEFA rejected Russia's candidacy for Euro 2028 owing to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Abandoned bids:

President of the Italian Football Federation Gabriele Gravina told Sky Sport Italia in February 2019 that the federation was exploring a bid. [19] Gravina reintroduced the offer a few days after Italy's Euro 2020 victory. [20] The Italian federation declared in February 2022 that it will bid for Euro 2032 rather than 2028 since it would give them more time to refurbish infrastructure.
