"If you score a goal and want to dance samba, go to the Sambodromo. Here you have to respect your colleagues and stop acting like a m*nkey." 
These unnerving words were said by some proclaimed Spanish 'educated' Football pundits live on El Chiringuito about Vinicius Jr.'s dance moves after every goal.
This is not a new occasion when European pundits doing their bit to earn their bread but in the process, directly insulting professional players who love nothing but the game. 
Previously, Brazilian Maestro Neymar faced several insults live on TV from numerous pundits who denounced his 'outrageous' celebrations after scoring a goal. Now it is the time for another Brazilian superstar in the making - Vinicius Junior. 
Vini's rise to stardom has been something of a fairytale if we see his performances since he joined Real Madrid, thanks to scout Juni Calafat. Despite taking his time to settle in the Spanish Capital, the Brazilian starlet has been one of the most crucial players for 'Los Reyes de Europa' after the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo. Of course, Real cannot ever replace Ronaldo but seeing Vini's performances week in and out is looking at someone who has enormous potential to become 'The Vini Jr.' someday. 
We've seen Vini showcasing his dance moves in an attempt to rise the temperature in the stadium especially at an away ground may seem a mocking of the opposition but people fail to understand the fun side of football. If dancing as a celebration is banned, it's like an insult to the art! 
Atletico Madrid's captain Koke with all his support from some Spanish pundits can continue their criticism of Vinicius Jr., neither he will submit to them nor it will effect his game but a masterclass from the Brazilian seems inevitable after what has been said. 
KEEP THE MOVES FLOWING, VINI ü§ç
