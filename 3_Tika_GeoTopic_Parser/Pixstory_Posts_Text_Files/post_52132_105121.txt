Without a pick in the NBA Draft the Los Angeles Lakers have been working out prospects who could fall late into the second round or undrafted Fortunately the Lakers have shown a keen sense of identifying prospects who can come in and help immediately despite the lack of draft capital In their most recent draft workouts Vanderbilt s Scotty Pippen Jr headlined the group and he would be an instant source of offense for any team that drafts him Pippen played his junior and senior year at Los Angeles high school powerhouse Sierra Canyon and is already familiar with the area and team Pippen revealed his favorite player growing up was Kobe Bryant which he admitted would make it a full circle moment if he were to be drafted by the Lakers I moved out to L A my last two years of high school Pippen said So L A became a new home to me So I ve definitely kept in touch with them growing up Kobe Bryant was my favorite player So I feel like it would be a surreal feeling to be drafted here So I think it s good to finally be able to get in and get a workout in here As a fellow scoring guard Pippen also acknowledged that he modeled some of his offensive game after the Lakers legend Yeah I think people say I use the pump fake a lot and I actually got that from him Just being able to draw fouls pump faking I grew up wearing his jersey number and stuff like that So I was a big Kobe fan Pippen isn t the only prospect who has named Bryant their favorite player as UCLA s Jules Bernard also expressed his love for the Black Mamba after his workout Aside from his admiration for Bryant Pippen is a solid scoring prospect and it would be easy to imagine his fit with the Purple and Gold
