Victor Osimhen has just returned to the field after the serious injury that kept him in the pits for some time and the contagion from Covid that effectively did not allow him to participate in the long-awaited African Cup The Nigerian therefore told himself explaining how difficult it was to overcome the terrible injury sustained after the violent impact with the Inter defender Skriniar I immediately felt that my face exploded As soon as I touched myself on the left cheek I no longer had any sensation I also had problems sleeping and if I turned over on that side I felt pain For now I&#39;ve recovered my strength driven by the desire to play and improve on headers I&#39;m not the type to curb my exuberance and I&#39;ve never made any calculations on the contrary I&#39;ve always tried to get back on my feet immediately without feeling sorry for myself the jump jump sprint I haven&#39;t scared of getting hurt and if I lose I always get angry I&#39;m very sensitive about this I don&#39;t give up
