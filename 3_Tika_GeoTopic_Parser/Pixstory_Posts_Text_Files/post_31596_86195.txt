A document from the reign of Ger has called into question all the dating of the 1st dynasty by raising again the problem of the calendar used by the Egyptians in such a remote era. It consists of an ivory plate on which it is thought to recognize the image of the goddess Sothis or the star Sirius in the form of a crouched cow that carries a vegetable sprout between its horns, a sign that in hieroglyph indicates the term year Vandier Drioton and Vandier If the proposed interpretation is right for the presence of this sign, it means that the Egyptians already in the time of Ger would have coincide the heliacal rising of Sothis Sirius with the beginning of the year in other words since then they would have invented the solar calendar It is probable that a lunar calendar was used in Egypt of which various traces subsist reality led the Egirians to adopt a calendar based on the phenomenon which occurred more regularly in the country and which therefore could more easily observe the flooding of the Nile. Thus they divided the year into three seasons, each of four months made up of thirty days, each of which corresponded to the rhythm determined by the flood The first season is precisely that of the flood akhet the second that of the sprouting and growth of the crops and the third that of the harvest shemu The beginning of the growth of the waters chosen to determine the beginning of the new year takes place at the latitude of Memphis which the assemblage point of the country at the very moment of the heliacal rising of Sirius The phenomenon occurs in the Julian calendar on July about a month before in the Gregorian calendar but not always on this day known in fact that the real solar year of days and hours every year the increase by a quarter of the day causes the dates of the two phenomena, i.e. the flooding of the Nile and the heliacal rising of Sirius, to move away from each other. A new coincidence therefore can only occur when the process of increasing the six daily hours has so to say a complete revolution, that is, every year
