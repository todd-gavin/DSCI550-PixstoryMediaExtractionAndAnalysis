Nobody is saying children should grow ungrateful. The only thing that is being said that they don't "owe" you anything for raising them. These two statements can co-exist. 
Making mistakes is inevitable, even as parents. There's no doubt about it and it doesn't make you a bad parent either. But just how it's not wrong to make mistakes, it's not wrong to have resentment for those who've hurt you even if they're your parents. I think that would just be the consequences of the mistakes, another thing that's inevitable.
To have a good relationship with your kids, you need to let go of this "they OWE me respect" attitude and actually behave in a way where they'll grow up respecting you. Expecting little children to understand complex human emotions like forgiveness or gratitude while not practicing them yourself is kind of hypocritical, don't you think?
