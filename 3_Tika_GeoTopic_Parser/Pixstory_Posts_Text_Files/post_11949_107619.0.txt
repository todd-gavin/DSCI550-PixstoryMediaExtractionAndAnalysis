Parenting is hard . I definitely do not claim to know how it is done . I have heard of people being overwhelmed and tired and sometimes frustration leads to blurting out words and sentences more harmful than intended . 💔😩

According to me Whatever parents say , gives alot of impact on children ! Today I just want to share phrases which can be uttered by parents , sometimes with the intention to hurt , sometimes not ! Still all of these will surely damage the confidence and Self-esteem to child ! 

Phrases Parents Should Never Say ;

1 You should Be more like your sibling .
2 You will never ever succeed in life .
3 I really wish you'd never been born at all .
4 Stop crying you are such a baby .
5 You should Be really ashamed of yourself .
6 You really cannot do anything right ever . can you ? 
7 Do not show your emotions it makes you look weak .
8 You should be better than who you are now .
9 You were an accident and not really wanted .
10 Why are you always so overly dramatic ?
11 You have to be perfect at all times .
12 I don't believe you or anything you say !

Every parent is human and not perfect . Nevertheless , it is also important to understand and realize the power behind words . As children , parents are their first reference to the world and internalize a lot of their parents’ words and actions . ❤️👨‍👩‍👦

Remember that words matter and can hurt . 👨‍👩‍👦💔
