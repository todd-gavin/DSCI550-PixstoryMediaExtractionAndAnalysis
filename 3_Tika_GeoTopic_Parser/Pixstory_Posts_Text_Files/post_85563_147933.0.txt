People with oily skin must use a face serum daily as it is a water-based product that will hydrate your skin, repair dead skin cells and make your skin plum, soft and smooth. 🤩💗
Every serum has different purpose for your skin, so it depends on what you are trying to achieve. Here is a breakdown of serums that one need along with its purpose.🤌🏻🌼
1. Hyaluronic Acid.
This serum is mainly for hydration. After cleansing and toning the face- go ahead with a good Hyalurionic serum.
2.Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)
This serum is indicated to reduce the appearance of skin blemishes and congestion. Apply to entire face morning and evening before heavier creams.
3.Vitamin C🍋
Vitamin C is an effective antioxidant, brightens the skin tone and reduces signs of aging. Vitamin C is such important part of any skin care routine.Using C during the day in combination with sunscreen is one of the most powerful combinations we can use for UV protection.
4. You can use lactic acid based serum which will reduce pigmentation.
5. Hyaluronic acid will make your skin plum and hydrate.
6. Salicylic acid will reduce black and white head.
Being said that, use no more than two serums per routine. If you have many serums that you like, use one to two in your morning routine and two different serums in the evening.
