Currently investigations are being conducted over the police s inadequate response to the school shooting in Uvalde Legislators and investigators cite several failures across multiple agencies A video was released to the public depicting the police reaction in which officers stood outside the classroom for more than an hour with one officer even taking a break to disinfect his hands while the gunman locked himself inside and killed many children and teachers A police officer whose wife was a teacher in the school and who was slain during the mass shooting tried to storm the room but was stopped by his superiors and forced to disarm before he could intervene In the video he is seen checking his phone while replying presumably to see whether his wife is okay However some saw this as him being inept and inconsiderate clearly failing to appreciate the context of the situation Clearly this is a terrible situation and it is crucial that investigators discover where we fell short so that we may take measures to prevent or mitigate future occurrences Nonetheless it is of equal importance that people not rush to judgment and refrain from criticizing and pointing fingers at others when they do not understand the whole story s context
