Her resilience, motivation, and hardwork are what makes Serena Williams always the number one Tennis player. She has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and the second-most of all time. 

She was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the 1999 US Open.

 From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she stood strong, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career Grand Slam, known as the "Serena Slam". 

After a break from injury at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claiming Olympic gold and becoming the first tennis player to achieve a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.

She won eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–to 15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the 2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record. 

She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and has reached four major finals since returning to play.

Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Williams was the world's highest-paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.

 She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman on Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27 million in prize money and endorsements. She has won the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was named Sportsperson of the Year by Sports Illustrated magazine. In 2021, she was ranked 28th on Forbes' World's Highest-Paid Athletes list. She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time. She is an inspiration to a whole generation of girls in and around America and the world for making their benchmark in Sports.
