NASA has finished the system requirements review for its Mars Sample Return Program which is nearing completion of the conceptual design phase NASA TV reported that during this phase the program team evaluated and refined the architecture to return the scientifically selected samples which are currently in the collection process by NASA s Perseverance rover in the Red Planet s Jezero Crater The architecture for the campaign which includes contributions from the European Space Agency ESA is expected to reduce the complexity of future missions and increase probability of success The conceptual design phase is when every facet of a mission plan gets put under a microscope said Thomas Zurbuchen associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington There are some significant and advantageous changes to the plan which can be directly attributed to Perseverance s recent successes at Jezero and the amazing performance of our Mars helicopter This advanced mission architecture takes into consideration a recently updated analysis of Perseverance s expected longevity Perseverance will be the primary means of transporting samples to NASA s Sample Retrieval Lander carrying the Mars Ascent Vehicle and ESA s Sample Transfer Arm With planned launch dates for the Earth Return Orbiter and Sample Retrieval Lander in fall and summer respectively the samples are expected to arrive on Earth in With its architecture solidified during this conceptual design phase the program is expected to move into its preliminary design phase this October In this phase expected to last about months the program will complete technology development and create engineering prototypes of the major mission components
