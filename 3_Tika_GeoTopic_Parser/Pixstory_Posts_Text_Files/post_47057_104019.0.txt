Chelsea Women’s star Fran Kirby has opened up about fatigue issues that have kept her out of the game and disrupted her career. The star has been plagued with bouts of health trouble, including being diagnosed with a heart condition in 2019.

The star is optimistic about making it to the nationals team for the 2022 UEFA Women's European Championship, having been included in the preliminary squad. She is reportedly managing her training and her diet, being extremely careful.

However, she has not made an appearance.since February and with her health issues, concerns over playing fitness would not be amiss. The 28 year old forward has opened up about her health issues, admitting that sometimes she even lacked the strength to walk her own dog.

Talking about her illness, she had to add, "It was really tough. I've had previous experiences with illness so it was hard to take. At the time I wasn't really caring about football or training but I think I dealt with it really well.

You lose a lot of stuff you usually do. I wasn't even able to walk the dog for five minutes so it's been nice to do that again. Hopefully now I can continue pushing."

On being involved in the English national team, “I feel good and hopefully I can be involved and get some training in.

I have to try hard but also do the right things to make sure things don't happen again. I know I have to perform to be able to get back into the squad but also do it in a safe way.

I know my body now and what I can do. I've said to Sarina and the coaching staff that I will be honest and I will know if I'm not right."

The Chelsea star will have to be careful managing her playing career, with this being the second bout of prolonged absence. She has also missed nine months previously when she was diagnosed with her heart condition.
