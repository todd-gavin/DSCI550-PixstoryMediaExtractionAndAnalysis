We have made lists of what we consider to be the Wonders of the World, but isn't the world itself just truly wondrous! The naturally existing beauties, the ones constructed centuries before, places and areas that have withstood the trials of time and kept their exquisite delicacy for us to enjoy. The European continent is the most appreciated in terms of Holiday Destinations, for any and every occasion whenever people can afford, they come and visit the lovely sights in its countries. Some of the most dreamy places to visit include, England, France, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Scotland, Romania, Prague, Greece, Denmark, Finland, Croatia and Vatican City. The beaches, the architecture, the museums, the historically, literature based and culturally prominent places, the food, the people, just about everything keeps pulling people from all around the globe towards these magnificent European destinations. Not denying any other continents and countries charms and enchanting allure, because all of them have places that are absolutely worth seeing atleast once in our lives. There is no time to be bored in a world as beautiful as this. 
"The most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the world itself."~ Wallace Stevens, American poet, Pulitzer Prize winner for his Collected Poems 1955.
