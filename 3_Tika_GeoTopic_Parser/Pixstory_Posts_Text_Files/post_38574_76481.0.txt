Julian Alverez is a Cityzen !! Manchester City were able to beat competition from AC Milan to get their man. Sources have told ESPN the overall cost of the transfer could be less than £20 million. 


He will likely to replace Ferran Torres and Sergio Kun Aguero, who left for Barcelona and most probably Raheem Sterling, who will look for greener pastures next summer.
His main position is Center Forward, but he can also operate from left and right wing. He can operate down the right wing, with Jack Grealish or Rahim Sterling(if he doesn't go down the left) operating from the left. City will be looking for an established striker in the form of Erling Haaland or Harry Kane after they missed out on Kane in the season of 2021/22.


Julian Alvarez has already 18 goals to his name in 21 matches he played for River Plate and at only 21 years of age . Behind him is Gustavo Del Prete who is 24 years and has only 9 goals to his name.

Alvarez has 6 assists to his name. If City are able to get a established striker this summer, he will have a joy in assisting the striker and scoring goal for himself.

Alvarez has long idolized Aguero.A move to the Etihad Stadium would give him the opportunity to follow in his former international team-mate's footsteps.


Alvarez converted the majority of his goals from inside the box - a total of four from inside the six-yard box underlining his goal-poaching abilities - but there were also five from outside the area. Alvarez has a hammer of a right foot, generating impressive power with minimal back-lift and scoring 12 goals. But he is by no means one-footed. In fact, he is similarly strong on his left, he scored 5 goals with his left.

There was even a goal with his head. Alvarez may be small in stature but, like Aguero, he is dangerous in the air, his combative nature ensuring he does not shy away from aerial challenges. 

Reports suggest He would initially return to River on loan before joining up with City later this year
