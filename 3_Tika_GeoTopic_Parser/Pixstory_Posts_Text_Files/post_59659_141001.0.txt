I came from a background where using a smartphone before the age of eighteen was " meye kharap hoye jaabe" to others. Where opting to sing and dance was "baaje meye hoye gache" to others. Being a girl i never used an eye liner or lipstick while attending parties or weddings as the "society" was always the larger slice of the cake of my life. 
It was 2018, the year which made me who I am today. After a hundreds of "no's" i started my college life from the hearts of the city,Saltlake. Life was very different there. It took me months to get adjusted to my surroundings. In my small area where i was always being said to wear salwaars or even long tops or kurtas with jeans , i was seeing people wearing crop tops and fashionable outfits all around. To me , fashion took a different move then. I started dressing myself in newer ways to look different, actually to look alike the ones around. I got a tons of offers for commercial shoots and reality shows and even started with some. I pinned life to be the smoothest then untill the world was hit by the novel coronavirus.All the sectors took a pause right then and so did my urge for going out. Well, i belong to a nuclear family where our family meets just for some minutes at night sitting together for a supper! Just as the life of a working family can be. To me, i myself was my friend cum secret keeper all my way. Thus, staying locked in my house for about an year or two pulled the worst out of me in the primary months. I used to dig in my stocks my find some good story books but that didn't helped for long neither did the never ending calls with the besties! 
I always loved doing extra curricular stuffs and a part of it made me join some social media community groups back then. Social media communities were in great power then. I joined them as a singer and PR and started contributing towards their growth.
