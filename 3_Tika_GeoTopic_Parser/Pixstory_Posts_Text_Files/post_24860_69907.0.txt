India celebrates Army Day with tremendous zeal on January 15. It commemorates Field Marshal Kodandera Madappa Cariappa (K. M. Cariappa), who’d been the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. Every year, the day is marked by conducting a military parade and many other martial displays at Delhi Cantonment’s Cariappa Parade Ground.
