In the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district, close to Pahalgam, is the alpine lake known as Tulian Lake. It is 3,684 metres above sea level and 16 kilometres (9.9 miles) southwest of Pahalgam and 11 kilometres (7.5 miles) from Baisaran. The lake frequently has ice floes floating on it. Mountains that reach heights of nearly 4,800 metres (15,700 feet) and are typically covered with snow encircle it on three sides. It is situated in a pine forest-dotted meadow. 

The massive Himalayan range includes the lake. The colour of the lake, which contrasts with the snow-capped mountains in the distance, makes it one of Kashmir's most picturesque landscapes. A freshwater lake can be found there.
