Association between hepcidin and type diabetes markers in indigenous Argentinean children living at high altitude Abstract Background Hepcidin is a protein that regulates the metabolism of iron In addition a high iron load can cause insulin resistance and subsequent diabetes Objective To investigate the association between hepcidin levels and glucose insulin lipids HOMA IR and inflammatory markers C reactive protein CRP ferritin Lp a and leucocytes in indigenous school children living at m above sea level Data were collected cross sectionally from the four schools in San Antonio de los Cobres SAC BMI glucose insulin lipids CRP hemoglobin leucocytes iron ferritin transferrin and hepcidin levels were obtained Results Three hundred and seventy six children males aged y were included Fifty five children were underweight overweight and obese Univariate analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between hepcidin and glucose r and HOMA IR r Furthermore hepcidin was found to be directly and significantly correlated with Lp a r leucocytes r CRP r and ferritin r Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that hepcidin was significantly and inversely associated with glucose and BMI and directly with Lp a CRP leucocytes and ferritin adjusted for age and gender R Conclusion In this study which included indigenous children living at high altitudes m hepcidin was significantly and inversely associated with glucose and BMI and directly associated with inflammatory markers such as CRP Lp a leucocytes and ferritin suggesting that hepcidin could be a reliable marker of future type diabetes Sources
