Giving up the Italian internationals was a hard blow for Matteo Berrettini The same goes for the Montecarlo and Madrid tournaments but the operation on the little finger of his right hand couldn&#39;t wait The problem now that recovery times risk expanding and Roland Garros too departure in May he might not see him take the field The bad news was given by the blue tennis player at an event in Milan I felt the pain playing a backhand before Indian Wells we thought it was inflammation and instead it was a lesion of a small particle above the right little finger which serves to hold the tendon in place So every time I played the backhand the tendon moved at that point the operation was necessary Now I have started moving my hand again the recovery proceeds with the right timing As for Paris not yet his participation skipped but he himself confirmed that more no than yes because I don&#39;t want to force the times he will only go to Paris if he is in a position to go all the way It could therefore be that Berrettini will return to play directly on the grass of Wimbledon It will be a season on different grass because I won&#39;t get there with so many games behind me Wimbledon Last year I took the post losing in the final next time I hope to score he added mentally this stop was difficult and the day I officially announced that I would not play in Rome it was terrible But I will transform these negative energies into competitive malice when I return I have always come back stronger after injuries
