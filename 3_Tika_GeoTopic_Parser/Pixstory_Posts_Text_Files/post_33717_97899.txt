There are still three days left in the Turkish S for Lig but the first verdicts have already arrived even if in a rather bizarre way Gazi ehir Gaziantep and G ztepe face off in the championship round The guests need a victory to still remain in the fight for salvation E in added time the feat seems accomplished Jahovic gives the lead to G ztepe dreaming of extending the dream of salvation for at least another day The goal however comes following the injury of an opponent left on the ground but before the match director whistles stop the G ztepe midfielder Soner Aydo du in fact kicks from midfield hitting the crossbar Jahovic then finds himself ready and bags, starting the protests of the hosts A few minutes go by and Joo Figueiredo equalizes the score in amazement general The goal in fact arithmetically condemns G ztepe to relegation after seasons in TFF First League the Turkish Serie B The equalizing goal comes after the Brazilian crossed the field with the visiting defenders who let him score undisturbed in a great gesture of fairplay But there&#39;s more to the match director even assigns a penalty to Gaziantep who could thus win the points Visitor coach Stjepan Tomas commented on the episode I didn&#39;t make the decision to let Gaziantep score I also spoke to our managers who gave us the ok to continue playing The choice was up to the players themselves who decided otherwise
