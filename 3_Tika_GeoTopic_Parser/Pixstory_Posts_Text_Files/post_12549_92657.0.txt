We surely know many mental health problems did arise especially during the pandemic period. All of us were closed to our homes and definitely that would impact our mental well being. Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shed light on the difficulties that the high school students have confronted during this period. 

The agency released its survey which is associated with the teens mental state during Covid 19. 

From the survey what we can understand is that more than half that's 55 percent of high school students have experienced emotional abuse during this period. And the worst part is it is from an adult who is at their home. Adding on to it 11 percent of them experienced physical abuse. 

37 percent of high schoolers developed poor mental health during the pandemic period and 44 percent expressed that they felt persistently sad or hopeless in the previous year. 

Nearly 29 percent of them shared that their parent or an adult in their home had lost their job during that period. 
Dr. Debra Houry, the acting principal deputy director at the CDC told in a statement that, “These data echo a cry for help." 

“The COVID-19 pandemic has created traumatic stressors that have the potential to further erode students’ mental wellbeing. Our research shows that surrounding youth with the proper support can reverse these trends and help our youth now and in the future.” 

As per the reports from CDC, lesbian, gay, bisexual youth, and female youth had experienced higher levels of poor mental health and also emotional abuse from their parent or their caregiver. There were also high rates of suicide especially in these groups of youth.
