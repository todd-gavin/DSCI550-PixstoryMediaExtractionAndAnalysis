In New York, ads for jobs would require disclosing the pay scale for the job seekers.
NYC lawmakers voted for including salary information in job postings to keep the seeker informed.

This concern has always been a hotly debated issue in many countries, with NYC being the first to vote to implement the policy. 
An advocate for restaurant workers, Elizabeth Stone, said, " I believe I deserve to know how much I can make as a waitress. You've put in a challenging position of not wanting to upset your employer and not wanting to scare away an opportunity, but also wanting to fight for what you know is what you deserve,”

"Pay transparency", in many ways, would eradicate the inequality between genders. Having disclosed the pay scale, people would know how fairly the income is decided for someone doing the same job.

Although many opinions have been hovering around, with people saying revealing the pay scale would decrease the job opportunity. Political consultant Amelia Adams said that she often doesn’t advertise salaries for fear of putting off job-seekers before even getting a chance to talk.
Nevertheless, this may be beneficial for the annihilation of issues like gender inequality.
