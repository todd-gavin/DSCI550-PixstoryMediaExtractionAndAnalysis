AMORE FINO A PROVA CONTRARIA, the new album by the Friulian singer-songwriter PIERO SIDOTI, will be released tomorrow Saturday May. It contains the singles Un Posto and Cosmico released in the past months. Piero Sidoti Love until proven otherwise an album whose common denominator is feelings and emotions where imperfect, wrong and splendid love stories are sung but above all human love stories The show is a meditation narrated and sung in the form of a fairy tale where the songs of Sidoti find a home on a meditative journey to know, gain awareness and welcome our entire inner world without forcing it, accepting even our darkest parts without identifying with them and thus learning to leave and let go of a path within us to be reborn and make contact with the our truest part
