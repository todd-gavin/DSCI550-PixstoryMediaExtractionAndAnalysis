While I was wondering none of the reptiles turned up probably due to the cold night and as some time passed I heard some murmurs from nearby I was informed by one of the constables about the crossing of a herd of wild boars at a short distance from us and thus asked everyone to be alert as these boars could be really life threatening and powerful on the level ground where they often attacked their enemies head on with immense momentum while their tusks tore deep into the flesh As another hour passed with everyone being careful and wary of the wild boars they seemed to have moved far and nothing but hares and birds could be vaguely seen or felt in the vicinity as the moon light allowed more clear view The December night was a cold one and we had adopted the trick used by the dasyu gangs of covering overhead with polythene sheets to save ourselves from the effects of the dew that was increasing every hour with the advancing night As the morning came closer the birds which were being heard through the night became clearly visible and gradually moved into the river waters The intended enemy was still not at sight while some farmers could now be noticed moving in their fields to light fires around which they sat to warm up themselves for the activities of the day To be continued
