 It means Yoga brings peace for us The peace from yoga is not only for individuals Yoga brings peace to our society Yoga brings peace to our nations and the world And Yoga brings peace for our universe This might feel an extreme thought to someone but our Indian sages have answered this with a simple mantra This whole universe starts from our own body and soul The universe starts from us And Yoga makes us conscious of everything within us and builds a sense of awareness It starts with self awareness and proceeds to awareness of the world When we become aware of ourselves and our world we begin to spot things that need to be changed both in ourselves and in the world These may be individual life style problems or global challenges like climate change and international conflicts Yoga makes us conscious competent and compassionate towards these challenges Millions of people with a common consciousness and consensus Millions of people with inner peace will create an environment of global peace That s how Yoga can connect the people That s how yoga can connect the countries And that s how yoga can become a problem solver for all of us
