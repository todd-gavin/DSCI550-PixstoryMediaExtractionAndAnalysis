2. Southampton

Inconsistency is something that has become a trend at the Saint Mary’s stadium over the course
of the past few seasons, and the same holds true for their goalkeeping department as well. With
Fraser Foster set to join Tottenham, Southampton are short in the goalkeeping department and
can turn towards Karius as a replacement. Southampton have veteran Willy Cabellero as a
backup keeper, but with the player in his twilight ages - must certainly be exploring other
avenues to have a competent backup keeper.

Karius and Southampton are almost a perfect match for each other. Both were once heralded
with a lot of promise and potential, only for them to have thrown it away and not reach the
heights they once had. Manager Ralph Hassenhuttl’s search for a goalkeeper could end with
Karius being the man they sign.

3. AFC Bournemouth

Newly promoted Bournemouth find themselves light in the goalkeeping department. The Cherries just have Woodman and Dennis as two senior goalkeepers, both lacking top flight
experience. Karius could be brought into the club to provide mentoring and much needed
numbers for the club to start their survival campaign in the Premier League.

Joining Bournemouth would keep the pressure off Karius' shoulders, giving him an environment
where he can thrive and find his form once again.

Wherever Karius decides to join, it would be important for him to choose a right club where he
can find playing time and regain confidence to salvage his career.
