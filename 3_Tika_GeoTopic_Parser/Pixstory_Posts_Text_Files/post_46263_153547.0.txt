Guys this is not me üòÇ but let me tell you ways ; ‚úÖ‚ú®
1 Slugging your hair at night with a lightweight oil and fuzzy sock OR sleeping with a silk bonnet ! Not only will it give you the most silky hair ever , but it will also protect your hair from damage + breakage , which allows it to grow stronger and longer !
2 Doing an overnight hair oil mask once a week with an oil that promotes growth . My favorite oils are Castor , Rosemary and Argan . Wash out in the morning !
3 Start using a scalp massager daily ! I use one every time in the shower after applying shampoo , but also every night before bed . This stimulates hair follicles and promotes growth . 
4 Rice Water + Apple Cider Vinegar : Both of these DIY hair masks are INCREDIBLE for hair growth . I love this combination . But remember - Rice Water may not be work for every hair type . It worked for me ! 
5 Find out if your hair has too much or too little protein and give it what it needs ! This will help the overall health of your hair and allow it to grow and thrive . Too much protein can lead to breakage and too little protein can lead to hair that won‚Äôt grow and isn‚Äôt healthy .
