Hey everyone I hope this post finds you all in great health So this side Tashu well isn t it a cute name So coming on introduction to describe me in a single word I would say I am versatile because I love to do multiple things like dancing cooking craft work digital stuff and more I am a foodie loves to eat in small breaks especially bhelpuri aahhh my mouth is literally watering right now I would also like to compare myself to a dolphin Just like dolphin which is at first very shy to strangers but as soon as they get well with each other it turns out to be freindly kind and caring I too am a bit shy in the start but as time passes I can bet you ll forget the former me So that s it a brief introduction of myself I hope you like making freinds with me Byee and have a wonderful day ahead
