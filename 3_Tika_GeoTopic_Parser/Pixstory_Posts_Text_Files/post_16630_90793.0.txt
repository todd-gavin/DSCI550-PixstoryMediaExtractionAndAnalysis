Sharmaji Namkeen is all set to release on Wednesday, March 31. Ranbir Kapoor arrived in style for promotions of his father Rishi Kapoor’s last film.

Sharmaji Namkeen is extra special for the Kapoor khandaan, especially Neetu Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor and Riddhima Kapoor Sahni since it marks the last film of late actor Rishi Kapoor. The film will be released nearly two years after Rishi’s death on April 30, 2020.

Ranbir Kapoor arrived in style for the promotions, wearing an all-black ensemble. The ‘Brahmastra’ actor looked hot and handsome in a printed black shirt and black pants that he paired with brown shoes.
