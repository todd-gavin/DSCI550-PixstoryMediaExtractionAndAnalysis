When it comes to Agatha Christie, Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot character isn't quite up to scratch. There is a pre-credits origin narrative for the moustache in Death On The Nile (the sequel to the 1978 film starring Peter Ustinov), which is more background material than most of the other characters are given.

Linnet Ridgeway (Gal Gadot) and her new husband Simon Doyle (Jamie Foxx) are on their honeymoon in North Africa when Poirot (Daniel Craig) finds himself tagging along (Armie Hammer). Other guests include Linnet's dour champagne socialist godmother, her bitter ex-fiance, a clueless toff and his domineering mother, and a well-known jazz singer and her niece, all of whom are there to wish the happy couple well (the starry cast includes Annette Bening, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Russell Brand). The unwelcome yet unshakeable presence of Simon's jealous ex-lover (Emma Mackey) marred the festivities.

Despite Christie's efforts, the film achieves nothing to alleviate the guest list's dysfunction. Linnet's nightly use of sleeping pills, however, may now be explained in part by this information.

When it comes to cinematography, this is a flashy work with plenty of bubbly and unfunny tinkling laughing on the dance floor. Dizzy by all the glitter and show, but unable to hide the truth that this is an empty bauble, the camera whirls in a frenzy.
