‌‌Divorce is always a difficult task. Even though the relationship was unhealthy; you could always end it in a very healthy way. Oklahoma City first established no-fault divorces in 1953, eliminating the need of finding faults in partners to end the marriage. This was later followed by other states. 
‌
‌No-fault laws eliminate the need to accuse a spouse of doing something untoward to establish a divorce; rather, they only need to cite "irreconcilable differences" instead. They are less expensive and reduce a lot of negative energy. It encourages people to leave an abusive relationship; it might be difficult for some people to explain what they have faced, whereas no-fault divorces provide a safe platform.
‌
‌Monetary settlements are based on a spouse's need, capacity to pay, and contributions to the family's finances, rather than on the bad things they did to cause the divorce. This also leads to less conflict and issues. 
‌
‌Whatever your concepts on marriage are there is always an easy option to end your toxic relationships. No need to cling to anything that doesn't give you mental peace.
