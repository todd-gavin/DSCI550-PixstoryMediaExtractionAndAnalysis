What is a Coral?

Corals are actually the skeletal remains of a marine polyp. The fleshy skin polyps secrete a carbonic substance from which coral grows like branches of trees in the warm waters of the ocean at a depth ranging from 10 feet to 500 feet. 

Certain species survive in much deeper waters. Around 95% of the coral is made up of Calcium Carbonate, around 3% of magnesium carbonate and trace elements of iron. Coral is also known as aragonite when found in the lining of seashells and is counted as a calcite by mineralogists.
