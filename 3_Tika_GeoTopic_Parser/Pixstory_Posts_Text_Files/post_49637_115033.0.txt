America has been considering the threat of coronavirus a negligible one even after the Covid pandemic that affected the whole population. The Omicron variant BA.5 is now very much dominant in the US and ignorance is causing a wave across the country. 

Most of the people aren't testing and hence the size of the wave isn't clear yet, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the past week have reported a little more than 100,000 new cases a day on average. 

Vaccines against the coronavirus offer limited protection from BA.5 and so far it is the worst version of the virus that we have seen. Doubts arise as this contagious hospitalization had not undergone a spike.  About 38,000 people were hospitalized nationally with covid as of Friday, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. 

There is widespread approval among infectious-disease experts that this persists as a dangerous virus that causes illnesses of unpredictable severity — and they say the country is not doing enough to restrict transmission.

Now the Restrictions and mandates are long gone. Air travel is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Political leaders aren’t talking about the virus — it’s almost a nonissue on the campaign trail. Most people are done with masking and social distancing. Playing with their lives it seems.
