US President Joe Biden unleashed sweeping sanctions Thursday responding to Russian President Vladimir Putin s attack on Ukraine that target Moscow s banking technology and aerospace sectors though the US and Europe stopped short of several key steps to target Moscow and Putin himself Still the scale of the package crafted over weeks of intensive technical and diplomatic negotiations marks the most significant deployment of economic penalties against a country with Russia s economic size and integration in global markets The US levied penalties across industries from asset freezes for the largest banks to debt and equity restrictions on critical mining transportation and logistics firms The package also included the largest scale effort to date to shut down access to critical technology for key Russian military and industrial sectors It also expanded the US strategy of targeting the adult children of key players and businessmen in Putin s inner circle The sanctions perhaps most critically were deployed in concert with Western allies in a show of force that underscored unified outrage with Putin s actions while at the same time limiting potential holes in the package that could be exploited by Russian companies These sanctions are completely unprecedented in their strength said Julia Friedlander a former Treasury Department and National Security Council official and director of the economic statecraft initiative at the Atlantic Council It really is taking a hatchet to Russian financial markets and the ability to move money around For days Biden s top aides telegraphed devastating sanctions targeting Russia s banking system in the event of an invasion and Thursday s actions made clear it wasn t a bluff as banks totaling more than trillion in total assets were slapped with sweeping penalties Ukraine and some lawmakers call for more At the same time Ukrainian leaders and some US lawmakers urged Biden to go even further to punish Moscow and Putin for the attack on Ukraine
