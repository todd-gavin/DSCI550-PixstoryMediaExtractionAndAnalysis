Slave trade brought many advantages to western societies The main duty of a slave was to work on plantations increasing productivity Slaves often worked long tedious hours in the sun with no pay or reward for their hard labour Their presence made traders and plantation owners more productive and made their living conditions very harsh After a while the duties of slaves extended to domestic work and female slaves became of high value In addition to their plantation duties many female slaves were taken into the homes of their masters to serve their mistresses cook clean and wash for them If a mistress had too many children the domestic worker was made to help in caring for the child After a while female slaves were made to take the place of low class women paid to breastfeed babies a practice known as wet nursing During enslavement black women of childbearing age were highly valuable Of course they could help increase the population of enslaved people but enslavers and their families had another idea of something they could provide Breast milk Shortly after giving birth enslaved mothers would frequently be forced to breastfeed white women s babies instead of their own Enslaved mothers could sometimes only see their babies few weeks This had horrible consequences Black children died at an astonishingly high rate Of course white women didn t care They went the extra mile to ensure they had black women s breast milk For some reason they considered breastfeeding as dirty or undignified White people loved to spread lies They painted black women as bad mothers who abandoned their own children to happily nurse white children when the truth was they were milking black women like cows Black women still carry that trauma Today they still have much lower rates of breastfeeding We all must know the horrific history of black women and breastfeeding to understand our cultural attitude towards the practice and hopefully finally free ourselves of the shackles of that anti black legacy and make our own choices about how to take care of our families
