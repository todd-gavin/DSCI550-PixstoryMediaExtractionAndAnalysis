The internet has changed the world that we live in and has constructed a whole new dimension that makes the internet the most important resource in today s era But the instances of cyber crimes have risen continuously at a rate much faster than conventional crimes especially in India because it is the second largest internet consuming country in the world with over million active internet users and their data is being shared with companies and the Government regularly This is a huge concern and puts our security at stake Surveys have revealed India has one of the most merciless online abuse cultures in the world The consequences of online abuse are very meager and general The algorithms of social media and internet companies do not have an effective review or fact check mechanism in place The plans proposed by the central government for Tech Company to invest in India require the confidence of a strong cyber law Otherwise they have no reason to invest in a country with sub standard cyber laws in place The cyber law in India must evolve accordingly to safeguard the interests of such a huge population of internet users who share vast amounts of information over the internet every second of the day To increase the security focus should be given to the already existing laws in India For example Section F of Punishment for cyber terrorism state Whoever commits or conspires to commit cyber terrorism shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to imprisonment for life This law itself is ambiguous because the terminology in multiple sections is too vague to ensure consistent and fair enforcement There is a need for stricter laws because these laws fall short to provide clear guidelines on the purposes for which the data can be put and to who can be sent or standards and technical measures governing the collection storage access to protection retention and destruction of data With most countries providing strong safeguards against breaches to cybersecurity It has become the need of the hour a bill should be legislated exclusively against cybercrime in India
