Man United’s current season has been the worst since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. They recorded the lowest point tally(58) in a season. It was a season to forget for both the fans and players alike. There have been a host of changes in the management, with new DOF incoming, scouting chiefs, new manager. Ten Hag has prioritized a new fullback. He has an eye on Borna Sosa, who after initially a tough spell is making waves in the Bundesliga. He caught the eye of Chelsea, who were looking for a backup for the injured Ben Chilwell.


However, Man United are looking to cause trouble for their English counterpart, as Erik Ten 

Hag wants to implement him in his newly formed squad. Whichever team manages to get hold of him, they will get a player who has high attacking output plus he will be troublesome for opponents with his magic feet and his dangerous passes and crosses.

 It remains to be seen where the Croatian will end up,as the transfer window opens in the first month of June.
