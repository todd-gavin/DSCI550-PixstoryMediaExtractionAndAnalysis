While we re talking about boundaries at work from home or otherwise we might as well talk about the exclusion of queer people in most such workplaces Diversity at workplaces is always appreciated but it is also important to ensure that offices are well equipped and ready to provide for marginalized communities and to make environments safer and better for them which also contributes to the overall environment of the workplace and encourages employees to do better Here are some ways you as an individual can do your part in helping build safe spaces Not Making Assumptions Unlearn the heteronormativity and avoid assuming that people s sexualities and identities would be default i e cis het allo and monogamous Educate yourself Educate yourself and keep up with the knowledge of microaggressions that can hurt the community as well as policies and laws that may affect your fellow citizens Use your privilege and demand better action from office managements policy makers your colleagues and family members Express that you care Show up in small ways or big Ask for people s pronouns express the possibility of non heterosexual relationships in conversations and not always linking a man to a woman or vice versa bring up topics surrounding pride and policies during daily conversations Respect people when they come out When someone comes out to you make sure that you express sexuality doesn t change anything for you but also acknowledging the struggles and disadvantages that one has to face because of it make sure they know you re with them and make sure to ask if they re doing okay Respect their boundaries and pay attention that you re not forcing someone to talk about things that disturb them Do not out someone Respect and understand that while one might come out to you they may not be ready or willing to do the same with everyone else Do Not out someone against their consent respect queer people s boundaries and their wishes this is theirs to tell and not yours
