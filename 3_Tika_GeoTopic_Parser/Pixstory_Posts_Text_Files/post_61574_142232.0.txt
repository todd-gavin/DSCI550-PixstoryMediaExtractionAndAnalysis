Roman Reigns will not be dropping the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship anytime soon, a new report has claimed.
Roman has held the Universal Championship since August 2020, before merging the belt with the WWE Championship after beating Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 38 in April of this year.
He’s been champion for over 700 days at this stage, and a new report has claimed that his reign isn’t going to be ending anytime soon.
A new report from WrestlingNews.co has revealed that Triple H is planning on having Roman Reigns stay as Undisputed WWE Universal Champion for the remainder of 2022.
In fact, the report claims that Reigns will be walking into WrestleMania 39 as the champion, meaning he’d have been champion for a staggering 945 days by that point.
The plan is still for Roman to defend his titles against The Rock at WrestleMania next year, with ‘The Tribal Chief’ winning the match and walking out of Los Angeles with his reign still intact
So it seems like the plan, at least as of right now, is for Roman to walk into WrestleMania 39 as Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, beat The Rock to retain his title, and then drop the belts shortly thereafter
