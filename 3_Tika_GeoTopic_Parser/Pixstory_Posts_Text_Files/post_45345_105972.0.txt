Malawi will be chasing their second victory to extend their lead on top of Group D as they face hosts
Guinea at the General Lansana Conte Stadiumon Thursday.

Hosts Guinea lost their match to Egypt last time out, while visitors Malawi won 2-1 against Ethiopia.

Guinea find themselves in terrible form, winless in 5 in all competitions. They will need to shrug off this
form if they want to make it to the group stages of the African Cup of Nations.

Malawi on the other hand find themselves in good form, unbeaten in their last 4 opportunities. Malawi
made it to the round of 16 last time out and will look to go further in the competition this time around.

Guinea vs Malawi: Predictions

While visitors Malawi are in better form, they tend to struggle away from home. Winless in their last
away outings, they also have a poor record against Guinea. Expect the hosts to narrowly edge out this
one.
