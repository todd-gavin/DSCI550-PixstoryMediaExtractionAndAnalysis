Labor has expanded its election lead for the first time since the election campaign began, as inflation fears and waning confidence in government put the Coalition on the wrong side of their own political divide. 

Labor has increased its already significant election-winning advantage by one percentage point, to 55.5 percent to 44.5 percent in two-party preferred terms, according to an exclusive Roy Morgan poll released this week. 

However, the ALP's increase in support after preferences does not reflect a boost in the party's primary vote. 

Labor's support for first preference nominations remained unchanged at 35%, bringing it even with the Coalition, which slipped 0.5 points since last week's poll.With a 1 percentage point increase to 13%, the Greens' vote share improved marginally, somewhat recovering from a loss in support shown in last week's survey. 

When the results were crunched on a two-party preferred basis, the shifts in support for the major parties tended to favour Labor.

Letâ€™s see what happens next!
