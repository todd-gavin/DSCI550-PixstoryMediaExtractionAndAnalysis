Long gone is the time when Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's duel used to light up the Spanish league season after season. Both the legends have moved on to other clubs and are not at the peak of their powers. La Liga on the other hand could have inherited another great rivalry after Barcelona ended up signing Robert Lewandowski this summer! 

The rivalry that we are talking about is between Robert Lewandowski and Karim Benzema. Both the center-forwards have been at the peak of their powers in the last two-three season. While Robert Lewandowski should have arguably won the last two Balon d'Ors, Karim Benzema is the favourite to win his first golden ball this time around. 

Karim Benzema had an exceptional season for Real Madrid scoring 42+ goals and helping his club win the LaLiga, Supercup, and the Champions League trophy this season. Lewandowski himself has had a dream run for Bayern Munich. The Polish striker scored 48+ goals for the Bavarians in competitions and proved once again why he is currently one of the best in the world. 

Both Benzema and Lewandowski would be 34 years old when the 2022/23 season starts! Hence we may not be able to get to see a long rivalry between the two number 9s. However, we could surely see a couple of years of intensive competition between the two powerhouses of Spanish football!
