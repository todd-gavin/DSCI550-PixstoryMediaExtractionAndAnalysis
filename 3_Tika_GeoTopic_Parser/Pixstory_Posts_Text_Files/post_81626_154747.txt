India had an inauspicious start in their first ever game at the U world cup as the USA handed them an defeat on opening day The home crowd at Kalinga stadium in Bhuvaneshwar witnessed a fighting performance by a team that was no match for the North American outfit that had scored fifty eight times and conceded only once in seven games of their qualifying campaign The ignominy started in the ninth minute with a goal from Melina Remimbas Charlotte Kohler doubled the advantage from a corner The third was a strike from Onyeka Gamero who capitalised on a defensive mistake while playing out from the back An extraordinary second from Rebimbas was followed by a fifth from Gisele Thompson Despite Coach Dennerby s promise that India would be difficult to score against the hosts found themselves playing for pride by the end of the first half Both teams made three substitutions at the break Among the American introductions was Mia Bhuta the first player of Indian origin to play for the USA in a world cup She donned the captain s armband in the second half Ella Emri added a sixth for the USA A penalty awarded near the hour mark was converted by Taylor Suarez Three minutes later Bhuta scored a stunning goal from outside the box The eighth goal meant that this would be India s worst defeat at this level The final half hour saw some more chances for the USA but keeper Anjali Munda was equal to them India did not pose much of an attacking threat in either half They could muster only one shot in each half and neither worked Victoria Safradin in goal While there was little by way of positives for India to take from the game the value of an experience like this on the world stage cannot be understated USA s aspiration of adding a U triumph to their numerous senior laurels is off to a great start India will hope to recover from this defeat in their game against fellow debutants Morocco The USA will face Brazil who as contenders themselves promise to give a much sterner test than India
