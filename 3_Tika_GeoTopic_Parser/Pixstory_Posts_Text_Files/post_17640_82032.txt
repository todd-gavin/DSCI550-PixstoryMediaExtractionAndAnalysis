Kylian Mbappe stole the limelight after leading PSG to a win over Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes The hype leading up to the match between two of Europe s elite clubs was immense Pochettino had set out his side to demolish Madrid whereas Ancelloti known for his organizational abilities set out his team to limit PSG s attack and hit them on the break It was a chess game between the two managers with the duo constantly canceling each other s move But it was the Argentine that landed the final knockout blow PSG came out of the blocks firing on all cylinders but Madrid held their ground and neutralized many of PSG s attacks Mbappe who has been constantly linked with a move away to the Bernabeu showed his suitors a glimpse of his world class abilities The Parisians were without their talisman Neymar Whereas Ancelloti had to rush Benzema back into action sooner than his liking Since the Frenchman s injury the goals seemed to have dried up for the Galacticos Hence Ancelloti had no option but to start Benzema In the first half Madrid was pegged back into their half and the first crucial chance of the match fell to Mbappe After he was put through on goal by Messi with a delightful lob pass but was denied by Courtois That was the highlight reel of the first half as PSG could not weave a way around Madrid s astute defense In the second half Mbappe who had been a constant menace in the left hand side drew Carvajal into a challenge and won a penalty for the Parisians All eyes were on Messi as he stepped up to take the crucial penalty But it was agony for Messi and the Parisians as the Argentine s penalty was saved by a defiant Courtois It seemed like the match was heading for a draw when Mbappe with his silky footwork cut through Madrid s defense like a hot knife through butter and slid the ball under Courtois s legs to give Paris the lead PSG head into the second leg with a slender advantage Whereas Madrid will be without Casemiro and Mendy because of suspension
