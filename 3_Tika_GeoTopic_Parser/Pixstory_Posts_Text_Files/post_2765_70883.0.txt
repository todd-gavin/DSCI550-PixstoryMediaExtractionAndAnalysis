While the state authorities are yet to identify the suspected hostage-taker, saying that they are looking at possible global angle, what is out in the media is that suspect's actions were related to the U.S. imprisonment of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman who has been in an American prison for a decade after being held guilty for trying to kill U.S. soldiers. The suspect claimed that he was Siddiqui's brother, although Siddiqui's lawyers have denied this.

But who is Siddiqui who is serving an 86-year sentence?

Also known as "Lady Al-Qaeda," American law enforcement authorities identified as a member of the terror group. She is considered close one of the most important 9/11 suspects, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In fact, Siddiqui became the first female terrorism defendant after 9/11.

Siddiqui graduated from top U.S. universities with a degree in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a PhD in neuroscience from Brandeis. 

Allegedly Siddiqui was arrested in 2008 in Afghanistan for "carrying sodium cyanide, as well as documents describing how to make chemical weapons and dirty bombs and how to weaponize Ebola," writes foreignpolicy.com  The FBI once named Siddiqui as a woman who has the "knowledge, skills, and intention to continue Al Qaeda's terror war in the United States and abroad."

Protests have been held in the Islamic world for many years now supporting Siddiqui.
