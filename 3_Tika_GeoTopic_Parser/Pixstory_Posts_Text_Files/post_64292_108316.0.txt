• your dad might be wounded, not necessarily 'bad'

• although not every dad did his 'best', most were unaware of how their behavior was impacting you

• you can dislike parts while liking healthy parts of him

• don't expect more than he's shown you he can offer

• When immature, he'll be unable to look at his part

• When triggered by him you might act unreasonable too
