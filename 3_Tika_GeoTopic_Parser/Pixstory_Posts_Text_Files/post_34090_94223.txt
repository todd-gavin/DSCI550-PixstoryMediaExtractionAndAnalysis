Heavy defeat at home for Sampdoria against Salernitana At the end of the score rewards infatit for the Campania players This is the comment of the Blucerchiato coach in the post match. his responsibilities And we have to do it together as a team To leave and after six minutes it becomes very difficult for the others We had a dull stomach reaction I have my doubts about a foul on Quagliarella by Fazio which could have been a penalty but beyond we need to become aware of this from this type of defeat Take the boos the criticisms and the shovelfuls of poop that will come at us but we have to do it as a team with a sense of responsibility It is true that we lost but we are not dead I went into the locker room and the team was very disappointed Heads down and no restart through punitive messages Punitive messages are given when you have a team that has no sense of responsibility You will find compactness on Monday in training by doing an in-depth analysis of our responsibilities without unloading the barrel on any player All heroes and all guilty
