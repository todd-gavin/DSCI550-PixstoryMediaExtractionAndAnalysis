With new variants of the SARS COV virus triggering fresh waves of the highly infectious disease scientists at the Kazi Nazrul University Asansol and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhubaneshwar have designed a peptide vaccine which they claim could protect against any future variants of the coronavirus Their research has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Molecular Liquids that is devoted to fundamental aspects of structure interactions and dynamic processes in simple molecular and complex liquids In this study we employed immunoinformatic approaches to design AbhiSCoVac a multi epitope multi target chimeric peptide that would be able to generate protective immunity against all six virulent members of the family hCoV E hCoV HKU hCoV OC SARS CoV MERS CoV as well as SARS CoV the researchers said The designed vaccine was found to be highly stable antigenic and immunogenic the researchers Abhigyan Choudhury and Suprabhat Mukherjee from Kazi Nazrul University and Parth Sarthi Sen Gupta Saroj Kumar Panda and Malay Kumar Rana from IISER Bhubaneshwar said Choudhary said the team of researchers developed the vaccine using computational methods and the next stage would involve the production of the vaccine which would be followed by testing This vaccine is one of a kind No other vaccine in the world has been designed to cope with all the Coronaviridae family viruses at a single time he told PTI He said the researchers had first identified various conserved regions in the spike protein of the six different viruses that undergo very few mutations and thus change a little in the course of pandemic Also these regions of the protein identified are highly immunogenic which means they can produce high levels of immune memory in the body that is required to protect against the viruses he said Unlike other vaccines these identified were selected after they have shown high binding strengths with a protein called TLR the same protein responsible for detecting SARS COV viruses in the body and initiating the immune responses Choudhary said Source Dr Reddy s submits proposal to DCGI to test Sputnik Light as Covid booster dose
