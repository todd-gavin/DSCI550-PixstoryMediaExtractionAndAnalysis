Background Aims During the global coronavirus disease COVID pandemic patients with pre existing chronic liver disease may represent a vulnerable population We studied the etiology based temporal trends in mortality of chronic liver disease and the underlying cause of death in the United States before and during the COVID pandemic Methods Population based analyses were performed on US national mortality records Temporal trends in quarterly age standardized mortality were obtained by joinpoint analysis with estimates of quarterly percentage change QPC Results Quarterly age standardized all cause mortality due to alcohol related liver disease ALD initially increased at a quarterly rate of before the COVID pandemic followed by a sharp increase during the COVID pandemic at a quarterly rate of Likewise steady increase in mortality of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD before the COVID pandemic QPC accelerated during the COVID pandemic QPC While ALD related mortality increased steeply compared to viral hepatitis related mortality during the COVID pandemic the proportion of mortality due to COVID among individuals with ALD was the lowest at more than lower than viral hepatitis The significant decline in all cause mortality due to viral hepatitis before the COVID pandemic plateaued during the COVID pandemic due to increase in COVID related mortality in individuals with viral hepatitis Mortality due to cirrhosis increased markedly during the COVID pandemic mainly attributable to ALD Conclusion All cause mortality for ALD and NAFLD rapidly accelerated during the COVID pandemic compared to the pre COVID era There has been a significant decline in viral hepatitis however a significant increase in COVID related death in this population Keywords alcohol related liver diseasehepatitis C virus infectionhepatitis B infectionnonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseNational Vital Statistic System Abbreviations ALDalcoholic liver diseaseCIconfidence intervalCOVID coronavirus disease DAAdirect acting antiviralHBVhepatitis B virusHCVhepatitis C virusICD International Classification of Diseases Tenth RevisionNVSSnational vital statistic systemQPCquarterly percentage change
