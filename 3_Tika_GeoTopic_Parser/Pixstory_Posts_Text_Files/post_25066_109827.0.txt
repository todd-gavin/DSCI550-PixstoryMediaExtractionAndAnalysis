According to journalist Tom Bogert, Los Angeles are close to finalizing a deal with Welsh star, Gareth Bale. The Welshman became a free agent this summer after his contract at Real Madrid came to an end. 

Gareth Bale is perhaps one of the most decorated players in European football, winning 5 UCL titles during his reign at Real Madrid. The left-footed player joined the Spanish giants in 2013, after a successful stint with Spurs. A source mentions that Gareth Bale will not require a Designated player spot. The deal will be valid for 12 months, which will run out in June 2023.

The 32-year-old scored 106 goals and delivered 67 assists at Real Madrid. Los Angeles FC have been making some progress in the transfer window, as they have also signed Italian defender, Giorgio Chiellini. The club have had a successful start to their campaign, as they are placed at the top of the MLS western conference after 15 games.

LAFC have accumulated 30 points from their 15 games, with nine wins to their name. The signing of Gareth Bale would certainly add strength to the Los Angeles squad, going further into the season.

The likes of Gareth Bale and Giorgio Chiellini are eligible to join the squad once the secondary transfer window starts from July 7. Hence, the duo could be eligible to make their debuts against LA Galaxy on 8th July.
