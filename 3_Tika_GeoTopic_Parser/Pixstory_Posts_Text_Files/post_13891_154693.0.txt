In the midst of festivities, in the broad daylight of October 4, a crowd of locals in the Kheda district of Gujarat, gathered to watch a group of Muslim men being tied to a pole and flogged with canes by police personnel. The men were accused of throwing stones on a Garba event. They were seen begging for mercy as plain-clothes cops continued to thrash them in full public view while the frenzied crowd chanted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. 
The very next day, on the other end of India, three Muslim men risked their lives to save around 30 people from drowning in flash floods during the Durga idol immersion ceremony in West Bengal. 
One of them namely  Mohammad Manik told The Wire,“I don’t see Hindus and Muslims. I only see humans. In Islam, they say that saving the lives of others is a deed of SAWAB. I did that only. I took Allah’s name and dived in. I had to save people. Both Hindus and Muslims have the same blood in their veins.”
