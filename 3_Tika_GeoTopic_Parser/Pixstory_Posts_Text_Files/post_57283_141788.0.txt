The first thing to do is stop exfoliating until your skin has healed and is at its baseline texture.
“Baseline texture” will differ from person to person; generally, it just means the texture your skin had before overexposure. That will be your baseline texture if you've always been acne-prone. You’re really just waiting for the signs of over-exfoliation — redness, inflammation, peeling — to fade.
-Stop all foaming cleansers, retinol products, and physical or chemical exfoliators.
-Switch to a mild cleanser and a fragrance-free moisturizer.
-Spot treat extremely red or raw areas with a rich emollient, like Aquaphor or Aqua Veil. 
-You can also use hydrocortisone cream or aloe gel.
