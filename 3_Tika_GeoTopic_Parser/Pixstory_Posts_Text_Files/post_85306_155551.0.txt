Troyes vs Ajaccio Probable Winners
Troyes has played decent football this season but their defense has been vulnerable more often than not in Ligue 1 and that has been their reason for suffering. However, they will be playing against Ajaccio at home and have a better form than their rivals and hence, we expect Troyes to win this game.
