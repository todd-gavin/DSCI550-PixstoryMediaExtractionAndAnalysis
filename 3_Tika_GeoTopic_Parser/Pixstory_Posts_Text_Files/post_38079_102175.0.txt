Barcelona have been linked with Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski for some time now. The Spanish giants have reportedly made their first bid for the striker but Bayern don't seem interested.

Robert Lewandowski has refused to extend his contract with Bayern Munich. The striker was visibly very emotional in his team's last Bundesliga game. The Polish international was seen saying goodbye to the Bayern fans, hence reportedly signalling his departure from the club. But his team reportedly wants to keep a hold of him and don't want to let him go. 

Barcelona on the other hand have now officially bid on Robert Lewandowski after rumours had earlier suggested they already have completed personal talks with the player. 

The Blaugrana have reportedly made a BID OF €30M PLUS A €5M BONUS for Robert Lewandowski. But Bayern Munich are uninterested in this bid as they value the 33 year old at €40 million at least. 

Lewandowski is easily one of the best strikers in the football world already. Hence Bayern Munich are looking to keep him for another season. The Polish international's contract expires in 2023. So the club is in their right to keep hold of the player. 

Hence it has to be seen if Barcelona make a follow-up bid with a better offer in order to complete the signing of Robert Lewandowski in the coming days.
