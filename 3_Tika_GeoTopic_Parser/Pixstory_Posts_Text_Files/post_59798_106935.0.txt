Do you want to know what it's like to be a member of the BTS army in India? Here's what it's like to wait for BTS to come to your nation for a concert when they can go all the way to the United States but not bother to show up in your own country, which is right in Asia. Searching the internet for wonderful BTS merchandise but either not understanding the price in a different currency or sobbing when you realise that most websites will not deliver it to you. People think India doesn't have enough armies, but guess what? They should visit my school or neighbourhood and make their own decisions. Seriously, it's no joke that BTS is idolised by three out of every five Indian teenagers. And then there's the odd uncle who asks if they're males or girls and then goes on a rant about the make-up they use. I know it's a problem all around the world, but it's on a whole new level in India. Being an ARMY in India entails writing letters to popular newspapers requesting that their posters be published, standing in long lines to buy tickets for the new BTS film, having to silence that idiotic guy in your school who calls BTS girls by telling them how stupid they look in comparison to our boys' angelic beauty, and, last but not least, having to shut up that idiotic guy in your school who calls BTS girls by telling them how stupid they look in comparison to our boys' angelic beauty and lastly having lots of fun.
