The agreement for the renewal of the contract between Juventus and Juan Cuadrado seemed to have already been done Instead it seems that the negotiations have stalled and the climate between the parties has become rather cold, in fact, there is no agreement Juventus would like to extend the Colombian midfielder&#39;s contract by spreading the signing of millions of euros over two years The player at this point would prefer to keep the agreement as now This is where Marotta&#39;s idea was born, always attentive to low-cost or directly zero-cost offers Cuadrado&#39;s would be an inexpensive operation for the card a little less for the salary to be given to the player given that Juventus&#39; proposal has to be overcome Given the departure of Perisic Cuadrado could become an important pawn for Inzaghi even if his years do not allow him to make long-term plans And the risk of a new Vidal or Sanchez case, i.e. players with top player salaries but not very useful to the concrete Nerazzurri cause At the moment, therefore, it is a suggestive idea that could come true but not in the short term
