Judging by the name, I thought The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde was a horror story. But it pleasantly surprised me. The story turned out to be completely different. 
It starts when an American family moves into the Canterville castle which is haunted by the ghost of itâ€™s ancestor. There is humour, moments which made me laugh out loud. The characters are really lovable 
and unique. Oscar Wilde does a brilliant job with the characters even the ghost, making them feel real.
The ending is so heart touching. Most importantly, this book will make you feel happy. It is a nice and light read, you can pick up when you need a mood lifter. It is perfect for reading in spooky October.
