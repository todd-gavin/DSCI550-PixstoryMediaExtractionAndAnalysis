Jose Daniel Ortega Saavedra, has been Nicaragua’s President since 2007. A leader of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a socialist party, joined the revolution against the then dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle as a student. As a firebrand Sandinista he was arrested, tortured and jailed along with other student leaders in the 1970s.

Later, the exiled Sandinistas got trained in guerrilla warfare by Fidel Castro’s government and eventually overthrew and exiled Somoza, following the legendary Nicaraguan Revolution. In the democratic election that followed Ortega became the president, subsequently defeated and made a comeback in 2007.

In his second avatar, Ortega gradually turned anti-democratic, alienated most of his comrades of the revolution and resembled Somoza, the very autocrat they overthrew. He started to violently oppress anyone who protested against his government and curbed civil liberties to such an extent that thousands of Nicaraguans started migrating to neighbouring Costa Rica. Last year he imprisoned most of his political opponents.

Ortega’s latest target is politically active student groups, one of the last bastions of opposition to the authoritarian government. Recently he brought five universities in the country under government control. His ruse: they had defied financial regulations and hence incapable of governing themselves. He had already gained control of students and academic unions in public universities. Now his opponents fear that 30 private universities will lose autonomy and there will be clamp down on students and professors who criticise him and his regime.

Among the institutions captured this month is the Polytechnic University, which had been the vortex of protests in 2018. A 50-day long protest movement was violently crushed by Ortega’s pet vigilantes and the police. 

The latest tactics of oppression by Ortega will surely lead to a surge in exodus of students and youth out of Nicaragua. Ironically, the man who drove out a dictator in his youth is now turning into a worse and more ruthless one.
