Black Arts Movement refers to many African American writers whose work was moulded by the political and social turbulence of the 1960s. BAM created new cultural institutions and conveyed a message of black pride. The movement withstood traditional Western influence and found new and their own ways to present the black experience.

The Black Arts Movement, although short, is crucial to the history of the United States. It sparked political activism and the use of speech throughout every African-American community. It allowed African Americans the chance to convey their voices in the mass media as well as become involved in communities. The movement has been seen as one of the most important times in African-American literature. It inspired black people to establish their own publishing houses, magazines, journals and art institutions. It led to the creation of African-American Studies programs within universities.

Among the well-known writers who were involved with the movement are Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, Maya Angelou, Hoyt W. Fuller, and Rosa Guy.
