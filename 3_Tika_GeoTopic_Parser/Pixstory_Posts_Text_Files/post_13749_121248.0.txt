Women's football in England began around WWI. When men fought for the country in the war, women took to working in factories and formed their own club teams. There was a time in 1920 when 53,000 spectators watched a women's football game at Everton- much more than a vast majority of men's matches.

Then came the retort from a male dominated English Football Association. As soon as WWI ended, the women went away from the factories and the FA forbade them from using fields to play football. Other countries followed and women faced societal ridicule, if they tried playing the game.

The ban lasted till the early 1970s. Around that time, FIFA posed a question to national football authorities across Europe about whether their countries recognise women's football. Only 12 out of 90 associations gave a positive response, indicative of how women's football was never allowed to spurt.

That is in complete contrast to what transpired on Sunday at Wembley, in front of a capacity crowd. The world watched it, as Chloe Kelly's late goal sealed England's win in the Euros. It was a reminder of how far women's football has come in society and it was a message to the naysayers that they can capture the same light as men's football. 

After all, it was England's first piece of silverware since the 1966 World Cup.
