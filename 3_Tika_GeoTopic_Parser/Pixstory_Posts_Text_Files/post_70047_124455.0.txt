The Supreme Court on Wednesday has directed the court-appointed Committee of Administrator (CoA) and Centre to hold talks and engage with FIFA to ensure the U-17 Women's World Football Cup is held in the India later this year.

A bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud agreed to consider the case for hearing on Thursday, after it was informed that FIFA threatened to withdraw the hosting rights.

One can recall that on August 5, FIFA-AFC had warned that if it finds the AIFF governance is not under democratic administration on or before September 15, there is a likelihood of stringent action being taken against AIFF, which could also result in the withdrawal of hosting rights of the Women's U-17 World Cup which was scheduled to be held in India.
