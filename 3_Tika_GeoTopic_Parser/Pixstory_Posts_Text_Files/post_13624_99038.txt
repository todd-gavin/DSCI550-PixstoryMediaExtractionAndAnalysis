If a man has nothing to do and lives in a quarantine house it is not his duty to serve others because society expects these duties from women and mothers and this expectation will continue until we learn Mother s Day instead of poems and Texts that are mostly about the suffering of raising children How many boys do not remember their mother after marriage as if there was no mother and they came out of the egg by chance And as mentioned before some people leave a message in the same way as Facebook posts and this is where it all ends and there is no change in the mother s life More than anything the mother needs the child s attention Neither a gold ring nor a dress nor a flower can replace the presence and attention of his child Celebrate Mother s Day by bringing change in the lives of mothers they do not need to do and continue to suffer and sacrifice A mother must be able to live for herself and seek comfort for herself At least in the cherished texts we should refrain from writing sentences that summarize the mother to a suffering and colonized woman Yes life is hard and painful but the burden of all this hardship should not be on the mother and such an expectation should not be reflected Know that a branch of a flower will not compensate the mother s efforts I am not going to write a prescription on how to compensate for these troubles so that everyone can do something that will make the mother s heart happy and her living conditions better
