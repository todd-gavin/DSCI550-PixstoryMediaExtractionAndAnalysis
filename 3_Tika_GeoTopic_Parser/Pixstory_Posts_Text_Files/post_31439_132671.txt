A research carried out in collaboration between the Isa Institute of Food Sciences of the National Research Council of Avellino and the A Zambelli Department of Chemistry and Biology of the University of Salerno was born from food for thought that emerged following meetings with the Joint Research Center of the Commission Europea has deepened the study of the spike protein of the Omicron variant of SARS CoV with the aim of investigating two aspects, on the one hand, understanding how it interacts with the ACE receptor, i.e. the entry route into our cells, on the other, verifying whether the antibodies developed by the human organism against the spike protein of the previous variants they somehow manage to recognize it The study published in Molecules required the creation of an automated bioinformatics procedure with which it was possible to simulate the variations of the amino acids of the spike protein present in the Omicron variant, therefore obtaining models of the interaction of the new spike protein with the antibodies on the basis of more than molecular models of antibody spike complexes already known for the previous variants of the virus and analyze the characteristics of the interaction highlighting how the new spike protein can be recognized or not by the antibodies developed against the old variants The work carried out has shown that many antibodies already present in our body can also recognize the spike protein of the Omicron variant although with some differences in the molecular interactions that can be formed explains Angelo Facchiano Cnr Isa responsible for the study together with Anna Marabotti for the University of Salerno In addition also studying the mechanism of interaction with the ACE receptor we have highlighted some differences compared to the spike protein of the previous variants offering a possible interpretation of the greater ease of transmission of the Omicron variant This research could have important implications also in view of the appearance of new variants the bioinformatics procedure in fact, this development could be used to simulate the substitutions of amino acids present in new variants and quickly give a forecast of the effects in terms of the capacity of the immune defenses offered by the antibodies already present in our bodies developed as a result of vaccinations or previous infections to counter any new variant
