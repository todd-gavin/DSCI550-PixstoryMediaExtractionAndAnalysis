R Ashwin, the number two ranked Test bowler and number two ranked all-rounder in the longest format of the game, was not selected in India's playing XI for the rescheduled fifth Test against England, which meant that the ace spinner did not play a single match on the tour.

Chasing 378 for victory, England got off to a flying start before the loss of three quick wickets forced them onto the back foot. Root, batting on 76, combined with Bairstow in a 150-run stand for the unbroken fourth wicket to put England's chase back on track. India wasted two reviews trying to get Root lbw and Bairstow got a life early in his innings when Hanuma Vihari spilled an edge in the slips.

Even cricket fans slammed the team management for benching Ravichandran Ashwin in the rescheduled fifth Test against England at Edgbaston. Ashwin was missed by the fans after Indian bowlers struggled for a wicket as Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow smashed unbeaten fifties to boost England's hopes of pulling off a record chase in the rearranged fifth Test against India at Edgbaston on Monday.
