The Foxes manager has informed over a press conference that the 25-year-old Nigerian Star will not take any more part at the King Power Stadium due to his injury setback. 

The Nigerian International has suffered a knee injury during his club’s clash against 
Rennes in a European Conference League and was subsequently subbed. 

Unfortunately, the English side suffered a 2-1 loss. The knock saw the 25-year-old 
being ruled out of the just concluded 2022 Fifa World Cup playoffs- where Nigeria failed against Ghana. 

Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Old Trafford for their clash against the Red Devils, Leicester 
Manager Brendan Rodgers disclosed that former Genk star will play no part in the 
remaining campaign. 

“Wilfred Ndidi, unfortunately, will be out for the next season, it’s a shame for us, but he will be ready for the next season,” Rodgers told media as per the Leicester City's website. 

In his absence, Rodgers is looking up to the Senegal International Papy Mendy- who 
had been shut off Leicester City’s starting XI due to Ndidi’s blistering form. 

“He’s done great for his country, he’s come back, but he’s always been a great 
professional. So, we gain a player in him and he’s done very well since he is back in the squad.” 

“The other players are starting to come back which is great. We have Jonny Evans in great form, whether he plays the whole game or not, or starts or comes off the bench, we’ll see.”

As things stand out, Leicester is at 10th position in the league table with 36 points in their bag having played 27 games. 

Victory over the Red Devils will see them move up the log in their quest to secure a 
place in Europe next season.
