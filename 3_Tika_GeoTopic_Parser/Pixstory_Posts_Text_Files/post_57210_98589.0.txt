On Thursday, Amber Heard, an American actress, made a statement supporting her allegations in her defence.
Heard was married to actor Johnny Depp, an American actor, from 2015 to 2017. Their divorce was the talk of the town and sought high media attention as Heard alleged Depp of being abusive throughout their relationship.
In 2018, Depp sued the publishers of British tabloid The Sun for libel, accusing Heard of abusing him instead and creating a hoax. In 2020, Depp lost the case as the judge found that Heardâ€™s allegations were proven to a civil standard. In early 2019, Depp sued Heard for defamation over an op-ed she had written on domestic abuse in The Washington Post. In 2020, Heard filed a countersuit against Depp. The trial Depp v. Heard began in Virginia in April 2022.

On her second day on the stand, she spoke about physical abuse by the actor Johnny Depp, "Nothing I did made him stop hitting me. Nothing. I tried for over a year, maybe two, or just not responding physically, not responding verbally, staring at him, trying to freeze, and trying to go to a different place. I would try then lashing out verbally. I would try to threaten that if he hit me again that I would call the police." 

He denied this by saying he never struck a woman and accused Heard of verbal and physical abuse.
None of them has accepted each other's claim of abuse.
