Why should USA take responsibility for what China, India and Russia do? They are the major contributors of pollution in the world. Why is my country expected to pay for it? We are protecting our nation from these things and that's how it should be. The entire world is not our responsibility. There is no need to pay for climate change. People need to stop attempting to change the environment and start getting ready for when it changes.
Our world experiences climate change as a natural process. There have been millions of years of it. We cannot stop a tornado, a storm, or a volcano from erupting. We might be able to anticipate it or even explain why it will happen, but we cannot control it or stop it. Because of this, everything that is being done for them is a complete waste of money and a swindle by any activist who can discover a reliable source of funding.
History is replete with examples of unprepared communities that failed when the climate unexpectedly altered. These countries need to do the saving for themselves, much to your displeasure.
