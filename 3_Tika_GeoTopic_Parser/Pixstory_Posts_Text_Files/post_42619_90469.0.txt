Today, when I was watching The Oscar ceremony and appreciating the art of all the winners then suddenly one incident changed the whole scenario of the ceremony and pull all the limelight of all the fans and media from all around the world. 

When Chris Rock came on the stage, he made a joke about Will Smith’s wife, initially, Will Smith also laughed at the joke but when he saw her wife’s face, he realized that his wife didn’t like the joke at all. 

Then he stood up, walk towards the stage and gave a slap of the decade to Chris Rock, and went back to his seat. Chris Rock smiled and continued the ceremony without raising any voice against Will Smith but Will Smith didn’t stop and abuse Chris Rock. 

After the incident, I thought that this incident was scripted like the Bollywood award ceremony but after reading some trusty worthy reports, I got to know that the rage was real. 

After the Oscars ceremony, nobody is talking about the winners, nobody is talking about the art, nobody is raising questions that who deserves the Oscar but didn’t win it, everybody is talking about that one slap. 

Through, Will Smith won the Oscars for the Best Actor in a Leading Role for the movie “King Richard” but this type of behavior is unacceptable. 

Chris Rock’s joke was wrong but Will Smith’s action was worse and this incident became the highlight of today’s ceremony.

I hope “The Academy” will take action against both the actors and have to make some strict rules that in future nobody will ever try to do such things.
