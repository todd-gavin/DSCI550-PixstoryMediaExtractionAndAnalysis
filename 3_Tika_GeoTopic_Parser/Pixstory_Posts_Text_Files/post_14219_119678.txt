MASSIMILIANO ALLEGRI That was a good work out I m pleased with the work we are doing and how the preparation is proceeding We could have paid more attention to avoid losing the goals but that s okay On the other hand Kean did very well and Zakaria who is coming on well as is Rovella who played the full minutes MOISE KEAN It was not easy tonight It was very hot and we paid a little bit for the intense work over these last few days I m feeling good and I try to give my best wherever the coach asks me to play as a winger or a striker Di Maria He s something else He ll give us a lot this year DENIS ZAKARIA A good match a good result useful for continuing this phase of the season We can improve but the preparation is progressing well I m happy with my game and playing this way I can also find the right feeling with my teammates with the whole team especially in midfield TOMMASO BARBIERI We were up against an excellent team so we are satisfied Just to be here is living the dream then I think of the action in Las Vegas that led to Compagnon s goal I think about being on the pitch tonight with Bar a at home everyone s so happy for me I have received so many messages it s amazing What have I improved On maintaining concentration for the full minutes NICOLO CUDRIG This was a match at a very high technical level against a good team that plays at great pace We did well to respond to the goals conceded and in not conceding a third This is the best summer of my life being here is a unique emotion You have to give everything on the pitch for this shirt When I came on and saw the players on the pitch I thought I was playing the Playstation it s something difficult to explain The year with the Under allowed me to grow immensely
