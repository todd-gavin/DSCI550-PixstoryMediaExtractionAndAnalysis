Shortly before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Beijing on Friday, Vladimir Putin met Xi Jinping, had lunch and enjoyed the big show together. All these happened at a crucial time when Russia’s relation with the West, especially the US, is deteriorating fast over the Ukraine issue. 

Xi addressed Putin as a “dear old friend” and Putin hailed his country’s “unprecedented” ties with China and held this as a model for international relations. In a joint statement, the two leaders expressed each other’s renewed support for each other’s foreign policy and signed a number of deals including a plan to increase export of Russian natural gas to China and a future project on nuclear power plants. 

More significantly, the two leaders jointly criticised “negative US influence” in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, and the bid to expand NATO, what they termed a “Cold War era” stance. 

China’s promise of political and economic support for Putin is clearly directed towards US President Biden’s strategy to isolate Russia to counter his military build-up on Ukraine’s border. Last week, it publicly supported Russia’s “security concerns” regarding NATO and later said in a statement that its foreign minister will coordinate with his Russian counterpart on issues of Afghanistan and Korean peninsula as well.

In a similar situation in 2014 when Russia imposed sanctions on Russia after the annexation of Crimea, Putin found support in China as an economic partner. China had signed a gas deal with Russia at a price favourable to the earlier. 

Now, as the two countries come closer, the move signifies a new world order reviving the long dead cold war of three decades ago. Russia attacks Ukraine, or not it’s clear that the world is gravitating towards two distinct blocs.
