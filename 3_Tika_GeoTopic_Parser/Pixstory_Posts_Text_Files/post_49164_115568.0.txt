The purpose of homework is quite significant. Children are taught that learning never ends and that home study is necessary. It proves to be very helpful later on in life.

For your brain to recognise that the new information is something you actually need and to memorize it, rather than ignoring it and forgetting it. You need to review what you learned 5-7 hours after you were first exposed to it. As one practices more, it is then stored in long term memory.

Homeworks do just that. It teaches kids to be self driven. It makes them realize the importance of self work and that you can't just be dependent on someone else to keep repeating what you have to do. You get guidance once, twice but in the end, you're gonna have to be self sufficient.

Banning homework would lead to that fire to work be extinguished in children. They won't be creative anymore, they won't strive to be self sufficient. The last thing our world needs is lazy people who are not driven. We need to keep balance in our society and for that we need to prepare people young.
