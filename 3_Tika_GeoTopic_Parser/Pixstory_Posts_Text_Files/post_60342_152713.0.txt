By climbing five peaks over 6,000 metres in 23hr 55 minutes, Harshad Rao and Saurabh Sharma of Pune and New Delhi set a world record.
Expedition of climbing to 20,000ft+ mountains in Sep 2022 was exploring the Rulang Nala Massif. From the total of 6 peaks in this the speed climbing duo climbed 5peaks.The formation among the 5 peaks can be called as Rulang Necklace after its group of peaks in line.
Out of these 2 peaks are supposedly virgin and have been climbed for the first time as seen from the IMF(Indian Mountaineering Foundation) website. Naming ceremony of the peaks shall happen later on after the formalities of the peak shall be completed with the IMF.
These peaks have a difficulty grading of being little technical, requiring good skills of mountaineering given the mixed climbing requirement of snow ice,rockcraft with some steep exposed gradients.
The other 5 peaks climbed on the opposite side are from the Chomchanker group and Thugje peaks in Rupshu glacier.
These peaks have a difficulty fairly good for regular trekkers as well to go unsupported with some introduction to mountaineering skills.
All these peaks lie between the famous Tsokar and Tsomoriri lake in Ladakh,India.
Interesting part of the expedition also being biking from Delhi right to base of peak and climbing it alpine style which is without Sherpa, High Altitude Guides or Porters or any other support crew in assistance.This type of climbing requires enhanced navigation and survival skills and is on basis of strong camaraderie with refined interpersonal communication between the climbers.
The duo had explored the same valley since 2020,2021 & in the third year of exploration had made it a grand success and overwhelmed to be coming back to share the story with all the fingertips and toes intact.
