Veteran actress Sri Devi' daughter Khushi Kapoor spotted in santacruz on Thursday. She did not fail to add a dash of style, keeping her look simple yet comfy as she stepped out of the premises.
Khushi Kapoor opted for a funky lilac sweatshirt which was matched with gym shorts. Comfy slippers and a white face mask finished the young star-kidâ€™s attire.
