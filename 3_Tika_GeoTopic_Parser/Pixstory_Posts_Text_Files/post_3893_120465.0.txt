Friendship is a book that we write in our life. Each relation we make starts from a friendship and the chapter of it is written by both of us. 

A bunch of friends  comes with us at every point of life that laughs, consoles, advises in our life. They may even create an aura of a parent, sibling or someone we could relate with so much. 

Each friend we have joins us in this journey of life during the turning points we take. We may have school friends, college friends, office friends, friends we make with other friends. 

Each friendship is unique and it take us on a journey. Journey to new places, new people we meet through them creates so much of memories and love we attach to these snippets. 

Friendships are theist beautiful form of relationship from which we can get almost all kinds of relational love and comfort. 

I would like to thank all my friends who have been a great part in making me realise their impact in my life. If we currently talk or not thank you for being with me and I'm grateful that I got such a beautiful relation with you. 

Happy Friendship Day to all of you ❤️
