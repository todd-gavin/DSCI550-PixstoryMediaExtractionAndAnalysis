There’s a good chance you see people staring into their screens everywhere you go.

While the convenience is nice, there’s many who feel we’ve become too absorbed in our smartphones and their endless streams of notifications, social media, and emails.

Mounting evidence shows that “mobile addiction” is a very real thing. There’s even a term for fear of not being able to use your mobile phone: Nomophobia . 

And even if you’re not addicted, there’s the distraction elements to contend with as well.

But let’s face it, just binning your phone completely and going back to a landline isn’t exactly attractive.

Surely there’s a compromise to be found?

For many, going back to basic mobile phones is an attractive balance of easy access to communication tools without the addictive tendencies of modern smartphones.

People are now considering if always being connected to everything is all it’s cracked up to be. Work is always a notification away, social streams never end, or you plan to play a quick game just to look up 2 hours later and realize your evening is gone.

We’re doing more living through our phones and less getting out and living in the world around us.

The easy fix is just to not mess with any of this stuff.

But, let’s face it, we’re human.

If the fix were that simple, the hold that technology has on most of the public wouldn’t be as strong as it is.

So an easier fix is just to get a basic phone or a dumb phone, as it is more popularly known.

While we love our phones, we can certainly see the value in disconnecting or simplifying things in an age of information overload. 

Mobile technology is awesome in moderation. There’s no denying that. It provides access to information and communications options that would have seemed like sci-fi ramblings even a few decades ago.

But moderation is important too.
