Assam Chief Minister Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma felicitated Commonwealth Games (CWG), 2022 Gold medalist Nayanmoni Saikia at the Janata Bhavan here on Thursday.

After bringing laurels to the country by clinching gold medal in Lawn Bowls in the recently ended 22nd Commonwealth Games, she reached Guwahati yesterday.

She was welcomed at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport (LGBI) by the officials of the Assam Forest Department where Saikia is currently employed as a constable.

Nayanmoni was born into a middle-class family in Golaghat. She was always passionate about sports and she started her career in sports through weightlifting. However, due to leg injury and deteriorating performance she chose Lawn Bowls because this sport was a game without injuries.

Assam Lawn Bowls Association has also welcome and felicitated Nayanmoni Saikia after her return to Guwahati.
