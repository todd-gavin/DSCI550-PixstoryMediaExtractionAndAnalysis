Fabio Viera is stealing the show tonight as his lovely assist put the Gunners 2-0 up. Half space crossing is king in the modern game and his lovely cross from just outside of the corner of the box was the highlight of the Half.
Arsenal have played well without being overwhelming, there's a lot of space wide as FK Bod√∏/Glimt are shifting their block ball side too much but Arsenal have been unable to take advantage of this yet.
Eddie Nketiah put the ball in the back of the net in clinical fashion snatching up a chance to put the ball in the back of the net. Very clinical. He's also been a standout being strong in his duels and great in possession
Let's see how the 2nd half goes.
