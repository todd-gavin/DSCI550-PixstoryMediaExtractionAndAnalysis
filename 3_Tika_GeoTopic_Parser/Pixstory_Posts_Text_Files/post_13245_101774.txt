The other day I was talking with a German friend about fruits I was bragging about our friuts being so tasty and delicious Actually I was a little bit right that is due the unique climate and soils that our country has Being mountainous irrigation is challenging there though due to that we have never been self sufficient in terms of food production and also there has never been a stable modern state to modernize and develop the sector Now under the Holy Taliban that is what a hungry and war torn nation can produce besides opium millions face hunger Imagine being a school child and your main concern is a loaf of bread Who cares you may say however this countery in its modern borders is a production of western colonialism Russian and British colonialists in nineteenth century so it is not a historically developed integrated groups of people in lands that can be self sustained economically More plain portions were sliced and taken by British and Russian Empires which are now parts of Pakistan and middle Asian countries The consequence of their dividing party is now our fate that instead of useful stuff we produce Taliban albeit with the help of our western allies and our sweet southern neighbor
