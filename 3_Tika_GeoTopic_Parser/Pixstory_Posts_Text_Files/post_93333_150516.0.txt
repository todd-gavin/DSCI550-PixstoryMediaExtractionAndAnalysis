Bisexuals are being prevented from living as their full selves in most American workplaces
With increase in access to language and affirming spaces, 57 percent of people are out about being bisexual in America as per Gallup 2021 data. 
Despite this, most bisexual people — and around 60 percent of bisexual men — are often prevented from accessing workspaces as their full selves, and are forced to conform to traditional norms of femininity and masculinity to survive. 
We need to put in a concerted effort to make workplaces accessible, to remove this norm of an invisibilization cloak.
