Q Do you think Kerala as a society has come a long way from the nineties and the early two thousand in queer activism Ans Yes there s a lot more public activism a lot more public discourse on queer life and the effort is certainly there to understand queer life There s also the effort to be at least politically correct For example in my own college in the NSS unit which is very official and not a rebel activity and something from the blessings from the country and the state so the NSS unit has a pride solidarity march in which I had the honour to take part So things have changed in the sense that you can talk about such things publicly Q When did you really come to know that you are bisexual in your orientation At what age did you come to know about it and were you apprehensive that society will accept your sexuality as it is Ans During high school I got to know about my orientation I realized what I was and I did talk about it I was not completely open but neither was I completely closed but I advocated rights for homosexuals as they were then called gays quite openly I even wrote an article about it which was published in a World Magazine The editor was initially hesitant to put it up but then I took it to the principal and the principal was liberal enough to clear the issue and it was published Parasuraman is Kerala s first openly bisexual academician An assistant professor of English at the University College in Thiruvananthapuram Parasuraman talks about what it means to be openly bisexual academician and father of two in a conservative society like Kerala The interview is a part of The Outing a podcast series brought to you by VVOX a platform with a mission to eradicate sexual shame and Earshot India s hottest podcast platform Listen to the podcast at
