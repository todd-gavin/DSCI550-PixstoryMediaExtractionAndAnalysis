One of Australia's oldest and best-selling chocolate bars is Cherry Ripe. It's a sweet and nostalgic bar with cherry and coconut filling, coated in dark chocolate, and finished with the famous red wrapper. 

Cherry Ripes have been on Australian stores since 1924, proving their durability. Despite the fact that they are made by the multinational candy giant Cadbury, these red-wrapped bars can only be obtained in Australia.
