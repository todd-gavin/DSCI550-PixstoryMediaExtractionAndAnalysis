For me peace is acceptance , acceptance of all colours, all races,all differences .it is also about acceptance of ourselves,our family,our friends.for me peace is trees ,it is the flow of a river ,it is the starry twist,it is the calmness of a storm ,it is the late night mist.peace is in endings ,peace is in startings ,it is a heavely thought of me and you entangled through the bonds of nature .so hold my hand and lets flow in deepðŸ’›
#Happy Peace Day
#Lets end racism and spread peace through black the colour of life.
