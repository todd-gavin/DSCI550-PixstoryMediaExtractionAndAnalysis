The principle of flame photometer is based on the measurement of the emitted light intensity when a metal is introduced into the flame The wavelength of the colour gives information about the element and the colour of the flame gives information about the amount of the element present in the sample Flame photometry is one of the branches of atomic absorption spectroscopy It is also known as flame emission spectroscopy Currently it has become a necessary tool in the field of analytical chemistry Flame photometer can be used to determine the concentration of certain metal ions like sodium potassium lithium calcium and cesium etc In flame photometer spectra the metal ions are used in the form of atoms The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC Committee on Spectroscopic Nomenclature has named this technique as flame atomic emission spectrometry FAES
