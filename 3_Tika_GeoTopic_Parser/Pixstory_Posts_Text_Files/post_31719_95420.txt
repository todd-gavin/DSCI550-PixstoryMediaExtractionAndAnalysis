In Italian private law, there are some justification causes for unlawful conduct that would otherwise be unlawful. There are three typical justification causes: the consent of the person entitled to it. The legitimate defense. The state of necessity. As regards the first point, whoever violates a right with consent is not responsible of the person who can validly dispose of it For example, the use of a person&#39;s image without consent is illicit but if the consent is obtained automatically the illicitness does not occur This however does not apply to all rights, for example it is not a reasoning that can be applied to fundamental rights and personal like life As regards self-defense, it will suffice to report the ART of the civil code whoever committed the crime is not responsible for being forced to do so by the need to defend one&#39;s own or another&#39;s right against the current danger of an unjust offense provided that the defense is proportionate to the offense In the same way, whoever commits the harmful act forced by the need to save others from the current danger of serious damage to the state of necessity will not be responsible. head towards the curb by breaking through a shop window the damage will be distributed equally it will not be solely the responsibility of the driver
