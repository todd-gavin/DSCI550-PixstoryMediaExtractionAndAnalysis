With Manchester City losing points to West Ham on May 15 and Liverpool beating Southampton on May 17, the margin at the top of the Premier League standings has shrunk to just one point, with one last encounter scheduled for Sunday, May 22.


Liverpool came from behind to win 2-1 at Southampton, while Man City had a late Riyad Mahrez penalty saved by West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski in a 2-2 draw, allowing the Reds to close the gap to just one point (90 points to 89).


On the final day, both Manchester City and Liverpool will be at home, and both will be favorites to win all three points.


Only three possibilities exist in which Liverpool may win the Premier League, one of which is a bit more likely than the other two. A defeat to Wolves would end their championship hopes.


Liverpool must complete the following to win the Premier League title on the final day:


Man City draw or lose vs. Aston Villa AND Liverpool win vs. Wolves


OR


Man City loses by 7+ goals against Aston Villa and Liverpool draws with Wolves [Liverpool wins championship on goal difference].


OR


Liverpool draws with Wolves and Man City loses by 6 goals to Aston Villa, and Liverpool scores 5+ more goals in their tie than Man City [Liverpool wins championship based on goals scored].


If Liverpool and Man City finish level on points (90), goal difference (first tiebreaker), and total goals scored (second tiebreaker), the championship will be decided in a one-game playoff. 


Bottom line: Liverpool will only be interested in winning, regardless of the number of goals they score. At the same time, they'll need former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to guide Aston Villa to a victory over Man City at the Etihad.


It will be a difficult task for Gerrard's Villa side: Man City hasn't lost consecutive Premier League games since December 2020.
