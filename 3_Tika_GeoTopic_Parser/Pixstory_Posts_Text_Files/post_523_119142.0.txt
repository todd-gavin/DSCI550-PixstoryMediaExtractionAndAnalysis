I was looking at the wedding pics of J LO and besides gushing over how beautiful she looked . It made me wonder whether there is any standard age for peak beauty. 
Although I am not talking about J Lo or for that matter people like Rekha closer home- I mean for lesser mortals like us . No Botox no surgery types . 
The health reporter in me decides to dig deeper. 
Well
Lots of studies with good enough sample size tell you, there surely is an age when both men and women look their best. 
Studies say both genders look most attractive in their thirties. 
A study done almost a decade earlier explains it the best possible way.  It’s based on US survey of 2,000 people has found.

The study, carried out by Allure magazine, found women are considered most beautiful at 30, show signs of ageing at 41, stop looking ‘sexy’ at 53 and are thought of as ‘old’ at 55.
Same for men, they look best in 30s, start showing age at 41. However they can still look ‘sexy’ till 58 and are considered old by 59-60. 

So here is the reason why SRK still tops the sexy chart. Ranbir not yet 41 still looks young and Deepika  looks stunning. 
Surely better than the newbies on the screen- the Saras, Ananyas and Jahnvis . 
Having said that if you are an eternal optimist than age is just a number.
