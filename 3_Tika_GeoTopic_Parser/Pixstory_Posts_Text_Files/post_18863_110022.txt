Nadal&#39;s debut at Wimbledon is approaching the Spaniard in the first round he will have to contend with the Argentine Cerundolo in a match that sees the Majorcan obviously favorite Even if Nadal hasn&#39;t played on grass for three years and it&#39;s not exactly a very simple surface as he himself said in press conference I&#39;m having fun playing on the grass after three years If I&#39;m here because things are going well otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have come he said referring to the foot problem he&#39;s been carrying for a lifetime and for which he underwent specific treatment in Barcelona for as long as it&#39;s about the condition of my foot I can walk normally every day when I wake up I no longer have the pain I&#39;ve had for a year and a half and in general I&#39;ve been better in training I&#39;m optimistic About his optimism Nadal is considered by all to be the favorite together to Djokovic and Berrettini If he also wins at Wimbledon he would do a 3-row and the Grand Slam would be his after his victories at the US Open and Roland Garros I don&#39;t know how I get there really difficult to predict a complicated surface that needs to be tested for a long time and I don&#39;t play on grass for three years. But I trust to get competitive
