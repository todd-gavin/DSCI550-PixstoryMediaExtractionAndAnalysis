Plants in water stress burnt and yellowed leaves fewer and smaller olives These are the effects of drought and high temperatures on Lombard olive groves where losses in the quantity of olives are estimated that reach up to a third compared to a normal year according to Coldiretti Lombardia in based on a monitoring of the area The explosive mix of heat and drought specifies the regional Coldiretti has hindered the appearance of small fruits on plants that show the symptoms of water stress with yellowed leaves that are scalded and characterized by a light color Even the olives that have managed to develop on the branches of the trees Coldiretti specifies they struggle to grow and swell correctly with the consequent risk of having a lower final oil yield The fears for a difficult year are recorded above all in the Brescia area, the first production area in the region. Another year to forget, says Silvano Zanelli olive grower from Puegnago del Garda and president of AIPOL the Interprovincial Association of Lombard Olive Producers The heat and drought are bringing our olive growing to its knees with product losses which in our areas are currently reaching peaks of A serious situation for a sector of great value for the Lombard agriculture both for the quality of the product and from an environmental and tourist point of view The damage to the olive growing season continues the Lombardy Coldiretti are added to those caused by drought to other Lombard crops At the moment the regional Coldiretti concludes, already estimated drops of about a third for the production of barley, wheat and rice while the losses for forage are now approaching the same as the estimated drop for the yields of the corn crops In the stables due to the high temperatures the cows are producing up to less milk but drought and it is hot in the plains fruit and vegetables are also burning while in the mountain pastures the pastures are dry and puddles of water used by the animals to quench their thirst and cool off are getting drier
