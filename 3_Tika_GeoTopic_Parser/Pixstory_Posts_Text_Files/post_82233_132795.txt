My father was a head of Ashram pradhan Many infected people have died and their children have left the place I wish everyone from the Ashram gets exposed to a more normal living A few years ago my association with an Ngo CFar changed many things for me I got involved more systematically in the welfare of all the Ashram inmates During covid pandemic and susbsquent lockdowns I could arrange medicines food and also doctors when needed I am not restricted to working for just the Ashram but also work for the entire Anand Parbat area which has around population FRom door to door surverys regarding health and hygiene to advocacy during covid or even clearing general perceptions about covid vaccination I am involved with everything These years have been a time of struggle but I have come a long way I remember when we used to go to schools we were made to sit seperately and teacher would ask other students to maintain distance Our children didnt face this much discrimination However getting jobs is a still a problem even if we had a leprosy patient in the family years ago even than the stigma remains Sometimes people for the fear of dicrimination would not even say they are from leprosy ashram MY sisters daughter was working for a month in a house after a month the employers asked ID proof the moment they saw address on her Aadhar she was asked to leave Things have definitely changed but more change is required My son who has done his class and did a computer course I hope he doesn t have to lie to get a job I am thankful to God that we have come a long way but we hope our children get better accepted and better education and work opportunities I am trying hard to realise this dream in what ever way I can I will feel equal and empowered when finally this dream becomes a reality As told to ToufiqRashid
