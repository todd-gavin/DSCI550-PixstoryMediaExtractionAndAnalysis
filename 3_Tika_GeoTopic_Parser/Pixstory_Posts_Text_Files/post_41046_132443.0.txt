The late actress Anne Heche will be buried with many other famous people in a renowned Los Angeles cemetery, her family announced on Tuesday. 

ABC News reported that Heche was cremated, and at a later time, her remains will be interred in a mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. 

Heche's sons Homer Laffoon and Atlas Tupper told The Associated Press that they were "convinced that our Mom would appreciate the spot we have picked for her; it's gorgeous, tranquil, and she will be among her Hollywood peers." 

Nearly two weeks after she was pronounced dead at a hospital from injuries sustained in a violent vehicle wreck, the details were made public. 

In recent years, the cemetery has evolved into a centre for festivals, concerts, and film screenings.
