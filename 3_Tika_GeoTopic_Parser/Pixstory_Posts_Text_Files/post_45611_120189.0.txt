The entire cast will return for American Idol's upcoming 21st season. Luke Bryan, Katy Perry, and Lionel Richie will once again sit behind the judges' table for the long-running talent competition's sixth season on the network, ABC said on Thursday, July 28. 

As per Billboard, they will, of course, be joined by presenter Ryan Seacrest, the only surviving member of the series' original cast, who will keep the show's trains running when it resumes broadcasting in the spring of 2023. 

On August 3, when "Idol Across America" resumes with its live, virtual nationwide search for talent, auditions for the new season will begin. All 50 states and Washington, D.C. will host tryouts, and the process will begin with the yearly "First 500" event, which offers a few aspiring stars the chance to snag a VIP spot before their fellow auditioners.
