When I say that I actually like Twilight, I am often met with incredulous looks. After all, we're at the point where hating Twilight has become a meme (https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/still-a-better-love-story-than-twilight). 

And yes, the book series has any number of valid critiques: it is flowery, overwritten, and itâ€™s certainly true that Edward, the 100+ year old vampire obsessed with a teenage girl is toxic, creepy and borderline abusive as a boyfriend. 

However, it is my firm opinion that the first movie in the Twilight adaptation is a vast improvement on the books. 

For one thing, it was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, of Thirteen fame. In Thirteen, Hardwicke proved that she knew how to depict the constant, suffocating intensity of life as a teen girl. She brings that same adeptness to Twilight, and the result is a beautifully shot, fun little romantic movie that doesn't take itself quite so seriously as the source material (there's one scene where a smirking Edward puts on sunglasses, clearly well aware of the fact that all the girls at school are ogling him). 

Hardwicke sands down a lot of what was unbearable about the books: for instance, the oppressively low self-esteem of the protagonist, Bella. Bella is played by Kristen Stewart, and let me tell you, it is an inspired casting choice. 

Anybody who entertains doubts as to K-Stew's acting chops need look no further than her recent turn as Diana, Princess of Wales in 'Spencer' - or her equally dark role in the movie 'Personal Shopper.' She has crackling chemistry with Robert Pattinson who plays the vampire Edward (Twilight fans know that they dated in real life!) and well, it all makes for a highly entertaining movie. 

Book - 0. Adaptation - 1! Game, set and match to Catherine Hardwicke.
