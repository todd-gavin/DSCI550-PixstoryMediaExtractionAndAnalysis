I believe , without a shadow of a doubt , that a woman's place is wherever she wants to be . While the struggle for a world with equal rights is making progress , traveling alone continues to be an act of defiance . It's not hard to find countries where incidents of violence against women are still very high , which intimidates female travelers to a certain degree (and with good reason) .

I dream of the day when women don't have to look for recommendations of safe places to travel alone . However , while this still isn't the reality , I believe that some countries are safer for female travelers than others .

So I decided to tell you all about 10 countries where solo female travel can be an amazing experience .  However ,  they're much safer and calmer than others .❤️

1 Finland
2 Canada
3 New zealand
4 Uruguay
5 Switzerland
6 Belgium
