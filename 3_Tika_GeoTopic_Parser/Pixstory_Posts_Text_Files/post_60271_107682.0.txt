Hundreds of frustrated army aspirants and other citizens protest the 'agnipath' scheme in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana, burning tyres and obstructing rail and road traffic, demanding the scheme's discontinuation. At the bhabua road railway station, protestors also set fire to a train.

The movement began after the centre announced the policy, which calls for the enlistment of jawans on a contract basis for a four-year period, followed by mandatory retirement for the majority of them without gratuity or pension benefits. Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi Chief Minister, has urged the Union Government to allow young people to serve the country for the rest of their lives, not just for four years.

"We've been preparing for a long time, and now they've made ToD (Tour of Duty) a four-year job. We don't want that, but we do want the previous recruitment procedure to continue ""Say the protestors," they said

"I don't believe our youth truly understood the idea or are puzzled." Both the state and the federal government are taking this seriously. I propose that they withdraw their protest and try to comprehend the scheme's benefits: Protests against the 'Agnipath' system, according to Deputy Chief Minister Tarkishor Prasad.

In Bihar, protests over the Centre's Agnipath recruiting scheme got violent in the districts of Chhapra, Gopalganj, and Kaimur, causing at least three trains to catch fire.

Several aspirants for the armed forces are dissatisfied with the changes made under the new Indian Army recruitment scheme, particularly the length of service, the lack of pension provisions for those released early, and the 17.5 to 21-year age restriction, which has rendered many of them ineligible.

Hundreds of young people protested the recruiting strategy in the districts of Nawada, Jehanabad, and Munger.
A large crowd gathered in Nawada to protest. Protesters vented their rage by setting fire to tyres on the highways and shouting anti-scheme chants.
