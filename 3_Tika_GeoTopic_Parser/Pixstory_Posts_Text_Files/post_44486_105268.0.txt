According to reputable journalist Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin has
signaled his desire to leave the club. The journalist tweeted, “Héctor Bellerín has no plans to
continue at Arsenal next season. He hopes for Real Betis return but the deal is more than
complicated because of financial reasons, it will take time.

Bellerín has received also other approaches and will decide his future soon.”

The defender spent last season on loan at boyhood club Real Betis, lifting the Copa Del Rey
with them in April. The defender is keen to join them on a full time basis, however Betis want
Arsenal to drop the transfer fee for Hector Bellerin and let him negotiate with the club on a free.

Arsenal however are demanding up to a sum of ₤10 million.

The defender has been attracting interest from other sides, in particular from Serie A giants
Roma. Speaking to Betis TV, Bellerin had to say “I have made my position clear to both clubs.

Now we have two months to get the best deal for all three parties. I have always said I made an
effort to come here, and I am willing to make every effort to keep it going because it is my home,
and I am happy.

It is also true that I had very nice moments in London, in England. Arsenal has given me a lot,
the opportunity to be a professional. If I leave, it will be difficult, but hopefully, everything goes as
we want."
