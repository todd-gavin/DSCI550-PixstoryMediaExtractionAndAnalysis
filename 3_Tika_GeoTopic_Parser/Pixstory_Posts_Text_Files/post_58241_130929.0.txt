Do you like those villainess story where the so called antagonist takes revenge then you should definitely listen to this song ! . It is the theme song for them . It captures the essence of a girl embracing her dark side and becoming a full fledged villain! Quoting a line from the song 'If they want a villain for the Queen, I am going to be one like they never seen '
