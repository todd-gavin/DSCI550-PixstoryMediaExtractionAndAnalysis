At some point, I started looking
At the ground more than the sky

I hold out my hand
But no one holds it

2. "Paranoia" by Kang Daniel

In a space without a single light
When the darkness comes
I lay expressionless, again and again
An endless fear, a terrible night
Wasn’t with me back then
But they right here now

3. "Whalien52" by BTS
The lyrics that will resonate with you: 

The world will never know how sad I am
My pain is water and oil that can't mix

Breathe, and the interest towards me ends
A child in the lonely ocean
I want to make it known too
My value,  every day

5.  "The Last" by Agust D
The lyrics that will resonate with you: 

On the first visit to the psychiatric ward
My parents came up with me
We listened to the consultation together
My parents said they don’t truly understand me
I don’t understand myself well either
Then who would understand?
Friends? Or you? Nobody knows me well
