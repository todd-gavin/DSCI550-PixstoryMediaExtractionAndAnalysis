I get straight to the point.

ðŸ”¼ When you surround yourself with someone you love to spend time with, you are not an introvert at that time. Perhaps Extrovert!

ðŸ”¼ But when you surround yourself with someone that you think will think that you're stupid then you go into your introvert zone.

So it's a state of mind that your brain decides based on your surroundings.
And oftentimes your mind is protective so it keeps you away from interactions. (That's excuses)

I hope I'm clear with my thoughts.

Thanks 
Stay Khush!
