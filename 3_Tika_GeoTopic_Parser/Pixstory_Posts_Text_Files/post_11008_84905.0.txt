As images from war-hit Ukraine streamed onto Indian screens, they carried concerns about the well-being of more than 20,000 Indians who studied or lived—or are still stuck—there: Over 18,000 were students, many of them studying medicine.
 
Ashwini Manjrekar is one of them. A 21-year-old MBBS student of Kyiv Medical University, Manjrekar had been stuck in Ukraine’s capital city, desperate to leave.
 
In her third year, she has done everything the Indian government asked her to: get in touch with the embassy, lie low, not panic, look for tickets to fly back, go to train stations in the hope of boarding a train to the country’s borders. Nothing worked.
 
While she was in transit, trying to get to safety, her Mumbai-based brother Aditya said his sister was not contacted even once by the embassy. “Most of the helpline numbers don’t work and if they do, the official only says that they will get in touch with us,” he said.
 
But the family’s constant anxiety turned into anger on 1 March 2022, when they heard Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s statement, declaring that all Indians had been evacuated from Kyiv. When Shringla made the statement on 1 March, she was still in Kyiv. On 2 March, Manjrekar fled in a private car, with no help from the embassy. 
 
“It is an absolute lie. My sister is on her own, even today,” said Aditya. “There are so many other Indian students still stuck in Kyiv. The government should not lie.”
 
Even as Indian students stranded in Ukraine and their families fight anxious moments till they reach a point of safety, a silently orchestrated disinformation campaign has been taking shape across digital platforms, in groups and forums that sympathise with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
