Background Patients with Acute Pancreatitis AP have at least a two fold higher risk for developing post pancreatitis diabetes mellitus PPDM No therapies have prevented PPDM Statins were demonstrated to possibly lower the incidence and severity of AP but have not been studied to prevent PPDM Methods Data from a commercial insurance claim database Optum Clinformatics was used to assess the impact of statins on patients without pre existing DM admitted for a first episode of AP in patients Regular statin usage was defined as filled statin prescriptions for at least of the year prior to AP The primary outcome was defined as PPDM We constructed a propensity score and applied inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance baseline characteristics between groups Using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling we estimated the risk of PPDM accounting for competing events Results With a median of years of follow up the year cumulative incidence of PPDM was CI among regular statin users and CI among non users Regular statin users had a lower risk of developing PPDM compared to non users HR CI P Irregular statin users had a lower risk of PPDM HR CI P Similar benefits were seen with low moderate and high statin doses Conclusions In a large database based study statin usage reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus after acute pancreatitis Further prospective studies with long term follow up are needed to study the impact of statins on acute pancreatitis and prevention of PPDM Keywords StatinsPost Pancreatitis Diabetes MellitusAcute PancreatitisLate Complications of Pancreatitis Abbreviations CI Confidence Interval HR hazard ratio AP acute pancreatitis PPDM post pancreatitis diabetes mellitus IPTW Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting
