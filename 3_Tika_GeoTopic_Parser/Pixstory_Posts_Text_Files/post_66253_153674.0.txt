I absolutely love Batman v Superman and it is my second favorite DCEU film of all time after Zack Snyder's Justice League. 
Also I don't care what haters says I think movie is amazing well not Theatrical Version because it's not really great but Ultimate Edition defiantly awesome and true version of that movie. 
What I love about this movie was the cast did amazing on their roles like I love Ben Affleck as Batman and he is my favorite Batman of all time, I love Henry Cavill as Superman and he is my favorite Superman of all time, I love Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and she is defiantly hands down the best Wonder Woman ever, I really enjoy Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Diane Lane is wonderful as Martha Kent, love Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, enjoyed Jesse Eisenberg is great as Lex Luthor not best Lex Luthor but he still great as him, and rest of cast did awesome on their roles, storytelling was amazing, opening was really beautiful, backstories were well done, dark scenes were amazing especially Bruce's vision of Knightmare, fight scenes were so awesome like with fight between Batman and Superman and final battle with Doomsday, it had amazing development on characters like they done awesome job Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman the most especially of having them to be team trio, love romance between Clark and Lois and they are my favorite couples of DCEU, emotional scenes were heart touching especially Superman's sacrifice that was so breathtaking, love how we get more extended scenes like seeing more dialogue of Diana and seeing projection of Steppenwolf, Doomsday was awesome in this movie, ending was really well done like I love seeing Batman threatening Lex Luthor in prison and when we get see shot of the dirt moving on top of Clark's grave of showing that he would still be able to brought back to life and it was really great set up sequel to Zack Snyder's Justice League, visual effects were so cool, and music was amazing.Â  
I give this amazing movie 10/10!
