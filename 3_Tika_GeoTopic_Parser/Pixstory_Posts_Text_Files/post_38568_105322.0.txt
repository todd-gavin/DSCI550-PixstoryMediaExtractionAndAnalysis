Real Madrid


After the furore at Chelsea, the 6 ft 6 inches Belgian joined Real Madrid - the rivals of Atletico Madrid, for a reported sum of £35 million. He was bought on to backup Keylor Navas,who was sort of a legend there as he already won 2 Champions League with them. He also started in the 2018-19 season’s Champions League final against Liverpool which Real won to make it 13 titles. After Navas left Real for Paris Saint-Germain, that’s when Courtois got a chance to make the number 1 spot for him.
