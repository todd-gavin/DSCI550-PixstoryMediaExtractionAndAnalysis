Chelsea has risen to become one of the most powerful clubs in English football under the ownership of Roman Abramovich. Over the years, the Russian oligarch revamped the Blues with more spending and prudent investments. It has marked the start of a new era for the club.

Romelu Lukaku, Chelsea's most recent incoming transfer activity, has returned to his previous club for a fee of £97.5 million. It was a club-record purchase. The Blues are one of the most astute transfer managers in the game, but things haven't always gone according to plan.


#5.  Papy Djilobodji

Papy Djilobodji's Chelsea tenure was one of the shortest in Premier League history, as he only played for the Blues for 59 seconds.

Chelsea made a £4 million panic deal of Djilobodji after failing to land their first transfer targets of Raphael Varane and John Stones. After more than five years with Ligue 1 club FC Nantes, the centre-back moved to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2015.

Jose Mourinho, then-Chelsea manager, stated after his arrival in London that he had never heard of his new centre-back. Djilobodji's footballing skill was not appreciated by the Portuguese, either. For the majority of his Chelsea career, the Senegalese was restricted to the bench.


#4.  Andriy Shevchenko

Andriy Shevchenko, Ukraine's all-time greatest goalscorer, was one of Roman Abramovich's first headline signings.

Abramovich's favourite and 2004 Ballon d'Or winner arrived in London with a growing reputation. Shevchenko was signed by the Blues in the summer of 2006 for a cost of £39.49 million from AC Milan. During his seven years at the San Siro, the now 45-year-old became one of the most deadly forwards in modern football.

In 322 appearances for the Rossoneri, the Ukrainian great was personally involved in 220 goals (175 goals, 45 assists). Things did not go as planned, however, as the Ukrainian was unable to adjust to the demands of Premier League football.
