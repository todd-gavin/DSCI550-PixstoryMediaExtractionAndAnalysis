We go over a rise on the other side we get a close up look at a herd of yaks most camera unfriendly The track now has the most amazing tourmaline pink colour to it The valley is broad pebbly so wide flat straight I can imagine those herds of wild ponies on a full gallop here We now head straight towards this multi hued mountain on a road which seems peppered with turquoise stones The kind that one finds in the silver trinkets in Leh I can t get over these iridescent roads We near the mountain there is a stream skirting it s base The road turns we leave the wide valley the imaginary horses The stream accompanies us meandering creating huge wetlands we spy pairs of Brahminy ducks the first of many Kiangs Finally It looks nothing like the donkey from my first trip There is a campsite of herders on the other side As we near Nyoma the stream reveals its full form as the Indus But here it is still winding its way leisurely gathering power not yet intent to get going The valley is wide sweeping as sandy as the Thar It looks like the background of a Thangka painting The hills keep up the play of colours intermittently now burnt pink now mossy green the dullest mauve By the time we reach Chumathang it has been a long slightly bone rattling haul I am grateful for the steaming hot spring water soak at the end of it all Now that the brandy that followed are the way to end a road trip Now that it is all coming to a close I wish I could start all over again The solitude has been profound a most welcome change Even Leh seems crowded now Each valley has had a distinct feel to it its own character The colour palette so rich full the sweeping vistas in our case even the meager wildlife have been a visual feast The next trip is on the cards Concluded
