Sports have always produced magical moments in the field. . . Last minute goals, lucks, friendships, moments of humanity. . But this man has shown us how desire and determination can bring dreams back to life. After almost losing an eye, after 11 surgeries, Norwegian Footballer Omar Elabdelaoui played 90 full minutes for Turkish champion club Galatasaray. 


The unfortunate incident happened in 2020 New Year's Eve, when firecrackers burst while holding in hand. After that, he spent most of the time in the US for treatment. He even accepted sister's stem cell for eye surgery. The Moroccan descent player kept his fitness all the time with the help of the trainer of NFL team Cincinnati Bengals. 


30 year old Omar has represented Norway 46 times. He was part of the U21 team which won bronze in UEFA championships in 2013. He was part of the Manchester City youth team as right back. Eventually, he played for clubs like Feyenoord, Olympiacos and Hull City before reaching Galatasaray for 4mn Euros. Galatasaray helped him in treatment. 


Galatasaray beat Göztepe 3-2. The 22 time Turkish league champions are currently at 13th in the league. They also hold the record for winning the Turkish cup for the most number of times (18), and the Turkish Super cup (16). They have also won the UEFA Super cup and UEFA Cup. 


Some of the incredible comeback stories include legends like Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Niki Lauda. In football, former Chelsea and Czech Republic goal keeper Petre Cech was suggested not to play ever again after horrific head injury which led to skull fracture in 2006. He came back strongly and did goal keeping without conceding a goal for 813 minutes. If you are a sportsperson, you stop at nothing.
