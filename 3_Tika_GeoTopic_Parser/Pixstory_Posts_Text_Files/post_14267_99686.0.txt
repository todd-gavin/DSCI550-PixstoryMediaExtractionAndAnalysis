CUP RAISER - Juventus have reached the final of the Italian Cup 21 times, more than any other team, in part thanks to the recent run of seven finals in the last eight seasons - five of six of which have seen the Bianconeri raise the trophy.

COMMON CONTEST - With 33 matches already contested, the Derby d’Italia is the most played fixture in the Italian Cup. The Bianconeri have obtained 15 wins, the highest number of victories from a single club over Inter in the competition.

CUP RUN - Juventus have remained unbeaten in the last 14 matches of the Italian Cup (not including penalty shoot-outs), winning 10 and drawing four, and have done better only between 1972 and 1973, when they remained 15 games without defeat.

STAYING SINGLE - The 14 goals scored by Juventus in the Italian Cup finals of the 2000s (excluding own goals) have been scored by 13 different players, with only Medhi Benatia in 2017/18 on target more than once.

PAST MASTERS - On four wins, Massimiliano Allegri is the joint most successful coach in the competition alongside Sven-Göran Eriksson and Roberto Mancini. Meanwhile, with one more success, Giorgio Chiellini would equal Mancini and Gianluigi Buffon on six victories as the player with most winner’s medals.
