The word hope is a word that has so many different meanings to so many different people This is because we all have different definitions and thoughts on what hope means to us Hope can be defined as something that gives you the belief or desire that a specific thing will happen or exist in the future a feeling of expectation and desire for something desired but not present an object of hope especially one characterized by immortality One such example would be having hope for the survival of life on earth Another example would be having hope for a certain person or group s success such as hoping your basketball team wins the game For myself I think that hope is defined as something that will happen in the future With this definition I would say that I have hope for the future of our world and society such as hoping there will be no war or fighting among groups of people anymore Another hopeful subject would be hoping that there will be no major catastrophes and therefore allowing us to continue to live on in peace and harmony For me personally my definition of hope is something that never dies no matter what may happen in life I think this is a good way to live even if your hopes aren t fulfilled at least you had hope for them and they will always be there If you are someone who does not have hope for the future of humanity or something else then that s ok maybe you can find hope in the little things in life like having fun with a friend or family member I believe that anyone can have hope for anything no matter what it may be Hope isn t something that allows you to feel a certain way about life all the time but it s a frame of mind that gives us reason to keep going despite all odds against us Hope is the strongest emotion because it is something you can t feel unless you have hope Hope is one of the most important and powerful emotions that humans experience
