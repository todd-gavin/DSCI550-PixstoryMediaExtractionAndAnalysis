If Siddique Kappan, a journalist from Kerala who is currently an undertrial in an Uttar Pradesh (UP) jail, gets bail on 9 September, the date fixed by the Supreme Court to decide his petition, he will walk free after a detention that has lasted 704 days. 
If he does not get bail, he will complete two years in prison in the first week of October. 
Kappan’s case is a reflection, said lawyers, a former chief justice and his colleagues, of an egregious miscarriage of justice, deliberate misinterpretation of India’s laws and vindictive prosecution. According to the UP police and government, it is an example of a man conspiring with Islamists to plot terrorist activities behind the facade of journalism.
Kappan, 43, a reporter with more than a decade in journalism, mostly as a Delhi-based reporter for Malayalam news publications and websites, argued in his latest petition, accepted by the Supreme Court on 29 August, that his case raises “seminal questions pertaining to the right to liberty, as well as the freedom of expression and speech vested in independent media under the aegis of the Constitution”. 
His imprisonment, with no sign of trial, “has caused untold financial and mental hardship to his family and friends”, said Kappan in his special leave petition, presenting himself as “an individual with clean antecedents”, who had “never fallen foul of the law”.
Kappan’s special leave petition—which allows petitioners aggrieved by the order of any court special permission to be heard in the Supreme Court—was filed after the Allahabad High Court, on 2 August, dismissed his bail plea, upholding the UP police argument that “he had no work at Hathras,” as a journalist. 
The case centres around the 5 October 2020 arrest of Kappan, a cab driver—released on bail on 23 August —and two young Muslim activists who were en route to the district of Hathras in western UP.
