A not so particular day I landed in Delhi Dilli Unkown to me this alien space of concrete jungles and fast tracked vehicles would i find myself in a small apartment somewhere in west Delhi Whose balcony was but a wormhole to a different dimension in itself A painter s advertisement showcasing his skills using the boldest of blues and the whitest of whites was painted over the back and sides of a terrace with his contact number and overlooked other puny buildings nearby it This advertisement was one of a kind atleast for someone who s spent most of his life in the hills and mind you this advertisement was huge and it stood out how Taj Mahal or any other wonders of the world did Id stare it for days to come with the same possible combination of question and answers evreytime It filled me with wonder and joy couriosity and keeness peace and grace even in the worst of times and bad Delhi weather The painting never loses its grace i used to tell myself as i sat there in the balcony with a cup of black tea and marlboros This was my haven my safe haven in Uttamnagar Delhi It is not anymore though i have moved on from there just how a bird would move out from its nest or just how we all move in life to the next part of this journey To find a new haven again a new place a new story just like everyone I wonder if someone ever did phone him her they over the advertisement
