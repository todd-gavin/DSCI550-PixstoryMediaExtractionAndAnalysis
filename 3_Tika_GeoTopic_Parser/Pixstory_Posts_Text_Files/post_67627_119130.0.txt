Juventus confirm that their star signing Paul Pogba picked up a meniscus injury and could miss a couple of months following surgery.
The French international midfielder returned to Turin this summer on a free transfer after not renewing his contract with Manchester United. Juve re-signed Pogba on a four-year deal which will reportedly see him earning about €8m plus bonuses per season.
The 29-year-old played his first match for Juve this season in a friendly against Chivas Guadalajara last weekend. Unfortunately, he won’t be able to play in their next preseason match after picking up an injury during a training session in Los Angeles.
After a medical check-up, Juve confirmed that Pogba suffered a lesion to the lateral meniscus in his knee. The club revealed that he will need a consultation with an orthopedic specialist before his condition can be confirmed.
Normally this type of injury will need him to rest for 2 to 3 weeks but if surgery is required, Pogba could be out for a couple of months.
