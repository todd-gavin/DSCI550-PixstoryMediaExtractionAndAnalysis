—Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. – Psalm 42:11

In this verse, we see that David is in a depressed and sad condition. He describes his soul as “downcast” and “disturbed.” Rather than remaining in his depressed condition, he engages in self-talk to help himself get out of his funk.

When we find ourselves in a depressed state, self-talk can be a good way to fight our way free. Not just any self-talk will do, however. It must be self-talk that recognizes God as our reference point and Savior. We can know that our downcast state is temporary because God is our hope.
