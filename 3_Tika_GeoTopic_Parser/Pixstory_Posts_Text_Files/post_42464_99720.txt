Electronic Arts EA sports just announced that their football based game franchise will be known as EA Sports FC from which was previously known as EA Sports FIFA This incident happened because EA and FIFA Federation Internationale de Football Association failed to reach an agreement and after years this game will be called by a different name As a FIFA fan this is the end of an era and if fans will make noise then who knows both parties will shake hands again but as for now there is no bridge between the two parties
