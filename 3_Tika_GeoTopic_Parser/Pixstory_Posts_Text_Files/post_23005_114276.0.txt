Ivana Ferreira Fuso has signed a new deal with Manchester United today, extending her contract until the end of the 2023/24 season. The Brazilian wonderkid will be joining Bayer 04 Leverkusen on loan until the end of the 2022/23 season. 

The 21-year old youngster joined the Red Devils back in 2020 on a two-year deal, with an option for a third year. Fuso didn’t get much gametime last season but ensured that she did her best in the limited minutes. She only managed to play for 81 minutes in the WSL last season.

But Fuso played a key part in United’s Conti Cup campaign. Marc Skinner’s side reached the semi final of the Conti Cup last season after facing the likes of Durham, Everton, Manchester City and Leicester City in the group stages and Arsenal in the quarter final. The partnership of Fuso and Welsh international Carrie Jones was vital towards United's sucess in the group stages. 

Manchester United head coach Marc Skinner on Fuso’s loan move: “This loan move is an excellent opportunity for Ivana to play regular first-team football.”

He also adds that the coaching staff and the club will be closely monitoring her progress with Leverkusen throughout the season. 

Leverkusen are a part of the Frauen-Bundesliga. Fuso is not new to the German league, having played for SC Freiburg’s academy and senior team. Her loan move comes at the right time as it offers her the chance of development. Fuso’s talent is visible everytime she steps on the pitch but unfortunately, gametime has been hard to come by. A season long loan in a familiar league would do her well. 

Marc Skinner on Fuso playing in the Frauen Bundesliga: "The German league is very good for the development of young players and a place where Ivana can express herself."
