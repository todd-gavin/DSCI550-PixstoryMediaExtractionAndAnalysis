There seems to be more celebrities without beauty brands than with them these days, but Hailey Bieber’s upcoming Rhode Beauty hits slightly different. For starters, the model and influencer has always been vocal — and savvy — when it comes to skincare. She uses prescription retinoids, see’s famed Los Angeles aesthetician Biba de Sousa, is a fan of Augustinus Bader and swears by Holifrog cleansers. Any beauty buff will tell you she’s ‘in the know’, and the few products she does share on social media are those held in high regard.
