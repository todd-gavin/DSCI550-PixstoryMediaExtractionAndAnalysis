 Kylian Mbappe has lamented the fact that the trio of himself, Lionel Messi and Neymar have only started clicking recently.

After the Argentine joined last summer, the Ligue 1 giants were expected to dominate European football this season. However, that wasn't the case until last week.

They were already out of the Coupe de France and the Champions League before their match against Lorient last week.

PSG won 5-1 with Messi scoring one, Mbappe scoring two and Neymar scoring two. Meanwhile, this week they thrashed Clermont Foot 6-1 with Neymar and Mbappe each getting a hat-trick and one assist.

Messi, on the other hand, provided a hat-trick of assists in the match.

"Yeah, it's a shame it's only happening now. Afterward, there were quite a few circumstances and events that caused us to be a little delayed. But we feel that they are three quality players. We try to help the team as much as possible, and that’s what happened today." Mbappe

PSG maintain a 12-point lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table over second-placed Marseille and have more or less wrapped up the title.
