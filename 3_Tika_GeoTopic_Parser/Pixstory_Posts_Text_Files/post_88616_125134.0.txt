The FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup was to be hosted in 2020 but unfortunately, the pandemic struck, putting a hold on it. 

But not to worry! Organized only in even years, it's set to happen this year on 11th October and it will be hosted by the one and only India!

Last time, Spain took the trophy, who is it going to be this time ??

Let's wait and watch! 🏆
