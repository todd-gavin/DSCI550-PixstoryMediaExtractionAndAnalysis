Motherhood is a woman s most pious and celebrated ability but it is deplorable to see how often the term is disparaged and misused by people for their benefit Although surrogacy is presented as a method of medically assisted reproduction and portrayed as an altruistic action used for helping couples who can t have a baby naturally But sadly the reality is far more vicious the so called sugar coated image of surrogacy is quite tainted and harmful for the women who choose to keep a baby in their womb for others The whole narrative of using a human body in most of cases a female body as a commodity is not new now It has been done repeatedly and frequently Whether it s a discussion over using a women s body as a sexual servitude or just exploiting her for one s own benefit society has done enough to harm the abilities and emotions of a woman Still unfortunately the topic of surrogacy motherhood is not put in this sphere It keeps on evading the discussion of human trafficking and exploitation because of the lingering views that it helps couples to become a parent But this doesn t justify the cruelty of the profession The whole concept compromises the dignity of both the women and the child by making them mere objects
