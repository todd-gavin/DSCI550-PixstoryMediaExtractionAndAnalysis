‌Jordan was a powerful campaigner for the Democrats during the 1960 presidential election, and this experience stimulated her into politics. In 1962 and 1964 she was an unsuccessful candidate for the Texas House of Representatives, but she was elected in 1966 to the Texas Senate, the first African American member since 1883 and the first woman ever elected to that legislative body.
