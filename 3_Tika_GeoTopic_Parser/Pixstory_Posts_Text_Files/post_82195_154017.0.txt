Today is the Kojagori Laxmi Puja. So today we offered prayers to Goddess Laxmi. She is offered sweets,fruits, and naru, small balls made of coconut and sugar and sesame and jaggery. Often khichdi, is offered. 
A very significant part is drawing Alpona. Alpona are designs drawn on the floor. But these are drawn with with rice paste. Designs of lotus, conch shells, owls are made. Also it is the norm to draw Goddess
Laxmi's footprints all over the house, especially at the entrance and kitchen. This signifies her presence and blessings.
