Arsenal have finally confirmed the signing of Ukrainian left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City on a 4-year deal. 

The Gunners had been pushing for the 25-year-old for quite some time now and after the numerous rejections that they have suffered lately in this transfer window, the confirmation of Zinchenko’s move comes as a sigh of relief for Arsenal fans. Arsenal will be paying £30 Million (fixed) and £3 Million add-ons to City for the player. 

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta spoke very highly of his new recruit right after his signing was made official. He told Arsenal’s website, “We’re so happy Alex has joined us. He’s a player that I personally know really well and continued to follow him after my time at Manchester City. Alex is a high-quality player who will give us options and versatility. It's not only about the positions he can play but as well, the versatility he will give us in attack and defence. Alex is a person with great human qualities and character, and I’m delighted that everyone has made this huge effort to bring Alex to the club.”

Oleksandr Zinchenko is a Shakhtar Donetsk academy product. It was only in 2016 that he made his big move to Manchester City and his career took an upward trajectory ever since. In his 6 years at Manchester City, he played 127 matches for the English club scoring 2 goals and providing 12 assists. In fact, he made quite a name for himself as Pep Guardiola’s reserve left-back player of choice. He has had a number of memorable performances for City. 

He will be a brilliant addition to Mikel Arteta’s team. Zinchenko is Arsenal’s 5th signing of the season after Gabriel Jesus, Marquinhos, Matt Turner and Fabio Vieira. After missing out on Lisandro Martinez and Raphinha to Manchester United and FC Barcelona respectively, Arsenal fans are glad to have finally landed the Zinchenko deal.
