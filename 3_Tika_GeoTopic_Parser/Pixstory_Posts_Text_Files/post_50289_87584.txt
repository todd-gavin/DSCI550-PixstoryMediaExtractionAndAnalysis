I can never forget the early morning of rd September when I had one of the closest encounters with the Maoists near a village school located on the top of the Rohtas Kaimur Plateau This village named Soli was at a distance of about kms from the Dhansa valley junction where one reached on the plateau after travelling uphill on unmetalled road laden with probable landmines for about kms from Rohtas Police Station downhill In those days the road to Rohtas itself at a distance of kms from the District Police Headquarters was in a pathetic state of disrepair and consumed not less than hours of body shaking journey by road The next kms of unmetalled forest road to Dhansa took about minutes and then the forest road took about kms to reach Adhaura on the other side of the plateau where one had access to metalled road and means of communication For about kms from Dhansa to Adhaura one was literally left with no communication even in since the wireless sets could not communicate with the district headquarters and further since there were no mobile towers in the hilly territory about feet above sea level which was also thus understood as a liberated zone by the Maoists The only Police Station on the hills was at Adhaura reaching which from the side of Rohtas was not easy We found a solution for communication using satellite phones during later operations on the hills but on this morning we had none The biggest weapon and strategy that we had was surprise which I was quite confident to be safe To be continued
