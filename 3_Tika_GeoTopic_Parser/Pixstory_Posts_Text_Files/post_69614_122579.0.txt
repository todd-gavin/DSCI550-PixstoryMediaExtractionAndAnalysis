Touted as the supreme gem of all lakes in Kashmir, Manasbal Lake is known for its peacefulness and sheer beauty. The quiet azure lake amidst the mountains surrounded by a lush green garden is a blissful experience. 
The lotuses that grow in the lake during July and August add to the charm of the lake. The stems of the lotuses are harvested to make the traditional Kashmiri Nadru. The Mughal Garden near Manasbal built by Nur Jahan provides an alluring view of the lake and mountain peaks. The lake is also the home to exclusive Himalayan birds. To enjoy thrilling activities, you can avail the shikara ride and water skiing.
