Life seems to have come full circle for former militant Yasin Malik. Is it the time for him to pay for his crimes that he committed as a militant? Malik belonged to Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), the organisation which raised the slogan of azaadi in J&K. But Pakistan stopped supporting it as it talked about Kashmir’ independence from both India and Pakistan. ISI didn’t like it and started supporting Hizbul Mujahideen which left JKLF short on both money and weapons. In 1994 Malik claimed he has left the path of violence.

He is facing charges of terror funding, kidnapping of Rubaiya Saeed, daughter of former Union home minister and J&K CM Mufti Mohammed Saeed, and also killing Indian Air Force personnel in 1990.

Malik has lost political significance in J&K and he doesn’t fit in the scheme of government of Narendra Modi which wants to punish all those who are reaponaible for violence in the valley - in past as well as now. The future doesn’t look very bright for Yasin Malik
