Humans are the most deadly species in human history, and they have been responsible for decades of population decline in a wide range of species. The River Dolphin is one such species. River dolphins are wonderful creatures. In some of the world's most beautiful river systems, they are the top predators. Despite this, they are generally unknown. Despite the fact that the four Asian species dwell in among of the world's most densely inhabited areas â€“ and all six species live in rivers that suffer a bombardment of dangers - they are nevertheless clinging to life. But they're barely hanging on. Apart from pollution, bycatch, maritime transport traffic, and habitat degradation, River Dolphins are threatened by hunting for their flesh and oil. It is one of the world's most endangered species.
