My last post started quite an argument about how the shelving of the movie could affect the crew of it The crew all got their paycheck and then began working on other projects The only thing they could lose is an award nomination and I truly don t think any award shows are going to do anything about it now Regardless of whether or not this film is released the hundreds of people who worked on it will not suffer at least not any more than they already do on a movie set They are compensated prior to the release of the film Any profit made from the film s release goes to the studio to reimburse them for their investment However if this film is released thousands of victims of paedophilia abuse and grooming will be affected Not to mention people are massively misunderstanding how common it is for projects to get shelved Actors and crew members don t stand by waiting for everything they worked on to get released and whine when they don t It s a part of working in the industry Now People don t only work for money their work has sentimental value to them They want to see this movie released would be a bold way of saying how you give a sh t about victims of assault It is appalling how people are so grossly overlooking women and children s safety while justifying the release of The Flash I don t know how it s even not possible to see the gravity of this situation at this point Ezra Miller is a child sexual abuser do we understand just how not okay it is to try to even find arguments against people s anger Their resistance is justified even if it won t have an outcome they want People don t wanna watch a child predator as a superhero Warner Bros can afford this loss it s another thing if they choose not to but they can afford it and don t really need an army of people sympathizing with their loss However Miller s victims can definitely use some of that support
