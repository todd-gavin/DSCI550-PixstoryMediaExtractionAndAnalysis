How many of you have personal experience with a dog breeder? In order to reduce genetic anomalies in their pedigree, dog breeders spend hours examining bloodlines. They're looking for a dog with the correct temperament to be a sire for future litters. They spend their weekends travelling across the country to dog shows to compete with other dogs of the same breed for the title of best in breed, which translates to best genetic specimen. Their dog's hips, elbows, and eyes are all screened for genetic anomalies, and if any are found, the dog is no longer considered for breeding. After that, the dog is either adopted into a forever home or maintained as a pet by the breeder.

Breeders want to maintain the breed's integrity while also helping to strengthen it. They devote many hours to researching and evaluating novel treatments for their breed. They can often advise a veterinarian which anaesthetics are the safest, which diet ingredients are known to cause allergies, and which antibiotics are likely to induce sensitivities.
A lot of breeders are also rescuers. They will adopt a dog from a shelter that is not one of their own, but is of their breed. They'll do everything they can to locate this dog a forever home while continuing to fulfil their breeding responsibilities.

When the tagline "adopt don't shop" is employed, it effectively means that a mixed breed dog is the only dog worth having. It implies that purebred dogs and cats do not deserve to be loved. Breeders aren't to blame for overcrowding in shelters. The overcrowding in shelters is due to irresponsible owners. People who own a dog but are unable to afford to get it fixed or neutered, resulting in unwanted puppies. The problem is people who adopt a dog and then decide to get rid of it because it no longer fits into their lives.
