Elizabeth II is revered as a female role model since she has been the world's longest-reigning monarch. But how can she be a feminist when she was a torchbearer of a sexist institution?

As Insider says, it could be argued that the Queen is the only reason we don't have a king. King George VI, the father of Her Majesty, exclusively had daughters; nevertheless, if the Queen had a younger brother, the old legislation would have required that he take her place in the line of succession. 

Even though she was the monarch, the Queen is usually seen as having a lower status than a king.

Moreover, while the monarchy does not always perpetrate misogyny against royal women, it hasn't made an effort to stop it from happening. 

For instance, according to the palace's "no response" press policy, royal ladies aren't allowed to respond to articles about them, even if they indulge in sexist stereotypes and baseless rumours. 

In a prior statement this year, Markle criticised the palace's rules, claiming that the press team left her "unprotected" and prohibited her from responding to untrue reports.

"There's the sexism that's not necessarily enforced by the royals, but that the royals rarely choose to call out, and thus, allow to flourish in the broader culture," royal commentator Kristen Meinzer told Insider. 

"For example, Kate Middleton to some degree and Meghan Markle to an enormous extent were labeled 'social climbers' when they married into the royal family, despite the fact that Kate came from a family of self-made millionaires and Meghan was a self-made millionaire herself." 

To what extent do you think it is true?
