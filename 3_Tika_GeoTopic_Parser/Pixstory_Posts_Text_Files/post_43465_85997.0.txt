A global sanctions-tracking database released a list on Tuesday, which showed that Russia has become the most-sanctioned country after the Ukraine invasion. 

The database, Castellum.ai, is a managed search algorithm and workflow and record keeping suite that supports users via an online platform, API and bulk data.

It said that Russia has seen a surge in sanctions by the United States and its European allies starting February 22, days before the Ukraine invasion began.
