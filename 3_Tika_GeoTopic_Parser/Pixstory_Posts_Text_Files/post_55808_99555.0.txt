Indigenous Australians are said to have the oldest storytelling tradition in the world. It's no surprise that some of our best national storytellers, such Alexis Wright, Kim Scott, and Leah Purcell, are First Australians. The Guardian reported that the tradition's current guardians are experimenting with new styles and forms of expression, with inspirational and powerful outcomes. 

As Rebecca Slater writes, what excites everyone the most is the blending of Aboriginal cultural knowledge and dispossession experience with increasingly popular speculative fiction, as shown most recently on screen with Cleverman. Claire G Coleman's debut novel, Terra Nullius, developed as part of the State Library of Queensland's black&write initiative and published by Hachette, takes the investigation of this genre to the next level.

Slater further says that Coleman, like so many of  Indigenous writers, reveals how much our history – particularly dispossession and colonisation – is still with us now and is on the verge of becoming our future. Coleman, a Noongar lady from Western Australia's south coast, speaks to the heart of Australia's issue as a nation: how to universalize Indigenous people's experience so that all Australians may understand it. The hallmark of good fiction is that it transports us from our current reality to another. Coleman's writing does this in a captivating manner. This is only her first book; she has many more years of captivating reading ahead of her.
