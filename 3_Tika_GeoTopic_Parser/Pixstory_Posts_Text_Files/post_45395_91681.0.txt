Gary Neville praised Manchester United midfielder Fred, hailing him as a bright spot in an
otherwise disappointing season at Old Trafford.

The 29-year-old has been chastised throughout the season, but his standing has risen after the
arrival of Ralf Rangnick. After Bruno Fernandes' shot was parried into his path by Kasper
Schmeichel, Fred fired into the roof of the net to earn a draw for the Reds against Leicester City
on Saturday.

Under Rangnick, Fred seemed to have found a new lease on life, scoring goals and putting in a
series of outstanding displays. His equaliser against the Foxes on Saturday was his fourth of the
season, equaling his total from the previous three seasons combined.

"This season's been pretty good (for Fred), I think the game against Atletico Madrid which was a
desperately bad night for Manchester United, he was fantastic, particularly in that first half,"
Neville told Sky Sports. "But it's a pretty low bar this season for Manchester United but he (Fred)
can hold his head high."

Another player who can take positives from their performances this season is David de Gea.
However, the Reds have had a dismal season overall, as they are currently three points outside
of the Champions League spots

Manchester United's chances of returning to the Champions League next season were given
another blow on Saturday Night Football when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Leicester at Old
Trafford.

It might have been a lot worse for Ralf Rangnick's side, but James Maddison was denied a late
winner for the visitors after referee Andre Marriner disallowed his strike following a VAR review
after Kelechi Iheanacho fouled Raphael Varane .

United will keep fighting for a top-four spot, but it appears unlikely on this evidence, with the
team three points behind Arsenal in that coveted slot after two games. Leicester moved up to
ninth place, above Aston Villa, and the Europa Conference League remains a viable option for
silverware this season.
