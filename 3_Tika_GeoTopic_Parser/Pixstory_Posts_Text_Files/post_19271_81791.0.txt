Not long ago was when I wrote about how Antonio Conte and Tottenham Hotspur seemed to have found the trick going forward in the season. Looking at the improvement in the early days after his appointment, it felt like the race for top four would have another twist. But now everything seems to be the complete opposite with no club interested in actually acting on the situation and take advantage of it. We are in "that time of the season" literally, where no club wants to play well and look to qualify for Champions League. Tottenham are not any different.
Be it Conte or be it any other world class manager (Jose the most recent example), the North London club due to it's history and the present cannot he considered among the elites when we talk about the future. The term bottlers has kept haunting them since forever now, bar the seasons under Pochettino when they were constantly performing both on domestic and European level.
These recent performances and off field activities have resulted in the doubts of Antonio Conte's future as the manager. The managerial situation is in tatters as Levy failed to land Conte's transfer targets and now that is in a way affecting the on field results which is but obvious. 
If they fail to achieve the objectives set during the start of the season, it is highly likely Antonio Conte will depart as we are known about his previous stints, and me being an ardent Manchester United fan am looking at this situation closely and with sparkle in my eyes.
