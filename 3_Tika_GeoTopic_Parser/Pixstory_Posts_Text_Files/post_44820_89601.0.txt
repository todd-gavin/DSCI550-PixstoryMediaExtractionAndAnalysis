#12.  Jeremie Aliadiere

He's a club ambassador and the Legends' secret weapon at full-back, and he's a fixture on Arsenal's in-house matchday coverage. We're delighted to see he's back on the job market after openly discussing his post-playing career battle with depression.

The Czech's playing career hasn't ended yet. He's now signed with Piast Gliwice in Poland. He played for Bayer Leverkusen for a few years, Heerenveen for a few, and earned six caps for his country.

Stack earned his reputation at Barnet during a four-year stay at the Hive, and after spells at Kerala Blasters in India and Eastleigh, he qualified as a UEFA A & B player and goalie coach. Last year, he was named Watford's head of academy goalkeeping.


#9.  David Bentley

In 2006, he moved from Arsenal to Blackburn on a permanent basis, and then to Sp*rs for a large fee. He was a member of the England squad at one stage, but his form deteriorated and he was loaned out to Birmingham, West Ham, and, strangely enough, FC Rostov. He eventually retired at the age of 29 and says he has no regrets. That's all right.Â
