You won't deny admitting that graphic eyeliner trends are all excellent ways of adding quirkiness to your look.
Eye makeup trends always leave a mark, and graphic eyeliners are another attractive way to do it.
These are some graphic liners you must try.

Out Of Line -A dash of red lines on the eyelids and the lower lashline will ensure your eyes are making a statement without trying too hard. It will add a touch of quirk without putting in too much effort. To get this look, prime your eyes properly so that the red pops out well. Draw a dash with a red coloured pencil from the crease of your eyes to the point it touches your browbone. Use the same eyeliner to line the inner corner of your eyes. Finish the look with a generous layer of mascara.

Narrow Arrow -Try this look if you wish to play a little more with your artistic side. A graphic eyeliner looks like this is apt for a retro night or sunny brunch date. It adds a quirky little touch to your look bringing all the attention to your eyes.

Open Wing- If you are looking for a mix of classic and fun, an open-ended wing is your thing. We all love that flick of winged eyeliner. But what if we tell you there is a wing that never closes? The open-ended branch follows your crease line, making your eyes seem bigger.
