Former Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has quit his job as the CSKA Sofia manager after days following racist chants from own fans against a set of black players Pardew who has also the technical director of the club has left both jobs with immediate effect After losing in the Bulgaria cup final to rivals Levski Sofia last month CSKA players were targeted by fans ahead of a league match against Botev Plovdiv Four black players were subject to racist chants and had banana peels thrown at them The players initially refused to play but Pardew managed to convince them to see the match out The incident saw Pardew resign with assistant Alex Dyer In a statement put up on the club website Pardew said This group of organized racist fans are not the fans I want to coach the team in front of The events before and after the match against Botev Plovdiv were unacceptable not only for me but also for my assistant Alex Dyer and for my players Our players decided to play out of loyalty towards the club That s definitely not the right way for CSKA because such a club deserves a lot more I want to express my gratitude towards all true CSKA fans for their support and passion I also want to thank Grisha and Dani Ganchev for their efforts to bring the club forward despite all the challenges and circumstances It s been a privilege and honor to serve this great club Unfortunately my time here has come to an end Addressing the fans later on social media Pardew added I loved my time and the people in your beautiful capital and I will not end my relationship here I want to continue my initiative to provide free soccer balls and supplies to local schools and I would encourage any potential sponsor to contact the club More time with the ball from an early age will create better technical players and ultimately help revive the great football history of this country
