At the end of the daring match against Spezia finished Maurizio Sarri commented on the match decided by Francesco Acerbi the most discussed man in the Lazio house I&#39;m sorry that there is this strange situation with Acerbi a boy who always tries his best You can make a month good month bad The only way to protect him talk about it as little as possible then I hope it&#39;s a passing protest We made two mistakes on goals we are guilty But we remained lucid and overturned the match My permanence linked to accessing Europe From what he has the president said it seems like bullshit to me These rumors don&#39;t surprise me we had some problems that I hoped to solve faster but the team is growing Let&#39;s see if in twenty days we will all be happy
