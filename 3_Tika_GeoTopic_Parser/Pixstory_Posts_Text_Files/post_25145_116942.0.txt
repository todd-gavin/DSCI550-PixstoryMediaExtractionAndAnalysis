1. Rinnegan – Naruto

There are many destructive and powerful eyes in anime series of Naruto & Naruto Shippuden and it’s hard to pick only one among them. Still, if it comes down to one then nothing is more dangerous than the Rinnegan which is considered as an eye that holds the power of the gods. This eye is the very definition of overpowered and stands at the pinnacle of strength & rarity.

Regarded as one of the most powerful abilities in the entirety of Naruto, the Rinnegan grants the user the potential to see chakra flow without having to use chakra itself to work. With skills like the Six Paths Technique, the user can attract and repel objects, master any jutsu, extract souls, and even resurrect the deceased. This eye has been wielded only by a handful of talented shinobi ninjas – Pain, Ōtsutsuki, Sasuke, Obito, and Madara Uchiha.
