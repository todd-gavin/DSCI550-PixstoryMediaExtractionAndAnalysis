Donations, protests, and other forms of engagement are among Hollywood's responses to climate warming. However, it appears to be losing out on a close-by approach. 

According to a new analysis of 37,453 film and TV scripts from 2016 to 2020, only 2.8 percent of screen fiction relates to climate change-related phrases. On Tuesday, a blueprint for reversing this trend was released. 

According to Anna Jane Joyner, editor-in-chief of the playbook and founder of Good Energy, a nonprofit consultancy, "Good Energy: A Playbook for Screenwriting in the Age of Climate Change" was created with input from more than 100 film and television writers.

“A big hurdle that we encountered was that writers were associating climate stories with apocalypse stories,” she said in an interview. “The main purpose of the playbook is to expand that menu of possibilities....to a larger array of how it would be showing up in our real life.”

HDTech reported that Leonardo DiCaprio, Jane Fonda, Don Cheadle, and Shailene Woodley are among the celebrities who have sounded the climate alarm. DiCaprio also starred in "Don't Look Up," an Oscar-nominated film from 2021 in which a comet rushing toward an unconcerned Earth serves as a metaphor for the dangers of climate change complacency. 

The playbook, on the other hand, asks writers and industry leaders to examine a number of less-direct techniques, with examples and resources given, according to Joyner.
