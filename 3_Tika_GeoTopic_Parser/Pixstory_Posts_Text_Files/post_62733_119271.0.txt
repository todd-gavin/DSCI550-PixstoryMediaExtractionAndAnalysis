Reading is extremely relaxing mentally. It's a great way to take your mind off your troubles and put it into another world that you can escape from. It can also improve your concentration and memory, which is why you'll be able to recall things better when you're reading.

It, additionally, improves your vocabulary, strengthening your writing abilities. This makes it easier for you to express yourself in a clear and concise manner when you write reports or essays.

It also enhances your knowledge, increasing the amount of information that you have stored away in your brain. You'll be able to answer questions more confidently and recall facts from other areas of study. You'll also be able to use previous knowledge in new ways by applying what you've learned from one subject or area of study to other areas of knowledge too!

Reading has been shown to promote creativity in children as well as adults, so if you're not already reading regularly then this could be one of the most important things that you do with your time!
