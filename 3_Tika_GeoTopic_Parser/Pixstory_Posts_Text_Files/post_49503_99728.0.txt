The debate on whether or not human cloning should be allowed keeps getting interesting, people come up with several takes to justify their standpoint. But first of all, what is cloning?

Cloning is a sort of genetic engineering in which cells from one organism are used to make a genetically identical second living organism. According to ThoughtCo, It took 277 unsuccessful embryo implantations to produce Dolly the Sheep, and clones tend to age rapidly and experience other health problems. So it's safe to say, artificial cloning isn't a perfect invention as yet.

I personally don't think human cloning should be a thing. First of all, we've toyed with nature enough as is. Not to mention, we've tried this with cross breeding in animals before. Thousands of animals die or suffer throughout their lives because some human thought it'd be fun to mix their parents' breeds. Clones age rapidly and can have severe health problems. Bringing a human to life only to make them live with chronic illnesses, pain and disabilities is inhumane and cruel. Especially, given how our system works, which does not give two hoots about its people. Those 'clones' would suffer and won't even be tended to. The lack of proper childcare, healthcare, house security, food security and whatnot. There's a need for a lot of science going into a lot of stuffâ€”and cloning is not one of them. The insane amounts of funds that go into this unnecessary cruelty could be put to some great use. I mean, people are dying from starvation and diseases but there's no money for them. On an organizational level, those funds should be directed to the betterment of existing people. When we've achieved that, we can probably take money for such things that are not necessary and most likely, dangerous for the world. We don't need to bring people to life only to make it a living hell for them.
