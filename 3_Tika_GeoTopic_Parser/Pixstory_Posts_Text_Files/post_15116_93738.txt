About meters of ice hidden by a blanket of stones in the shadow of the walls of the Gran Sasso And what remains of the Calderone the southernmost glacial body in Europe and the only one in the Apennines according to the data provided by the ground penetrating radar which has covered its surface in recent days in the area of a survey and collection campaign of in situ ice samples If the Calderone ice cores prove to be a sufficiently preserved archive, they could aspire to be kept for decades in the sanctuary of suffering mountain glaciers which will be created by the international Ice Memory initiative co conceived and coordinated in Italy by Carlo Barbante director of the Institute of polar sciences of the National Research Council Cnr Isp and professor at the Ca Foscari University of Venice The research activity on the Gran Sasso organized by Cnr Isp and the Ca Foscari University of Venice in collaboration with experts from National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology Ingv of the University of Padua and the company Engeoneering Srls was made possible thanks to the Department of Firefighters public aid and civil defense which provided helicopters and specialized personnel to reach the glacier basin safely at the foot of Corno Grande at a height of meters A first radar profile elaborated by INGV researchers revealed a clear photograph under the debris there is a part of ice mixed with stones and then a few meters of apparently cleaner ice This is the clearest photograph ever taken of the depths of the former glacier, today a glaciated Calderone The processing of all the data collected through radar and electromagnetic surveys is providing glaciologists with useful information for choosing the most promising point in which to take a deep ice core According to recent estimates the Calderone loses every year an average of one meter thick The reduction in the volume of ice still present in the next few years could deprive the area of a precious source of water accumulation says Carlo Barbante In addition to water, information on the environment and the climate of the past are also in danger preserves and scientists are able to interpret
