People often forget that the central message of the Bible is that God loves us He gave his only son for the salvation of mankind I have always believed that God would want us to love him rather than fear him He is our father Why would he want us to be unhappy People are often trapped in marriages wherein their partner cheats on them and does not fulfil the vows of holy matrimony The foundation of any marriage is trust and respect and if this is absent the bond ceases to be holy This is not only my personal opinion but also what the Bible says Many people are curious about what the Bible has to say about divorce Marriage is considered as a life long vow between partners in Christianity While many people assume this indicates God despises divorce and Christian divorce is generally frowned upon this isn t the case Unfaithfulness Matthew and maltreatment are examples of biblical reasons for divorce Exodus Matthew says that And I say unto you Whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery Exodus says that If he marries another woman he must not deprive the first one of her food clothing and marital rights A If he does not provide her with these three things she is to go free without any payment of money Therefore one should not use to name of God to justify their prejudices for divorce and let people decide themselves whatever course is best for their marriage
