As a Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner PMHNP I will write prescriptions As a nurse I ve given thousands of medications I ve seen medical treatment change lives I believe in science I believe in using your resources Medications are a powerful and effective support for mental health You know what else is powerful and effective Therapy A balanced diet Healthy movement Sleep Mindfulness Social connectedness Nurture your mental health from multiple angles Take no shame if meds are a part of the strategy l often compare medication to a step stool that allows clients to see the work on the table Sometimes you need a little support to get the most out of your therapy work school and life A Taking medications shows forethought responsibility and ownership never weakness Medications target symptoms not you You are more than a diagnosis Don t let symptoms get in the way of achieving all you are capable of Source mindfulcounceling
