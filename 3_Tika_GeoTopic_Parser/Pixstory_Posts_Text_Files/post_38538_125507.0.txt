Ajax have been credited for bringing world class superstars, be it the Immortal Johan Cyruff, or the prolific Marco Van Basten or the technical Dennis Bergkamp or Edwin Van Der Sar. Similarly, there is a new breed of players who are emerging and some of them were being molded into legends by ex- manager Erik Ten Hag. One such player who gets the recognition is ex-Ajax player Hakim Ziyech. 


Ajax made it to the Champions League semi-final run in the 2018-19 season and a part of it was down to Ziyech’s contributions, where he made 24 contributions in 11 matches he played. It put him 3 behind Lionel Messi,and 10 more than Mohamed Salah. He was an important cog in 4-4 draw with Chelsea in the 2019/20 Champions League.


The Blues, under the leadership of Frank Lampard, being impressed with his performance bought him in the 2020-21 season. He rebuilt a young team by bringing the likes of Timo Werner,Kai Havertz,Edouard Mendy,Thiago Silva and Ben Chillwell,and the most exciting of the lot was Hakim Ziyech. 


With Lampard being fired he was replaced by Thomas Tuchel and under the German’s leadership, they won the Champions League, Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. 


Manchester United are having a bad transfer window. Even Though they managed to rope in Christian Eriksen,Tyrell Malacia and Lisandro Martinez, they are short in certain positions, such as right-back, defensive midfielder and a right-winger and Cristiano Ronaldo.


We can see from his season map as to why Man United want Ziyech and what he’ll add to the team. We can see from his seasonal heatmap as to where he made passes, shots, crosses, dribbles and so on. He likes to operate down the right-wing, cutting inside and creating threats. 

Passing


He made a total of 1280 passes out of which 543 were completed passes. Ziyech attempted 737 passes. He made 9 smart passes. The player put in 32 passes into the penalty box and he likes to pass mostly down the right-wing.
