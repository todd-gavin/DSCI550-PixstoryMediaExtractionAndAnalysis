Unfortunately it was not possible to take photos or videos, I&#39;ll say it right away I never know if it&#39;s because the photos and flashes risk ruining priceless paintings or if it&#39;s just a commercial issue but so many memories of what I&#39;ve seen will only be in my eyes and I will not be able to share them. I suggest if you are in northern Italy or happen to visit Palazzo Martinengo and the Women in Art exhibition in the meantime, there is an unpublished Magdalene by Titian never exhibited in Italy before and then over masterpieces by artists such as Guercino Pitocchetto Appiani Hayez Corcos Zandomeneghi and Boldini who with their works have been able to represent personality, refinement, character, sensuality and the most subtle nuances of the female hemisphere, paying particular attention to fashion, hairstyles and accessories typical of every era and geographical context The exhibition itinerary is divided into eight thematic sections Saints and biblical heroines Mythology in pink and ancient history Portraits of women Still life for women Maternity Work Daily life Nude and sensuality
