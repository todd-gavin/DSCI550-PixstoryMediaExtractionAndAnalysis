On the last Sunday in February, the United States celebrated "National Women's Day," while Russia celebrated "International Women's Day" for the first time on the last Saturday in February in 1913. (albeit based on the Julian calendar, as in the Gregorian calendar, the date was March 8). 

For the first time in Germany, International Women's Day was celebrated on March 8, 1914, presumably because it was a Sunday. As in other countries, Germany's commemoration focused on women's right to vote, which German women did not achieve until 1918. Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of Charing Cross station on her way to speak at Trafalgar Square during a march in London in favour of women's suffrage at the same time.

Archives tells us that women textile workers in Petrograd staged a demonstration that eventually enveloped the entire city on March 8, 1917, on the Julian calendar, demanding "Bread and Peace"â€”an end to World War I, food shortages, and czarism. This was the start of the February Revolution, which, along with the October Revolution, comprised Russia's second revolution. 

"International Woman's Day" was observed on February 23rd (8th March) and gatherings and actions were planned, according to revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky. But we had no idea that this 'Women's Day' would be the beginning of the revolution. Revolutionary events were predicted, but no timeframe was given. Despite the orders to the contrary, textile employees quit their jobs in numerous factories in the morning and dispatched delegates to plead for help.
