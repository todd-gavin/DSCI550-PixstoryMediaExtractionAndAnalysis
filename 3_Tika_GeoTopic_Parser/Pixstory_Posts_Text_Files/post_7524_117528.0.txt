Maruti Suzuki India has unveiled their latest SUV the 'Grand Vitara'. Maruti was falling behind in the SUV segment for some time since the discontinuation of the same vehicle in 2015. While it's ancestor was a massive SUV with a bigger engine of 2.4 litre, the new one seems to be a small and budgeted car.

The new Grand Vitara will be offered with two engine options in India. It will get a 1.5-litre petrol engine with strong hybrid tech. It produces 91 bhp & 122 Nm while the electric motor develops 79 bhp & 141 Nm. The combined output of this powertrain is rated at 114 bhp.

Marutiâ€™s latest flagship SUV will also get a 1.5-litre mild-hybrid petrol engine that will develop 101 bhp and 136.8 Nm of peak torque. The engine will come with a 5-speed MT & a 6-speed AT and the manual variants will get an optional AWD system as well. 

Bookings for the vehicle are open now whereas it will officially launch in September. It will rival the likes of Seltos, Creta, Kushaq and Taigun.
