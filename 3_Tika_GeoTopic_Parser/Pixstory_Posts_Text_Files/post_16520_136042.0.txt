It was on September 2, 2021, when the entire glamour world stood in shock with the news of actor Sidharth Shukla’s death. The 40-year-old had suffered a cardiac arrest and bid adieu to the world. Amid his friends, family and colleagues, the most affected one was his ladylove, Shehnaaz Gill, who still can’t get over the most painful truth of her life.

September 2, 2022, marks Sidharth Shukla’s first death anniversary and his family got together for a prayer meet with Brahma Kumaris for the departed soul. A fan page shared pictures of Sidharth’s mother, Rita Shukla, his sisters and a few other family members attending the prayer meet and distributing prasad.
