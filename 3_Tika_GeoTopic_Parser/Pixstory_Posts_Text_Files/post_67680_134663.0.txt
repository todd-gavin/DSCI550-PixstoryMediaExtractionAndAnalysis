The Lakshmi Vilas Palace in Vadodara, Gujarat, India, was constructed by the Gaekwad family, a prominent Maratha family, who ruled the Baroda State. Major Charles Mant was credited to be the main architect of the palace.
This time Friends society held a sports event for students from the MS University. It was an aquathon cum triathlon and the volunteers had the responsibility to host the entire event along with several departmental responsibilities. 
One thing that I have learnt during my days as a volunteer in this NGO is that taking up the position of an in-charge in any activity not only increases leadership qualities but also boosts up one's confidence level which comes handy later on in life. 
A hectic yet a fun day indeed!!
