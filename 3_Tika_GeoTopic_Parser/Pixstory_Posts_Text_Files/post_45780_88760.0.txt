Just when I thought global warming is going to kill us all, NASA is at our rescue. We just have to make a couple of changes in our city!

According to climate scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York, rooftop gardens and vegetation can help alleviate some of the city's extreme heat. Researchers have advocated for the replacement of black tar and other dark-colored roofing materials with bright, Sun-reflecting surfaces or "green roofs" with plant cover for decades. They've now used publicly available satellite data to assess the effectiveness of these improvements. 

NASA TV said that the urban heat island effect is a phenomena in which heat is enhanced or amplified in cities. Because asphalt, concrete, and other similar surfaces absorb and hold more heat than vegetation, temperatures in urban areas are frequently 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than those in neighbouring suburbs or rural areas.

This heat disproportionately affects older persons, low-income populations, and some communities of colour in neighbourhoods with fewer trees and green spaces. 

Green roofs are used to reduce the temperature in urban areas by utilising the cooling effect of plants. Greenery can be extensive (shallow soil, low-maintenance plants) or intensive (high-maintenance plants) (deeper soil, more diverse plants and trees). 

The GISS team looked at three locations in Chicago to investigate how green roofs affected surface temperatures around the buildings, as well as whether there was a difference between those locations and others nearby that didn't have green roofs. Two of three green roofs in the study reduced temperatures!

So, go “Green”!
