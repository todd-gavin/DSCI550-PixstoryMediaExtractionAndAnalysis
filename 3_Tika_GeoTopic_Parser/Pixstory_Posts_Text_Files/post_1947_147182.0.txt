Charter Communications, one of the largest telecommunications in the world lost a lawsuit against the estate of an 83 year old woman who was robbed and stabbed to death by a Charter vanel technician who was off duty but wearing his uniform and in his Charter van.What might be even shocking about this case than the fact that someone was murdered is the fact that the jury awarded the woman’s estate $7 billion. That’s right: billion.On appeal, the judge lowered the award to $1.15 billion. Though significantly less, still an extremely large sum. To put that into perspective, in the infamous case against Johnson & Johnson, where they were found to have known their talcum powder was causing ovarian cancer in women, the jury awarded 22 plaintiffs $4.69 billion which was reduced to $2.12 billion on appeal.
