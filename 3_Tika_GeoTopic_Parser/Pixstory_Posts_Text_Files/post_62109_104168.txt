Rafael Nadal was full of emotion following his four set victory over Novak Djokovic Tuesday night at Roland Garros in an evenly matched quarter final until Nadal emerged victorious A match that was dubbed as KING OF CLAY COURT vs KINGSLAYER it certainly lived up to its hype The story was quite simple both men were eyeing retribution Nadal wished to avenge his loss at Madrid where Novak handed him a defeat on clay court in straight sets While Novak wanted to face the man who conquered the Australian Open when he wasn t present to defend his title A rivalry for the ages and it couldn t have had a better set up for its next chapter Nadal faced a lot of difficulties in build up to Roland Garros which included a six week recovery from a rib fracture and continued issues with his chronic foot injury Instead of focusing on that he preferred to look ahead to the opportunity he has afforded himself He s now two wins away from claiming his th Roland Garros title and his nd major crown both of which would extend his own records Nadal is confident in his ability to recharge mentally and emotionally for his Friday meeting with Alexander Zverev The Spaniard will also take full advantage of his two rest days after winning a pair of four plus hour matches against Djokovic Nadal also talked about Roger Federer The Big Three were level on Grand Slam titles until Nadal s January triumph at the Australian Open Between Novak Roger myself we have an amazing story together facing each other in the most important matches for such a long time So that makes things more special and more emotional From my perspective the level of us three is very equal It s not much difference so it doesn t matter Although Nadal was kind enough to include his rivals in the debate the records as they stand favour Nadal in the debate of the GOATs As reported by sports Illustrated
