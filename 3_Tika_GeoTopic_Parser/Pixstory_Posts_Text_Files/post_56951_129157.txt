If a lot of it has changed it wouldn t always be one side of the story to narrate However I think some past instances and occurrences have brought this cruelty to parents behaviour When I speak of parents here it s not about every parent of course it s not about every teacher either Blaming it all on parents would not be the right thing to do I mean yes some parents don t appreciate their child s teacher at all they would say mean things and even disrespect their efforts but what about the teachers who don t pay attention to the child s growth at all If we are discussing the teacher parent relationships and what only teachers have to endure then discussing classroom behaviour is equally important Always complaining about the child s behaviour and demotivating them in front of the class is as inappropriate as the parent s way of dealing with some good teachers It s the tutor s role in a classroom to not make some children feel marginalized but since there are the ones who have done it this has made parents question the teacher in certain unacceptable ways It could be mean and impertinent but what they care about is their children because half of the time child spends in school and that s where they can adapt good or bad from the environment So if we are arguing over parents behaviour then teachers behaviour should also be paid attention to
