In the wake of the recent release of numerous controversial Supreme Court decisions, a great deal of hatred has been directed at the Supreme Court justices, particularly Justice Thomas. Since 2011, Justice Thomas has taught a constitutional law course at the law school of George Washington University. In response to his controversial horns, a change.org petition demanding his termination was created. 

As of this writing, 11,000 people have signed the petition. However, the law school at George Washington University has only about 1,700 students. This means that thousands of individuals who do not currently attend the school are attempting to prevent students from enrolling in a class taught by a Supreme Court Justice.

Thankfully, the school administration publicly and categorically rejected these calls for his dismissal. 

There have also been reports that alumni are threatening to withhold their donations if the organization continues to operate. This is arguably the most despicable act. Alumni with deep pockets are attempting to use their money to intimidate a school they no longer attend in order to deny current students the opportunity to be taught by a member of the United States Supreme Court. In other words, it doesn’t matter if the students actually want to be taught by him because the alumni don’t want him to teach.
