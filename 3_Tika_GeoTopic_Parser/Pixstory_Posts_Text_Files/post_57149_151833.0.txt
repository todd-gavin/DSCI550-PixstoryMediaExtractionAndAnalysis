Social anxiety can stem from anything so, merely an incident to something that is like a bad memory.
There is not one reason or cause to justify it; instead, there are countless things that insinuate social phobia.
It could be inherited from family; if the family history contains people who have endured social phobia problems, then it could be the chances of a child also adopting it from the behaviour and surroundings.
Although it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learnt behaviour.
If seen with the biological sight, then we can delve more into the brain structure. For example, a system in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-duh) might play a role in controlling the fear response. Conversely, people with an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations.
Besides all other reasons, social anxiety is a learned behaviour; some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behaviour in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children.
