At the Los Angeles Lakers look like a team that could be active around the trade deadline as they try to salvage their season The Lakers have gotten strong play from LeBron James the past month but the team as a whole has largely struggled which has put real doubt that they can turn into a championship contending squad any time soon Because they have largely underwhelmed Los Angeles is primed for a trade and recent reports have already pegged them as a buyer So far the Lakers have been linked to players like Myles Turner and Jerami Grant but another name that made sense was Cam Reddish R eddish was eventually traded to the New York Knicks for Kevin Knox and a first round pick but it appears the Lakers also tried to pry him away from the Atlanta Hawks Reddish has been rumored to be on the move for a couple of months because of the Hawks own struggles and his skillset as a wing would have been perfect for the Lakers Los Angeles has been starved for more size on the perimeter and Reddish would have been a seamless fit next to the Big of LeBron James Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook However even though the Lakers may have missed out on Reddish there are still targets for them to chase after in the coming weeks At this point it seems as though a move for L A is inevitable but it remains to be seen who they can get with their limited assets While adding talent is the first priority for the Lakers their next focus should be to try and open up roster spots in the event someone becomes available via the buyout market Kent Bazemore and DeAndre Jordan have been excised from the rotation and it appears the front office is willing to move the veterans to make room on the team
