India beat Australia by six wickets. 
What a game.
It is Hardik Pandya who defeated short third man to squeeze this wide delivery from Sams for a four. What a match we have had here, what a way to end an absolutely thrilling series. 
What a chase it has been.  
 Virat and Suryakumar Yadav have sent the Australians running for cover after the end of the powerplay. 
The pair put up 104 runs off just 62 balls for the third wicket before Suryakumar fell to Josh Hazlewood after blazing 69 off 36 balls. Kohli has since gone on to score his eighth half century against Australia. The visitors are defending a target of 187, which they got to thanks to blazing half centuries from Cameron Green and Tim David. They would have scored much more had it not been for Axar Patel and the rest of the Indian bowlers putting the breaks on the innings after Green fell in the powerplay.
