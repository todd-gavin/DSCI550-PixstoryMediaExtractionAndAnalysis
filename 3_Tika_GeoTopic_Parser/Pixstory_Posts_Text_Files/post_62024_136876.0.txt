This was one of those afternoons when, for Chelsea and Thomas Tuchel, any win would do. They duly got it despite a laboured performance and now that their extravagant transfer business has been completed they can feel justified in plugging the line that the season starts here.
The most slow-burning of affairs ended in near-chaos and with West Ham fuming at the disallowing of what seemed a perfectly good equaliser from Maxwel Cornet.
Kai Havertz had only just put Chelsea ahead, volleying in smartly at the near post after a fine cross from fellow substitute Ben Chilwell, when Édouard Mendy dived in to clear at the feet of Jarrod Bowen. The keeper could only knock into the path of Cornet, who finished emphatically.
West Ham celebrated but their joy was curtailed when Andrew Madley was summoned to his monitor. VAR had correctly spotted that in his follow-through Bowen clipped Mendy but the contact was slight and, in any case, the ball had already squirted several yards away and Mendy’s chances of correcting his error were slim.
The goal looked good, even when slowed down to the kind of speed that warps too many decisions, but Madley opted to chalk it off and West Ham were rightly incensed.
“It was a ridiculously bad decision,” said David Moyes, who went to see Madley afterwards. “I don’t want an explanation from them as it would have been a tough one to give. I don’t think anyone could justify that.
