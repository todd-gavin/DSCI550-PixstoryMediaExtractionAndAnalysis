Dominance. One word to describe this match report and performance by Arsenal.In my pre-match thoughts, I stated we needed to match the intensity of Brentford to impose our game-plan, and we did more than that. The first minute was a clue into the trend of the game. We started with the possession at the feet of our back four plus Partey, teasing Brentford into a hopeful press. A few passes to suck the opposition front-line created a gap to create a move which involved Martinelli and Granit Xhaka to produce the first half-chance of the match. First signs of our confidence.Arsenal needed to respond to their last league defeat of the season and what a brilliant start provided by the solid William Saliba. Set pieces have been an asset for the club in the last 12 months for the club, with Saka sending in a lovely floated corner which Saliba flicked on from the front-post. We've done this before, and the goals tally from set-pieces continue to increase.Jesus wrapped up the first half performance with a lovely headed finish, but it will be Fabio Vieira's goal which will definitely be on-repeat as a highlight. Vieira started in his first PL start of the season, in the place of Martin Ã˜degaard. In my previous analysis of Vieira, there were signs he may be shot-hungry if he can find a yard of space - and what a lovely strike to start his Arsenal career. Saka once again the provider, finds Vieira in space - who cleverly shifted to finesse a left-foot curler, only to catch Raya out. It's the quality in the shot, and I think we'll see more of that.Other stand-out performers included Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey, with the latter reminding us how integral he is to the system in the #6 role. Constantly receiving and recycling possession - he is the clubs Rolls-Royce in midfield.We now go into the international break in good spirits, with a league game against Spurs up next. We are ready to entertain their visit.
