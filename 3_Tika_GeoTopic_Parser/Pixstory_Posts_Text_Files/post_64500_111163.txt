Stranger Things it s been my favorite show for a very long time now I always knew its popular show but never watched it until I had the Netflix subscription At first I wasn t in favor of the show but I decided to give it a try The first few seconds of the show seemed very horrific and I thought that this show was not for me but I gave it some time and soon fell in love with eleven I love watching powerful female characters I also loved the idea of all the characters coming together and fighting the battle against the upside down I love the way Eleven evolves with the show and she creates new relationships with people she meets along with her and Hopper I like the way Hopper adops Eleven like his daughter They have beautifully depicted that non blood relations can be very strong bonds I also love the s vibes the clothes and the music depicted in the show Now the last season is about to come I m very excited because I can t wait to watch it
