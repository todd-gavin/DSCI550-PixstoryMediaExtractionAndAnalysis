Chelsea Handler and Jo Koy recorded a video they had planned to share on their one-year anniversary. But upon posting it to Instagram, the comedians revealed they have broken up. 
Posting a video they had recorded ahead of the major milestone to Instagram July 18, the former Chelsea Lately host revealed they have "decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now." 
Handler thanked her fans for the love and support she and Koy received during their time together. "I know many of you were invested in our love, and I wanted to express to you how much that meant to both of us," she wrote. "How much it still means. And how much I now believe in love for each one of us."

And she had nothing but wonderful things to say about her ex. "This man blew my heart open with love and because of him, my life experience has changed forever," the comedian continued. "To be loved and adored by jokoy has been one of the greatest gifts of my life. He renewed my faith in men, in love, in being 100% who I am, and I've never been more optimistic for the future. Jo- you blew my creativity open, my lust for working hard again, being on the road again, and you reminded me who I was and always have been, and my feet have never been more firmly planted in the ground."
Handler also noted Koy will always have a special place in her heart and that she wishes him nothing but the best.  

"This is not an ending. It's another beginning, and it's a comfort to know that I am still loved and love this man the way the sun loves the moon and the moon loves the sun," she added. "YOUR PERSON IS COMING. So, please continue to root for both of us, because you never know what life will bring and let's first start by all going to the theater on August 5th to buy tickets to Jo's new movie EASTER SUNDAY and Filipino PRIDE! Let's go!"
