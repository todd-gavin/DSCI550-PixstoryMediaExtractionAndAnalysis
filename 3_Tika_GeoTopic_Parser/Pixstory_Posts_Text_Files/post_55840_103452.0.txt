Clive James is a writer, journalist, critic, poet, and broadcaster, with a wealth of wit and language that has made him a favourite of many. James was born in Sydney and given the name Vivian, but he was subsequently allowed to alter it because it was perceived as a female name, prompting him to pick Clive. 

His memoirs, in particular, are noted for their sardonic character, and his own affiliations and acquaintances with some of the most iconic cultural luminaries of the twentieth century make them a fascinating read.

As per Booktopia, we follow little Clive on his journey from boyhood to the threshold of manhood in the first instalment of Clive James' memoirs, when his days of wearing short trousers are finally behind him. Clive's exploits growing up in the suburbs of post-war Sydney are hair-raising, riotous, and almost too good to be true, as he battles school, girls, assorted family, and an overpowering ambition to be a superhero... 

Unreliable Memoirs is an amusing and moving introduction to the biography of a national treasure, told with James' unmistakable sense of humour and self-effacing charm. This classic book, a million-copy hit, is a celebration of life in all its unpredictability.
