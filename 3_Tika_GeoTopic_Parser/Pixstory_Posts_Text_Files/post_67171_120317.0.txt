Mig 21 is a supersonic fighter and interceptor aircraft,  designed by Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau of Soviet Union. It is one of the most- produced supersonic jet aircrafts in aviation
 history.
        India is the largest operator of Mig 21s. In 1961, India purchased Mig 21. In 1964, it became the first supersonic fighter jet to enter
 the service with IAF. It played an important role in Indo-Pak wars of 1965, 1971 and 1999 Kargil War. In 2001, an IAF Mig 21 shot down a Pakistan Navy's Atlantc aircraft over Rann of Kutch in Gujarat,  India. IAF Mig 21 Bison aircraft  also shot down a PAF F-16 aircraft during the 2019 Indo-Pak skirmish in Jammu and Kashmir. 
   As of 2019, India is operating around 113 Mig 21s. But because of high number of crashes, it is also known as the Flying Coffin. 
       According to the Government of India, starting from September 2022, all the remaining Mig 21s will be phased out by 2025. 
         I think it should be phased out early and replaced by Tejas. We can't afford loss of our talented pilots.
