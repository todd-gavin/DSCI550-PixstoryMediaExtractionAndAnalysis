Celebrities' lookalikes often grab the attention of social media and here’s another one who resembles our Cutie Alia bhatt.😍🐣💗
Bengaluru’s Roshni Sony shared videos on Instagram, which reminded people of the actor. Many also call her ‘chhoti Alia.’🌻
From similar facial expressions to haircut and smile, Roshni undoubtedly can confuse anyone as Alia.😍👏
 In one of her posts, she recreated Alia’s iconic ivory wedding look. In another reel, she enacted a line from Gangubai Kathiawadi. She also posted a parody clip of herself addressing claims of her resemblance with the actor. It read, “How do you resemble Alia Bhatt so much?”
The video has now crossed 70K views on the photo-sharing app. 
“Even before I got the show, I wouldn’t want to be identified as someone else. Alia is my favourite actor.😌🤌 I admire her a lot. I find her cute. If someone is saying that I resemble her, I find it overwhelming.💗 Up to that, it’s fine. But the moment it starts converting your identity, it becomes problematic. I don’t think anyone wants it. I would be very happy if people start calling me Rajjo instead of Alia. Because being Rajjo is my identity and not someone's doppelganger,” she told referring to her character Rajjo from her first TV show.💗🌼
