A dog is more than simply a pet; it may be your best friend, your partner in crime, and a companion who will always be by your side. It's one of the most incredible feelings in the world to see your dog enjoying the life you gave him. 
They are not only trustworthy, but they also have the best emotions. They'll always express gratitude for what you've done for them. By sitting with you, playing with you, sleeping with you, and making hilarious faces to demand treats and food, they will keep your morale strong. 
A dog can completely turn your life around; you'll always grin as you watch your dog enjoy the life you've given him. There is a very famous quote on internet that “ you are truly blessed if a dog comes in your life “ which according to me is 100% true .
