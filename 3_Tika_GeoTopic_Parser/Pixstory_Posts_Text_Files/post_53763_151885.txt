The Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for has been awarded to Svante P bo from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig Germany for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution In other words P bo has been awarded the prestigious prize for having sequenced the genomes of our extinct relatives the Neanderthals and Denisovans and for the fact that these discoveries have resulted in novel insights into human evolution P bo is widely regarded as having pioneered the field of ancient DNA a research area dedicated to the recovery and analysis of DNA from historic and prehistoric remains Although P bo did his PhD in medical science at Uppsala University in Sweden in the early s he also studied Egyptology when he was at Uppsala It was a logical next step that he took tools from molecular biology garnered from his expertise in medical science to better understand human prehistory Extracting DNA from ancient bonesBeginning in the s P bo studied ancient DNA in material ranging from mummified humans to extinct ground sloths This work was technically challenging because ancient DNA is significantly degraded and can be contaminated In the decade that followed he developed a series of methods and guidelines to recover and interpret authentic DNA and to minimise the risk of contamination from modern sources especially from contemporary humans In the early s there was significant excitement in the field about the possibility of recovering DNA from dinosaurs However based on his knowledge on how DNA degrades over time P bo remained sceptical that DNA could survive such a long time He was later proven right For many of his colleagues it was clear that P bo s goal was always to recover Neanderthal DNA But he took his time and carefully developed the methods for recovering and authenticating ancient DNA until these methods were mature enough to accomplish this objective Finally in P bo and his colleagues published the first Neanderthal DNA sequences Read more
