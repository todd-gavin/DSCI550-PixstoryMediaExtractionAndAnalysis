Seeing the title , this question , what comes to your mind?

Hate? 
Hate for men?
If your somewhat progressive then,
Rights?
Women's right?

But let's take a deeper look at the meaning of feminism !

Feminism is not only for women's right.
Feminism is idea of having equal rights and equal access to opportunities irrespective of gender, means equality!

So do we need to have any problem from equality?

If not , then why it is hated?

Maybe because of a few people who use it in wrong way!

But that should not change our views towards equality.

I know there exists people who don't even know it's meaning , play victim card in the name of it.

These type of people also should understand that because of their these small action , large group is suffering.

But that doesn't give anyone right to take other person's rights.

I hope you loved reading it!
Thank you
