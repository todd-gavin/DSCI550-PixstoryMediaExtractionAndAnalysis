A large part of the credit also goes to boxing legend Mike Tyson, who makes a cameo appearance in the film and makes his Bollywood debut. The entire Liger team was preoccupied with the promotional campaign. During one of the events, Vijay Devarakonda spoke about his experience working on the sets of Liger with one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. In an interview with the news agency IANS, Vijay Devarakonda revealed that Tyson abused him "lovingly" on the set. "He abused me a lot in English, albeit lovingly, and I can't even remember what he said to me." "But, yes, I had fun with him," he was quoted as saying.
