Hello everyone! This is my first post here so it will be more of like an introduction. 
My name is Poorva Narang, a happy to go lucky person who loves singing and listening to music. I'm an extrovert and love interacting with people. I'm a huge Kdrama, Kpop and anime lover so feel free to ask for suggestions! 
I constantly search for opportunities that can help me prosper vigorously & holistically. I have always been an academically oriented person. 
Besides that, I have always been very active in every kind of co-curricular activity in my school and got many opportunities to lead a team, manage a number of events, work with local environment societies, raise awareness about different social issues, etc. 
I prefer playing guitar, journaling and playing badminton when I am not doing something to make my professional life better.
