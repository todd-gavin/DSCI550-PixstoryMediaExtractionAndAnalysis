They say women should cover themselves why Who gave you the right to force women to do this They say this is God s law Well I understand that everyone accepted the God you are talking about but there is so much talk and discussion about this ruling and how to do it they say no this is God s ruling they are so confident that It is as if they have just come from God Why Because it is wrapped in so many layers of ignorance that there is not even the smallest opening left for the sun of reason and wisdom to shine into them And Today small children and babies are wrapped in diapers due to a simple need that is small children cannot have control over their emptying and urinating because the nerve fibers related to this action have not developed well in them and sensitivity And they have not found the necessary intelligence But after two or three years healthy children no longer need diapers The element of time has made such a change possible Cleanliness and hygiene is the principle not wearing diapers or not sometimes the same principle requires you to wear diapers sometimes the same principle requires you not to do this Mr Legislature Covering or not covering women is not God s law God s law is order beauty security human dignity contract growth fertility justice and fairness etc Covering not covering how to organize a family political system etc must be made in the light of these laws changing conditions changes the way and form of things because those are the appropriate laws The conditions of human life change with the passage of time God s laws guide us to how to change with changing conditions how to shape our institutions and social contracts so that God s laws which are actually honor and principles of existence are respected Because the good of all lies in moving according to these laws to deviate from these laws is to go to the abyss of ignorance poverty helplessness and destruction God s laws are abstract values that are understood from existence
