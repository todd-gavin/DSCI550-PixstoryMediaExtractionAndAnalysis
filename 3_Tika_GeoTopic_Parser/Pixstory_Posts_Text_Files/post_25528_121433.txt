Religion is one of the main reasons why people are afraid of living When I say living I don t mean just surviving To survive is one thing even stones do that but to live is a completely different thing To live means to be sensitive to discover your potential and achieve to higher states of being The problem however is that the starting point of religion is fear Religion is based on the idea of sin all people are born sinners impure souls and if they don t purify themselves they will soon be condemned to hell by God where they will have to experience eternal suffering In order to avoid being thrown into hell religion demands that people prove to God that they are worthy of heaven How By following the dogma of religion Naturally when they are put in such a situation they find themselves in a continuous state of fear They are always afraid of whether their actions are right according to religion or not When you believe that you are being constantly watched by an all seeing eye of God you have to act in certain ways to please God The fear of hell is always in your mind filling you with worry and anxiety and this does not allow you to live spontaneously As a result religiously indoctrinated people become neurotic and in some cases even psychotic
