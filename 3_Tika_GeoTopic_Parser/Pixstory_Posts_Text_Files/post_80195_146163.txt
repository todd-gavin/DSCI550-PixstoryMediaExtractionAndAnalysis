I blame it on the content I watch which conceals all the challenges of the college life behind the glitz glamour and love filled fa ade But we all know it s all a sham College is not always fun as it seems to be As soon as you step through the gates you not only enter a new building but a new world A world which is filled with a pool of talent where you know you have to go the extra mile to make a place for yourself People with extraordinary brains talents looks styles cultural and social backgrounds believe me you are bound to be frazzled and I was You observe people away from their homes living in a different city surrounded by different people and still managing it with a smile There were and still are days where I question my potential self worth and coolness but what helped me sail my boat was A constant reminder that I can do it I am capable of everything I have achieved and will achieve and my self belief Just like every flower blooms feeling the sunshine so does every person in the college blooms facing all of his her talents we aren t supposed to nip the flower with the pressure College for sure shatters your preconceived notions It has various opportunities and experiences in store for you each year All you need is Emotional quotient self belief to find calm in and if there is chaos
