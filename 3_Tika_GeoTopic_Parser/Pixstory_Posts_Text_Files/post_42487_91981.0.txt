From today, the quarterfinal matches of the UEFA Champions League will begin, and out of four matches, Manchester City vs Atletico de Madrid is my second favorite tie and Real Madrid vs Chelsea is my top priority but I will talk about that match tomorrow.

Today, two matches will be played in UCL, the first match is Man City vs Atletico Madrid and the second is Benfica vs Liverpool. 

There is a highly likely chance that Liverpool will secure a comfortable win against Benfica but on the other hand match against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid will be very tight. 

Going by the football pundits, all the experts are writing off Atletico Madrid in front of Manchester City but as a football fan, I think there is a slight chance for Atletico Madrid and on their day, they can grind off the positive results. 

If we talk about the teams, there is no doubt that the Manchester City team is stronger as compared to Atletico Madrid. 

Manchester City will win the match because of their team quality and better bench strength whereas Atletico Madrid will win the match because of the team spirit they have and manager of Atletico Madrid knows that he lacked the resources he needs to beat Man City but he also knows how to take out best from the available resources.

If we talk about the team tactics, both teams playing style is parallel to each other where Manchester City plays attacking football by keeping possession, on the other hand, Atletico Madrid plays very defensively, irritating another team, and scoring goals on the counter attack.

This match will be very interesting, the energy of both the managers (Pep Guardiola and Diego Simeone) will make this match intense on the field. 

So Letâ€™s hope the better team will win the match and there will be no issue of overthinking from the Pep Guardiola side.
