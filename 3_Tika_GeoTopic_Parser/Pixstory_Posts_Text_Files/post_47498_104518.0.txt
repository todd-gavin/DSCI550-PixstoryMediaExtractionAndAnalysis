On the last day of the 2021â€“22 Premier League season, Crystal Palace defeated Manchester
United 1-0 at Selhurst Park, capping off a season of change under new manager Patrick Vieira.

Vieira was charged with rejuvenating an old squad and introducing a more open brand of
football this season after years of defensive togetherness to preserve survival under Roy
Hodgson.

Review of the Season:

Despite the fact that Hodgson kept Palace in the Premier League during his four years in command, many fans were relieved to see the former England manager depart at the conclusion of the 2020-21 season.

Palace had evolved into a team that was more at ease when they were not in control, and they
were set up with a primary goal of organization and defensive stability.

The Palace leadership went to Arsenal great Vieira last summer, despite the fact that he had
had a mixed managerial record up to that point and had no experience managing in the Premier
League.

The run was a breath of fresh air for Palace fans, who had been prioritizing Premier League
survival over any type of cup run in previous years, and even an easy escape from relegation
was not jeopardized.

When the team needed him most, Palace great Zaha was there, but the signing of Olise, in
particular, helped relieve the pressure on the Ivorian, with the latter giving supporters some
'wow' moments with his talent and flair to swiftly become a fan favorite.

Vieira finished his first year in the Selhurst Park dugout with an excellent 48 points and a comfortable mid-table finish after three victories in the final five league games, culminating in a
victory against Man United on the final day.
