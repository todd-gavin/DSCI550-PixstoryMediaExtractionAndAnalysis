Swimming is a great way to get exercise and stay healthy, but it's important to be careful about the way you care for your skin. Here are some ways to make sure your skin stays protected during swimming:
1. Wear sunscreen – Even if you're only going for a short swim, apply sunscreen to both your face and all of your exposed skin. Remember that even water can burn if it's high in UV radiation.
2. Use an SPF 30 sunscreen or higher– This is the most effective level of protection against both UVA and UVB rays.
3. Avoid using self-tanning products before swimming – Self-tanning products contain harmful ingredients that can aggravate your sensitive skin while you're swimming. 
4. Don’t forget about your ears! – Protect them too by wearing ear plugs or ear muffs when you swim. These will help reduce water pressure on your eardrums, which could lead to hearing loss in extreme cases! 
5. Be mindful of the salt water – If you're bathing in salt water, be sure to rinse off all the soap before swimming so that it doesn't enter.
6. If you experience any pain, swelling, redness, or itchiness on your skin, please stop and see a doctor. These could all be signs of a serious injury and may require hospitalization. 
7. Apply cooling packs or sponges to your skin before entering the water to reduce the risk of sunburn or heat exhaustion. 
8. Avoid getting water on your eyes - tears can cause contact dermatitis and swimmer's itch (a rash caused by exposure to chlorine). 
9. Use a chlorinated pool when possible - this will reduce the risk of fungal overgrowth (which can cause acne) and other skin problems.
