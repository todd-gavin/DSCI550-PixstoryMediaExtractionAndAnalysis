Dr. Philip Gordon was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' national security advisor on Monday, succeeding Amb. Nancy McEldowney, who had held the position since January 2021. 

Fox News reported that McEldowney will leave the government in the coming weeks for "personal reasons," according to a senior administration official. 

In a statement released Monday, the Vice President's Office confirmed Harris' appointment of Gordon, who will also serve as President Biden's assistant. 

Since January 2021, Gordon has been Harris's deputy national security advisor. 
Gordon's appointment was lauded by Harris's office, which said he "brings a plethora of foreign policy experience to the role."

Gordon formerly worked as a special assistant to the president and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region during the Obama administration. Gordon previously worked as an assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs from 2009 until 2013. 

Gordon was appointed by Harris after McEldowney resigned from her position. Since the Biden administration took office in January 2021, McEldowney has held the position.
