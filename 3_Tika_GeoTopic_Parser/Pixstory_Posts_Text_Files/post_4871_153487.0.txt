Yesterday on 7th October 2022, the final episode of Criminal Justice season 3 was released. The third season of the crime series focused on a juvenile trial case.
Criminal Justice: Adhura Sach, is a story about the murder of teenage celebrity Zara Ahuja (Deshna Dugad), and the trial of her stepbrother, Mukul Ahuja (Aaditya Gupta) who is the prime suspect in her murder as all the evidence points towards him.
The series focuses on issues like internet trolling and the mental health of young children, especially teenagers.
Disney + Hotstar is the official streamer of the series and every Friday, one episode of the season was released, keeping audience anticipation high.
In total 8 episodes of the series were released, the first few episodes of season 3 were an interesting watch with good story buildup. Somehow the later episodes felt stretchy but the series maintained to keep unpredictability giving no sign of real killer to the audience. The last two episodes really picked up the pace and gave audience a fresh suspect to look at as a killer.
Pankaj Tripathi’s role as Madhav Mishra was amazing just like in the first two seasons of Criminal Justice. Tripathi’s character even in season 3 maintained his subtle humour throughout. 
The opposition lawyer was played by Shweta Basu Prasad whose character was Lekha. The courtroom drama between Madhav Mishra and Lekha was quite an interesting watch with few great lines.
Other actors like Purab Kohli who played Zara’s father Neeraj, and actress Swastika Mukherjee as Avantika, Zara’s stepmother, and Gaurav Gera who played Mukul’s real father were convincing in their characters.
Mukul played by Aaditya Gupta who was the main accused throughout the series was really good throughout his series with his acting skills.
Criminal Justice: Adhura Sach is not good as season one of the series but also not as bad as season two. It’s surely a great season for bingeing and for sure a good one-time watch.
