Espanyol have completed the signing of Martin Brathwaite on a free transfer in a three year deal This comes after a contract termination was agreed between Brathwaite and Barcelona The year old had two years remaining on his Barcelona contract and it seems a settlement has been reached with the club in regard to that The Catalan club informed the player of their decision to offload him which further highlights the financial crisis they have found themselves in Brathwaite initially did not want to leave this summer but in recent days he became more open to the idea The glaring issue which was blocking his exit was the settlement fee he would receive from Barcelona as his contract was to be terminated While the fee has not been disclosed it is understood the forward was demanding million euros as this was the amount he would eventually earn at the club for the next two years After activating economic levers in order to register new signings Barcelona have been looking to sell some of the high earners at the club One factor which has seemed to have an impact on Brathwaite s willingness to leave is understood to be the fact the World Cup is near approaching later this year The Dane s relationship with the fans at Barcelona turned into a toxic one following supporters jeering him after he refused to take a pay cut The year old made appearances for the Spanish giants and scored some important goals therefore it has become unfortunate to see how he has been treated by Barcelona fans recently Robert Lewandowski s arrival at the club has played a massive role in Brathwaite s exit as the Polish international is Xaxi s preferred number nine Lewandowski is also on astronomical wages therefore Barcelona were desperate to offload Brathwaite this summer Espanyol travel to Bilbao this weekend to face Athletic club and the Dane could make his debut for the club after completing his medical earlier today There were some reports of Brathwaite making a move to England earlier this week however the year old was in the country to attend the wedding of Donny Van de Beek
