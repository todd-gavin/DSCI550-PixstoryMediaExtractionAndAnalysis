Former US President Donald Trump on Sunday joked that the United States should put flags of China on its fighter jets and bomb Russia.

While speaking to the top Republican National Committee of donors, Trump suggested that the US should put Chinese flags on F-22 fighter jets and "bomb the s*** out of Russia."

"And then we say, China did it. Then they start fighting with each other, and we sit back and watch," he said in what came across as a joke as his audience laughed and clapped, US media reported.

He went on to call NATO a "paper tiger" and asked at what point does countries say "No, we can't take this massive crime against humanity?"

The former US president stressed that the US can't let it happen, pointing to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

"We have to have Biden stop saying that - and this is for everyone to hear - that we will not attack Russia ever because they are a nuclear power, right?" Trump said.

"You know who is saying this? Okay, whether it's fact or fiction, 'We will not attack Russia. You see, they are a nuclear power.' Oh, thanks for telling us," Trump said, as per CBS News.

Earlier this week, Donald Trump had asserted that he remains the only US president of the 21st century under whom Russia did not invade another nation.

"Under Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under Biden, Russia invaded Ukraine," Trump was quoted as saying by media.
