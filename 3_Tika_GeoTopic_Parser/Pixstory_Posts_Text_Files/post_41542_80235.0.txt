Climate change disproportionately affects low income workers. These jobs are inherently more dangerous as unsafe workplaces are intensified by extreme heat (outdoor workers, roofers, construction workers). Heat exhaustion, falling, heat stroke, etc are serious effects this can have on workers. To help alleviate this, businesses can provide workers with cold water, create good shades and allow for regular breaks and holidays on really harsh days.
