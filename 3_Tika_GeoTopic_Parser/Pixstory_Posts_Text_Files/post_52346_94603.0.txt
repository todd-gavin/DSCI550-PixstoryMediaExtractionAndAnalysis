Whether you want to try new foods, make new friends, or simply have a memorable day out, taking a tour around Sydney will give you something new to love about your city.

Furthermore, now that domestic and international borders are open, these are ideal day trips if you want to show guests around or if you are visiting from out of town.

1. Locals' Dining Tours

Weekly inner-city dining tours of Surry Hills, Darlinghurst, and Potts Point are offered by The Sydney Connection. These tours, which are accompanied by a well-connected guide, are aimed at visitors and Sydneysiders who want to go 'where the locals go.' You'll be able to try three different restaurants in one night!

2. Surry Hills's Best Kept Secret Bar Crawl

This tour is all about good food, great bars, and meeting new people. It's not your typical pub crawl, with a maximum of 12 guests.

3. Walking tour of Sydney's Hidden Treasures

Join us for a leisurely stroll through the inner-city suburbs of Pyrmont, Ultimo, and Glebe. Discover why there are so many pubs in this part of Sydney, as well as the area's Aboriginal history. You may even come across a talking pet cockatoo!

4. Running tour of the harbour sights

Put on your running shoes and prepare to run around the harbour. Every day at 9 a.m., this tour departs. Visit Mrs Macquaries Chair, Kiribilli, the Opera House, Cadman's Cottage, and Lavender Bay. You'll run about 10 kilometres.
