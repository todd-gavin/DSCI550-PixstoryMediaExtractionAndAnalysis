Being a Chelsea player, Frank Lampard was certainly not going to be given any love at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. Hence, the landslide victory for the Spurs didn't help the former Premier League star. 

The Everton boss was first subjected to the "You're just a s** Steven Gerrard" chant. This was a clear indication that Frank Lampard is no way close to his former England teammate in a managerial capacity. 

Steven Gerrard has had a wonderful start to his managerial career after leading Rangers to the Scottish Premiership. Since then, the Liverpool legend has joined Aston Villa and is doing a commendable job at the club. 

Everton were out of the game as soon as the 55th minute when Harry Kane scored his brace. The Tottenham Hotspur fans then started the "You're getting sacked in the morning" chants after the Spurs scored their fifth goal. 

The Tottenham Hotspur fans would again start before the full time whistle to poke fun one last time at the Everton manager. Loud chants of  "What's the score, Lampard?" started ringing around the stadium.
