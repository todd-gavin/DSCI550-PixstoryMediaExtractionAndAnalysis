South Australia s Naracoorte Caves is one of the world s best fossil sites containing a record spanning more than half a million years Among the remains preserved in layers of sand are the bones of many iconic Australian megafauna species that became extinct between and years ago The reasons for the demise of these megafauna species are intensely debated But the older the fossils we can find the better we can understand the species evolution and extinction To date determining the precise age of the caves has been difficult However our research demonstrates for the first time how old Naracoorte s caves really are and the answer is up to years older than previously thought Our findings shed new light on the antiquity of this important place We hope this will aid understanding of how biodiversity responds to a changing climate over time A moment in geologic timeCaves can be extraordinary time capsules often preserving the remains of long extinct plants and animals in exquisite detail The Naracoorte Caves in South Australia is one such example The cave complex is South Australia s only World Heritage site Among the remarkably diverse and complete fossil record are the remains of iconic megafauna such as Thylacoleo carnifex marsupial predator Zygomaturus tribolus huge herbivore Wonambi naracoortensis giant constrictor snake Procoptodon goliah browsing sthenurine kangaroo Palaeontologists have excavated and dated many of these fossil deposits and reconstructed the skeletons of a number of megafauna species The caves formed when groundwater percolated through cracks in limestone rocks dissolving them and forming cavities They were previously dated at between and million years old an estimate generated by dating a fossil dune ridge that lies over the cave complex But the methods used to date the dune ridge were not entirely suitable for the task As such a precise age of the caves had not been obtained until now Read more
