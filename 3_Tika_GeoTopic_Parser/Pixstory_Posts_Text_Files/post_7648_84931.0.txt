Robert Pattinson as Batman has made the role his own, he's conflicted within himself and he brings forth that dichotomy in his own unique way. He wants to feel but at first decides not to, its this gradual arc of feeling again that underlies in the whole plot. Robert Pattinson while potraying Bruce Wayne is a silent methodical actor, he doesn't waste his words, he hasn't developed that Bruce persona yet but there room left to explore. When he's wearing the Cowl, he acts with his eyes. His eyes potray the different emotions under that he feels under the suit. This movie just shows why he is the World's Greatest Detective in the comics, its a very realistic portrayal. Robert Pattinson for me is definitely the best Batman yet.

Its the nuance with which he plays the character, The Batman voice may have been the best yet, its not forced at all, it feels intimidating. His interactions with other characters keeps on developing throughout the plot.

This movie is a gritty noir story, with scenes that remind of Se7en and even the Zodiac. Matt Reeves has blended all the elements together beautifully and put forward a masterpiece. It creates its own space in the canon of Batman and this Battverse has a long way to to with Robert Pattinson acting as its anchor. 
There isn't a single flaw I could find in his performance, he potrays the broken, lost, without hope Bruce Wayne in a poignant way. In contrast to this, The Batman is a complete foil to this and he blends these two perfectly, to put forward a worthy Batman in front of the audience. You'll feel every blow that he delivers and every blow that he receives. This movie is everything that it had set out to be and it even exceeds expectations. This movie proves that glamour and pizzazz isn't the only formula for comic-book adaptations.

Robert Pattinson is The Batman that every Batman fan ever wished for. Don't miss out on this masterpiece, releasing on 4th March 2022.
