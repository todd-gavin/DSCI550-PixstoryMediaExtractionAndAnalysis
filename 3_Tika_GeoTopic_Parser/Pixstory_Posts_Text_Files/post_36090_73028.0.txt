Nature it's a true beauty in self ,nature it's god damn beautiful creation of god and the etarnal beauty of mother nature it's really pleasing to the eyse it's like decorative and feels like the less you see , the less you see again and again and yes it's our moral duty to maintain the etarnal beauty of mother nature to respect her as our own and the  eternal beauty of mother nature It's beyond words and i really wish to sink in the  rhythm of it's beauty...🍃
