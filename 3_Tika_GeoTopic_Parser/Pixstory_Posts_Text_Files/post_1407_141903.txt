Over the weekend I watched the new Bollywood movie on Netflix Ek Villain Returns I think it may have been the worst movie I have ever watched Which is quite an accomplishment Now I quite enjoy a bad Bollywood movie the terrible dialogue ludicrous action scenes and silly premise is all great fun to me I love seeing say Hrithik Roshan dress up as Queen Elizabeth in order to steal the Kohinoor But my problem with Ek Villain Returns wasn t just the lousy script it was that it was outright misogynistic It employs that longstanding Bollywood trope of the intense young lover who is unfairly spurned by the object of his affections Movies like Kabir Singh lean heavily on this trope and use it as the central conflict which only serves to reinforce the popular Indian idea that women shouldn t romantically reject men who love them even if its sexual fixation masquerading as love Sorry but this is not amusing to me whatsoever Not when there are hundreds of stories every single day of spurned suitors throwing acid on women s faces lighting them on fire stalking them raping them murdering them I don t want to link to these distressing stories you can find them quite easily by Googling But my point is that this narrative is dirt common these men kill women because they feel sexually entitled to them and they don t see woman as full people who have the right to their own agency and to say no to men This is what these men have grown up learning and its what they see in the pop culture around them Every time Bollywood directors make another movie about a woman who finally gives in to a man or a woman who is punished for saying No or a movie romanticising an abusive and dangerous man they are complicit in this culture And that s why I didn t enjoy Ek Villain Returns
