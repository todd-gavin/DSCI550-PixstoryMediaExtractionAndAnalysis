Daily Mail reported that Former First Lady Melania Trump hinted that she may be up for a second term in the White House during her first sit-down interview since her husband left office.

Melania told Fox Nation that she is doing well and keeping busy after Donald Trump's tumultuous exit from Washington, D.C.

'I like Washington, D.C. I know it operates completely different[ly] than any other city. To be the First Lady of the United States was my greatest honor, and I think we achieved a lot in the four years of the Trump administration,' she said. 

'Never say never,' she added.

Melania also said she enjoyed her role, and taking care of the White House despite the many criticisms she faced while Trump was in office.

Scrutiny towards the former model-turned-businesswoman increased after an incident in which she wore a jacket emblazoned with the words 'I really don't care, do u?' on a trip to visit immigrant kids at a border detention center in 2018.

Melania clarified later the message was meant for the 'left-wing media and people' who criticized her, and not the children.Despite his wife's cautious answer, Trump has repeatedly hinted that he will run for the presidency again in 2024.
