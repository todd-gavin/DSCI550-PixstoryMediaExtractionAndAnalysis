I’ve always loved films and stories, the possibilities that can be created through an absence of what isn’t but wants to be. But I’ve never been able to act: it’s something that has always made me hyper-aware of myself, beyond what my already overthinking mind can handle.

Any time I was pushed to cross the boundaries within myself through a dance class or performance at school, I would find myself becoming smaller, the circumference of boundaries tightening into a sharp point at my chest.

I wasn’t ready to confront the mess that would spill over if I broke past the awkwardness of myself. 

What I didn’t know was that the reason it was so hard to act was because I was already exhausted from putting on a show daily, on endless repeat by attempting to live despite not being myself.

Curtains drawn, lights dimmed, everybody’s gone home but my costume is skin and my make-up waterproof: 23 full years as an experienced actor who never leaves the stage. 

When I did try to leave the stage, it wasn’t to be myself but to destroy the theater altogether.

I don’t know what it means to navigate the world as myself because I still haven’t fully made it there but after years of attempting to erase myself, the love and support that helped me embrace my transess has translated into a hope to be able to live with myself.

There’s always a fear in being alive but I’m less afraid to live because I know the steps I need to take to access healthcare that will remove the exhaustion of carrying on this show.

More than half of trans children were at risk of suicide this past year, and access to gender-affirming care is linked to being at lower risk of attempting suicide by nearly 40 percent in transgender and nonbinary youth

Gender-affirming healthcare makes life liveable, and the right to access this lifesaving healthcare is a human right.
