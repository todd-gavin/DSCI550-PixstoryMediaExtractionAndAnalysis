Since ancient times, rice water has been employed in Asian beauty rituals to obtain luminous and smooth skin. Sprinting rice water on skin is a natural home cure for treating and preventing acne, getting rid of acne scars, and reducing hyperpigmentation. It is well known for brightening your skin, fading dark spots, and blemishes for a clear and smooth texture. In addition, rice water has vitamins and minerals that can feed the hair and scalp and possibly promote growth.

All in all, it's one of my personal favorite DIY skincare and haircare product.

But that doesn't mean it doesn't have side effects.

The first and the foremost side effect of rice water, which is most commonly faced by a lot of us in the west, is protein overload. Rice water is a great source of protein, especially the fermented one and it's a DIY protein treatment but our hair, especially if you're white, have a different texture than asian hair and it may not be able to take the same level of proteins as them. That would make your hair brittle and cause breakage. A good way to reverse it is using any protein treatment less frequently and keeping your hair moisturized. Rice water is good for all hair types, but the dose depends on the individual.

Having patches of dry, flaky, or itchy skin is one of the possible adverse effects of using rice water on the face. After using rice water, some people have negative side effects including hives or a rash. Infection symptoms on their skin include painful open wounds, red skin streaks, a fever, or sores that do not heal. If it happens to you, stop using rice water.

And of course, if you're allergic to rice.

Every great product is not great for everyone. Try and test!
