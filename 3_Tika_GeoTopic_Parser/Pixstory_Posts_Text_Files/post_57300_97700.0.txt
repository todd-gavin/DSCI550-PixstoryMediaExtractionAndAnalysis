A cornucopia of people was affected by Covid 19 Pandemic, but it is an uncanny fact that some were able to escape the disease every time.

This could be many, as some people took mitigation measures so seriously, from maintaining a social distance to wearing a mask and even getting vaccinated on time.
Kimberly Powers, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Public Health, said that,
“Things like working from home and avoiding crowds will minimise a person's number of encounters with people who might have an active infection, and then things like being vaccinated and wearing a well-fitting mask can decrease the risk of acquiring infection if someone does come into contact with someone who has an actively infectious virus."

There is also another narrative involving this case; some people came into the trap of the disease, but they didn't get to know it because it was an asymptomatic case, or there might be mild symptoms that didn't prompt testing.

While some were in the field working with the infected ones, they were also shielded from the disease.
These unfathomable and perplexing narratives have confused the researchers for a long. A study says,
"Being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn’t always result in infection, and we’ve been keen to understand why,” study author Rhia Kundu said in a statement, using the scientific name for the coronavirus. “We found that high levels of pre-existing T cells, created by the body when infected with other human coronaviruses like the common cold, can protect against COVID-19 infection.”
There is other research going on to find the actual reasons behind it.
