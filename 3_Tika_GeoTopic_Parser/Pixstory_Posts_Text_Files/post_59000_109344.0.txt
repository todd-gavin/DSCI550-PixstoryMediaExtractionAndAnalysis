According to sources, the Delhi government has banned the entry of heavy and medium commercial vehicles between November 1, 2022, and February 28, 2023 in an effort to reduce air pollution in the city during the winter.

Trucks delivering fuel and other necessities would be permitted entry into the city.

Apart from CNG-run and electric trucks, sources claim that only diesel-powered trucks transporting necessities like gasoline and perishable commodities will likely be permitted to enter the capital.
Raw fruits, vegetables, cereals, milk, eggs, ice, and other ingredients are necessary.

However, sources also claimed that although CNG-powered small goods vehicles are accessible, they are few and typically operate on a local level in the nation's capital.

Because these trucks travel great distances, from as far as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and can't refill along the way because CNG is not readily available in every state, trucks that transport bulk products do not run on CNG.

In November of last year, trucks were prohibited from entering Delhi, and the Delhi administration also sent letters to neighbouring states warning them that any diesel-powered vehicle older than 10 years that entered the national capital would be seized and destroyed.

Additionally, the Delhi administration has lately ordered that only BS VI compliant buses travelling on interstate routes and headed for Delhi be used by the neighbouring states.
