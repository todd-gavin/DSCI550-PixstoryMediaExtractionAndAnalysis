From mini skirt suits, to bold chromatics, these are the trends that are ruling the runway.
2022 is well under way, but as we approach Fashion Month, we're taking a look at the trends that can already be anticipated this year—and planning how to dress for it. Here, the biggest trends to look out for in 2022.

👗 -  Mini Skirt Suits 
 After seasons of maxis and midis, the mini is about to take the stage, but in the form of suiting. Consider this the perfect opportunity to take your matchy-matchy sets of 2021 into 2022 with more tailoring—and a bit more leg.

⛹️‍♀️ -  Sporty Space
 Athletic lines are going intergalactic—and there couldn't a better time for it. With tech-integrated fabrics and classic sporty silhouettes, the space age meets the age of athleisure.

💃🏻 - Chromatica
Statement dressing will take the stage this year, but instead of fussy accoutrements, it's bold colors that will kick clothing into the realm of "POW!" From the recent runways at Richard Quinn, Proenza Schouler, and Prada, one thing became clear: ROYG-BIV makes for a revelation in celebratory dressing. 

👗 - Folk Lace
 This year, rebellion may come in the form of lace. Demure and feminine, delicate embellishment offers seasonal softness to follow the rise in temperatures—and hemlines.

💃🏻 - Trains
After years of thigh-high slits, and down-to-there necklines, subtle sex appeal comes in the form of classic cuts with dramatics trailing trains that are meant to turn heads.

🏖️ - Luxe Beach
 If Emily in Paris is any indication, high octane glamour doesn't need to stop where the sand meets the sea. On this year's beach getaway, dress to the nines in intricately detailed swimwear, cover-ups, and accessories, carving out a more is more space in a locale more often dominated by denim cut offs and classic bathing suits.
