Looking at his touches, he has made the majority of his touches in the middle third with a 99 percentile having made 60.75 touches per 90. The Argentinian is a good carrier with the ball as he has carried the ball to the opponent’s half 69.00 per 90, and he has progressively carried the ball 6.13 per 90.

Final Review

The young Argentinian, despite his young age(24), shows the maturity of a seasoned defender. His cool demeanour and composure on the ball bring stability to the backline. His short stature has never been an issue in lunging for tackle and jumping to win every aerial duel. That’s why Erik Ten Hag is keen on bringing him along with Jurrien Timber. If United are not able to get Pau Torres or Alessandro Bastoni, then the board should have a look at the Argentinian who can play in multiple positions. It would make United's backline more stellar and stronger than last season when it was in utter chaos. It remains to be seen where Martinez ends up.
