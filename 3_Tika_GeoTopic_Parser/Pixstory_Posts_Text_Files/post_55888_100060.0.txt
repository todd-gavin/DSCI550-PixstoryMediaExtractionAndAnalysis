‌Along with those who put complete blame on humans, some scientist also doesn't agree with humans being the root cause of climatic changes. Earth has been changing since we know, species get destroyed and new species emerge! Even before there were humans this has happened! Earth’s climate has always warmed and cooled and  Earth is susceptible to change people should be ready to acknowledge the changes.
‌
‌The rising of Co2 levels is not only the reason for global warming it has a lot to do with the earth's structure and the sun. Human-produced CO2 is re-absorbed by oceans, forests, and other “carbon sinks,” contradicting the climate changes and hence maintaining a minimum balance. 
‌
‌A study published in Energy & Environment says “variations in solar activity and not the burning of fossil fuels are the direct cause of the observed multiyear variations in climatic responses.” Global warming and cooling are primarily caused by fluctuations in the sun’s heat (solar forcing), not by human activity.
‌
‌The increase in the level of the ocean and other aspects have been steadily increasing for many years hence can't be contributed to humans alone. This could be the way of earth. It is not at all constant and changes are inevitable. Yet there is no argument for the fact that we could try and conserve the earth and slow down its ageing process.
