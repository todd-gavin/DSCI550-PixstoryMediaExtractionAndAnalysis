Omar Richards, a former England U21 left-back and player of Bayern Munich, has officially signed with Nottingham Forest. The 24-year-old defender relocates to England after signing a
four-year deal at the City Ground, a year after leaving Reading for Bayern.

Richards is the fifth summer hire for Forest, and the left-back will join Steve Cooper's team before the friendly against Burton Albion on Tuesday at the Pirelli Stadium.

Richards told Forest's official website:

"I'm thrilled to return to England by joining Nottingham Forest at such an exciting time"
"The club has enjoyed an incredible last few months and there's great ambitions for the Premier
League return.

Richards is expected to join Forest this transfer window along with another full-back, Neco Williams, who would cost the newly promoted team £16 million. Williams played for Championship-winning Fulham for the second part of the season while on loan, appearing in 14
league games, contributing to two goals and scoring twice for the west London outfit.

The fullback has played just 33 games across all competitions since making his debut in October 2019 because he has spent his entire time at Anfield filling in for the team's first-choice right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. Williams, however, is anticipated to start for Wales at right-back during the World Cup finals this winter in Qatar.

Before confirming Richards' arrival, Forest completed four deals: Moussa Niakhate from Mainz
for £17 million, defender Giulian Biancone from Troyes, goalkeeper Dean Henderson on loan
from Manchester United, and striker Taiwo Awoniyi on a club-record deal.
