Post Roe world is proven to be a tragedy for women Paramedics arrived at Lattice Fisher s Mississippi home to find a newborn in the toilet lifeless and blue the umbilical cord still attached The child roughly six pounds and more than weeks along was announced dead at the hospital Although Fisher said she wasn t aware of the pregnancy at first she admitted it after surrendering her iPhone to police whose search history had information about the abortion pill Now she has been indicted for killing baby Fisher In Pre Roe world too there was evidence against women through their online research and text messages Now after overturning Roe v s Wade simple search histories could cause problems for women Lots of people Google about abortion and then choose to carry out their pregnancies said Laurie Bertram Roberts a spokeswoman for Fisher Thought crimes are not the thing You re not supposed to be able to be indictee of what you thought about Fisher declined to comment These digital records of ordinary lives are sometimes flipped over voluntarily or attained with a warrant and have given a gold mine for law enforcement The reality is we do absolutely everything on our phones these days said Emma Roth a staff attorney at the National Advocates for Pregnant Women There are many many ways in which law enforcement can find out about somebody s journey to seek an abortion through digital surveillance Digital evidence had also played a central role in the case of Purvi Patel an Indiana woman who the National Advocates for Pregnant Women said in was the first woman in the United States to be charged convicted and sentenced for feticide in ending hen pregnancy The state s evidence comprised texts Patel exchanged with a friend from Michigan in which she talked about her plans to take pills that can incite abortion In countries like Poland and Germany encrypted messages are being sent and networks that don t connect to abortion clinics are directly for the protection of women needing abortions Shockingly in the US women have to endure so much for a right of theirs Source Guardian
