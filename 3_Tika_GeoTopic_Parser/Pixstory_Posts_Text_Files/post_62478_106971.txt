Dogs love beaches much like us But as their hoomans we have some responsibilities we need to take care of when we decide to give them this fun Avoid taking your dog to the dog beach during the hottest hours of the day and make sure he has plenty of shade and fresh cool water You should try to restrict your activity to a bare minimum Sure you can play fetch with your dog but make sure they get enough rest get out of the sun and drink plenty of water in between games Carry a first aid kit Antibiotic ointment or spray Cotton balls Digital thermometer Disposable gloves Extra collar and leash Flashlights Gauze and self adhering bandages Hydrogen peroxide Ice pack Pocket pet first aid manual Magnifying glass Saline eye solution Scissors Soft muzzle Styptic powder Syringes Towels and Tweezers Sunscreeeeen Dog sunscreen and wipes are designed specifically for dogs to protect them from the sun without exposing them to potentially dangerous substances such as zinc which is commonly found in human sunscreen As long as dogs have access to fresh water ingesting a tiny bit of seawater will not hurt them but if they drink enough seawater they will get severely dehydrated Vomiting ropy saliva and dry sticky gums are all symptoms
