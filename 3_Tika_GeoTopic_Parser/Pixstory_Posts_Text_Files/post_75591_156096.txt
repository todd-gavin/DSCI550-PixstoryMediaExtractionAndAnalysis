Against Leeds on Sunday afternoon Arsenal undoubtedly delivered their worst performance of the season Control potency and solidity were all words that have applied to Arsenal all season but today all three were thrown out of the window With the redeeming quality just some good individual performances including that of Aaron Ramsdale The goalkeeper was absolutely superb and in some sense is the sole reason Arsenal didn t collapse today However through everything the Gunners have won again They have claimed three points in a very loud place against an energetic team and stay top of the Premier League Arguably Arsenal have been the better side in every of this season s Premier League fixtures Even when they lost to Manchester United they did it with the majority of chances Today they suffered and truly should ve been beaten Following Saka s opener Leeds had one on ones missed a penalty and had numerous dangerous positions in the Arsenal penalty box However again Arsenal walked away with the three points A sign of a great team is one that can still find a way to win even when they are at their worst That is not to say Arsenal can afford to play like this every week Today was a big off day but the fact they still won speaks to the mentality that now exists within the Arsenal dressing room The Gunners were unwilling to accept anything less than a win and fought tooth and nail to take the points With nine wins from their opening ten games Arsenal now sit four points clear of nbsp second place Manchester City and the Gunners don t look like slowing down
