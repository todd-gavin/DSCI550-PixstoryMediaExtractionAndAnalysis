It was just a couple weeks ago that word broke of WWE restating past financial results due to “certain unrecorded expenses” made by now ex-CEO and Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. Those filings showed approximately $14.6 million in payments that “were or will be paid by Vince McMahon personally.”

Now, an updated filing with the SEC has uncovered even more payments that bring the total up to $19.6 million.

When McMahon resigned, though it was publicly presented to as a retirement, there were reports indicating it was partially due to the expectation that more would come out in regards to hush money payments. This appears to be at least some of the “more” that was referring to.

It remains to be seen if this is the end of it.
