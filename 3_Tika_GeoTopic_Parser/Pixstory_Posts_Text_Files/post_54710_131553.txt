Climate change has already increased global temperatures greatly increasing extremes This will continue unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to net zero The C target of the Paris Agreement requires emissions reductions of around in the next years Newborn babies are particularly vulnerable to high temperatures They have a limited ability to thermoregulate or control their body temperature and can easily become dangerously hot or cold Older babies and toddlers can thermoregulate better But they are often unable to communicate their temperature discomfort They rely on caregivers to help them adjust clothing and change their environment like opening a window or seeking shade Africa has some of the poorest and hottest countries in the world This means that young African children are at particular risk of heat stress impacts However estimates of heat related deaths in African children are limited primarily due to the lack of available mortality data over the continent There has been little research into the impact of climate change on child heat related deaths in any region of the world To address this knowledge gap we estimated present day and future heat related mortality due to climate change in African children under five years We did this using a range of different global heating scenarios and information from a small number of existing studies relating temperatures to heat related child deaths in Africa We also considered population growth and recent declines in the total child mortality rates in African countries due to developmental improvements such as better healthcare and infrastructure We estimated that between and there were between and heat related child deaths per year in Africa Climate change accounts for approximately half of these deaths The additiona dayl deaths due to climate change cancel out the recent reduction in heat related deaths that was achieved through developmental improvements Our research underscores the urgent need to reduce emissions and take adaptation measures to reduce the impact of heat on babies and children Read more
