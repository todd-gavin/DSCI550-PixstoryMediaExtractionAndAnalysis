As if you needed more reasons to adopt a pet, let me tell you that adoption is a financially wise decision too!

As per HS, most of the time, the cost of spaying or neutering a pet, the initial set of vaccines, and sometimes even the cost of microchipping are covered by the adoption fee, saving you some of the up-front expenses of bringing a new member of the family into your home. You might also spend less on housebreaking and training costs, depending on the animal. 

Moreover, adoption is the last hope for many old animals!

Since many animals in shelters and rescues are already housebroken, you might also be saving your rug in addition to the life of the animal. In addition to giving older animals a second chance, adopting a mature pet frequently makes it simpler to integrate them into your household.
