The world's first The Dutch striker will remain in north London after agreeing to new terms.

Vivianne Miedema has signed a contract extension with Arsenal, putting an end to doubts over
her future.

The prolific Dutch attacker has agreed to new terms that will keep her in north London once her
current contract expires this summer.

There has been no word on how long the new arrangement will last, but speculation over a
relocation to Barcelona or the United States has died down for the time being.

Miedema told the club's official website: "I believe the most beautiful part about the game is
establishing something with a team and individuals around you that you truly want to be
around."

"I think I've found that at Arsenal." Winning titles with Arsenal, I believe, will mean a lot more to
me than winning them with another club right now. That is, of course, my ambition with Arsenal.

"Viv is a brilliant talent and a tremendously essential player for our club, so it's excellent news
that she is remaining with us," said Gunners' manager, Jonas Eidevall.

"As a club, we want to win trophies and compete at the highest levelâ€”we know Viv wants the
same things, and we'll work together to make that happen."

The Gunners wanted to keep the 25-year-old because she has been a revelation in English
football.

In all competitions, Miedema, who is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world,
scored 100 goals for Arsenal in the 2021-22 season, scoring 23 times in all competitions.

She has 72 goals in the Women's Super League's history and became the first player to score
against every side she has played against in top-flight action in November 2021.

Miedema, who joined Arsenal from Bayern Munich in 2017, had a temporary monument erected
outside Emirates Stadium ahead of a north London derby in May to commemorate her
outstanding achievements. During her stint with the Gunners, she also won the WSL title and
the League Cup.
