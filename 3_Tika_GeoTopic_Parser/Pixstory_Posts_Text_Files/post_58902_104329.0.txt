The Government of India has imposed a service tax on the services provided by restaurants. GST has replaced many taxes, including service tax.

Restaurants charge this for the services they provide to you. There are no specific guidelines in current tax laws regarding the limitation of service charges by restaurants. This is the money that goes directly to the restaurant.

According to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution, the Service Charge is the voluntary amount levied by the restaurant that customers pay at their discretion. Service tax, on the other hand, is a tax that must be paid to the government.

However, many customers are conflating service charge and service tax and questioning restaurants as to why they must pay this additional amount following the implementation of GST. Customers are required to pay a service charge in some restaurants. Customers are becoming more confused about the purpose of GST, despite restaurateurs emphasising that the service charge is not intended to increase profits, but rather to benefit the staff.

As a result, according to the law, Service Tax has been phased out by GST, and customers are not required to pay it. However, the Service Charge remains in effect.
