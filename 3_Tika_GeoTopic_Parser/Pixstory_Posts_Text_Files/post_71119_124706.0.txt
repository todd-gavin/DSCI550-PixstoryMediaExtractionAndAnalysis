The Kashmiri embroidery has a unique style that can be seen in both the method and the final product. The original name for Kashmiri needlework, Kashida, was introduced by the Persians, and the motifs and design clearly show a strong Persian influence. The piece is incredibly colourful and takes inspiration for its motifs from natural landscape features. It is believed that royal patronage gave rise to this art, which is primarily practised by men.

Before being finished, the Kashmiri needlework is supposed to pass through numerous skillful hands. Never is a single piece completed entirely by one individual. The different threads and raw materials are also collected from various locations and combined to create colourful designs. Distributors sell plain shawls and/or yarns that have been dyed and processed for embroidery. The job is done secretly in private homes or in teams at the Karkhanas/workshops. Another prevalent sight is training centres, which have proliferated because to the increased demand for embroidered goods.

The fact that practically all Kashmiri artisans embroider with their right hand is both intriguing and odd. Left-handed craftspeople are scarce, if not nonexistent. The fourth finger of the right hand is used by the artisans to hold a thimble known as a Nyatth. To insert the needle into thick fabric, use this technique. To permit the smooth movement of the stem while the thimble is not in use, mustard oil is applied to the finger. 
The sitting position used by embroiderers while working is known as "Zangvaitth." Their backs are against a wall, and they are seated with their knees raised. Backrests might be a thick, hard cushion or an angled wooden plank. Women are reported to prepare the yarn, and males are said to work mostly on the Kashmiri embroidery.
