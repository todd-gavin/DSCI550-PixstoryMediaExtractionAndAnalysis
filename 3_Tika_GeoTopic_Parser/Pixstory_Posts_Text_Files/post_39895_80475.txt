Badhai Do releases today a spiritual sequel to the National award winning hit Badhai Ho The movie stars Bhumi Pednekar and Rajkumar Rao Bhumi plays Suman Singh a year old physical education instructor with a fascination with women To escape the pressures of their families she marries a cop named Shardul Rajkummar When Rajkummar s character indicates that he is also gay the tale takes a major turn For those unversed it s called a lavender marriage which is a hetero marriage between two homosexual persons who agree to this arrangement of convenience for various reasons like trying to fit into society avoiding social stigma emanating from their single status and using it as a cover so that they can live their lives with some semblance of freedom Directed by Harshavardhan Kulkarni whose previous works include hits like Hasee to Phasee and Hunterrr The situation of LGBTQ in India is still icky and a taboo like various others topics in India This social drama hopes to fulfil the gap of misunderstandings and encouraging people to be aware In an interview with India Today Bhumi said she didn t doubt the choice after she agreed to do the movie Yes that s not my sexual preference but is my sexual preference all that I am made up of This is exactly what the film speaks about When the actor Rajkumar was asked about his sensitive role in this film what was his mindset The actor said Well of course I understand the responsibilities and not just me I think all of us do We are also big supporters of the LGBTQI community However as I said it s a very well researched film and Harsh even had some people from the community involved while writing it He was constantly making them read the script so that there is no wrong message The early reviews say Badhaai Do is a complete family entertainer with a twist So I would highly recommend go on and watch this film Cheers
