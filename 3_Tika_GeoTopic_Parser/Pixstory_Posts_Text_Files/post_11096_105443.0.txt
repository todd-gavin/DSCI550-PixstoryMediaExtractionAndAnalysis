How women’s health impacts the workplace- 

Around 11 million women have taken long-term health breaks during their working lives, and 3 million have left their workplace due to female health issues. 

Woman’s health issues like menstruation to postnatal depression at work place or in daily life have been ignored and they left unaddressed, have a negative impact on both the business and the employee.

With menopause, for example, almost a third of women have taken sick leave due to menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, brain fog, anxiety, fatigue, and migraines – yet only 25% told their manager the real reason why. 

The reason why it is so essential to broaden the discussion around women’s health beyond pregnant workers and new mothers is because nearly all women will experience female health issues at some point in their lives, most of which aren’t covered in workplace policy and general awareness the way pregnancy/maternity leave is.

This requires a level of understanding, compassion, and knowledge from business leaders, senior members of staff and HR.

In the same way that we know someone who has a cold should take time off, we should also know that a woman experiencing brain fog and fatigue should be able to take time off as well – it begins with normalising the discussion around all of women’s health.
