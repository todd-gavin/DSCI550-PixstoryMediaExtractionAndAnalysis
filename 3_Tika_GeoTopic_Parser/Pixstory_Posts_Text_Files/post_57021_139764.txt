It s sad how a serious mental health disorder has been made a topic of humour People enjoy saying they have OCD without suffering from the real issues of the problem And honestly it is not confined to OCD but many such important things are trivialised by misusing it in day to day life The freedom to use language and mould it your way has given light to people who think saying anything anytime to clarify their points would be ok But it is not The thing is not about someone who doesn t have OCD but claims to have it the problem is about the ones who deal with the frustration and joke It is hard for them to see people joking about their health conditions without actually understanding the impact of it People who suffer from OCD already have a lingering shame in them that they think their actions would have caused they re already dealing with social stigmas and at times like this turning their disorder into a joke can make them feel more embarrassed and ashamed In this case they even avoid taking treatment as it would be ignominious
