Gigs The first part of this year has been entirely about gigs However this entire month of April has been a dry spell with not a single gig scheduled for us This is mainly because our lead singer has been travelling a lot this month I ve got a full time job and it is one that I quite enjoy My music is not a form of escape for me It s just another very cool part of my life It does get difficult sometimes when you have to balance the two Many times I schedule my weekly offs for the days I have a gig so it doesn t have any impact on my professional life However sometimes that isn t possible so it s my shift which comes into play So far I ve been lucky with the shifts But there are days when I come back home from a gig at am struggle for sleep drift to sleep at am and then wake up at am for my shift Gotta do what you gotta do Why do I get back home at if I m done playing at A valid question But what s the point of playing a gig and then not being able to soak in the attention from the people in the audience once you get off stage If I m being honest the member who gets the most attention is the singer He s a mid level Instagram celebrity who s got a very loyal following of for some reason really pretty women No joke it s model ville once we get off stage They re all there for him obviously but some of them realise that the rest of the band is pretty cool too After the gig the usual thank you s to the you played really well s the rest of the band can be found religiously in the smoking room When the singer comes to find us that s when the fans come follow him into our cave From there it s every man for himself All this and then I stagger home with a few hours for my shift The rock and roll life
