A simulation game is one in which players create characters and simulate the lives of their creation in a virtual world. Such games have been praised for its lifelike graphics and ability to simulate real-world activities such as dating, marriage, divorce and raising children. It has been criticized for being overly simplistic in its depictions of human relationships. Much like most AIs.

Many critics claim that a simulation game is an inappropriate game for children due to its depictions of sex and violence. Some parents have even gone so far as to ban children from playing the game altogether, which is understandable. However, an aspect that is worrisome about it is how comfortable it has made players with violence. That is something I think about a lot, yet don't have a concrete opinion on. Violence in video games. Many people say that it doesn't affect children but I am not sure how is that possible. The games quite directly communicate to children that violence is okay. And children's minds aren't as developed to make a clear distinction between fiction and reality. Everything influences them, how come not the games?

This is especially alarming because apparently research has shown that some people who play violent video games are more likely than others to commit acts of violence against others. In fact, many criminals including mass shooters were influenced by such games.

Violent video games are also too realistic and create an environment that is comfortable with violence and bloodshed. They cause more aggression, bullying, and fighting.

I'm personally a big fan of such games, I'm just not too sure if teens and kids should be allowed to play them is all.
