•Drinking coffee may help in digestion-

Are you someone who loves coffee? Then you need to read this as a recent study found that drinking coffee may help in improving digestion. Here’s all you need to know about it.

•The Study•

As per a new research, coffee has positive effects on digestion and the gut, and protects against common digestive complaints such as gallstones as well as certain liver diseases.
The study has been published in the 'Nutrients Journal'. The review of 194 research publications suggested that moderate coffee consumption (defined by EFSA as 3-5 cups per day) was not found to generate harmful effects on the various organs of the digestive tract.

•The Analysis•

Two areas of particular interest emerging from the research are the association between coffee and a reduced risk of gallstones and the evidence linking coffee consumption with a reduced risk of pancreatitis, although more research is still needed.
On its journey through the gastrointestinal tract, coffee has three main impacts:
Coffee is associated with gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretions all necessary for the digestion of food. Coffee was found to stimulate the production of the digestive hormone gastrin; and hydrochloric acid, present in gastric juice - both of which help break down food in the stomach. Coffee also stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK), a hormone that increases the production of bile, also involved in digestion.
Coffee appeared to be associated with changes in the composition of gut microbiota. In the reviewed studies, coffee consumption was found to induce changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, mainly at the population level of Bifidobacteria - a ubiquitous inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract.

•Coffee for metabolism•

Coffee is associated with colon motility - the process by which food travels through the digestive tract. The data reviewed suggested that coffee may stimulate motility in the colon as much as cereals, 23 per cent more than decaffeinated coffee or 60 per cent more than a glass of water and it may be linked to a reduced risk of chronic constipation.
