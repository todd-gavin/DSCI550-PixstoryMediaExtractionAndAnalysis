23) Franco Baresi


One of the greatest defenders of all time, Franco Baresi was a rock-solid player in the defense and strikers feared to play against him. The medals and trophies won by Baresi are numerous. During his term with the Italian national team, he won gold in FIFA World Cup in 1982, Silver in 1994 and Bronze in 1990. With AC Milan, he won six Serie A titles and 3 UEFA Champions League titles. Remembering his contribution to the club, AC Milan retired “6” after the final game of his career. 


#22) Bobby Charlton


Sir Bobby Charlton is one of the best-ever players to feature for England. He was part of the World Cup-winning squad of 1966 and is known for his attacking instincts and lethal strike force. Sir Bobby Charlton went on to survive the Munich Air disaster that happened in 1958. He then helped Manchester United to win multiple league titles and also assisted the club to become the first-ever English club to win the Champions League. He was the highest goal scorer for Manchester United until Wayne Rooney surpassed him in 2017. He also has the second-highest number of appearances for the European giants. 


#21) Lev Yashin


Goalkeepers are always neglected when it comes to bigger awards. However, no one can forget what Lev Yashin did for the Soviet Union and his club career during his days. Known as Black Spider, he revolutionized goalkeeping with a lot of commanding nature and his positioning. His reflex saves are less spoken about.  


Lev Yashin had won the European Goalkeeper of the Year award a record nine times and remains the only goalkeeper to win the Ballon d’Or. He was also named in the FIFA Goalkeeper of the 20th Century and the World Hall of Fame of Soccer.
