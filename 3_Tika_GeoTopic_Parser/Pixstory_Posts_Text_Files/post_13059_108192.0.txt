The complex attack on a Sikh Gurdwara in the Karta-e-Parwan area of Kabul city faced strong reactions inside and outside Afghanistan.  
Early Saturday morning, multiple armed attackers stormed into the Gurdwara, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) said.  

At least one member of the Afghan Sikh and Hindu community was killed in the attack, said a spokesman for the MoI, Abdul Nafay Takor, adding that one Islamic Emirate force member was also killed.  

Seven other people were wounded, according to Takor    
Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack and called it a "terrorist incident." 

Karzai called for the start of a national dialogue to establish long-term peace and stability, and pleaded for the country to be saved from suffering through the unity of all Afghans. 

“I strongly condemn today’s heinous and cowardly terrorist attack on our Sikh community Gurdwara in Karta-e Parwan,” said Abdullah Abdullah, former chairman of the High Council National Reconciliation.  

The UN Assistant Mission in Afghanistan on Twitter said it “strongly condemns today's attack on a Sikh temple in Kabul, which is reported to have resulted in numerous casualties. Attacks on civilians must cease immediately.” UNAMA also called for the protection of all minorities in Afghanistan. 

The Pakistan foreign minister in a statement condemned the attack and said it is “seriously concerned at the recent spate of terrorist attacks on places of worship in Afghanistan.”
