Fresh winner of the last and penultimate Wimbledon Novak Djokovic has returned to talk about the future and the next Grand Slam in the States where he risks not being able to participate because he has not been vaccinated In fact, in the United States those who enter must have undergone the entire vaccination cycle A case very similar to that beginning of the season in Australia I was expelled from a country I would like to return to so I would like to return to Australia I love Australia there I have achieved the best results at Grand Slam level so I hope I can do it in January because I want to be there About the American tournament I also want to go in New York and the United States and added I want to go where they allow me to play I am a tennis player not a politician and I do not enter other fields because I am not interested I have my position and I support freedom of choice I respect everyone and I wish others do the same To then conclude If I have permission there will be if I don&#39;t have it there will not be Not the end of the world I still feel young I still feel like I have many years of career so there will be many opportunities
