Construction of the first multi-story 3D-printed home in the United States has begun in Houston, Texas. The home is being constructed out of concrete and a wood frame. With these materials, the home is said to be more resilient and more insulated, allowing for a reduction in energy costs particularly in warmer weather months.The complicated process involves a home being 3D modeled and then that model being fed to a massive, home-sized 3D printer that runs for approximately 20 hours per day by itself.The final home will be approximately 4,000 square feet with 2 stories and uniquely curved walls.Could this be the next step in the future of automation? 3D printing homes will have the effect of reducing the costs of building homes and increase the speed at which they are built â€” of course, it can also take jobs away.
