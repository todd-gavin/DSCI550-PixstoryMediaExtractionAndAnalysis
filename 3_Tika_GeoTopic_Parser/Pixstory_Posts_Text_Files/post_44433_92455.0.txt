The Italian admires the Argentine's accomplishments but wishes he would make his game plans
more exciting. Atletico Madrid's style of play under Diego Simeone has been described as
"boring" by coaching icon Arrigo Sacchi.

Sacchi, who used to manage Atleti, saw Manchester City struggle against a low block in their
1-0 Champions League triumph over the Liga club this week. While Sacchi admires the
Argentine's accomplishments, he believes that more should be done to make his game plans
more visually appealing.

“Simeone has achieved many results in recent years,” Sacchi told Gazzetta dello Sport. “There
is no doubt that his experience as a player in Italy has influenced him as a coach.

“First of all, don't concede goals. And then let's see what happens, let's rely on the talent of
some individuals and hope for the best.

“It's true that Atletico have quality elements, but instead of buying players and spending a lot of
money, they should have spent the money on changing their style.

“Let's face it: this way of playing is boring for the audience. The fans ask for beauty, they ask for
emotions. What emotion can there be in a fifty-metre-long ball?”

Sacchi illustrated his thesis with an example from Euro 2000, disclosing a critical remark from
Pele after Italy defeated the Netherlands in the semi-finals.

Despite his dislike for Simeone's system, Sacchi admits that the Spanish team hasn't been
beaten yet, pointing to Pep Guardiola's lack of a defensive strategy against defensive teams.

Atletico didn't have a single shot on goal but it's not like City had a lot. Apart from [Kevin] De
Bruyne's goal, which was beautiful in its build-up and execution, Sacchi says he doesn't
remember many scoring chances. It was a challenge for them so it wasn't fun. Atletico didn't
want to play football, but City had a duty to do something more to overcome the wall.
