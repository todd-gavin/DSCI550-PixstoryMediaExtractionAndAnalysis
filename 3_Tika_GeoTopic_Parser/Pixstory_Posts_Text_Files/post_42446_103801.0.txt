Tomorrow, the Italian football team will play against the Argentina football team, the football world will get the third champion of “The Finalissima.”

Yes, you heard it right. “The Finalissima” is the one-off fixture played between the Euro Champions and CONMEBOL Champions and because of that Italy (Euro 2020 champions) will face Argent(CONNEBOL champions 2020) on 2nd June 2022 and timings of the match will be 12.15 am.

The Finalissima will be a one-off fixture which will play over ninety minutes and there will be no extra time, which means if the match is level at the end of ninety minutes then the match will be decided by the penalties shoot-out.

Before 2022, The Finalissima happened only twice which was way back in 1985 and 1993 when France defeated Uruguay 2-0 in Paris and Argentina defeated Denmark on penalties in Argentina respectively.

As a neutral fan, I think UEFA and CONMEBOL joined hands to organise “The Finalissima” just to pull more crowds and because of that, they will earn more money from ticket sales and television rights.
