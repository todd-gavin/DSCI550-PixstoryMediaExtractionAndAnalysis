Carlo Ancelotti, the head coach of Real Madrid, has tested positive for Covid-19, according to the club. During the international break, the 62-year-old was directing training at Real's Valdebebas training camp in preparation for a return to La Liga play on Saturday.
Their plans, however, have been thwarted by the news that head coach Carlo Ancelotti has tested positive for coronavirus.
"Real Madrid CF announces that our coach Carlo Ancelotti has tested positive for COVID-19," a brief statement read.
At this point, it's unclear whether the Italian is experiencing any symptoms or is feeling poorly.
Spain has recently abolished its test and isolation laws for persons suffering from symptoms, with the advise now being to limit social interaction, prevent contact with vulnerable people, and wear a mask at all times outside the home.
There are presently no travel restrictions for entering the United Kingdom from Spain for the Champions League match against his previous team.
Real Madrid's most recent encounter was a humiliating 4-0 home loss to Barcelona in the Clasico.
The new laws, which were implemented by the Spanish government on Monday, indicate that both symptomatic and asymptomatic people can continue to work. As a result, if the club chooses, the Italian coach might join the players after they return from international duty this week.
Carlo Ancelotti, on the other hand, is likely to spend a few days at home resting from his sickness. According to 'El Espanol,' he will be temporarily replaced by his son Davide.
Carlo Ancelotti could miss the encounter against Celta Vigo and even the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Chelsea next Wednesday, depending on how long it takes him to recover.
