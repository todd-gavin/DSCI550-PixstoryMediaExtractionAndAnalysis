Constitution Advisor to Bikaner continues....

During this period I was asked by the Government of the United States of Rajasthan if I would agree to take up appointment as the Chief Justice of their High Court. I declined the offer. 

On my release the Maharaja of Bikaner wrote: 

“Even though unfortunately the duration of your term as my adviser was short, your mature advice and counsel were of great help to me and to my Government, especially at the present critical juncture.

 Your going away would be a great loss to me and to my people. I, however, take this opportunity of expressing to you my sincere thanks for your valuable services which I greatly appreciate and I shall always have very happy memories of our association, however short it may have been. I was very glad to hear that you had such a good send off by my people and officers.” 

Before closing the chapter of my stay in the State of Bikaner I must record my appreciation of the very kind treatment that I received at the hands of His Highness, Maharaja Sardul Singh and the heir apparent, Raj Kumar Karm Singh and the Maharani of Bikaner. His Highness was a shrewd and benevolent ruler and had always the good of his people at heart. The Maharani, a great Hindi scholar and a poet, was a shrewd and intelligent observer of events. Kanwar Jaswant Singh, the Prime Minister of the State, was a jewel of a man and his kindness is unforgettable. The people of Bikaner, including the leaders of the Praja Mandal, took very kindly to me. 

My children enjoyed their stay in Bikaner and Abu. They were admitted in the public school in Bikaner which was one of the best schools there. I visited the school a number of times. 

To be continued...
