The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) conference was addressed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who suggested that the organisation think about holding its own big athletic event. US News reported that in a speech at the SCO summit on Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin made it clear that he wanted the organisation, which includes the two most populous nations in the world, China and India, to play a significant role as a global counterweight to the American-led West, which has distanced itself from Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine.Putin said: "There are good opportunities to intensify sports cooperation with the prospect of holding major sporting events under the auspices of the SCO. To do this, we could think about creating an association of sports organisations under our association."Following the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, a doping scandal involving accusations of a state-backed system in numerous sports has resulted in severely limited participation by Russian competitors in consecutive Olympics. Only neutral flags have been permitted for those who have competed.
