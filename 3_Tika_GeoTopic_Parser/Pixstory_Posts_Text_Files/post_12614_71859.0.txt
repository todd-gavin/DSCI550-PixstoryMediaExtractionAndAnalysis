The theory is that people are either left-brained or right-brained, meaning that one side of their brain is dominant. If you’re mostly analytical and methodical in your thinking, you’re said to be left-brained. If you tend to be more creative or artistic, you’re thought to be right-brained.

This theory is based on the fact that the brain’s two hemispheres function differently. This first came to light in the 1960s, thanks to the research of psychobiologist and Nobel Prize winner Roger W. Sperry.

The left brain is more verbal, analytical, and orderly than the right brain. It’s sometimes called the digital brain. It’s better at things like reading, writing, and computations. According to Sperry’s dated research, the left brain is also connected to:
•— logic
•— sequencing
•— linear thinking
•— mathematics
•— facts
•— thinking in words

The right brain is more visual and intuitive. It’s sometimes referred to as the analog brain. It has a more creative and less organized way of thinking. Sperry’s dated research suggests the right brain is also connected to:

•— imagination
•— holistic thinking
•— intuition
•— arts
•— rhythm
•— nonverbal cues
•— feelings visualization
•— daydreaming

We know the two sides of our brain are different, but does it necessarily follow that we have a dominant brain just as we have a dominant hand?

A research found that the two hemispheres are tied together by bundles of nerve fibers, creating an information highway. Although the two sides function differently, they work together and complement each other. You don’t use only one side of your brain at a time.
