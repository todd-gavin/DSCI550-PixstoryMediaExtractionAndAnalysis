Undoubtedly the worst Star Wars movie ever made, The Last Jedi is the biggest middle finger to Star Wars in history, made by an idiotic fool of a director who basically sought to undo the entire legacy of the franchise by basically deconstructing all of The Force Awakens build up and spitting on the entire Star Wars IP in one movie.
 
 The most divisive movie in Star Wars history, in a recent interview with Empire Magazine, Rian Johnson strongly defended The Last Jedi. Looking back on it, “I’m even more proud of it five years on,” he said. “When I was up at bat, I really swung at the ball.” You didn’t swing at the ball, you missed completely.
 
“I think it’s impossible for any of us to approach Star Wars without thinking about it as a myth that we were raised with, and how that myth, that story, baked itself into us and affected us,” explained Johnson. “The ultimate intent was not to strip away – the intent was to get to the basic, fundamental power of myth. And ultimately, I hope the film is an affirmation of the power of the myth of Star Wars in our lives.”
 
This is arrogance and denial in its purest form, from a man who thinks too highly of himself. The fact is, that Last Jedi was made with the viewpoint of subverting expectations, which it did, just done completely wrong.
 
This exemplifies the biggest problem with The Last Jedi and why despite its great financial performance, it was a qualitative disaster. It sought to be over-intelligent while having no respect for the existing lore.
 
 Already, narratively speaking, Star Wars was not in the best place as Ep 7 was not the most original piece of work, but at least JJ Abrams had a vision, even if it was a trip down nostalgia lane.
 
There was an overarching narrative and a pre-existing idea in the works  ruined by Johnson’s entry. Instead of tying his own film with its predecessor,  Ep 8 became its own separate entry, fully discarding everything Ep 7 had worked on.
