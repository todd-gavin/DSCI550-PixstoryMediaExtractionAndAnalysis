Last week I saw movie RRR all the right ingredients Rajamouli after Bahubali success two of finest South Indian stars Bahubali I had liked for its grandeur larger than life presentation Hoped not to be disappointed and all was good till the end after that they went the other way More on this later what however I want to talk about is the anthem for freedom fighters they played post credits The anthem was conspicuous by the absence of two infact three greats of India s freedom fight Gandhi Nehru Ambedkar These leaders specifically Nehru is not mentioned constantly blamed for all the ills that country is facing even current inflation for God sake Till that movement I though it was just the current political dispensation but realised that leaving them out is a norm now While the team of the movie already has clarified that they were giving regional recognition and leaders like Sardar Patel and Bhagat Singh Rani of Jhansi But I want to tell those people these leaders were no regional leaders They didn t fight for Punjab or Gujarat They like Nehru and Gandhi fought for Freedom of India A nation a country not regions or religions Recently an official in a Noida society said in his official page that India is where it in because Godse sacrificed his life These things are in public domain and no one takes any action You can differ in ideology but no nation treats its leaders specifically it s first Prime Minster the way India does We are the way we are today because of these leaders because of the modern vision of Nehru and Ambedkar Because they didn t rely on animal residue for cure they promoted medical research we had medical schools education system at par with the world They invested in Communication technology science history which was not divisive They inherited a massive country without much to count on they had to lay the foundation on which the nation was to be built They did a good job
