… to nudge American influence farther from their borders and unravel U.S. alliances in their respective neighborhoods. Just as Putin frets about NATO encroaching closer and closer on his Russia, Xi stresses about being ring-fenced by a network of U.S. partners across Asia. In this quest to remake the global geostrategic map, a joint effort to increase pressure on the U.S. in Europe and Asia would strain Washington’s attention and resources, and spread doubt about U.S. global commitments. The more the two can trade and invest with each other, the less vulnerable they become to U.S. economic sanctions. If they use their own currencies for that business—as they have pledged to do—perhaps they can even throw off the yoke of the almighty dollar.

But there are plenty of reasons to believe that little of this will happen. Most fundamentally, the two countries are heading in opposite directions. Putin presides over a declining power that lacks the economic vitality to sustain its political clout. He can afford to toss a grenade into the U.S.-led global system. China instead sees itself as a rising power, and that ascent remains tied (at least for now) to that very same world order. Xi, like Putin, wishes to alter the system, but he can’t afford too much disruption. The Chinese economy is so entwined with the rest of the world that any turmoil Xi might cause could boomerang right back at him.
