It is too hard to give a favorite when it comes to Pasta Italy s food are the best in the world There are no pasta dishes which are not good I always go to some good dining restaurant every weekend But at the end I arrived to the conclusion that my favourite pasta dish is the classic Pasta with tomato sauce Pasta al Pomodoro because simple things are always the best I usually made it home whenever I am in mode of eating any Italian I usually put a ton of tomato sauce on my pasta and also a lot of raw olive oil I like it that way I generally don t like putting Parmesan cheese on my pasta but sometimes I use to give my own touch to it by adding sometimes parsley mayo and oregano
