On Wednesday, Hurricane Ian, one of the worst hurricanes ever recorded in the United States, battered the Florida coast. As pointed out by news portals, the path of damage is visible in a number of online videos and pictures. On its official Instagram page, NASA, an American space agency, has since posted a video of Hurricane Ian. On September 28, the International Space Station (ISS) recorded the video. In a terrifying white tint, it depicts the hurricane engulfing the entire area surrounding Florida. The footage appears to show the hurricane consuming everything, which looks awful."Hurricane Ian as seen from the International Space Station (@ISS) on Sept. 28, 2022, as it orbited 258 miles (415 km) above," NASA wrote while sharing the post.
