I had gone to my dance class in the evening. The weather was pleasant. As soon as I came out of the class to go back home, I had to retrace my steps as a speedy motorbike passed by me. Oh! the road rage. Suddenly it became dark and there was a dust storm. Gosh! the visibility became zero but fortunately, my sunglasses came to rescue.



Dust and leaves, garbage and polythenes all danced in a rhythm happily orchestrating down. Wow! the harmony the nature exhibits. Then came down a shower to wash off all the remaining grime and dirt. I stood their aphonic, enjoying and marveling at the cleansing phenomena. The surroundings were as clean as a new slate. Elated I walked forward I saw a boy dropping an ice cream wrapper carelessly on that clean slate .“Another bad signature by man” I grumbled. I thought of picking but preaching sounded better. It worked and I smiled back home. I added a few more pots to my balcony and pledged not to plunder the beautiful nature. For me, that storm was an eye-opener enhancing my insight.



Small acts make great Impacts.
