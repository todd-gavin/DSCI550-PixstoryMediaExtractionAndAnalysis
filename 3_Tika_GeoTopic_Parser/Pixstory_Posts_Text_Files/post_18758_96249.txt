Although the championship victory for PSG is almost official, the season can only be defined as a failure The richest and most expensive team in the world with the addition of Messi failed to make the qualitative leap hoped for, indeed in the Champions League against Real Madrid between and back he showed all the limits that not even money can fill For Leonardo and the rest of the Parisian staff in the summer there will be a few things to put back in order including the enigma of the starting goalkeeper given that Keylor took turns throughout the year Navas and Gianluigi Donnarumma Next year they have already announced from Paris there will only be one left The two goalkeepers are very different and also the market they could have opposed Donnarumma is still years old but earns millions of euros net a year A very expensive signing that Juventus first interested in the goalkeeper would not be willing to spend At the moment there are no other teams interested also due to the cost of the card about million euros PSG took him on a free transfer in the summer For his part Savas has won three Champions Leagues followed with Real Madrid therefore great experience but also his very expensive signing over million euros net per season This year he was the owner in the league but recently he said that the dualism and the rotation with Donnarumma was not positive indeed In short, work for PSG there will be a lot to do starting right from the number
