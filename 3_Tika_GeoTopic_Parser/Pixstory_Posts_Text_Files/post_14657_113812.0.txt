The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned about an outbreak of Listeria on 2nd July. The affected patients have either lived in Florida or have travelled to the state in the same month as they are ill.

23 cases of listeriosis have been report across 10 states - Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. 

In Illinois, one fatality has been detected.
