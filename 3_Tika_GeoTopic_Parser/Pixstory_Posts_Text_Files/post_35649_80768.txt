The performance of the Azzurri in rugby U was nothing short of amazing, annihilating the reigning champions and making history by winning well in a Monigo overflowing with enthusiasm. The Italian defense was great which allowed them to achieve an historic result. The match was dominated by the Azzurri with the result that at times it even seemed to go too tight for coach Massimo Brunello&#39;s boys Prop Riccardo Genovese was awarded the best player on the pitch at the end of the match
