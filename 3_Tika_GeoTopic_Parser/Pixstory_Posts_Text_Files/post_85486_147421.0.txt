It’s nearly time for the World Cup. An unusual time of the season, but we will all adapt to the scheduling.The question on many English fans will be what our starting eleven looks like when we play Iran. The full World Cup squad is yet to be released, but I thought it would be fun to predict the starting 11 in our first group match. I’m predicting the lineup Gareth Southgate will make, as well as my personal team.Southgate’s starting 11RamsdaleWalker - Maguire - StonesTrent - Rice - Phillips - ShawSaka - Kane - SterlingI think Southgate has a team he trusts, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see players that are not currently in league form.My starting 11RamsdaleJames - White - Stones - TrippierBellingham - Rice - MountSaka - Kane - SterlingThe strategy is interior wide-players. Saka and Sterling play close to Kane. I was torn between Foden instead of Sterling. The talent that we have now deserves an aggressive looking side. James and Trippier allow us to switch to a back-3, and Bellingham and Mount create overloads. Rice has the quality to dictate and recycle from our centre-backs.What’s your thoughts?
