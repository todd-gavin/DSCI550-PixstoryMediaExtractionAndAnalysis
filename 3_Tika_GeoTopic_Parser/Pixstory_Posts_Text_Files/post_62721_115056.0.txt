I've gone to a lot of bookstores that had a cafe in them, a lot of cafes that had a little reader's corner in them. But this right here sounds like something straight out of my wildest dreams. I can't imagine just how relaxing it would be and I'd totally look forward to being there everyday.

And honestly, being able to look forward to something is my most favorite feeling ever. It's always great knowing there's something good waiting for us ahead of a hard day. So yes please! A bookstore cafe where I can get my specific coffee with my specific genre of book please!
