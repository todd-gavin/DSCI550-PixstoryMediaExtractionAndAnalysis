Tierney is adaptingTierney started this game in place of the injured Zinchenko, who remains out for a couple of weeks. The question amongst the fanbase is how do we adjust to the stylistic approach depending on who starts. Zinchenko is a hybrid midfielder, coming centrally and starting moves. Tierney was seen taking up central positions, making space for others.Strength in response to defeatOur last league performance against Manchester United resulted in our first league defeat of the season. The performance against Manchester United was positive and fluid in parts, however individual positioning created holes in the defensive phase leading to United taking their opportunities. We responded with a complete and mature performance.Thomas Partey is too good at his jobWe know how important Partey is to our set up, and the break in football last weekend provided recovery time for him. It was essential he returned to play as soon as he possibly could, and his performance was effective once again. Partey had the most passes in our passing network and the most highest xG buildup passes, and you could see how we were denying the Brentford press in the opening stages.Fabio Vieira shines with lovely strike at #10Squad depth won us the match against Brentford. Martin Ødegaard was out, but in came the Portuguese midfield star to start his first Premier League match of the season. The small-framed midfielder saw plenty of the ball, without being too extravagant. What a lovely strike to introduce himself.Saka plays well againSaka had another effective game from the right-hand side, and I personally feel he’s been playing well for large parts of the season so far. Saka is the ultimate space maker for his teammates as he drives at players, and takes up positions of danger against the opposition. He’s playing well, just differently.
