Legendary actor Al Pacino is reportedly dating Noor Alfallah, who is 53 years younger than him. 

Earlier this week, Pacino stepped outside in LA for a painter Julian Schnabel exhibition where he grabbed dinner with other friends including actor Jason Momoa, who shared a photo in which Noor is sitting next to Pacino. 

However, now after many rumours, reports are confirming that they are indeed dating.

Now as per Page Six, the iconic actor and Noor are dating for some time now. Their love blossomed during the covid-19 pandemic.  

Sources via a Page six said, ''Pacino and Noor started seeing each other during the pandemic'' and they don't have any problem with the huge age between them. 

In the past, Noor has dated many wealthy old men including  Mick Jagger, 78, US-based billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen, 60 and others. Alfallah comes from a rich Kuwaiti American family and is also a vice president of Lynda Obst Productions at Sony. 

Al Pacino's dating news comes almost two years after his breakup with Meital Dohan.
