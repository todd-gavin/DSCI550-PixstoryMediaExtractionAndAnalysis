The shipment of Indian auxiliary wheat through Pakistani territory to Afghanistan, after months of controversy, will finally begin in the next few weeks. In the wake of the economic crisis in Afghanistan, India has said that 50,000 tonnes of wheat will be donated to Afghanistan, but so far the shipment through Pakistan has been controversial.

The Indian Express Tribune reported on Saturday that Indian and Pakistani officials had finally agreed on the shipment after months of debate. Earlier, Islamabad had allowed 50,000 tons of wheat, health and medicine to pass through the country, but how it was discussed.

The Express Tribune quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the shipment of Indian humanitarian aid would begin in early February.

According to the agreement between the two countries, all these shipments must be transferred to Afghanistan within 30 days after the start.

The two countries disagreed on how to deliver humanitarian aid. According to the publication, Pakistan wanted Pakistani trucks and trucks with the UN logo to do so, but India wanted Afghan or Indian trucks to transport the cargo. Finally, the two countries have agreed to allow Afghan trucks to transport supplies. For this purpose, a list of names of Afghan contracts with Pakistan has been shared.

Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Asim Iftikhar Ahmad told reporters on Friday that all arrangements had been made and that Pakistan was waiting for India to send the first shipment.

In early October, India sent a request to Islamabad authorities on October 7 to transfer 50,000 tonnes of wheat through Pakistan. Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arindam Begchi said on Friday that the Delhi government was committed to providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. These include food, medicine, and the Covid 19 vaccine.
