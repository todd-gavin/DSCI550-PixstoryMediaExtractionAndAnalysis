Kylian Mbappe wants to leave Paris Saint Germain as soon as possible but already tried to do so in July after penning his renewal There were several discussions then of the representatives of the World Cup champion with the higher ups at the Parc des Princes Upstairs at the club a split was contemplated but it set the price for Mbappe s departure at million euros and the Real Madrid option was roundly rejected With that in mind the name of Liverpool appeared on the table The player himself had recognized in May in his interview with this newspaper after his extension with PSG that the Premier League club had been there attentive always the third in the running However for various reasons Mbappe and his advisers preferred not to pursue this option This is how it was conveyed to the two main players in the talks Nasser Al Khelaifi and Antero Henrique The relationship with both of them and by extension with the French club is worse than ever A point of no return has been reached as it is considered that what was agreed has not been fulfilled Mbappe feels victim of these false promises and political pressures and simply seeks to play soccer in a suitable environment for it without looking at money that he would return if it would free him from PSG Considered Mbappe s sporting mentor he was in charge of choosing the new coach Christophe Galtier a figure of his utmost confidence who did not convince in other areas within PSG The limitations when working and the friction among others with Antero have raised an intolerable climate at PSG with a dressing room that is also fractured and in which the ways of Lionel Messi with Neymar as the main ally are not liked by a powerful group The logical thing then is that Campos would follow Mbappe s path if he leaves PSG Real Madrid had an inkling that this would happen arguing that PSG s operating mechanisms did not fit with the functioning of a team in any sport As of today the signing of Mbappe seems unfeasible for various reasons but in soccer nothing is impossible
