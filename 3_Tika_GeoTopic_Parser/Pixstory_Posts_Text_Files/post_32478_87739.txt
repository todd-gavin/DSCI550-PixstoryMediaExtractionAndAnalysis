The place in the downhill of the Courchevel final was enough for the Italian Sofia Goggia to secure her third specialty cup ahead of the Swiss Corinne Suter who was the only one who could still worry her The race was won by Shiffrin who is ever closer to the crystal ball General The other Italians are also bad with Elena Curtoni Brignonre and Bassino tenth but today the only thing that counted was bringing home the third cup and this Sofia did Better than her in history only Vonn cups Moser Proell Goetschel Saizinger and Figini
