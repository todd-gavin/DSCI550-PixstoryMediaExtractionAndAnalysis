We are in the midst of a period marked by widespread disease, social and political upheaval, economic rifts, and shattered safety nets. The signs of communal trauma are prevalent, whether each of us suffers the horrors of this moment close to home or as part of a greater circle. Many of these signs and symptoms, such as feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or exhausted, may seem familiar. Numbness is one that demands special attention. We've learned a lot about how numbness affects us all as a psychiatrist with a lot of experience treating traumatised migrants and as an author and teacher who works with communal trauma. 

Our news-watching habits exacerbate our problems. During times of uncertainty, we are all vulnerable in our own unique ways. Fears that have been asleep for years could reawaken.
