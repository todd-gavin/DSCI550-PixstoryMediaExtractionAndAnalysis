Hemeroplanes triptolemus.
The snake-mimicking caterpillar, which is native to the Amazonian rainforests, eventually develops into a very ordinary moth in the family Sphingidae, but while it is still a larva, it employs an astounding survival strategy. Sphinx moth larvae are essentially energy-rich food source offered on a bed of leafy greens for the jungle's predators without a strong defence system in place.
However, they wouldn't wanna miss with a viper, would they?
The larva of this moth enlarges and reveals its underside to resemble a snake's head with black eyes and even light reflections in order to avoid that fate. It doesn't exactly do more than intimidate the predator but it works its job pretty well!
