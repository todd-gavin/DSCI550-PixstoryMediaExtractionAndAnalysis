You came to meet me with your mask on,
all that it took you to turn my feelings on,
was to take of the mask.
I never thought I'll feel this way about you,
because never in the world I thought that I would fall in love with you,
but that long shiny hair of yours attracted me towards YOU.
I can never imagine us being in a relationship,
Coz that would ruin our friendship.
Do I want to be in a relationship with you?
YES!
Am I scared because this decision may affect our friendship?
YES!
What do I do now?
Not to tell anyone about how i feel about u
I cant afford to loose you
because I can never imagine a world without YOU
