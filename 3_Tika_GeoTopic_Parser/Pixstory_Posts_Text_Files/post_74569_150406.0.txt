The time of the year is back and the most-awaited and controversial reality show, Bigg Boss is set to return on television with its 16th season this year. Ahead of the show’s premiere, Bollywood superstar Salman Khan launched Bigg Boss 16 on Tuesday, 27 September, in Mumbai at a mega event.  ✅Salman Khan interacted with the media during a press conference on Tuesday night. 💯Reacting to the rumours of his high fees, Salman Khan said, "All those reports about my fees are untrue. If I ever get paid Rs 1000 crore I would never work in my life. But there will be a day when I will be paid this amount. If I get paid this amount I have so many other expenses like lawyers that I actually need them. My lawyers are no less than Salman Khan. My earning is not even one fourth of it. These reports are read by income tax and ED department too." 😱😱😱Salman Khan also said that he doesn't wish to return to BB every year. "There are times when I get irritated and I tell the channel that I don't want to host the show. But they don't have the choice so they come back to me. If they had choice they would have replaced me long back. They would never come to replace me. There are a lot of people who have replaced me," he said. 😱😱😱Salman Khan often loses his temper on Bigg Boss. Talking about that, the actor said, "Yes, sometimes I have to go out of limit because the contestants go overboard. ✅The viewers only watch an hour of episode which is edited but the actual footage we see and the viewers not always understand why I reacted so loudly. They see the edited stuff. Woh nahi dekh paate ke kis level ki badtameezi ki level Paar kar dete hain log. I interfere to stop them from crossing the limit. It doesn't affect me I have other problems to deal with"✅✅
