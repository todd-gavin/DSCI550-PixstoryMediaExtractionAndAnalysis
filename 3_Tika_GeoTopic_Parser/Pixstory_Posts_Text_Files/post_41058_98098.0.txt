Netflix's budget cuts have impacted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the streaming giant has cancelled the royal couple's animated series, Pearl. The series, which was conceived by the Duchess of Sussex, is the conglomerate's third animated kids' project to be cancelled before its premiere. 

David Furnish and Liz Garbus served as executive producers on the series, which follows a little girl who is inspired by historical figures. Pearl was the second project to emerge from the royal couple's overall Netflix arrangement, and it was first announced in July 2021. 

Heart of Invictus, a docuseries produced with the Invictus Games Foundation to follow contestants from the rescheduled Invictus Games The Hague in 2022, is still in the works.
