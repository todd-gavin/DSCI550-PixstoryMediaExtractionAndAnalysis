Lionel Messi continues his top-notch form this season as he scored two goals in a friendly fixture against the Hondorus on Friday night.
After a below-par campaign with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) last season, the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner raced off to a strong start in the ongoing season. He already has five goals and seven assists to his name at club level.
Even for the national team, Messi continues to be the main gun and this was shown yet again when he dropped a marvellous performance in the friendly game against Honduras.
After doubling Argentina’s lead by a penalty goal before half-time, Messi produced a ridiculous chip goal in the 69th minute. He collected the lost possession outside the box and chipped the ball over the goalkeeper who was out of position, netting his second goal of the night.

One last dance for Lionel Messi
Though the great Argentine forward has shown no signs of slowing down, he is already 35-year-old. It won’t be wrong to say that the upcoming Qatar World Cup would naturally be his last one.
Lionel Messi has won every trophy possible in his career so far, except the prestigious FIFA World Cup. Though he managed to reach the finals in 2014, his side were handed a 1-0 defeat by the Germans in a nail-biting encounter.
The World Cup 2022 will be his last chance to get hands on the biggest Trophy in the football world. With their latest win, the Whites and Sky Blues have continued their domination and are now undefeated in their last 34 games.
It looks like the Argentina team are on a mission and they won’t stop until they win the World Cup again. They will definitely head into the tournament as one of the hot favourites.
