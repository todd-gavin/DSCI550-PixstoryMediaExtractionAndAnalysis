An old clip of Michael Jordan dishing out a no-look, behind-the-back pass to Scottie Pippen goes viral on social media.

Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen are arguably one of the greatest duos in NBA history. The Chicago Bulls pair shared the same locker room for more than 10 years and managed to lead the franchise to 6 championships in 8 years. Jordan and Pippen are among the best players that the game had ever seen and pairing them up was just unfair to the rest of the league. 

Jordan-Pippen pairing was as overpowered as it could get, with the two dominating the league on a nightly basis. Now, both the superstars assisted each other on numerous made buckets throughout the course of their careers. The video of one such assist has recently gone viral on social media.

During the fastbreak of one of their clashes against the New York Knicks, “His Airness” dished a beautiful no-look, behind-the-back pass to Pip, who went on to convert the layup.

Pippen and Jordan had one of the most exciting highlight reels of all time. And certainly, this play does feature on that mixtape.

While Jordan is hailed as The GOAT, Pippen too had his moments of glory but was often overshadowed by Michael Jordan.
