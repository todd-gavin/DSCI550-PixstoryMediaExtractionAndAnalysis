Welcome to the new franchise movie reality which looks suspiciously like the old one Veteran performers are being hauled out of retirement and recast in parts they thought they d left behind years if not decades ago It s the antithesis of cancel culture The Guardian reported that A list performers used to sometimes dip their toes into the blockbuster world when they needed money for a new house or a divorce but they re increasingly discovering that as the Eagles put it you can check out any time you want but you can never leave In the last decade franchise films have grown to dominate the box office displacing most other types of films However dominance is far from certain in the aftermath of the pandemic Instead of moving forward mainstream entertainment appears to be travelling backwards back over familiar terrain to familiar characters and perhaps back to a period when blockbusters were a safer bet than they are now The coming year is shaping up to be a repeat of the previous one For instance Morbius a recent superhero spin off gave us a taste of it The movie s post credits scenes which abruptly revealed Michael Keaton who had nothing to do with the preceding quasi vampire shenanigans may have astonished or bewildered casual audiences
