Sometimes we re so desperate to get over our writer s block that we just start writing anything nonsense included Writer s block can be stressful and make you feel useless Everytime I experience one I go through several days of anxiety and my brain keeps telling me that I am of no use Especially when you love writing and are good at it It s like feeling useless at that one thing you re good at It s not a good feeling to say the least It s like you have ideas floating around in the head you have more ideas your mind ia flooded with them and you are excited to pen them down but when you sit down to work it just doesn t work You can t think of how to write You can t form coherent sentences or can t create a foundation of your story Have you ever experienced a writer s block I believe if we write we do experience it at times and that s okay We can t be productive all the time
