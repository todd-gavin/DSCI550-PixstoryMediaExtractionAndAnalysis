From the pass distribution we can see that he has attempted 60.8 passes. He ranks 86% in short passes made, which puts him in the 37 percentile. He has made 33.1 average pass length which puts him in the top 1% which is the 99 percentile. 


The great Dane has made most of his touches in the attacking third of the pitch. He has made 25.87 touches per 90 which puts him in the 85 percentile. The Danish playmaker was the best player for Brentford. Per-minute, he is Brentford’s top performer in six out of eight key on-the-ball metrics: expected assists, key passes (a pass leading to a shot, goal), goal-creating actions, shot-creating actions, progressive passes, and switches.

And in the other two – passes into the penalty area and progressive carries – he comes a close second. He, could play his own game at Brentford and do what he wants. 



Goal Scoring?


The Danish playmaker has scored 1 goal in 938 minutes. Eriksen fired 2.0 shots per 90, putting him in the top quartile amongst midfielders in the Premier League. The 30-year-old had 0.8 shots per game, ranking him at the 94 percentile.

Final Verdict
The Danish playmaker is a free player as he had a short-term contract with the Bees. He has been rumoured to join Tottenham, but he might not. As Antonio Conte manages there. The Italian didn't play the Dane while being at Inter. The only option is Manchester United, who after capturing Tyrell Malacia, are looking to bring reinforcements in the middle of the park and Erik Ten Hag wants him.
