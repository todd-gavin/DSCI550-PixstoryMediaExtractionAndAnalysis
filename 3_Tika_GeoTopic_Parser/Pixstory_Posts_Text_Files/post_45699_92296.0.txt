Scientists have been trying their best to establish contact with alien for decades now but none of them have worked. Although their are speculations about the existence of aliens, there is no solid proof and as we know, the foundational pillar of science is solid hard proof. 

Now, NASA has decided to think out of the box and resort to unconventional ways to discover aliens. 
The project is A Beacon In The Galaxy (BITG).

What is it? Well news portals are saying that a team at NASA is hoping establish contact to extraterrestrial life by sending unsolicited nudes through binary signals outside Earth’s atmosphere in a bid to attract ETI (Extraterrestrial Intelligence). 

A research paper from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory highlights the project and talks about it. “An updated, binary-coded message has been developed for transmission to extraterrestrial intelligences in the Milky Way galaxy. The proposed message includes basic mathematical and physical concepts to establish a universal means of communication followed by information on the biochemical composition of life on Earth, the Solar System's time-stamped position in the Milky Way relative to known globular clusters, as well as digitised depictions of the Solar System, and Earth's surface.” 

Honestly, I don’t know how I feel about this one. Yes, it is ingenious but is it really the best idea? As a space enthusiast, I have learned that some things I come across maybe bizarre but you don’t learn the secrets of the universe through conventional ways.
