If you take the track record of previous movies into consideration then, Welcome was a superhit and audience still watch that movie whenever they show it on TV. As far as Welcome back goes, it maybe have been successful in Box office but not in terms of being a cult classic. ✅

Same deal with Dhamaal, Housefull and Golmaal. The 1st part of these movies did really well and occupied their spots in people's minds. ✅✅

(most of today's memes are from Dhamaal, Hera Pheri, Phir Hera pheri, Welcome etc.) 🔥🔥

Memes are also a good way to judge the success of a movie in people's minds. 😂😁

So coming back to the question, I think Hera Pheri 3 will be a box office hit but a flop in people's minds. 🫥🫥

Today's movies have full of overacting, always an angle of a love story, unfunny punchlines. Hera Pheri 3 will be a success as Hera pheri fans will go to watch it but it won't be a cult classic film.❌🤔
