‌The US is setting the example of how to treat immigrants. The US Congress has introduced a resolution to observe April 14 as National Sikh Day; taking into consideration how the Sikh Community began immigrating over a 100years and their contribution to the development of the US.
‌
‌Sikhism is the world’s fifth-largest religion with nearly 30,000,000 adherents, roughly 1,000,000 of whom have the US as their home. This is a very good step to accepting other cultures and respecting them. Moreover, this will also lessen hate crime in the country. 
‌
‌Here are the heads behind the resolution: Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon, introduced the resolution in the House on March 28 was backed by over a dozen lawmakers: Karen Bass, Paul Tonko, Brian K Fitzpatrick, Daniel Meuser, Eric Swalwell, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Donald Norcross, Andy Kim, John Garamendi, Richard E Neal, Brendan F Boyle and David G Valadao.
‌
‌Let's all cheer and welcome the steps put forward by Congress for accepting cultures and promoting harmony.
