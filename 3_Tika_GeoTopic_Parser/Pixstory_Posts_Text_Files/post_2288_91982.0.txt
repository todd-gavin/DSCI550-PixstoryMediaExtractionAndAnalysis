Interesting story but I can't vouch for the facts. 

If true, the minister has guts. Somehow, I feel as if I know the person. 

Anyways, it seems he has the blessings of the ideological mentor. The minister also claims that he has the support of 252 MPs. A clear threat. 

It will be interesting to see how the ruling side responds to this story.
