Argentina continued their unbeaten run as they beat Jamaica 3-0 in a friendly match on Friday night. They now haven’t seen a defeat in their last 35 games over the last three years.
Lionel Messi, who started the game off the bench, shined again as he scored a brace after coming on the field in the 55th minute. He scored a vintage goal running towards the Jamaican goalpost to place the ball perfectly.
Just three minutes later, Messi treated the fans with another piece of art as he found the back of the net from a set piece. With this brace, the forward’s goal tally now accounts for 90goals for the national side.
After the game, a fan invaded the pitch to get the Argentine’s autograph on his bare back.
Though Messi started signing, the security guards interrupted in between which left the attempt unsuccessful.

Lionel Messi - The main gun of Argentina
Lionel Messi’s incredible run will boost Argentina’s chances in the upcoming Qatar WorldCup. Not only for the national side, but it seems like the 35-year-old has found his rhyme even at PSG as his numbers have been extraordinary so far this season.
After yet another masterclass from Messi, coach Lionel Scaloni compared him to tennis great Roger Federer, who recently retired from the game.
“He is like Federer. He retired and the entire world got emotional thinking he won’t be here anymore," he told TyC Sports.
“It was wonderful to see him play. The same thing with him, although much more because football is a sport that moves much more. It’s why the entire world enjoys him, regardless of the country,” he added.
It was Argentina’s last game before their World Cup opening fixture against Saudi Arabia on November 22 at the Lusail Stadium.
