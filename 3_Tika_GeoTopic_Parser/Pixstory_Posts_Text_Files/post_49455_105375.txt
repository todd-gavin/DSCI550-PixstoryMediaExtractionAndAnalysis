Human is curious that s an undeniable fact Out curiosity has taken us to discover many marvels and in that process destroying the planet to the point of no return Some safari maybe better than the others but they are never ethical They can never be Simply because of the fact that we are invading the wild animals homes damaging their ecosystem and making conditions inhabitable for them If that was ever as ethical as so many people claim it is we wouldn t be on the brink of losing our ecosystem wildlife and the planet So many species of flora and fauna have gone extinct or are on the verge of extinction I mean just how ethical can you make that exactly And how safe can you make it for those natives that you re forcing in the wild and in dangerous conditions because they need money and you re taking advantage of that For example in a safari guide was mauled by a leopard in South Africa while giving the tourists a jungle tour Obviously the tourists had no training of what to do in these situations and were unable to help In the end he helped himself out of that situation but with bad injuries How safe was that for him and those accompanying him And that s not it the leopard was later put down for attacking the man Now you go to a natural predator s natural habitat for your unnatural entertainment and then kill it because it acted by its nature How ethical is that We are habituating the wild s predators to leave their instincts and when they act on it we kill them That s how we are disrupting the ecosystem and as long as we believe we re entitled to every aspect of nature we will keep doing that successfully putting ourselves in an apocalyptic position
