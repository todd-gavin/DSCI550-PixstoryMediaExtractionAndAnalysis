Republicans in the Senate have halted a Democratic proposal to protect people s ability to cross state lines to seek an abortion Even one of the senators said that proposal would encourage abortion tourism and help fly in abortionists The bill from Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto came in reaction to moves by Republican led states to stop people from traveling to seek abortions following the supreme court s ruling last month overturning the right to access the procedure nationwide Democrats tried to get the Senate to pass the measure unanimously on Thursday but Republicans refused to do so Montana Republican Steve Daines was among those rejecting the measure saying in a floor speech that it was hastily put together and very very extreme This bill would give fly in abortionists free rein to commit abortions on demand up to the moment of birth Daines said This bill also protects the greed frankly of woke corporations who see it s cheaper to pay for an abortion an abortion tourism than maternity leave for their employees This is disrespectful even after the issue for about years had caused concerns nationwide Things are getting worse in the US day by calling it abortion tourism is how demeaning When will the Republicans learn to respect women and their choices Every time bills come in Republicans rejects them and it s almost like democrats know what will happen and still comes up with a bill This system sometimes doesn t feel democratic Source The Guardian
