Afghanistan has been a major destination for Indian sugar, and India one of the biggest importers of Afghan spices and dried fruits, especially apricots and figs.

The chaos that followed the Taliban takeover of Kabul in August last year saw India shutting down its mission and pulling out of Afghanistan. With the country’s economy in a shambles and diplomatic ties suspended — India has still not recognised the Taliban regime — bilateral trade, which took a hit in the immediate aftermath of the takeover, picked up again. Via Dubai, and its banks.

Afghanistan has been a major destination for Indian sugar, and India one of the biggest importers of Afghan spices and dried fruits, especially apricots and figs. The Taliban takeover took place at a time when Afghanistan was expecting a bumper crop of dried fruits, most of it meant for India.

With the collapse of the economy and no diplomatic relations, there was uncertainty over the fate of this bilateral trade which included other exports from India and was valued at $1.5 bn in 2019-2020.

But 10 months down the road, Indian traders say their Afghan exports and transactions are proceeding smoothly after a short interruption, even though total trade in the 2021-22 fiscal fell by nearly 40 per cent in value over the previous year.

Last fiscal, total trade was Rs 3,719.76 crore, as against Rs 6,106.20 crore recorded in 2020-21, according to trade statistics of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

But Indian exporters have continued to send goods by sea to Karachi port, and from there by road to Afghanistan. Afghanistan’s exports have been trickling in through the Chabahar port in Iran, and the Wagah border with Pakistan.
