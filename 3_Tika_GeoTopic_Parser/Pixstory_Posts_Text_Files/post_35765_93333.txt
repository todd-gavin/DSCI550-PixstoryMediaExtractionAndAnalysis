Very bad news for Udinese and its fans The Bianconeri striker Beto has in fact suffered a flexor injury and will be forced to stay in the pits for at least two weeks, therefore almost certainly missing the matches against Venice and Empoli but also the recoveries against Salernitana and Fiorentina Mister Cioffi has some chance of recovering his striker for the match against Inter in May Isaac Success will certainly find more space who will have to be ready to replace the Portuguese alongside Gerard Deulofeu
