Abstract
The best nutritional practices for exercise and sports performance are largely activity specific. The presence of type 1 diabetes undeniably bestows additional factors to consider to manage exercise and ensure adequate nutrients and fuels are available for optimal performance. Whether participating in sports or physical activity on a recreational basis or striving to achieve a high level of athletic performance, individuals with type 1 diabetes must pay attention to their nutritional and dietary patterns, including intake of macronutrients, micronutrients, fluids and supplements, such as caffeine to maintain metabolic and glycemic balance. Performance aside, nutritional recommendations may also differ on an individual basis relative to exercise, glycemic management and body weight goals. Balancing all these dietary factors can be challenging for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and many related aspects have yet to be fully researched in this population.
