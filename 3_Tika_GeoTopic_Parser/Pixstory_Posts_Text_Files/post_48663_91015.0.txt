Kemba Hudley Walker was born on May 8, 1990, to Paul Walker and Andrea Walker, in the Bronx, New York. He has two brothers – Akil Walker and Keya Walker, and one sister – Sharifa Walker.

During his junior year, he once played against Simeon Career Academy and senior guard Derrick Rose in a 53-51 victory at Madison Square Garden. He earned a spot on the prestigious McDonald's All-American Team, when he posted 18.2 points and 5.3 assists per game in his senior year.

He now holds the NBA record for most three-point field goals made in the first three games of a season, with 19, breaking Danilo Gallinari's previous mark of 18 set in 2009-2010.

He also set a record by being the first player in NBA history to make five or more three-point field goals in each of the first three games of a season.

He signed a multi-year shoe agreement with Under Armour, Inc., one of the main American sports equipment companies, shortly after being picked. He was the first rookie to achieve so from the 2011 Draft Class. 

He signed with Jordan Brand, a Nike subsidiary that specialises in basketball shoes, after his contract with Under Armour expired.

With his 250th 3-pointer on April 7, 2019, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, he became the eighth player in NBA history to connect on 250+ 3-pointers in a season.

During that season, he received the Bob Cousy Award as the best point guard in collegiate basketball, among many other honours.

Following the Division I Championship victory, Walker was named to the Huskies of Honor, becoming the first men's basketball player to do so since the inaugural class was announced in December 2006.

After being 0-28 versus LeBron James to start his career, he won his first head-to-head matchup in January 2020, with 20 points, seven assists, four rebounds, and a steal.

Apart from being a basketball player, he is also a very good dancer, and has performed three times at the Apollo Theatre for the TV show “Showtime at the Apollo.”
