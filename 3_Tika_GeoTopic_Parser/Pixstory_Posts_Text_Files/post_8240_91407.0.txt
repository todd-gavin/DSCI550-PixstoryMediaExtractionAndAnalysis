The ballots hit inboxes of Kia MVP voters everywhere this week, but Giannis Antetokounmpo keeps making it increasingly difficult to punch send.

For the second time in three nights, Antetokounmpo engineered a Milwaukee comeback victory over an Eastern Conference heavyweight on Thursday, sinking two free throws with three ticks left in overtime as the Bucks bested the Brooklyn Nets 120-119 at Barclays Center.

The win lifted Milwaukee to within a half-game of Miami for the lead in the Eastern Conference standings.

Antetokounmpo made it all possible by draining a 3-pointer with 18 seconds left in regulation to force OT on a shot that moved him past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Milwaukee’s all-time leading scorer.

“It’s just a tribute to everything he does all the time, the work he puts in. [He] just kind of does whatever we need to win a game,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “To make the 3 to send it to overtime and make the free throws to win it, he’s special. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is just one of the iconic players in our league.

“So, for Giannis to pass him as organizationally our all-time career leading scorer, to have a front-row seat for the last almost four years, I just feel incredibly fortunate. To see where he’s come from, how hard he’s worked, and all the great coaching he’s gotten along the way, it’s just beyond impressive what he’s done, and he’s got a lot more left ahead of him.

Antetokounmpo moves up a spot in this week’s edition of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. But with nine days remaining in the regular season, the race remains too close to definitively call. Like the fringe teams clawing for berths in the postseason and Play-In Tournament, Antetokounmpo continues to surge during crunch time of this MVP race with stellar two-way play.

Antetokounmpo poured in 44 points to go with 14 rebounds and six assists against a desperate Brooklyn team, producing his second 40-point outing since Tuesday, when he scored 40 points with 14 rebounds and the game-clinching block on Joel Embiid in a comeback win over the Philadelphia 76ers.
