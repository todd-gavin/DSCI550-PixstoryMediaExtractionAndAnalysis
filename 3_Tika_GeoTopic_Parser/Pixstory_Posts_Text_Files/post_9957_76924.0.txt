On the frigid afternoon of Jan. 23 in Washington, D.C., the “Defeat the Mandates” rally brought together a crowd of right-wing conspiracy theorists and vaccine skeptics. The anti-vaccine movement, once a fringe cohort, has repositioned itself as an opposition to mandates and government overreach, writes Vera Bergengruen. The distinction has attracted legions of supporters by tapping into the anger, exhaustion, grief and frustration of millions of Americans as the pandemic enters its third year. In the crowd, fresh anger mixed with repackaged old grievances. The spectacle was part Trump rally, part conspiracy convention, part protest. Only a handful of the three-dozen rally-goers who spoke to TIME said their anti-vaccine stance predated COVID-19. Most cast their attendance as a fight against something larger—a way to channel their frustration with the government response to the pandemic, or an outlet for leftover resentment from the 2020 election. All of them said it would be their top priority when they next go to the polls.
