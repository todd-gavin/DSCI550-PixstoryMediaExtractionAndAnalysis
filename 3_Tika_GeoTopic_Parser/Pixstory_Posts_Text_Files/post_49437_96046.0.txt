Privacy is the currency of our internet persona, with bits of personal information being exchanged for minor comforts. However, we are blissfully unaware of what that entails. Because, well, that's private, we don't know what data is being bought and sold. The evidence that flashes before our eyes appears to be innocuous enough: We simply search for a new t-shirt, and within a moment, the company follows us throughout the web, luring us from every sidebar. Our data, on the other hand, can be used for problems of tremendous public importance in ways we can't even imagine.

You can't expect your communications to be strategic documents for a power-hungry firm seeking total road dominance when you sign up for something. Such costs are often only discovered after they have already been paid. When a private citizen is caught up in a viral moment, they may discover that a wealth of information about them is available online, ready to be splashed across the headlines. 

Companies that mine data on us know everything there is to know about us, but we know very little about what they know. And, just as "privacy" has become a tense buzzword, the rich have appropriated it to keep control over others and avoid accountability. We've seen corporations and government officials become increasingly enraged about their own need to be left alone as we bargain away the level of privacy that the average person expects. To better conceal their business operations, companies require nondisclosure agreements and out-of-court arbitration. In 2013, Facebook removed the option for users to remain unsearchable on the site; at the same time, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, was buying up four residences in the Palo Alto neighborhood to protect his privacy.

The rich don't exactly care about the privacy laws in the end, because more often than not they get away with violating them.
