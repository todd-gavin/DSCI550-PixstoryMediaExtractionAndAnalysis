Luis Enrique

Luis Enrique is a versatile, technically gifted midfielder who has appeared in over 200 games on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as a half-century of international caps for Spain.

Despite winning three trophies in five years at Real Madrid, he left for Barcelona on a free transfer in 1996, claiming that he felt underappreciated in Madrid.

It took some time to win over the Barcelona supporters. But, after scoring in multiple Clasicos against his former team, he became a popular figure and a well-liked captain.

Luis Enrique was a footballer who won two league titles and various other trophies before becoming the manager of Barcelona, where he won two more league titles and the 2015 Champions League.

Samuel Eto'o

After being identified at the Kadji Sports Academy in Cameroon, Eto'o joined Madrid as a kid. But he never quite cut it in the capital, with more loan periods away from the club than league outings for them.

He eventually moved to Mallorca, where he scored 54 goals in four and a half seasons before joining Barca in 2004.

He savoured the opportunity to show Madrid what they were missing. He scored 29 goals in his first season and 34 in his second, totaling 130 goals in all competitions with the club.

Eto'o's stint in Catalunya was a resounding success, with three league crowns and two Champions Leagues. In 2009, he moved to Inter, where he won the treble under Jose Mourinho.
