Dhaakad was a disaster at the box office... It only managed to sell 20 tickets and earned Rs 4,420 countrywide. There were many trolls about the movie and also on the lead actress Kangana. 

And today Kangana hits all trollers by posting an Instagram story... Where she says 
Why is only Dhaadkad being criticized??? while many other movies did do as good as they expected. She points out a few movies which were failures at the box office.

Kangana wrote in her IG story while calling films like Gangubai, Jug Jug Jeeyo, Radhe Shyam & 83 a flop, “Every day I wake up to hundreds of articles of Dhaakad being a flop… and no one is talking about these big disasters…any specific reason?”

What is your opinion for her response?? 

Is she playing a “Blame game”?? 
Or 
Trying to say she is being “Targeted”?
