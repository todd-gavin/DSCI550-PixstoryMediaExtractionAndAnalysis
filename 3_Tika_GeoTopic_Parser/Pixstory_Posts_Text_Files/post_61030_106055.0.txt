Constantly on the run,
Lost in this rat race,
Having to worry about the future and what it holds constantly.
Why do we go through so much planning and overthinking?
What is its purpose, and does it do any good to us?
We have always been told to make a plan and worry about the future regarding studies, marks, college, career, family, marriage, and so much more. But from what I have experienced, it is a waste of time to make a plan while being worried. Life is a journey to be savored and enjoyed, not a destination that we need to reach. Every day is a new opportunity to savor the moment. It is good to make a plan for the future, but it should be done on a realistic measure and balanced in a way where you enjoy studying or working to make a career. "Everything is going to be okay" is my way of taking a break to remind myself of the true purpose of life, not to work under worry and pressure but to enjoy the ups and downs of this rollercoaster.
