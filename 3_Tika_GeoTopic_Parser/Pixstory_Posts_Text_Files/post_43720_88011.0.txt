After the quarter-final and semi-final draws in Switzerland on Friday morning, the eight clubs left in the Champions League have found their way to the final.

There are four exciting matches to look forward to, featuring the reigning champions Chelsea taking against Real Madrid.

The semi-finals were then drawn. The first leg of those ties will be held in late April, with the final taking place on Saturday, May 28 in Paris.
With three teams from each country, England and Spain are well-represented.

Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester City will all be hoping to maintain England's recent success in the Champions League, where the country has produced two of the last three winners.

Meanwhile, Real Madrid, Villarreal, and Atletico Madrid represent Spain, having eliminated Manchester United in the last 16.

Data analysts, on the other hand, anticipate that the trophy will be awarded to Germany this year.

Before the draw, the team at FiveThirtyEight predicted Bayern Munich will win the Champions League with a 26 percent chance.
Man City (25 percent) and Liverpool (23 percent) are close behind, with reigning champions Chelsea getting a 10% chance.

Real Madrid and Carlo Ancelotti, on the other hand, know what it takes to win the event and cannot be discounted.
