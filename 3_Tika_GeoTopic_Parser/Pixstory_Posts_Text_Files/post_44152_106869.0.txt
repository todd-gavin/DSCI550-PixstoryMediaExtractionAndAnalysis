Struggling Arsenal left-back Nuno Tavares is wanted in a loan transfer by French outfit Marseille, according to reports. Tavares joined the Gunners last summer from Benfica in a 7.2 million euros deal. The 22-year-old was handed more game time than what he was most likely expecting the last term, with starting left-back Kieran Tierney struggling with injuries.

Tavares was a hit and miss for the Gunners. At times, he would look electric going forward.
But often he was defensively vulnerable. And according to Lions de l’Atlas, Tavares could be handed the chance to improve on loan in France.

Giants Marseille are believed to have made contact with Arsenal over the left-back. The 
Ligue 1 runners-up would like to take Taveres on loan for the 2022-23 season. Arsenal has already drafted a contract with Bologna over the signing of highly-rated Scotland international Aaron Hickey. The 20-year-old left-back featured 36 times for the Italian outfit last term.

Hickey impressively found the back of the net five times. However, Mikel Arteta’s men could face competition from fellow Premier League outfit West Ham United. David Moyes is keen to add a left-back to his defensive ranks with long-time servant Aaron Cresswell ageing and Arthur Masuaku proving unreliable.

Hickey has been valued at 21 million euros in some quarters.

Taveres’ departure could allow Arsenal to further their interest in versatile Bologna full-back Aaron Hickey. In addition, they have been linked with Manchester City utility man Oleksandr Zinchenko. Although, they may prefer to use him as a midfielder.

Still only 22, Arsenal should not make any hasty decisions about his decisions. His contract is due to run until 2025. As such, there is no urgent need to sell if they do not believe in him.
