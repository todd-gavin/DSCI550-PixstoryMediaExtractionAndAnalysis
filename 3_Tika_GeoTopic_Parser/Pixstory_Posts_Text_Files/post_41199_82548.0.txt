In 1524, the first European explorer, the Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano, wrote the first documented history of New York City. The Dutch were the first Europeans to arrive in 1608. 

In New York City, the "Sons of Liberty" campaigned against British rule, and the Stamp Act Congress, which included members from all Thirteen Colonies, assembled in the city in 1765 to organise resistance to Crown policy. Because of its strategic location and importance as a major seaport, the city was a desirable target for British capture in 1776. The British Army invaded New York and made it their stronghold after General George Washington lost a series of engagements from which he narrowly escaped (with the notable exception of the Battle of Harlem Heights, his first victory of the war) and the British Army occupied New York and made it their base on the continent until late 1783, attracting Loyalist refugees.

From 1785 to 1789, the city was the national capital under the Articles of Confederation, and from 1789 to 1790, it was the new nation's capital under the United States Constitution. The city hosted the inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States, the drafting of the United States Bill of Rights, and the establishment of the United States Supreme Court under the new government. With the construction of the Erie Canal, the city became the leading port on the Atlantic Ocean, with good steamboat links to upstate New York and the Great Lakes, as well as coastal business to lower New England. In the 1840s and 1850s, rail connections to the north and west bolstered its central position.
