The summer transfer window is slowly getting heated up. The clubs are looking to land the signatures of their primary targets whereas the selling clubs and agents are not willing to let go of their profit margins. Amidst the players who are in talks with a move to England, Gianluca Scamacca stands tall on the list.

Gianluca Scamacca is linked with a move to Arsenal as they are looking to replace the voids left by Pierre Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. The team is left with Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah. The club needs a proven striker and are linked with Victor Osimhen, Gabriel Jesus and Gianluca Scamacca. Victor Osimhen seems to be a possible dream whereas Scamacca is undeterred by the unwanted attention. 

Talking to media, the Italian player sidelined the speculations by stating: 

For those who know me, I am a very simple boy who is living a dream and will do everything to get as far as possible

I don't read these things. Only the pitch counts. The numbers are made up by the clubs. For me, the pitch and have fun counts. 

According to reports, Arsenal’s first informal bid was turned down by Sassuolo as they value their player highly. Arsenal are yet to make a formidable first offer for the striker. 

In the previous season, Gianluca Scamacca raised the eyebrows of the football clubs by setting the Serie A stage on fire. The player scored 16 goals from 36 games in Serie A. He also had an assist to his name in Coppa Italia. The player averaged a goal every 134 minutes in the league. The striker occupied the sixth position in the Golden Boot race. Ciro Immobile won the prestigious Golden Boot in the Italian top-flight.
