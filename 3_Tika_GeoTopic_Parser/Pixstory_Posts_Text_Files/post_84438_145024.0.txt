If you want to start playing basketball but don't know what position to play, allow me to offer some assistance:
Center: The center is the tallest player on each team, playing near the basket. The center tries to win rebounds and score or block, depending on the possession. 
Power Forward: The power forward does many things a center does, but also takes longer shots than the center. 
Small Forward: The small forward plays against small and large players, their presence all over the court. 
Point Guard: The point guard runs the offense and is usually the best dribbler and passer. 
Shooting Guard: The shooting guard us usually the teams best shooter and is also a good dribbler.
