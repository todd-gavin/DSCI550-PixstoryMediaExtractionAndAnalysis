Transgender and non-binary persons are often dehumanized, mocked, sensationalized and stigmatized in news, media, and films. 

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019 prohibits any wrongful portrayal of the community which causes emotional abuse.

A trans-affirmative media can play a vital role in decreasing stigma, reducing violence, and changing the narratives on how trans and gender nonconforming folks are perceived in India.

Communi-T is conducting this workshop on trans-affirmative reporting in partnership with Canada in India, where we will share lived experiences, technical guidance, hands-on working and networking opportunities for journalists, reporters, writers and filmmakers.

The workshop is by invite-only, but will be documented in this space. 

What To Expect: 
Introduction by Dr. Aqsa Shaikh, Founder, Human Solidarity Foundation
Panel discussion on ‘Reporting it Right’
Legal aspects of Trans representation and reporting in media
Do’s and Don’ts of Trans representation
Medical Aspects of Transgender experiences
Way Forward

About Communi-T:

Communi-T is an initiative hosted at Human Solidarity Foundation, Delhi that is working towards the empowerment of transgender and non-binary communities through legal empowerment and sensitization of stakeholders for a stigma-free and enabling environment. 

Communi-T is intersectional and consists of trans people, queer folks and allies from the fields of healthcare, law, social media, and advocacy. We intend to engage with stakeholders like healthcare professionals, lawyers, policy makers, academicians, corporates and journalists, to create a stigma-free and enabling empowerment for TGNB Folks.
