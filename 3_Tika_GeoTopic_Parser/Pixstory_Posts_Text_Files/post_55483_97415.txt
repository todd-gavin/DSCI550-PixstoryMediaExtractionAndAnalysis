I purchased a book today called Option B It s a self help book dealing with immense damage within one s self and how to cope and heal one self What I ve realized dealing with mental illness is It s okay to take your time to process or to get help even though getting help is the best way out it s normal to lay back and process your feelings on your own No matter where you are in your healing journey there will be various breakdowns time and again which will make you believe it s better to give up this is where you don t And work even more harder on yourself
