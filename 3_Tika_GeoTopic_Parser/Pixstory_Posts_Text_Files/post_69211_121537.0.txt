According to officials, a group of 570 pilgrims departed from the Bhagwati Nagar base camp on Tuesday in order to pay respects at the 3,880-meter-high cave shrine of Amarnath in the south Kashmir Himalayas. 
The traditional 48 km route from Nunwan in Pahalgam, in Anantnag, in south Kashmir, and the 14 km shorter but steeper Baltal route in Ganderbal district, in central Kashmir, were the starting points for the 43-day Yatra on June 30. 
According to them, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) provided intense security when the 33rd group of pilgrims departed in a convoy of 21 vehicles. 
According to officials, the first convoy to depart the Jammu base camp was made up of 346 pilgrims travelling to Baltal in 10 cars, followed by a second convoy of 11 vehicles carrying 224 pilgrims to Pahalgam. 
As the yatra nears completion and due to unfavourable weather, the number of pilgrims visiting the cave shrine is sharply declining, according to officials. 
Since June 29, 1,43,693 pilgrims have travelled from the Bhagwati Nagar base camp to the Valley. 
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, on August 11, the yatra is said to come to an end. 
With the exception of the 15 pilgrims who perished in the flash floods at the Amarnath cave sanctuary on July 1, a total of 36 individuals, predominantly pilgrims, have died up to this point. (Agencies)
