Independents are challenging the Liberal Party in a swath of primarily inner-city seats. 
The Guardian reported that the counterattack has been intense, with surveys suggesting independents have a chance to take traditionally blue-ribbon seats including as Wentworth, North Sydney, Kooyong, Goldstein, and Curtin. 

But what exactly do Liberals mean when they call their opponents "false independents," and is this a legitimate accusation? 

An independent candidate, according to Prof Graeme Orr of the University of Queensland, is one who is "not backed by a registered party." Parties must have a constitution, endorse candidates, have 1,500 registered members, and use their name on the ballot. Although historically independents tended to be breakaways from political parties, independents have had success organising without prior party affiliation.

Therefore, liberal MPs use blatant hyperbole when they call their opponents "false independents," but they have the right to advocate their position. 
Independent candidates may face partisan assaults if they remain mute on who they would want to lead in a hung parliament, but that does not indicate they are not independent of the major political parties.
