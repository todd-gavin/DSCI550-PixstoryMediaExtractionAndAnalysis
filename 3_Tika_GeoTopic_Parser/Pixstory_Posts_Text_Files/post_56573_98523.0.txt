When you’re famously one of the most beautiful women in the world, that’s a lot of pressure to look good. But like everything else thrown at Angelina Jolie, 46, that doesn’t seem to phase her. The actress and filmmaker is equally known for her philanthropic work, which explains her belief that the best way to be beautiful is through your intellect. “I often tell my daughters that the most important thing they can do is to develop their minds,” Angelina wrote in an essay for ELLE. “You can always put on a pretty dress, but it doesn’t matter what you wear on the outside if your mind isn’t strong. There is nothing more attractive—you might even say enchanting—than a woman with an independent will and her own opinions.”
