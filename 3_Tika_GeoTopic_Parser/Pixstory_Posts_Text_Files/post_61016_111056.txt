Polaroids are my favorite type of picture It is such a personal and memorable form of photography This one was of my table tennis team and me when we traveled to Bijnor Uttar Pradesh for our National tournament It was a wonderful experience having it captured in a polaroid is one of the best forms of treasuring memories
