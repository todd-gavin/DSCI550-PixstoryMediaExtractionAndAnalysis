Sometimes what people say isn t the right thing What has been generally accepted by society as the truth isn t the truth because truth comes from experiences and each person has their own experiences making it different for everyone to interpret process and accept that truth People say that forgiveness is the greatest act of kindness Forgiving someone is not easy but when you do it you have an upper hand over the person However I feel that every time forgiving a person isn t the best option as it is a constant reminder for you to dwell on your past I believe that forgiving someone doesn t give you closure it doesn t give closure to your feelings rather it suppresses your emotions that have been building up for a while And when emotions or feelings aren t expressed it causes turmoil inside the head a clutter that can hamper your growth physical mental and emotional People take advantage sometimes you forgive them and they would do the same thing again thus sometimes it s important to prioritize yourself and do what s the best Forgiving someone doesn t mean that you have done something wrong or you are selfish not forgiving someone gives you a chance to stand up for yourself It helps you rediscover yourself by fighting the thoughts that once used to bother you and made you question your self worth You can t forgive every person who has wronged you it doesn t work that way which is completely fine Taking your time and acknowledging the entire situation is something that s a viable option here Ignoring what happened will only deepen the wounds and not help you to go past the incident Image Source Greatist
