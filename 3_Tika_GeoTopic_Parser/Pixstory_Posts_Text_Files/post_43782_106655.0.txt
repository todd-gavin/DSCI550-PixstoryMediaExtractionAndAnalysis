One of the most surreal moments of the 2021-22 season was “Busquets to the bench’ trending on Twitter during the season. While the hashtag was a particularly bizarre way of manifesting it, it does touch on a debate with clearly drawn lines in Can Barca.

Some believe that Sergio Busquets now is incapable of performing at the highest level and is a hindrance when Barcelona come up against the best teams in Europe. Others feel that Busquets is not the problem, rather the issue is systematic and placed in the right team, Busquets continue to be one of the best in what he does.

One way or the other, a succession plan cannot be too far down the line, with his contract up at the end of the 2024 season. One of the names that have been touted as an option to occupy Busquets’s option is Ruben Neves.

The 25-year-old Portuguese was highly rated as a youngster and now stands out for Wolves in midfield. He is also a client of Jorge Mendes and supposedly was brought up during a dinner with Barcelona’s Sporting Director during the week.

According to Mundo Deportivo however, Neves is not an option for Barcelona this summer.

Xavi Fernandes has faith in Busquets to perform the starting role again this season and counts on Franck Kessie and Sergi Roberto to fill his absence. There are plenty of positions to strengthen in Barcelona and with limited funds, it makes sense to prioritise other areas.

Neves is a natural pivot that can project to the attack with frequency, without neglecting his works of the mark. Skilful with the ballon in the feet and intelligent to position the field.

Nevertheless, his high cost does that the technical body advises to the directive cule go by other more urgent reinforcements this summer.
