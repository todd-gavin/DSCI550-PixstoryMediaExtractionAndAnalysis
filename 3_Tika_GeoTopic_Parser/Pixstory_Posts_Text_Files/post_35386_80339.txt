Confirmations have arrived from Inter about the injury sustained by Alessandro Bastoni during last night&#39;s Coppa Italia match The Nerazzurri defender suffered a stroke during the first half of the match against Roma and was forced off the pitch in pain and in tears The worst was feared but perhaps the danger of a serious injury was averted the ankle sprain was in fact confirmed after the checks In any case Bastoni will be re-evaluated in the next few days taking into account the fact that he will not be able to take the field for the next two rounds due to disqualification remedied in the league He will instead be able to recover for February when the eighth leg of the Champions League with Liverpool will be scheduled
