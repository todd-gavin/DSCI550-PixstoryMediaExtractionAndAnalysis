King Charles' empty seat in a row front  has a major significance. During Queen Elizabeth's committal ritual on Monday, spectators in St. George's Chapel noticed an empty seat in front of the new monarch. However, contrary to what some have surmised, the chair is not intended to pay tribute to any other royals who have passed away. People reported that in these circumstances, the chair in front of the monarch is always left free so that, if they are not placed in the front row, they can see the proceedings clearly from the second row. Similar to this, Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's wedding and Prince Harry's coronation both had an empty seat in front of the late Queen Elizabeth.The Queen didn't need the accommodation at Prince William and Kate Middleton's 2011 ceremony, however, as she was seated in the front row then.Moreover, Queen Elizabeth memorably sat in the same spot at the 2021 funeral of Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years. Due to COVID-19 restrictions that required social distancing, the monarch sat alone in the pew.
