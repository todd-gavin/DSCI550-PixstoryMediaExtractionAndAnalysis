Hence in a season of calm weather Though inland far we be Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea Which brought us hither Can in a moment travel thither And see the Children sport upon the shore And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore Then sing ye Birds sing sing a joyous song And let the young Lambs bound As to the tabor s sound We in thought will join your throng Ye that pipe and ye that play Ye that through your hearts to day Feel the gladness of the May What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now for ever taken from my sight Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower William Wordsworth
