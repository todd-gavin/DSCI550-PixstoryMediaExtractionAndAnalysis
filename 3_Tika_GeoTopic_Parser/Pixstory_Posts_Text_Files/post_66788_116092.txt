A series so highly anticipated by the whole fandom became one of the weakest entries in the whole marvel Cinematic mutli verse The series felt so lack lustre and out of touch with everything that it was a painful process to just sit through it I don t know if I ll ever be able to be excited for anything related to Ms Marvel I think even Marvel knew that the series would be no good that s why they put the Brie Larson cameo to make the fans happy by ending the series on a high note But unfortunately it came when all the life was sucked out of the series
