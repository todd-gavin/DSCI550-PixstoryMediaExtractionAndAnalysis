4. GOODIES FROZEN CUSTARD AND TREATS

Nothing is better on a hot, humid DC day than a visit to the Goodies food truck. Goodies is a darling vintage food truck that serves Wisconsin-style frozen custard. This is truly some of the best custard you’ll ever have. Perfectly rich and creamy, it is beyond decadent. Oh, and did we mention there is an option to sandwich the custard in between a donut and drizzle with caramel? We can’t believe it either. If doughnuts aren’t your thing, they have plenty of other amazing baked good to choose from, and they’re always made fresh. Not only does Goodies serve up tasty treats, but they win the award for the friendliest staff—they are always beyond warm and welcoming, always happy to answer questions, and accommodate when they can.

5. PHO WHEELS

Pho Wheels had to be on our list of Washington DC food trucks because their incredible beef pho and Vietnamese sandwiches are a must-try. Our absolute favorite item on this truck’s menu is their Báhn Mi pork belly sandwich.

This sandwich is a unique explosion of flavor. Sink your teeth into the perfectly crunchy French bread, tender pork with pickled carrots and daikon (white radish), cilantro, cucumbers, onions, and garlic aioli.
