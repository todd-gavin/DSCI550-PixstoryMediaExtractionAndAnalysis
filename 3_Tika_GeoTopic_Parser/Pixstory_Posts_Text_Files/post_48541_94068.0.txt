The Bible makes it clear that there are some things worth fighting for. By definition, truth and lie are not the same thing. We must take a stand against deceptive teachers and “contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people” (Jude 1:3). Issues that promote "another gospel"—a salvation message that differs from what the Bible teaches—must be condemned (Galatians 1:7; 2 Corinthians 11:4). As heresy, any revelations, publications, or opinions presented as infallible or equal to the Bible must be rejected (Revelation 22:18; Jeremiah 14:14). We are also to “destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). We do not compromise God’s Word or water-down the gospel. If it is a matter of salvation or holy living, we should take a strong stand. Other matters may be handled differently. First Timothy 1:4 instructs Christians not to “devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by faith.” So the Bible gives us some guidelines about what is worth debating and what is better left alone.
