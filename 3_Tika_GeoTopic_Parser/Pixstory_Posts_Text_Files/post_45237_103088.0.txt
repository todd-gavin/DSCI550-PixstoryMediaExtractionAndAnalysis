Jayden Braaf; the Manchester City youngster Jayden Braaf has completed a free transfer to Borussia Dortmund. 
The 19-year-old has signed a deal with Dortmund until June 2025. He had a troubled spell at Manchester City and was made available for a move despite his contract running until the summer of 2023. 

The Dutch winger was loaned out to Udinese in January 2021 after it was decided that a change of scenery would be the best for all parties, but he sustained a serious knee injury. 
He has been recovering in Manchester in recent months and announced on his Instagram page on Thursday that he will be leaving Manchester City. 

“I want to say a huge thank you to everyone at Man City for the faith and support they have shown in me over the last few years,” he wrote alongside a short video of his exhilarating wing play. 
“I have grown both personally and professionally and wouldn’t be where I am today without their guidance. To my teammates, academy and my staff members and especially the fans, a big thank you!”
“A big SO to Nick Oakley for working with me on my rehab and bringing me into the position, I am right now. All the very best for the future.”

City signed Braaf from PSV in 2018 and he immediately stood out as one of the most talented, exciting players in their academy and was quite popular among his teammates. 

However, any opportunity to become a member of the first-team squad became nigh on impossible over the past two years after the City coaching staff decided that his attitude and application in senior sessions did not meet the required standard. 

In moving to Dortmund he follows the same path as Jadon Sancho, who moved for a quicker route to the first team football in 2017.
