Meghan Markle did not accompany her husband, Prince Harry, as he made his way to Balmoral Castle following the news of Queen Elizabeth's death. According to royal press secretary Katie Nicholl, Meghan was not invited to join the family at the estate.
“It's understood that the family wanted Prince Harry to be there, even though he was unable to get to Balmoral in time to see his grandmother,” Nicholl tells ET. 
Duchess of Sussex was not invited to join the family at Balmoral, Kensington Palace press secretary Nicholl says. Prince Harry traveled solo from London to Scotland after canceling an appearance with Meghan and other royals due to Queen Elizabeth's health.
The queen's family arrived in Scotland for prior engagements. Prince William, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also in Scotland. The royals were seen a day earlier attending a school event with their children.
