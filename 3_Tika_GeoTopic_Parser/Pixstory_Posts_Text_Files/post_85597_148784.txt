Norwegian Wood by Haruki MurakamiIt took me almost two years to read this novel I had my own issues and phases which didn t let me finish it but I when finally did it made so happy Well yes I was relieved that I could finally put it down but it is an amazing book that really makes you wonder about a lot of things It majorly deals with suicide and mental health and in its own way is a gem When I first began reading it I hated Naoko She seemed so selfish and it made no sense to me as to why did Toru like her But as you go further along you see how flawed she was and one couldn t blame her for the way she was As someone who lost loved ones last year I loved how the novel ended open ended Yes yet it gave me hope that everything will turn out to be fine There s a chance people might not like to read it but honestly it teaches you that people can be flawed and it s okay and sometimes you have to accept that and move on
