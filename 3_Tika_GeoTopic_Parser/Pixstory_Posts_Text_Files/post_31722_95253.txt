The abrasion of tires during the circulation of means of transport causes the release of polluting micro-particles into the environment, a phenomenon which is growing rapidly on a global scale. The particles accumulate along roadsides and then flow into waterways, polluting the water ecosystem and causing concerns for the health of the ecosystems concerned Due to the current methodological gaps in analysis techniques, microplastics smaller than m micrometres remain largely unquantified In a new study by the Institute for chemical-physical processes Cnr IPcf in collaboration with the Soft Matter Lab of the University of G teborg and the Institut des Mol cules et Mat riaux of the University of Le Mans researchers have combined for the first time an unconventional strategy for optical trapping of strongly absorbing particles D Trapping with Raman analysis Raman Tweezers to reveal and identify the chemical nature of the particulate in the range between nm nanometers and m micrometers taken in the washing of a vehicle overhaul platform The research was published in Environmental Science Nano By exploiting the optical forces generated by highly focused laser beams we can trap micro and sub micrometric particles directly in liquid Depending materials we can confine the particles in the laser spot or push them against the walls of a microfluidic cell Once immobilized we can then analyze their chemical nature one at a time explains Pietro Gucciardi of the Cnr Ipcf and coordinator of the study The researches show how it is possible to use the combination of optical tweezers and Raman spectroscopy to characterize the microparticles released as a result of the abrasion processes of tires and brake pads during sudden accelerations or braking that occur, for example, during the review tests of our cars. The results of the study could be used to develop tires or braking systems with a lower environmental impact says Giovanni Volpe of Uni G teborg
