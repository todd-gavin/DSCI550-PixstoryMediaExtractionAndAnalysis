Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk And let the misty mountain winds be free To blow against thee and in after years When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms Thy memory be as a dwelling place For all sweet sounds and harmonies oh then If solitude or fear or pain or grief Should be thy portion with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me And these my exhortations Nor perchance If I should be where I no more can hear Thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together and that I so long A worshipper of Nature hither came Unwearied in that service rather say With warmer love oh with far deeper zeal Of holier love Nor wilt thou then forget That after many wanderings many years Of absence these steep woods and lofty cliffs And this green pastoral landscape were to me More dear both for themselves and for thy sake William Wordsworth
