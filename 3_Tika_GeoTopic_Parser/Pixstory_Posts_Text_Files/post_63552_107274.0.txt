June 14th is recognized as ‘Flag Day’ in the United States to mark the country’s adoption of the stars as stripes as the national symbol, since former President Woodrow Wilson issued a presidential proclamation in 1916. 

The above photo is from NASA’s website, which reads: “All NASA spacecraft include a United States flag. Through the decades, our nation's flag has been placed on the Moon, headed into interstellar space, accompanied rovers on Mars, and been featured on spacesuits. In this iconic image, Mission Commander John Young salutes the flag while jumping! The Apollo 16 Lunar Module Orion and the Lunar Roving Vehicle are in the background.”

It is always fascinating to look at outer space photos on NASA’s website, but I don’t understand: Why are we traveling across atmospheric layers to colonize the moon?

NASA’s fiscal budget is $22.629 billion. Following the Elon Musk and World Hunger controversy, it is clear that while $6 billion will not end global hunger permanently, it could prevent an emergency hunger crisis, and feed 42 million people for about a year. 

I am no mathematician, and I am definitely no space connoisseur but the question persists: Is NASA Worth The Money We Spend On It? And At Who’s Cost?

I read this Forbes article, but return only with more questions:
