Arsenal without a doubt is one of the most decorated football clubs in the history of the game. The club right since its being founded back in 1886 has been one of the most influential clubs in the football world amongst the rest of the teams. The team has achieved several unthinkable honours to its name till date. 
The team's trophy cabinet consists of 3 Premier League titles, one Champions League and Europa league title each in addition to 14 FA cups and many more domestic trophies and league cups. However the beginning of this great journey was marked back in the year 1893 when Arsenal played their first Premier League match appearance.
It was in 1893 that the club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal a couple years ago in 1891. The club got to play its first league match on 2nd September, 1893 against Newcastle.The match took place at the Manor field Plumstead which was Arsenal's new home stadium that season. The match had an attendance of around 10,000 people. 
It took Arsenal just 6 minutes to find the opening goal of the match when Arthur Elliot broke open from the central region and passed it to Charles Booth who then laid it open for Walter Shaw who scored amidst tremendous applause. Arsenal lead 1-0 at half time.
Things didn't really seem to change in the second half too as Arsenal continued to attack brilliantly with the ball in their possession and soon went up 2-0.  
Thompson at first forced a good save from Williams. However a couple minutes later the visitors finally had their first goal with crate finding the back of the net with a "fast shot" to pull one back for his side. 
Newcastle after having found their first seemed more confident than ever as they soon maanged to equalise with Sorley's wonderful header off a free kick to make it 2-2. 
So the first league game for Arsenal against Newcastle ended in a draw at London. The gunners went on to play another 1159 games thereon till date winning 626 and losing 250 of them.
