Neil Warnock has indicated that he has no plans to return to managing in football. The
legendary 73-year-old has been unemployed since leaving Middlesbrough in November 2021,
just a few months after breaking the record for most games managed in professional English
football (1,603).

Warnock was questioned on Sky Sports if he planned to return to management, but he
reiterated that his goal is to retire from the game.

"I just thought it was the right time, really, coming towards the end of the season, there's not
really a job you're going to get before then," he said. "I've had a good run really. I'm enjoying
things I've not done for years; I'm having a lot of time with the family; my dogs and I've taken up
cycling too.

"It's hard to replicate the final whistle when you're won a game, there's nothing quite like that in
normal life, and you have to realise you're not going to get that buzz again in that situation. But
I'm doing a couple of evenings in the theatre, and I imagine I'll still be nervous before them!"

It ends one of the most illustrious careers in British football history, in which the former winger
managed 16 different clubs and set the record for the most promotions in English football
(eight). After starting his career at non-league Gainsborough Trinity in 1980, Warnock played
five years with Burton Albion before joining Scarborough in 1987 and achieving promotion to the
Football League.

He later rose to prominence with Notts County, whom he guided from the Third Division to the
Premier League in consecutive seasons, albeit he was fired in 1993 after the team was
relegated in their first season in the First Division, the season before it was renamed the
Premier League.

Warnock's final job was at Boro, where he saved the club from relegation before leaving in
November 2021.
