The first such event in the Tricity which was completely free of plastic litter, Freedom Run 2022 organised by Panchkula-based Venus Remedies shunned the use of all single-use plastic items like packaged water bottles and plates made of plastic, thermocol

Panchkula:  Over 300 people from all walks of life took part in the second edition of “Freedom Run” on the eve of National Sports Day here on Sunday morning to drive home the message of keeping fit and active through running. The participants included 65 Chandigarh Distance Runners athletes and 26 students of the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), Chandigarh.

Organised by Panchkula-based pharmaceutical firm Venus Remedies in collaboration with the local chapter of the Indian Medical Association on the theme of “Freedom from Plastic”, it was the first such event in the Tricity which was completely free of plastic litter. This “green marathon” was devoid of single-use plastic with personal water bottles replacing packaged water in plastic bottles and paper plates substituting plates made of plastic and thermocol.

Flagging off “Freedom Run 2022” in the 21km (half-marathon), 10km and 5km categories from Sector 5, Panchkula, Venus Remedies Chairman and Managing Director Pawan Chaudhary said, “Besides promoting the message of staying fighting fit through running, this Freedom Run also aims to draw attention to the adverse impact of plastic waste on the environment by saying no to single-use plastic. It is a small beginning, but a decisive step in making people around us realise that they can all make a difference by avoiding the use of disposable plastic items in their day-to-day lives.”

Chaudhary later felicitated the winners, including Surender Gulia (men), Manisha (women) and Jaskaran Singh (senior citizens) in the 21km category, Vimal Kumar (men), Priya (women) and Mehar Singh (senior citizens) in the 10km run and Deep Raj (men), Ravita (women) and Urmesh Kumar (senior citizens) in the 5km category.

The event was organised under the banner of R3SET, a holistic pain management solution developed by Venus Remedies that signifies “freedom from pain” through a 360-degree self-care approach.
