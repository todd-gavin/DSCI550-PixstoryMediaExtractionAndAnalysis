Kang sara (played by lee da hee) from yrue beauty is an iconic character . Her style and charms won my heart. 
It was actually due to how she changed the rules ,earlier 2 fl were supposed to mean and evil and come between the fl and ml .
But sara was none of that she was smart , independent woman with a calm and collected personality. She totally rocked her outfits .
Even her chemistry with eun ho was off the charts ,they reversed the classic romance troupes and the cherry on the top was her character development.
