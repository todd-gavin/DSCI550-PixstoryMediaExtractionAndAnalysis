On International Yoga Day, 21 st June 2022 SGI organised TAALARYOGAM YOGATHON - Rhythm of the body and mind for Holistic Well-being around all its campuses.

This was a completely different experience  as Taal yoga uses Vinayasa based yoga,where the participants performed yoga to the rhythms of sangeet and tabla.

Around 300 staff members and 3000 students participated in this unique record-breaking Yogathon which lasted continuosly for 3 hours.

It was a refreshing day all together for the participants physically as well as mentally. Although what their day even better was having their names included in the Guinness Book of Records with a shining Certificate and free after workout snacks provided by the College.
