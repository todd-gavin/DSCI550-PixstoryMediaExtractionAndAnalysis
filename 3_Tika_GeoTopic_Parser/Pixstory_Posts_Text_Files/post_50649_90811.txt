If you ask me as a man and as an ardent basketball fan what is my most prized possession I will say my Air Jordan in a heartbeat I still remember how hard I worked to save money to buy these For me it was not about shoes but what they represented The Air Jordan is the shoe that started it all for basketball sneaker aficionados without it the world would be a completely different place But did you know These shoes almost didn t happen What a pity it would have been Michael Jordan made his NBA debut in making him the most anticipated rookie of all time Although he was not the first choice in his draught he was the most popular His accomplishments in college were legendary and the world awaited his appearance beside the greats with bated breath To go along with his debut he signed a deal with Nike that allowed him immediate access to an exclusive sneaker line which was unusual at the time As Arun Sharma says Michael was not a well known athlete like Magic Johnson or Larry Bird but they were willing to put everything on the line for a kid SportsRush reported that he was chosen as the brand s face and he did not disappoint He wore a chain around his neck his tongue out and he dropped a lot of jaws He played in the air with wings just like his emblem described him Jordan was electrifying in the Red Bull colour scheme Because MJ wanted to join with Adidas what we now know as the Jordan Brand almost didn t exist They were offering him more money from the outset and he was eager to accept His mother forced him to listen to Nike s sales spiel and it was the best decision he d ever made in sports
