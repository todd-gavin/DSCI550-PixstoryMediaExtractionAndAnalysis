‌As the controversial legislation has been delayed, Boris Johnson had said that a legal move to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland protocol is only an “insurance” policy.
‌
‌The prime minister came under strong criticism from all sides when he flew into Belfast to renew the devolved government at Stormont, amid the continuing row over the protocol.
‌
‌One of the major glueing points is the protocol aligning Northern Ireland’s trade with the EU rather than the rest of the UK, with the DUP refusing to return to power-sharing without major changes.
‌
‌Boris Johnson said that he doesn't want to scrap the protocol but he believes it can be 'fixed'. Many sources according to the Guardian say that the government is open to negotiations but has not decided to continue with the protocol.
