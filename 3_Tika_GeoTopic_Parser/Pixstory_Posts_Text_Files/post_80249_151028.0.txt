What led to the National Games' seven-year delay in being held?
Goa was chosen to host the event after Kerala hosted the National Games successfully in 2015, however the event was continually postponed due to logistical problems and other concerns. When the facilities required to perform various activities were discovered to be lacking months before the event, the organisers were held accountable for their subpar work by 2019â€“20.
The information was made public after the Indian Olympic Association threatened to fine the event's organisers a whopping Rs 10 crore if they failed to host the competition. However, as the COVID-19 epidemic struck the nation by March 2020, the likelihood of holding the event significantly decreased.
