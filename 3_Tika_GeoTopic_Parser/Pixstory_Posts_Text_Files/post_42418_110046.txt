I just watched Dharma Production s new movie JugJugg Jeeyo and why I mentioned Dharma Production and not any actors in the introduction because only Dharma Productions can pull off a family entertainer movie like this Jugjugg Jeeyo is a multi starer movie which includes Anil Kapoor Bheem Neetu Kapoor Geeta Kiara Advani Naina Varun Dhawan kukoo and Manish Paul Gurpreet Tisca Chopra Meera and YouTuber turned actor Prajakta Kohli Ginny The movie starts with a song where director Raj Mehta smartly showed the love life of Kukoo and Naina from their childhood to teenage Then the movie takes a jump of five years and now the couple is in Toronto where Kukoo is working as a bouncer and Naina is working as an HR but now they are not happy in their marriage life and decided to take a divorce But they promised each other to keep it a secret until Kukoo s sister s marriage got over and to attend the marriage they comes back to Patiala India The real conflict of the movie came when Kukoo got to know that his dad Bheem is having an affair with his maths teacher Meera Now the whole movie revolves around three focus points which are as follows Marriage of Ginny Will Kukoo and Naina get a divorce or will they patch up Will the secret of Bheem s affair be revealed or not Things I liked about the movie are the actions of all the actors and the special mention of Anil Kapoor and how the director manages to give comedy emotion and drama and romance equal importance in the movie So if you are planning to watch a movie with your family in the coming days then JugJugg Jeeyo should be on your watchlist
