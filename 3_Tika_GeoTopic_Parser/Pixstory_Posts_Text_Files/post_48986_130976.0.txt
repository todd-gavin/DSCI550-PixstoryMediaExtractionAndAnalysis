The seahorse is commonly found in coastal waters around the world. However, their population is being threatened by a number of factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and global trade.
Seahorses are sensitive to changes in water temperature, and their habitats are being destroyed as a result of global warming. The seahorse's natural environment consists of warm, salty seas, but as the water gets warmer and saltier due to climate change, it becomes difficult for them to survive. Seahorses are also sensitive to changes in salinity levels because their gills need a specific level of salt in order to function properly. 
Their food sources are also being affected by increasing levels of pollution in the ocean, which makes them vulnerable to disease. And lastly, they're caught in nets as part of commercial fishing operations, which results in their deaths.Seahorses are often traded as delicacies or used in traditional medicine overseas. When these markets become saturated with seahorses or when laws regulating their trade are put into place, it can lead to their extinction.
All these factors contribute to the rapid decline of the seahorse population. If this trend continues unchecked, it may be difficult for them to survive in the future. So far, little has been done to halt or reverse these trends, which means that we need to do our part if we want these beautiful creatures to stay alive!
