Doesn't it bother you?
To be so harsh,
Breaking my hope,
As if it is a glass waiting to be shattered,
By the slightest of sounds. 

Even I know its under a false pretence,
But have you ever thought,
What this poor soul has been through?
Many years of a sense of emptiness,
A void that no one can fill.

Is it my sin to love,
To develop my feelings,
Should I be imprisioned?
In these shackles of silence,
For how you shun me off. 

My words betry your spurns,
My heart rejects your silence,
Just like you dismiss my feelings,
Just cast me out now,
For these blues are eternal now.

These will never be my wasted times,
For every effort I put,
My heart loses a part,
So, it could be yours,
You're just letting it fall off.

The blame is on me,
Even for the tears that flow,
From these red drowned eyes,
My vision may be blurred,
Still I'll see you with perfect clarity. 

Your image I cannot forget,
Your voice just won't leave,
That first glimpse I had,
Is engraved into my soul,
Don't try to erase it,

It's impossible even for you,
Even though I'd obey your every request,
Don't tell me to leave these feelings,
My heart won't abandon you,
It just seeks you.

For once drop this pretence,
Talk to me like you once did,
Hopes may emerge,
But I promise you,
That would be better than this,

I'd die a single death,
Not be in this loop,
Where I keep on dying a new death.
Trust me when I say I can't forget,
The love I have for you.
