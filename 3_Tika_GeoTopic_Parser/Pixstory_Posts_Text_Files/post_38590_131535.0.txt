Man Utd vs Liverpool-The Battle at OT
Raphael Varane, Martinez and Malacia, were a beast in the defense. They did well to keep Salah and co out from the danger zone. 
We will see how the players fared:
1)Tyrell Malacia
Bought from Feyenoord, the Dutch fullback played really well in closing down pockets of space, and in keeping Trent Alexander Arnold at bay.
Malacia, who had 93% passing accuracy, made most touches down the left wing. He won 6 duels(aerial and ground both). He made ball recoveries in the important areas of the pitch. 
Looking at his heatmap, it will be more clear.
2) Lisandro Martinez: Bought from ETH ex club Ajax, Martinez lived upto his price tag, as he and Varane kept the front 3 of Salah, Firmino and Diaz quiet. Martinez blocked 3 shots, which could have resulted in a goal. It was more than any player in the pitch.
From the heatmaps, we can see that Martinez had a pass success of 82%.He had 18 accurate passes. Martinez made 7 goal line clearances, one which was going to be an own goal. He attempted tackling players 2 times, out of which he was successful 1 time. He made also 1 interceptions.
3) Marcus Rashford: The golden boy of Manchester United, was under intense pressure from fans and pundits alike. There was a rumor of him moving to PSG. But he put all these to rest by slotting past Allison.
He scored 1 goal and had 5 shots taken too. He made the most shots too inside the box with 5.
4) Jadon Sancho- Sancho showed a piece of magic to fool Milner, who made a fool of himself, and the forward coolly slotted past Allison.Sancho had a pass success rate of 86%. Out of 33 passes, he made 19.
Even though Liverpool enjoyed high amount of possession , but they couldn’t get past United defense. United came out as eventual winners.
