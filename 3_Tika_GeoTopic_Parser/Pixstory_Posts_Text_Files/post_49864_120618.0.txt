Even though grief is common different people mourn in different ways and this could take an enormous amount of time for some people. There are however commonalities
experienced among most individuals. 

The five stages of grief include

Denial: Grief is an overwhelming emotion. It’s not strange to respond to strong and often sudden feelings by pretending the loss or change isn’t happening.

Anger: Where denial may be considered a coping mechanism, anger is a masking effect. Anger is hiding many of the emotions and pain that you carry.

Bargaining: During grief, you may feel vulnerable and helpless. In those moments of intense emotions, it’s not uncommon to look for ways to regain control or to want to feel like you can affect the outcome of an event. In the bargaining stage of grief, you may find yourself creating a lot of “what if” and “if only” statements.

Depression : 
.Whereas anger and bargaining can feel very active, depression may feel like a quiet stage of grief.

Acceptance: Acceptance is not necessarily a happy or uplifting stage of grief. It doesn’t mean you’ve moved past the grief or loss. It does, however, mean that you’ve accepted it and have come to understand what it means in your life now.
