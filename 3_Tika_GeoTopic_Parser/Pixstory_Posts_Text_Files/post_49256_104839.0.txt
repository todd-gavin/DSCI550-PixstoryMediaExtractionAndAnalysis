I've not been on many trips but each time I have been to a place I don't know much about, I have someone come with me.

I think it's the most efficient way of travelling. Have someone with you who knows the place you're travelling to - saves you a lot of time and you make the most out of the trip. You don't miss out on stuff either. Many times people miss out on important spots without a tour guide, many times they don't understand the significance of that place from a local's perspective which I think is very important. What the natives of a place believe or understand can be different than what tourists do.

Not to mention, the sense of safety that's usually absent when you travel alone. There are many places where the internet doesn't work or you can run out of battery, such instances can prove to be life threatening. The crime ridden areas or other threats too. Plus it gives you an experience on how to travel at all. I'd suggest you always have someone with you when you're starting out.

I might start travelling alone once I have gained enough experience but until then, it's a travel guide coming with me. I won't lie, I'm a little paranoid about travelling alone. ðŸ™ˆ
