While the entire nation is yet to come out of the shock of the team's humiliating exit from the Asia Cup, Virat Kohli has given everyone aÂ  surprise when people were least expecting it by putting an end to a nearly 3 years-long wait for his Century No. 71 in international cricket. It finally arrived in the form of his maiden T20I hundred in the inconsequential Super 4 match of Asia Cup 2022 against Afghanistan in Dubai.
Virat Kohli hit an international hundred after, precisely 1020 days as he amped up for India in the dead rubber against Afghanistan. His last century came against Bangladesh in November 2019 in the pink ball test at Eden Gardens.
With this classic hundred, Kohli matched Ricky Ponting on the list of most centuries in international cricket. Kohli has now 71 hundred registered to his illustrious career while Sachin Tendulkar is on top of the elite list with 100 3-figure scores. Virat's 122* innings also put him on the list of highest scorers for India in T20Is, while Virender Sehwag (319) and Rohit Sharma (264) remain the top scores in Tests and ODIs for India respectively.
Virat's perseverance & energy during his rough ride in the last three years is second to none. The world got to see the old Kohli on the field again who has mesmerized the world of cricket for more than a decade with his gold knocks and unreal class.
The most awaited knock has come at an opportune time for the team as his form was one of the major concerns for the upcoming T20 World Cup that kicks off in Australia next month.
Is this a new beginning for Virat?
Well, I guess "time will tell", but for now it's a moment to rejoice for his fans around the world.
