The Danish playmaker has signed a short-term deal with Brentford for the 2021-22 season, although it will expire in the summer.

Christian Eriksen would "want to play Champions League football again" when his short-term deal with Brentford expires, with Manchester United and Tottenham reportedly interested.

After joining the Bees as a free agent in January, the 30-year-old playmaker had an emotional comeback to top competition in 2021-22, with the Denmark international back in competitive action for the first time since having a heart attack at Euro 2020.

He has proved in the Premier League that he is still a polished operator after being dismissed by Serie A giants Inter. He would not appear out of place if given the chance to grace a European stage next season.

When Eriksen was recovering from a significant health crisis, he agreed to a six-month contract with Brentford, which would expire in the summer.

"I don't think there are any football players who can just pick and choose between teams," he told Viaplay of his future plans.

"There are also a lot of teams who want to see one's journey first." I have a variety of offers and possibilities that we are reviewing before making a selection.

"I'd like to play Champions League football once more." I understand how enjoyable it is, but it isn't necessary for me. "

Eriksen has one goal and four assists in ten games for the Bees, helping them avoid relegation, and there is a strong desire in west London for him to stay put.

Brentford manager Thomas Frank is hopeful for a new deal, saying of Eriksen, "There is still more to come from him." Perhaps not ten top crosses each game, but greater crispness in key situations. He's doing well now, but the last stretch will take some time.

It was not a gamble for me to sign Eriksen. I was certain he could benefit us and may have been the finest Brentford acquisition ever.
