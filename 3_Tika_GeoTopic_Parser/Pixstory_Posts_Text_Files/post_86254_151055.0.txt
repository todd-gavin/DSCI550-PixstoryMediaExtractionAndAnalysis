I travelled alone many times but it was my first time when I travelled alone at night by bus. It was a safe journey but I still wanted to share my experience with you all.
My journey was from Shimla to Delhi. I reached the bus stand with my mother and she started crying because I was going far from her for the first time in her life. I controlled my emotions at that time and consoled her but after she went I couldn't stop myself from crying. I started missing her in a second she left. I was afraid, nervous and many more emotions as I was going away from my home and I was travelling in the night. But overall I enjoyed the night view like of course I was travelling from Shimla which is pretty in day and very beautiful in nightðŸ’—.
