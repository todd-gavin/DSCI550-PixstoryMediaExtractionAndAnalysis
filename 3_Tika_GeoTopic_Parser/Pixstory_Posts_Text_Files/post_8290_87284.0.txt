NBA and Golden State Warriors superstar Steph Curry has revolutionized the game unlike ever before and has been one of the faces of the league for quite some time now.

The three-time champion has broken all types of records and will undoubtedly go down as the greatest shooter of all time. Curry's ability to score at all three levels and from ridiculous spots beyond the arc has propelled him to one of the true greats the league has ever seen and has been the trend setter for a generation.

Steph Curry has given the fans some incredible moments over the years and on his 34th birthday, we take a look at the five most iconic moments of his illustrious NBA career thus far.

The setting is Game 3 of the Western Conference First Round as the Golden State Warriors went up against the New Orleans Pelicans.

After winning the first two games, Curry and co. were down by three points with 9.6 seconds left in the game. Draymond hands the inbounds to Curry, who shoots a three-pointer from the wing but it doesn't go in.

However, Marreese Speights grabbed the rebound and handed it to Steph as he shot another three-pointer from the corner with Anthony Davis guarding him and drains it.

It was an incredible shot from the Baby-Faced Assassin as the Warriors tied the game and went on to win the matchup in overtime and subsequently swept the Pelicans in the first round.

Steph Curry was a man on a mission in Game 5 of the 2015 NBA Finals as the disappointment of Game 4 led to an incredible outing in Game 5 for Chef Curry. The Baby-Faced Assassin dropped 37 points on the night, along with seven rebounds and four assists all the while shooting better than 56% from the field and nearly 54% from the perimeter.
