Henry Dimbleby's review proposed taxing salt and sugar used in refined foods, restaurants and catering.

Boris Johnson recently called the proposal "unattractive". But a government stressed its policy would facilitate healthier diets. Labour said it "failed to deliver".

The government-commissioned independent review of the food system, led by Leon restaurant chain founder Mr Dimbleby last year recommended the tax to incentivise manufacturers to reduce salt and sugar in food to improve people's health. The government is expected to dismiss proposals to introduce a new salt and sugar tax in England when it declares its food strategy next week.

Mr Dimbleby said money raised should be spent on dealing with the inequalities around food, by broadening free school meals, funding holiday activities and food clubs, and giving healthy food to low-income families. It follows a levy on sugary drinks implemented in 2018.

The government is expected to accept many recommendations from Mr Dimbleby's review. But the prime minister has said he did not want the strategy to affect "hard-working people".

And BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said that amid the rising cost of living and pressure on the prime minister from Conservative MPs to approve more traditional Conservative policies, ruling out a salt and sugar tax would be no surprise.
