Sir actress Tillotama Shome shared a photo on social media with unshaved talking about body Hair. She’s wearing a T-shirt with Unapologetic printed on it at honestly, that’s says it all! 

Tillotama talks about body hair as she wrote “I do say Sorry a lot. Worst is when I apologise in anticipation of someone's apology, as if it's a Hello. I am sorry if I did something good because I could have done it better. The visceral ones of course, slip out of your mouth in silence. The t shirt is a reminder to use it less and mean it more. (Oh and about body hair, yeah not sorry about it. I wear it as I like it. Its not a statement. I also wax. I also don't.)
Good day!”
