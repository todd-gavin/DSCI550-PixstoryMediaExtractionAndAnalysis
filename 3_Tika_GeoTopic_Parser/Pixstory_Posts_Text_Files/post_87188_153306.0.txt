The ninth gameweek of the English Premier League is here. The relegation battling Everton are all set to face the top-four contending Manchester United. Both teams will fight for three points at Goodison Park on Sunday. 
Everton find themselves in 11th place as they remain unbeaten in the last five games. They registered a 2-1 win over Southampton after going behind in the 49th minute. The team is high in spirit and will look to maintain their form against Manchester United.
On the other hand, Manchester United lost to Manchester City at Etihad in the previous game. Though they scored three against City, Manchester United were exposed in their previous game. However, their win against Omonia will be a motivation for the team to perform better against Merseysiders.
