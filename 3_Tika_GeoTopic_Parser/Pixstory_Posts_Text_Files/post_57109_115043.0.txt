Through movies, memories are never lost.
Cinema knows how to capture and keep the most important chapters of life.
It ensures us that memories never wane; they can be remembered and revisited from time to time.

The idea of calling memories a "timeless entity" makes cinema more phenomenal; the fetters of past or present do not confine it because it knows at the end what matters are the faces that sparkle up and the eyes brimming up with tears while visiting or remembering the moments that cinema has preserved for them.

Memories within memories show the characters visiting flashbacks and moments of the past; this way, it adheres to the process of memory-making and portrays cinema in its most beautiful ways.

What would it be to live without memories and reminiscence? Just a place where cinemas would not exist and even humans.
