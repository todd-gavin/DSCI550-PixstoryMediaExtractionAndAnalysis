If Yogi Adityanath makes a comeback as CM of Uttar Pradesh, as exit polls have predicted, he is going to create history and his victory will have far reaching consequences at national level as well as within the BJP. 

The 2017 assembly elections were contested by the BJP without a declared CM candidate, so the entire credit of the win went to PM Narendra Modi but this time, they are contesting with Adityanath as the face of the party in the state and if he manages to retain power, his stock is certain to rise within the party and also as a Hindutva icon around the country. 

Before becoming CM of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath has served consecutively as a member of the Lok Sabha from Gorakhpur constituency multiple times. 

Yogi has faced challenges within the party from many quarters and but almost all exit polls have given him clear majority with varying number of seats and if exit polls turn out to be true, Yogi is all set undisputed leader of BJP in the most populous state of the country that sends 80 members to Lok Sabha.
