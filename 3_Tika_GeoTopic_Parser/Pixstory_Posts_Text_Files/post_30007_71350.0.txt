In the search of peace,started ride towards east!
Got stuck there between river and trees.🌅🌴
There was no internet and sucking notification beeps!
But yeah there was a calm and mental peace! 🌸🌈
Natural touch up was soothing twist  :))
The woods were lovely, dark, and deep.💚🍁
But From inside it was like i have promises to keep! ✨🤝🏻
And ended with miles to go before i Sleep! 💙🌍
