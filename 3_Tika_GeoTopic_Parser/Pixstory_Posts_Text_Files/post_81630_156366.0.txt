USA beat Morocco by four goals to none at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Goa to secure qualification atop Group A. Both teams were playing the last group game with a chance to qualify for the knockouts, although Morocco’s hopes were riding on India being able to get a result against Brazil. Brazil’s 5-goal demolition of India ensured that Morocco were only playing for pride in this fixture. Charlotte Kohler opened the scoring in the 24th minute with a first-time finish from 12 yards off a cross from the right by Melina Rebimbas. USA went into the break 1-0 up, although they might have felt themselves deserving of a greater lead. In the 68th minute, Emeri Adames went on a run on the left wing and drove a low cross into the penalty box which was bundled in by Samantha Smith. Amalia Villarreal set up Charlotte Kohler for her second of the night five minutes later. USA’s last goal of the group stages came in the 81st minute as Villarreal's cross from the left allowed Smith to get a brace as she tapped in from point-blank range. 
Today’s win caps off a near-perfect run in the group stages for Team USA. They scored 13 goals and conceded only one. Their biggest win ever in a World Cup was achieved in the 8-0 defeat of India. Today’s win means that team USA are currently the top scorers at the World Cup. Team USA will face Nigeria in the quarterfinals, who beat Chile 2-1 today to secure qualification from Group B. 
This was Morocco’s first appearance at the U17 Women’s World Cup. Having been pitted against title aspirants Brazil and USA in Group A, it was always a tall task to try and achieve qualification. The North African outfit did well to beat India convincingly and only narrowly succumb to Brazil. They will return proud of their first effort on the world stage and hopeful of a stronger showing next time around.
