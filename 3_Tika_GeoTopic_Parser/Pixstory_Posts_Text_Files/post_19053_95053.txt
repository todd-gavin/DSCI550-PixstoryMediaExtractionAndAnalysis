Napoli may have said goodbye to Scudetto hopes after the home draw with Roma The whole environment is feeling the effects but there is one player who will not wear the shirt of his city next year who burst into tears at the end of the game It is Lorenzo Insigne the captain of this Naples the one who had given hope to the fans by scoring the penalty kick that for a few minutes did not give the three points that would have kept the race for first place for mister Spalletti&#39;s men Instead the equalizer goal in the last state like a bolt of lightning blue sky for Napoli For Insigne yesterday the game began with an explosion of joy for the penalty scored in the tenth minute An irrepressible happiness for those from Naples who dream of bringing the tricolor back to their city The draw then ruined everything Insigne first gave a disconsolate football at the bottles of water and the triple whistle which broke out in tears that did not go unnoticed He wanted to apologize to the fans he wanted to honor the th goal with the same shirt with victory and to chase after the two Milanese who are now points apart The mathematics he doesn&#39;t condemn Napoli yet but it&#39;s really difficult to overcome two teams in just championship days
