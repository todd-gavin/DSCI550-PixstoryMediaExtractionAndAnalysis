SK Sturm Graz vs Midtjylland Probable Winners

Midtjylland have not been in a good form in their domestic season so far and that can certainlyreflect on their performance when they travel to Sturm Graz. However, one thing that goes intheir favor is the fact that they have fared well away from home.

Sturm Graz, on the other hand, have had decent openings in their domestic circuit but on thecontrary have a poor record in European competitions at home, having lost 13 of the last 16matches. This fixture could well end in a tie.
