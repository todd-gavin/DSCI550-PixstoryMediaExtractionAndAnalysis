In a sensational piece of news, English Premier League club Aston Villa are reportedly weighing
up offering a contract to free agent Luis Suarez this season, as the midlands club look to
address their striker situation this summer.

Villa manager Steven Gerrard and former teammate Suarez have been in regular contact since
the turn of the year, with the manager keen to bring Suarez onboard to Aston Villa.

Aston Villa
however, are not rushing with a contract as the club is assessing other options in the transfer
market as well. Aston Villa have youngsters Cameron Archer and Keinan Davis returning on
loans from successful spells in the Championship and out and out strikers Ollie Watkins and
Danny Ings at the club.

Villa would be looking to continue pressing on the good progress they have made in the summer
so far, with signings of Coutinho, Kamara and Diego Carlos. The club is reportedly looking for a
striker, left-sided defender and a midfielder ahead of the 2022/23 Premier League season.

If Suarez is approached for the role of the striker, he would bring tons of experience winning all
the honors at the biggest clubs of the world.

While his goal scoring streaks have certainly
slowed down, Suarez still remains a highly intelligent player looking to create space and feed
others the balls into dangerous positions.

Villa could send a statement to the entire league by
signing an icon like Luis Suarez.
