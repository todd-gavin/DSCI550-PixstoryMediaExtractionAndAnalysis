Our ecology has recently been under grave peril. There has been a severe ecological catastrophe that has put life itself in jeopardy. We have been depleting and contaminating the environment's priceless natural resources. As a result, we have poisoned and soiled our own lives. Pollution is defined as any unwanted and excessive addition of elements that disrupts this equilibrium. Pollutants are the term for these compounds. When this imbalance reaches a critical point, it can be lethal to humans and other living things alike. And this imbalance, which is swiftly and universally developing, has sounded the alarm. The need to safeguard and conserve our environment is critical.
