When it comes to snake bites, no first aid is almost always less harmful than bad first aid. So remember not to go all DIY if you've been bitten by a snake. Do not cut and suck â€“ absolutely do not do that! Do not use those commercial snake bite kits, do not use a stun gun on yourself. A snakebite can be a major source of panic, so that's what you need to keep in mind in a situation like that. It is hard, but try not to panic. Try keeping yourself calm. Slowly back off and get seated in case you start feeling dizzy and hit your head. Call 911, or whatever emergency number you have in your country. If you have the choice, opt to someone else carrying you to the doctor. Keep your movement minimal. Remove any jewellery, watches, bands etc should any swelling occur and they act like tourniquet cutting your blood flow. Venomous snakes usually leave dry bites They will do so if they can frighten away a predator with a nip instead of wasting their venom to defend themselves. To ascertain whether this is the case, do not hold off until symptoms start to show up. Let the hospital make that assessment. If you live in an area where snakes are common, know what kind of snakes are around. Same with if you're traveling to one such area. If not, try taking a snap FROM AFAR. Do not chase after the snake to take a photograph or kill it, should it bite you again. Always remember, while panicking is the natural response of our body in situations like this, try to relax. Panicking would speed up the spread of the venom.
