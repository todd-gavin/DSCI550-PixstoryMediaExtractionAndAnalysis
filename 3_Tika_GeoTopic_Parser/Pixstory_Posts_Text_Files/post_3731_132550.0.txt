Unequal pay between male and female executives for the same work or role is a sad reality of our times. From films to tech and even the informal sector, a gender pay gap does exist. According to the Monster Salary Index (MSI) published in March 2019, women in the country earn 19% less than men.
However, the advertising industry claims to differ.
Rohit Ohri, Chairman and CEO, FCB Group India, said the salaries at FCB Group are entirely based on talent. “I think in today's day and age, this is a very peculiar conversation, we have absolutely no gender pay gap in FCB. It's entirely dependent on talent. We were the first agency in India to have a female CEO. Today we have Swati Bhattacharya as the Creative Chairperson.”
“In Fact, we focus on getting more women into senior positions in the company. We have an initiative called ‘ She can and She will’ where we have women leaders from the industry talking about their journeys in an attempt to inspire more women to become leaders,” he added.
According to Amit Wadhwa, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officer, dentsu Creative India, there is absolutely no gender pay gap at their agency. “For us, it's really clear, we pay on the basis of scales. We have scales for different roles like planning, strategy, creativity etc. There is absolutely zero difference between a male and a female executive. It is absolutely based on merit.”
As per Taniya Arora, HR head at Cheil India, pay disparity in the advertising industry doesn’t exist anymore be it from a gender point of view or the other, it is a requirement of the skills which are mapped to the position.
