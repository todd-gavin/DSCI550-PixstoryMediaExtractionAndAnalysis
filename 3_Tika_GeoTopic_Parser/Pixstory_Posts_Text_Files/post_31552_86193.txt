It is commonly said that philosophy was born in Greece and after all this affirmation can still be considered valid The legacy left by Greece to Western philosophy wrote Bernard Williams western philosophy But this observation also opens up a series of questions that reveal all the complexity of the problem Starting from the fundamental question, even if it is true that philosophy was born in Greece, what should be understood by philosophy What specific characteristics connote it as such compared to other cultural forms preceding or contemporary with it An old thesis of some historians of philosophy who had concerned with the relationship between Eastern culture and speculation and Greek philosophy and science was that while the Orient had produced exclusively material civilizations in which technical aspects predominated, Greece instead would have operated a total revolution of traditional ways of thinking, making the leap towards a type of spiritual civilization in which disinterested speculation and pure theory predominate these would in fact be the proper characteristics of science and philosophy this is the thesis of the Greek miracle A thesis that found its historical antecedent in Greek culture the great philosopher Plato in the fourth century BC he had distinguished the Greeks from other peoples in this way based on a classification of their natural character and their character. According to Plato, the Egyptians and the Phoenicians have a philochhromaton soul, that is, attached to the riches and more material interests of life the Thracians and the Scythians have a thymoeides soul that is irascible easy prey to passions while only the Greeks have a philomathes soul that is disposed to intellectual conscience Source Giulia Civita
