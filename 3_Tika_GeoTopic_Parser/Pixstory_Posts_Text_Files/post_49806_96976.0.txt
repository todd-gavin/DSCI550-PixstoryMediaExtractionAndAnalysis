Americans are between both worlds. Recent studies find out that most Americans want more gun control but are afraid of mass shootings. Is gun violence decreasing not even during festivities? During the Easter holidays, 4 incidents happened in America injuring many. 

In the survey according to You GovAmerica reports when asked what the reason for the shooting was Americans most often said that it was an act of mental illness (44%), followed by an act of violence (42%), an act of hate (38%), and an act of terrorism (29%).Â The survey also finds out that 31percent support more gun laws and 40 % say both are equally important and many women stand against guns. 

Survey points out the chaos gun violence has created in the minds of people, especially in the Brooklyn shooting. People are torn between the question of whether guns are safe or not? One of the possible solutions is to give guns only to trained individuals who are given concern and awareness to only shoot in emergencies. Those who are found to be involved in any kind of criminal activity should not be allowed to possess a gun. Misuse of guns should be strictly banned and punished. The police force should work without racial prejudices and help all the people and be more efficient where people need their help. Too dreamy? This is needed for America
