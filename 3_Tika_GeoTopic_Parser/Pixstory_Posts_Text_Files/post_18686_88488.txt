The salvation challenge is won by Sampdoria who goes to points and therefore to Venice third from bottom in the standings defeated today A very important victory for Giampaolo&#39;s men signed by Caputo who scores a brace The match is not very beautiful indeed very confusing It is precisely the lack of order allows Caputo to break the deadlock for the Sampdoria striker taking advantage of a sensational mistake by Maenpaa and bags him into an empty net Again in the first fraction the doubling arrives Another mistake by Venezia and Caputo once again good at being found in the right place and at the right time to easily bag Venice tries in the second half but in a sterile way All the hosts are left with ten men for Henry&#39;s expulsion for protests
