What happened to Afghanistan If it happened in Korea, Japan or any other country, dozens of their officials and politicians would have committed suicide. None of us implicitly accept responsibility, even if he makes a comment, blaming others and throwing snow on our own roof is nothing.
This is true of the majority, not just of high-ranking officials, but a general complication.
In addition to economic dependence on the outside, the death of conscience can be examined in various walks of life, in the family, the collective sheriff environment, language and culture. How does our conscience die? How do we alienate ourselves from our human conscience or responsibility?
 Where is our refuge in this alienation?
