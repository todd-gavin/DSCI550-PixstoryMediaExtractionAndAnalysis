I started playing Table Tennis in Sixth Class I saw my elder brother playing Table Tennis and that was my first interaction with the sports Then I wanted to play the table tennis and my father enrolled me to get coached Then I continued playing till the age of and after that I left the sports The main reason behind my decision to leave the sports was that there was no job security There wasn t a sports quota around those days and even now it s very less It was when I left the sports to do a job in a school During I started coaching Table Tennis to children and someone within me the passion for the sports was re ignited and I started to play again professionally In I got selected for Assam s Men National team and after playing that tournament I got a job from the central government This was for the first time that a player after a gap of nine years got selected into the National team of Assam My playing style was very aggressive and I was an attacking player always looking to score points
