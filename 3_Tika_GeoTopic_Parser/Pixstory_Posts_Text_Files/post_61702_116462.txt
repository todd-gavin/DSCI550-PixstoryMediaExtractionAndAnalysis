To be honest I am not surprised USA is a prime example of a country being so obnoxiously polarized that even segregation of school going children might be heavily debated with many counter views Rather than focusing on teaching children inclusivity and breaking the generational trauma the USA has decided that segregated schools are the way to go How dumb do you have to be to even think that it s a good idea God I hate this country
