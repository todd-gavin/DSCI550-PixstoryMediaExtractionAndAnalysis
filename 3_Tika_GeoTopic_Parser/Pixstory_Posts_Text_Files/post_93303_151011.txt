Let me clarify to the male readers of the text traveling and availing public means of commutation is is no party for the women It entails violation of their privacy in terms of groping even teasing sexualy assaulting and harassing These are not at all exaggerated terms These have happened to all the women that travel in public transportation If doubt try asking the women around you You will be shocked by the tales they have to tell and the number of times it has happened and at the places where it happened I would now talk about things that have helped me personally to have a sense of security First is masks and the other is the women s coach in the delhi metro For a large number of people mask has been a problematic habit to incorporate into their daily life Complains include suffocation choking and irritability It not only serves the purpose in mitigating the corona virus but also has been helpful to women in ways not think able For women it protected them from the male gaze on the streets buses trains airports and shops You would feel the gravity and uncomfortable reception of it only if you have been on the receiving end It s been a boon for the women who almost in their lifetime must have been come face to face to this de humanizing vulgar and sexually violating gaze It makes one feel like a thing of lust and just fit for viewing as a sexual object I have personally not changed the habit of wearing mask in public places still I feel a little more protected and safe when nobody can view my face Therefore I receive reduced attention from the males around This may also have contributed to reduced groping and assaulting women Coming to the female coach of delhi metro It has been a safe haven for me when traveling in the metro I don t have to battle for a space free from getting unwanted attention and scanning of my body Also having women around in public spaces is definitely a great comforter for me
