Kenya Many places of Kenya reminds me of India years ago a developing country and its friendly people I mostly spent my time in Nairobi and Kisumu foreigners normally not advised to step out of the hotel after dark sun set I have not seen any danger or threat especially with these lovely people However it s not a rocket science to realize what poverty can lead you to Coming back to Kenya this friendly and aspiring country is look like In the right path of development and prosperity Chinese investment has given a sudden face lift for Nairobi its capital and big boost in their economy though the aftereffects are still unknown I have seen new railways connecting between Uganda and Kenya enormous high ways and bypass to overcome the famous Nairobi traffic congestion in the city invested by Chinese they are definitely boons for the people and their day to day lives and for Government income On the other hand I spent only a few days in Kenya but managed to go at least a national park wild safari and city tour Both trips gave me a lot more idea about Kenyan highlights The commitment and dedication to nature by Kenya government and its people vividly observed during my wild life safari such as rangers fight against poachers the pyre of poached hypo horns and ivory plus tons burned a few years ago schemes and plan to protect the environment and endangered animals and also the indigenous people Have seen schools and universities nice homes offices and flats which looks like real estate also booming large port for the flower and agriculture products export etc World would be a better place with helping each other and living in harmony
