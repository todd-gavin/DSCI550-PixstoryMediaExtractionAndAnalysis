Godddd I love Marvel but enough is enough We don t need so many spin offs Madame Web is a second grade villain in the spidey comics and today even that is being considered worth enough of a spin off I mean aren t we all tired of so many movies and tv shows and spin offs which down grade the quality as a whole Just take a look at how disappointins was Ms Marvel The world needs more originality rather than just going back to the same formula
