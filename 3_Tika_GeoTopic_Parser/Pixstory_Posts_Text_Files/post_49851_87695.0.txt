‌Why does a 3-year have to play with a gun? This horrifying incident happened near Chicago in a car outside Food 4 Less store. 
‌
‌The Family was sitting in the car, the boy in the backseat, the father in the driving seat and the mother in the front seat. 
‌
‌According to the Dolton police chief Robert Collins Jr: “He somehow got ahold of the gun and began playing with it in a playful manner, pointed the gun and fired the shot,”
‌
‌His mom, Daejah Bennett, got a bullet stuck on her neck and was rushed to hospital where she succumbed to death.
‌
‌When the 3-year was questioned in a forensic interview by a child expert he agreed that he had fired the gun.
‌
‌Still, the charges for the misdemeanour with guns will be indicted upon the father since the child is a minor. Although the father legally possessed the gun he lacked the concealed carry permit, required to carry it in a vehicle. Moreover, the gun was not locked and secured.
‌
‌
‌A similar incident happened earlier this year in Georgia wherein a 4-year-old boy in shot himself with a gun while his mother was shopping inside a store. 
‌
‌According to a leading gun-control advocacy group, Everytown for Gun Safety, 'In 2020, gun sales surged 64 per cent, and this rise—coupled with school and childcare centre closures as a result of the pandemic—has heightened the risk for all household residents: the number of unintentional shooting deaths by children was 31 per cent higher from March through December 2020 than during the same period in 2019."

‌This is not a rare incident this happens in the US at a very increased level. Again, have the elders become so irresponsible by leaving guns near the children. This kind of incident leaves great trauma in the minds of children. Gun control laws should be made strict to prevent these incidents. This is the case of children what about numerous firings and intentional shootouts happening in the US? Isn't the government and law system responsible for these tragedies?
