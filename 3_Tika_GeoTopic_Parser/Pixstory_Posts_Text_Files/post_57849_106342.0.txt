Be it school or college, attendance is one crucial aspect, not for grades but, for the ability to get grades😂🤦‍♀️
And we've all heard so much from teachers and professors over the years about our attendance, its importance and how it should be taken seriously and not for granted😂
So its been ingrained in your mind since kindergarten to listen and reply when you hear your name😂
No matter your mental state, when you're there in school or college, the one thing you'll most definitely concentrate on is giving your attendance, even if you're dead on feet😂
