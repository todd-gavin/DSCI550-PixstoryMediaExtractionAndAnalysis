After a long long wait, the Thor : Love and Thunder teaser is out, while it doesn't reveal too many plot details but it does reveal a few iconic looks for our heros. In the teaser we see Chris Hemsworth's Thor trying to find his own new purpose in life, we see him completely fit and then we see Chris Pratt looks amazing as Starlord (Peter Quill). Finally, the wait is over Natalie Portman is holding the Mjolnir and she's fighting with it as The Mighty Thor. We still haven't received a look of Christian Bale as Gorr, The God Butcher who will be the main antagonist of the movie. We also get a brief glimpse of Russell Crowe's Zeus in the tesaer.

The synopsis of the movie reads the following, The film finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he’s ever faced – a quest for inner peace. But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who – to Thor’s surprise – inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s too late.
