Actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan asked NCB officials if he deserved to be labelled an ‘international drug trafficker’ despite no illegal drugs being found on his person, according to a new report. Aryan was arrested by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with an alleged drug bust onboard a cruise ship off the Mumbai Coast in October last year. He spent several weeks in jail before being granted bail.
Accusations ranging from possession of illegal drugs to links with international drug gangs were hurled at him. But in May, 2022, he was given a clean chit by the NCB, which cited ‘lack of sufficient evidence’.

As per India Today, Sanjay Singh, NCB’s deputy director-general (operations), who headed the SIT behind the probe, recalled his conversations with Aryan. He had told Aryan that he would speak to him ‘with an open mind’.

According to him, Aryan asked him a few “soul-searching queries”. He said “Sir, you have painted me as an international drug trafficker, that I finance drug trafficking — aren’t these charges absurd? They did not find any drugs on my person that day and yet they arrested me. Sir, you have done me great wrong and ruined my reputation. Why did I have to spend so many weeks in jail — did I really deserve it?”
