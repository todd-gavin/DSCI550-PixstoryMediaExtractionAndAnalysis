Amitabh Bachchan's granddaughter was always expected to join the movie business but a few years ago, she proved everyone wrong. Navya has said in an interview that she aims to join her father Nikhil Nanda's business. Now, in a new interview, Navya has said that she never intended to become an actor in the first place.
Speaking to Barkha Dutt in a joint interview with her mother, Navya set the record straight. “I enjoy dancing and things like that but it was never something I took seriously that I would do this as a career. I was always more inclined towards business. My grandmother and aunt were both working women. They were also were involved in the family business in some capacity. My father, grandfather would take their opinion on it. That was always a world that excited me a lot more. I am also the fourth generation of the Nandas to take over that. I really wanted to carry that legacy forward, support my dad and everything that he is doing. Being the woman in the family and take that forward was also something of pride for me. But I don't think acting is something I would have done,” she said.
