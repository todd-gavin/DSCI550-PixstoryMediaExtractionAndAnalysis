The legendary Sunil Gavaskar is set to have a cricket ground named after him in England. The former India captain will have a stadium going by his name in Leicester as part of the honour bestowed upon him by the Bharat Sports and Cricket Club. 

This club will have its entire 5-acre sports field named after the great batter, making him the first Indian cricketer to have a ground on his name in England or anywhere in Europe. Gavaskar, currently in London, said he is "delighted" to have received such a mark of appreciation for his contribution to the game.

"I am delighted and honoured that a ground in Leicester is being named after me". "Leicester is a city with possibly the strongest supporters of the game, especially Indian cricket, and therefore it is a huge honour indeed", Gavaskar expressed.

"We are thrilled and honoured that Gavaskar has agreed to have this pitch and ground named after him," Kieth Vaz, a serving MP of UK Parliament said. "He is a living legend and over the years, has delighted Indians and other lovers of cricket with his record-breaking performances."

We are honoured too.
