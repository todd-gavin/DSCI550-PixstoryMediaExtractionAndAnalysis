Alan Shearer was talking about Leeds United defender Pascal Struijk on the Premier League's
YouTube channel. Shearer was speaking as part of the Rising Stars series about some of the
Premier League's greatest young players, and Struijk is one of the players who has captured the
Newcastle legend's attention.

Despite the fact that Leeds have struggled defensively this season, Shearer believes Struijk has
been outstanding, comparing him to Virgil van Dijk.

Shearer had this to say about Struijk:

“The left-footed 22-year-old was given his chance following an injury to Liam Cooper, and while
Leeds have not been at their best defensively this term, he’s made his case to be a regular in
the team,” Shearer said
“Physically imposing at 6 ft 3, he welcomes comparisons to Virgil van Dijk and having played for
the Netherlands at youth level, Leeds fans will be hoping he can reach similar heights.”

Struijk, who is only 22, has a lot of potential to grow, and despite Leeds' defensive struggles this
season, he has looked like a future star. As Shearer points out, his physical characteristics are
obvious, but he's also a brilliant game reader who is at ease on the ball.

Although Leeds' defence isn't very strong, Struijk appears to be a capable man at the back, and
he has a bright future in the game. It remains to be seen whether he can match Virgil van Dijk's
achievements, but even if he's half as brilliant as the Liverpool defender, he'll be a treasure.
