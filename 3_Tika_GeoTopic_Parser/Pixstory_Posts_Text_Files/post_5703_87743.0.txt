Saudi is in active talks with Beijing to trade some of it's oil sales in 'Yuan' instead of dollar.

This move might dent the U.S dollar's dominance in the global petroleum market. The talks between Beijing and Saudia to trade in Yuan has been on and off since six years but recently they have been accelerated as Saudis have grown increasingly unhappy with decades-old U.S. security commitments to defend the kingdom.

According to the Global Times 

"Chinese international affairs and oil experts said that although Saudi Arabia and China have been engaged in talks about using the petroyuan for some years, nothing concrete is likely to come out any time soon. But they said that using the yuan to settle some of Saudi's oil trade with China is definitely a trend gaining momentum as it meets Saudi interests, and the yuan is getting increasingly internationalized.

In light of the increasingly frequent abuse of US unilateral sanctions, countries are stepping up their efforts to look for a backup currency for their international trade, and the yuan is one of the options on the table, Li said. With the world's multi-polarization process continuing, the trend will gain momentum and contribute to the internationalization of the yuan".

Now the question is, will this mark the end of US dollar's dominance over the world?
