Life of hundreds of species has been saved due to the court ruling in California. A federal judge in California has overturned a 2019 Trump administration move to gut the landmark Endangered Species Act, vacating that administration's changes and renewing protections for hundreds of species.

This ruling is a win for environmentalists and climate advocates. The rehabilitation of the protections could also be a boon for climate groups that contend oil and gas drilling in certain areas could damage threatened wildlife.

"The Court spoke for species desperately in need of comprehensive federal protections without compromise," Earthjustice attorney Kristen Boyles said in a statement. "Threatened and endangered species do not have the luxury of waiting under rules that do not protect them."

A coalition of environmental groups -- including Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity -- and the state of California had sued the Biden administration to bring back changes.

In his decision, US District Judge for the Northern District of California Jon Tigar said the Biden administration has not "evinced any desire to keep the 2019 ESA Rules intact," agreeing to vacate the Trump rule an easy one.

Tyler Cherry, a spokesperson for the Department of Interior, told CNN the department is studying the decision.

Its had been very clear that Trump made all his progress in favor of the industries and fossil fuel companies. Trump overhaul shifted how the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deemed whether species authorize federal protections. 

It could have considerably expanded how long it takes for a species to become protected, which had the consequence of taking several species out of consideration for protection.
This decision is good news despite many things occurring in America.
