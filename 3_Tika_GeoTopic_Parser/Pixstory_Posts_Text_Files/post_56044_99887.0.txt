Ballad is a short narrative folk song, whose distinctive style popularised in late Middle Ages and persists to the present day in. The term ballad is also applied to any narrative composition suitable for singing.

The term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular love song and is often used for any love song, particularly the sentimental ballad of pop or rock music, although the term is also associated with the concept of a stylized storytelling song or poem, particularly when used as a title for other media such as a film.

See this ballad by John Keats 

I met a lady in the meads,

       Full beautiful—a faery’s child,

Her hair was long, her foot was light,

       And her eyes were wild.


I made a garland for her head,

       And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;

She looked at me as she did love,

       And made sweet moan
