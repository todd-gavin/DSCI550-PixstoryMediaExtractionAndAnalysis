Industrial activities of the past couple of centuries have polluted the environment and its devastating effects are obvious to one and all For those who still want proof there are reports after reports warning an apocalypse ahead The fact of climate change has been largely accepted now but little action is forthcoming from world leaders Scientists resent the fact that decision makers are not attaching due importance to their work Some of them have even threatened to go on strike in order to draw the world attention to their concerns Such a course of action might indeed provoke some action but more likely it would be ignored even welcomed in some quarters The scientific studies of course are shouting from the rooftops that we are running out of time to make course correction Last year many parts of the world suffered from extreme weather events In August the IPCC released a report saying some of the shifts were already irreversible UN secretary general Ant nio Guterres called it a code red for humanity Last week there was yet another report from the IPCC and Guterres called it an atlas of human suffering But did any of those reports lead to effective action COP in October last year was probably a failure In the journal Climate and Development scientists Bruce C Glavovic Timothy F Smith and Iain White write The tragedy of climate change science is that at the same time as compelling evidence is gathered fresh warnings issued and novel methodologies developed indicators of adverse global change rise year upon year They feel that the science society contract is broken and discuss options to repair it The trio then calls on climate scientists to stage a mass walkout to stop their research until nations take action on global warming Their exasperation is understandable But effecting widespread and permanent changes in democratic societies is not an easy task nor one that can be accomplished in a year or two On the other hand if the research is stopped climate deniers will have a freer hand Science will have to continue its job without expecting its fruits
