I have always for as long as I can remember have identified as a feminist It is something that has been inculcated in me by my mother and grandmother Growing up in a female dominated household I quickly learned about the issues women face daily and wanted to be an ally to this revolutionary movement I embraced the tag of being a feminist with open arms However decades later I still feel that the movement has not accepted me It has no place for me Even the normative concept of feminism like everything is dominated by the whiteness of people Do not get me wrong I support the movement But the truth is I am not represented here Here people advocate for how women don t need to be conventionally beautiful to be worth it but then why I am still considered ugly because my hair are not long and blonde Here activists talk about how beauty comes in all shapes and sizes Then why I am still ridiculed for my big lips The truth is that black women never were a part of white feminism We don t only struggle against patriarchy and racism everyday but we are also the victims of internalised misogyny of our fellow women How are we supposed to overcome this Will our voice be ever heard
