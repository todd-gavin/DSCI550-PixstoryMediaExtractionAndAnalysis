In the view from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, the twin galaxies NGC 4496A and NGC 4496B dominate the frame. NASA TV reported that both galaxies are in the constellation Virgo, but although looking side by side in this view, their distances from Earth and one another are considerably different. NGC 4496A is 47 million light-years away from Earth, while NGC 4496B is 212 million. Because of their huge distances, the two galaxies are not interacting and only appear to overlap due to a chance alignment. 

Astronomers can investigate the distribution of dust in these galaxies because to chance galactic alignments like these. The black tendrils that run through both NGC 4496A and NGC 4496B add to the splendour of the galaxy.

In a process known as "reddening," dust in the universe scatters and absorbs blue light, making stars appear dimmer and redder. Dust reddening is distinct from redshift, which is caused by the expansion of space. Astronomers can map the dust in the spiral arms of the foreground galaxy by carefully monitoring how dust in the foreground galaxy influences starlight from the background galaxy. The "dust maps" that arise aid astronomers in calibrating observations ranging from cosmological distances to the types of stars that populate these galaxies.
