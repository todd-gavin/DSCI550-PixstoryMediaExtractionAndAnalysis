The founder and CEO of Raise Financial Services, Pravin Jadhav, blasted Paytm Money's wealth management business on Thursday for stealing his workers. Paytm Money's first CEO was Jadhav.

On the microblogging site Twitter, Jadhav commented that Paytm Money's attempt to recruit his colleagues from Raise and DhanHQ was a "little hilarious."

I believe you should take a step back and concentrate on the fantastic product, staff, business, and clients I left behind. Guess what will happen if I start making offers to your team and customers? Jadhav made this statement in a tweet on Thursday.

According to Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Paytm is on track to become the first online firm in India to reach $1 billion in annual sales by the end of this fiscal year in March.

Paytm was the face of India's tech startups before it lost two-thirds of its value after going public and came to represent the collapse of the sector. In an effort to sell investors on the future of the losing business, the creator of the company now pledges a sharper focus on financial performance.

India's startups are currently experiencing a crisis that was made worse by Paytm's stock price collapse. Investors' confidence in the startups' earnings potential caused valuations to plummet. Young companies, many of which had achieved unicorn status as funding poured into everything from digital learning to online retail in the 1.4 billion-person nation, suddenly saw their fundraising plans come to an abrupt halt. The Ukraine conflict and worries about a global economic downturn made circumstances worse for companies worldwide in 2022.
