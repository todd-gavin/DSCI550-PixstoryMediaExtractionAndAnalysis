After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) transferred most of its MLAs to a resort on the outskirts of Jaipur ahead of the key Rajya Sabha elections this week, resort politics has continued to dominate the headlines in Rajasthan.

The BJP's move comes only days after the Congress relocated its MLAs to an Udaipur resort. Nearly 60 MLAs are reportedly present at the resort, according to a party leader.

"This is a training camp where MLAs will be trained for the Rajya Sabha elections," a BJP spokesperson told.

Surprisingly, the move comes as the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) has announced its support for BJP-backed independent candidate Subhash Chandra, a media magnate, in the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections.

"In the next Rajya Sabha elections, the party will not vote for either the Congress or the BJP. In terms of the constitutional procedure, however, the party will support independent candidate Subhash Chandra "Hanuman Beniwal, the RLP's national convener and Nagaur MP, tweeted on Monday.

While the BJP has stepped up its campaign for the Rajya Sabha polls, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot met with over 100 Congress MLAs in an Udaipur resort on Monday and urged them to stay united.

On June 2, the Congress moved their MLAs to Udaipur, fearing BJP horse-trading.

Six Rajasthan Congress MLAs - Rajendra Gudha, Lakhan Meena, Deepchand Kheria, Sandeep Yadav, Joginder Awana, and Wajib Ali - have openly expressed their dissatisfaction with the party's senior leadership ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections.
