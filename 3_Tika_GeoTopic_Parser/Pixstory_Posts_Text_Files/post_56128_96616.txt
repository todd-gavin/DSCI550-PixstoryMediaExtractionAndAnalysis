We all know how much has changed after the war Prices are high and highest than ever Meanwhile what are the congress and Democrats doing Instead of ending a war fueling it by sending weapons and financial aid Unemployment is low yet labour needs remain high Wages have grown while prices are on a vertical incline National measures for inflation alone reached their highest levels in four decades last month a spike that left lawmakers hearing an earful from voters in their states and districts during the recess I completely agree with Sen Elizabeth Warren D Mass when she warned the democrats if they don t handle the economy they are defiantly going to lose the elections I mean I won t vote and I am ready to give a chance to the Republicans to see what they can do to bring this situation under control I am afraid if the word of Republicans is true when they said from day one of Biden the economy is out of hands Before focusing on the world just try and focus on your on stifling economy We demand a lower price tag in exchange for votes
