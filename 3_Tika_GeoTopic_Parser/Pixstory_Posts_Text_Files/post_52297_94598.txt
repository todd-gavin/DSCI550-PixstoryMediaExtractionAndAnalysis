Love the sandy beach waves water ocean sunsets weather everything Venice beach us in Santa Monica Los Angeles Pay for the parking and you ll be good I always visit this beach when I want peace and enjoy the nature but if you want more information Los Angeles is a landlocked metropolis with no access to the ocean However the Los Angeles area has at least beaches in L A county and even more if you include beaches in Orange and Ventura counties to the south and north To experience all of these delights would take a lifetime Those with limited vacation time should choose the area that best suits their leisure style
