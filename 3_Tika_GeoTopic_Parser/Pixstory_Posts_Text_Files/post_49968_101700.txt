 The transition to renewables will be fastened by great improvements in the pricing and performance of such systems The price of renewables has been falling globally because of the increases in efficiency of wind and solar systems due to steady increases in the efficiency and achievements of large scale manufacturing We should also remember that it won t take long for our initial investment begins to pay off when lower electric bills are It does cost more to build wind farms and install solar arrays But once these plants have lower operation and supervision costs than conventional power every year No more regular fuel bills and only minimal expenses for the upkeep solar panels have no movable parts that wear out and need to be replaced The price argument is also fallacious because we have never paid the real price for the power we use which comprises the cost to the environment and human health of the carbon pollution that fossil fuel mining and burning generates We should be supporting technologies that help us to put the brake on fatal climate change rather than feeding the unsustainable fossil fuel habit
