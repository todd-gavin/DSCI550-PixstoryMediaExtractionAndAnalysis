Cutting-edge Italian research in the fight against breast cancer A study conducted entirely in our country BioItaLEE presented in June at the Congress of the American Society of Clinical Oncology American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO in Chicago illustrates the data of the combination of two biomarkers that could provide information prognostic and predictive effects in patients with hormone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor negative HR HER advanced or metastatic breast cancer In the BioItaLEE study, patients were treated first-line with the CDK inhibitor ribociclib in combination with letrozole hormone therapy Biomarkers are characteristics of the tumor that allow us to identify patients who respond or fail to a given treatment In this way they improve both the understanding of metastatic disease and the chances of long-term survival The study involved patients from Italian centers This work everything Italian is gaining great interest at an international level explains Saverio Cinieri President of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology AIOM It defines a research model that fits within precision oncology and opens up important prospects for making metastatic disease chronic It also represents a sign of vitality of the research in our country that demonstrates its ability to involve many centers in complex trials. The evidence obtained needs further confirmation in order to be applied in daily clinical practice, but they mark an important starting point for the start of further research. new cases of breast cancer More women are living with the diagnosis of metastatic disease which in about 1 of the cases expresses hormone receptors The standard treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancers the combination of a cycline inhibitor with hormone treatment says Michelino De Laurentiis Coordinator of the BioItaLEE study and Director of the Department of Breast Oncology and Thoracic Pulmonary National Cancer Institute IRCCS G Pascale Foundation of Naples Ribociclib is the only drug in the class of CDK inhibitors capable of boasting total consistency and solidity of results
