Almost nothing else was talked about for days Referee Marco Serra&#39;s mistake in Milan Spezia foul whistled in favor of Milan without giving the rule of advantage in an action that not even a second later turned into a goal by Messias back at the center of football talks after the same whistle spoke about it in an interview given to Sky Regret is still strong in Serra but there is also a great deal of awareness that the mistake can lead to an improvement Rebic started with the idea of strangling me and then understood as a field man that even in his career he missed a goal into an empty net what happened to me the referee Serra told me I think everyone from the youngest to the oldest would have had the same reaction On my return to the locker room some AC Milan players passed as heartbroken as I was Calabria from captain said words of comfort to me Florenzi who was as heartbroken as I was he hugged me then Theo Hernandez and Brahim Diaz pass by and they too told me to get up and react because everyone is wrong And then Ibrahimovic arrived the substance of his speech was now proves to be strong and react Now I can&#39;t wait to get back to refereeing A serious mistake the most serious that can happen to a referee It was my mistake the Var can&#39;t do anything And the worst mistake that can happen to a referee In my head there is a priority error I focus on Rebic and Bastoni and think if he touches him foul He&#39;s shooting he can&#39;t not do a foul I miss the complete scenario I don&#39;t see Messias who is about to shoot on goal I remember thinking let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t throw it inside while when Gyasi scored in the earphone I exclaimed I can&#39;t believe it He will return to referee in the top flight the hard work done up to now will not be canceled by an error, albeit a very serious one
