Kids are growing up smarter this days with a lot more technology and resources at hand The world which is moving at the speed of light needs very rapid adjusting and it s hard to accept changes in the adulthood when you re set in your ways So it is a good practice to inculcate those values among kids when they re young sure it may seem capitalistic or agenda driven to you but the inescapable reality is that they have to grow up in a capitalistic world and getting a head start on how it works is not a bad idea imo
