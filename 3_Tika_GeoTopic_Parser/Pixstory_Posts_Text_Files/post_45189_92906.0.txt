Paris Saint-Germain's 6-1 triumph over Clermont Foot 63 in the French league on Saturday was another case of a sorry French team bowing down to the country's elite. While this goes down as yet another disappointing season for the Qatar-owned club, the final few games do tend to bring light hearted joy.

Yesterday was probably the very first time we saw Brazilian forward Neymar click with Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi right at the centre of things. Both Neymar and Mbappé grabbed hat-tricks, walking away with a match-ball each as Messi produced one of his better displays in a PSG shirt.

"I am very pleased to have scored my first hat-trick of the season. And even happier with the win and our attitude. It's important that the chemistry between us gets stronger in every match."

This spur of fortune comes too late for their liking as last month confirmed what was yet another failed attempt at conquering European glory when Real Madrid knocked them out of the Champions League.

"Unfortunately, everyone is pretty much at 100% at the end of the season. It's a shame, but I am very happy with everything that we are showing on the pitch.

 It's a lot easier to play with players who are very intelligent. Leo and Kylian are extraordinary, they are two geniuses."

Neymar's praise for his partners in crime isn't unjustified, but these aren't necessarily games their season will be judged by. While Mbappé has probably been the most consistent player in all of Europe when it comes to scoring goals, Neymar has been on and off. Albeit with the Ligue 1 trophy already in the bag, Paris Saint Germain will consider this a failure. 

With 7 gameweeks to go, there's room for plenty more Messi - Neymar - Mbappé link up over in France.
