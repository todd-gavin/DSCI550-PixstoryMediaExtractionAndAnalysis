Mohamed Salah intends to return to training for Liverpool this morning in a bid to be ready for Thursday's game against Leicester City.

The 29-year-old led Egypt to the Africa Cup of Nations final only to lose on penalties to Sadio Mane's Senegal.

Egypt also played extra time on four occasions, so Salah has played 749 minutes of football since he went to Cameroon for the AFCON (transfermarkt).

However, The Times reported on Monday that Salah has told the Reds that he has every intention of playing against the Foxes.

Now, it will be up to Liverpool's medical team to decide if he is ready or not, but the fact he made himself available speaks volumes about his character.

He could easily have decided to take a break and focus on Liverpool's game against Burnley, but Salah is a true winner.

Of course, he still might not play on Thursday, but the gesture from the Egyptian is the key thing here.

Salah is clearly someone who just loves football, and it would be an incredible achievement if he were to play against Leicester.

However, given that he is the Premier League's top goalscorer this season, I wouldn't be surprised if he played and scored on Thursday.

Salah probably didn't play that well in the AFCON, and he didn't even get to take a penalty in the final shootout, but he seems determined to help Liverpool chase Manchester City at the top of the table.

It is clear that Salah is a winner, and he is determined to help his side win on Thursday; if I were Jurgen Klopp, I would put him straight back into the team.
