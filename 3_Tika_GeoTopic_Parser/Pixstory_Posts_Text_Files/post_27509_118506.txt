The Ferrari F seen at Paul Ricard could perhaps have conquered the pole position without the teamwork between Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Yet it was better for the redhead not to take any risks against Red Bull and Max Verstappen who are often able to give surprises right in the moments highlight by offering the Monegasque a slipstream on the Mistral straight to which much of the credit must be given for those three tenths of a second ahead of his rival Merits that Leclerc himself immediately recognized to his teammate I am very happy for the last attempt happy also for the help he gave me gave Carlos it was a great team work there was excellent communication between us and Sainz it was really fantastic I certainly earned at least a couple of tenths for free on the straight Arriving in the third sector knowing that I have a haul of two tenths earned that way I it helped me approach the last few corners with more confidence Instagram photo scuderiaferrari
