To be honest summer doesn't feel good here, we get sun all around the year and in summer temperature going above 40Â°c doesn't feel any good.  Still having fun is important irrespective of season.

I like bikes, to beat the sun I have sacrifice on sleep but getting up early and riding bike on empty roads at 6 am is too good to miss out.
