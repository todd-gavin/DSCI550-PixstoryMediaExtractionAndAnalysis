Mental health has been a crucial phase of the pandemic, many people lost their loved ones, and it was not easy to overcome such grief. What aggravated it more was the constant reluctance to not move out of the home. The room was the only space to feel safe and secure for most people who experienced any loss.

A complete cut from all the physical activities was one of the reasons why most people suffered from depression.
Studies have found that exercise is an effective treatment for mental health problems.

"For some people, it works as well as antidepressants, although exercise alone isn't enough for someone with severe depression," says Dr Michael Craig Miller, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

Exercising in 45-minute sessions three to five times a week was the most beneficial for improving mental health, the 2018 study found. However, the study said that even doing household chores reduced poor mental health days by about 10%.
A study published in 2020 found that even light exercise helped protect children against developing depression. The 2020 study revealed that 60 minutes of simple movement each day at age 12 was linked to an average 10% reduction in depression at age 18.

The types of movement included running, biking and walking, and activities like doing chores, painting or playing an instrument.
