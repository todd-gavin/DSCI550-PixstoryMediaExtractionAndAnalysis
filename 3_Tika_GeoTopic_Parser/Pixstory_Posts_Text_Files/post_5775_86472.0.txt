Yogi Adityanath triumphs as his party gains the majority in 2022 assembly elections of Uttar Pradesh.

Many are saying that history has been created as since independence no party has come to power consecutively in the state. Adityanath will serve as the CM of UP for the second term.
He has won the Gorakhpur seat by a margin of 100000 votes.

His rule in the state has been accepted by its citizens and he got rewarded by them.

These elections were crucial for Adityanath as this time the party was contesting elections on his face unlike in 2017 when they contested without a declared CM candidate and the credit went to PM Modi.

These results will turn Adityanath into a prominent and powerful leader in Indian politics.

Now, what remains to be seen is  how the state will fare in his second term as the CM.
