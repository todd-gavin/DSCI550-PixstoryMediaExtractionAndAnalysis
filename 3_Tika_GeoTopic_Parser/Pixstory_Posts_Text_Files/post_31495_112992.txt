At the top of the top ten for holidays, the more than doubling of the prices of international flights that take off in June and which also have primacy compared to all the items in the basket and are placed in the absolute place of the monthly increases with the Silver Medal for domestic flights which fly by exactly one third on an annual basis, a very worrying figure, especially if one considers that the item which marks the record for the monthly increases in May Instead of the rental of means of transport and the rent of garages and parking spaces with the place in the previous month in the monthly top ten Just off the podium are the hotels, motels and pensions which mark a comparison with last year on a cyclical basis place Followed by maritime transport ice creams and international holiday packages Not you save yourself not even going to a restaurant over last year or in a park or museum. The top ten is closed by recreational and sporting services, which include swimming pools, gyms, discos and bathing establishments which, for now, show a lower percentage but which increase in just one month of What emerges from these data is that for the next holidays the less we move away the better Between flights and fuel the prices are exorbitant says Massimiliano Dona president of the National Consumer Union
