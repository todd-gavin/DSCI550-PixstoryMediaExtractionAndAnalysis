Since tensions between the US and China erupted this month over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island, two US Navy vessels have made their first transit through the Taiwan Strait. 

As per CNN, the USS Antietam and USS Chancellorsville guided-missile cruisers were travelling on Sunday "through waters where high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in conformity with international law," according to a statement from the US 7th Fleet in Japan. 

According to the statement, the transit was "ongoing" and "no hindrance  from foreign military troops so far."

But is there an underlying message?

Some definitely think so!

The two US Navy warships passing through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, according to John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, sent a "very clear" and "very consistent" message that "the United States military will sail, fly, and operate wherever international law permits us to do so."

According to him this was planned long ago!

Letâ€™s see what happens next!
