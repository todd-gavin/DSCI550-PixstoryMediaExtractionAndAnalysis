Warner Bros s upcoming The Flash movie won t make it to theaters before the New Year As part of a wider rescheduling of films from the studio Ezra Miller s solo film as the lightning fast superhero was pushed back to June following COVID production delays joining the Jason Momoa led Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom in moving back a year It was originally slated to premiere in theaters in November after the previously scheduled Black Adam which now debuts in October It s a disappointing set of news especially after seeing DC s sizzle reel of superhero films last month that gave a brief glimpse of Miller and his retractable eye visors The film has been one of DC s biggest upcoming releases in part because of how much hype director Andy Muschietti has been stirring up on social media but because it ll also be the first time Miller s Flash will be the star of the show in a DC film Beyond that some sort of movie involving the fastest man alive has been on DC s mind since further stoking the flames of a Flash fandom hungry to see the hero in his own feature film
