Tea for me is something that reminds me of the thing called "home". It smells like home, it tastes like home. Having come to Delhi for my undergraduate has been a huge transition for me as I had never lived away from home before. 
I feel every North Indian home has a tea time where each member of the family sits together and relax while sipping some good tea. In my home, it is followed religiously. That why I have such strong attachment with the evening tea. Science and research has proven that the strongest nostalgias and sensory associations are formulated by our olfactory and gustatory senses. We remember them the most vividly and with all of our sense. 
Living in a PG, there is a constant lack of packaged milk, and me being me, tired as always, never go out and buy it. So today, I used the milk powder, water, tea leaves and sugar to make a hot cup of tea since I was feeling home-sick. I still remember the first sip of this hot liquid. It felt like I am back home again. Sitting with all my family members, catching up on each other's day and mood. Sharing household chores at the same time like chopping vegetables, kneading dough of wheat flour and getting samosa from the nearby shop. 
This feeling becomes my most cherished time during the day and it has now become a daily habit of making that tea. I feel fortunate and grateful that I have a family and a memory of them to reflect and long to be back to them again unlike most of the people who do not wish to go back to their families for long holidays or who do not have a family at all. Thank you tea for reminding, relaxing and making me nostalgic in the most beautiful and loving way.
