Maybe I don t know what I want in life But I don t want people who would make me feel worthless or bad I don t want drama and mind games I don t want conflicts and inner battles I don t want being a burden on anyone I don t want to be a failure or someone who doesn t make a change in the world I don t want to hurt anyone or get hurt in return I don t want fake people who are there because of something not because of you I don t want friendships that stress me or blame me for being kind of distant I don t want to have a life full of wars
