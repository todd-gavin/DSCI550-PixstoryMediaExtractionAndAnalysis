President Joe Biden has said he thinks his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will move in on Ukraine but does not want full blown war He told a news conference Mr Putin would pay a serious and dear price for invading but indicated a minor incursion might be treated differently The White House later stressed any Russian military move would be met with a swift severe response from the West The Kremlin warned the comments could further destabilise the situation Russia has some troops near the border but denies planning an invasion President Putin has made a series of demands to the West insisting Ukraine should never be allowed to join Nato and that the defensive alliance abandons military activity in Eastern Europe We have made it clear that any further eastward expansion of Nato is unacceptable Mr Putin said at a televised press conference last month Mr Putin s exact reasons for the build up of Russian troops near Ukraine s border are unknown but many believe it is an attempt to force the West to take Russia s security demands seriously On Thursday US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting foreign ministers from Germany France and the UK to co ordinate Western strategy over a potential invasion of Ukraine He has previously warned that Russia could attack Ukraine at short notice At his news conference on Wednesday Mr Biden said There are differences in Nato as to what countries are willing to do depending on what happens If there s Russian forces crossing the border I think that changes everything What you re going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades and it depends on what it does he said It s one thing if it s a minor incursion and then we end up having to fight about what to do and not do etc
