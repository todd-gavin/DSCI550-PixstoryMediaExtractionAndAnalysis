Here ends another beautiful chapter of my life..... My internship days at SOS. I came here with lot of expectations, and I'm so content now that I met those and more. I'm really gonna miss them, within a span of one month I really felt like I'm their Didi. Those children really stole my heart.Â  I'm so thankful to the children and whole SOS family for the love, care and warmth, and for being one of the best chapter.
