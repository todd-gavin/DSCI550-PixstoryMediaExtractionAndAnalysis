If Kulusevski's positional awareness and pace on the counter-attack is what allows Son and
Kane to flourish, Bentancur's presence bolsters the midfield in behind. Like in Italy and for the
Uruguayan national team, he has a lot of running to do under Conte. The coach expects him to
act as a pivot down the centre, and to play forward passes upon winning possession. Not much
has changed except perhaps the intensity of the English game.

“When I was coach of Inter, I tried to ask him, but then Juventus moved before. Maybe they put
more money than us at the time, and then they bought this player." Conte remarked
He also added the fact that Kulusevski and Bentancur give Tottenham clear ideas and good
vision, both of which are relevant when it comes to their recent displays.

“I said that with these two players, despite that we lost four players in January, with these two
new signings we made this squad more complete, with more balance,” Conte added.

“I think that it’s very important in football to have a clear idea, and to have a good vision.
Because in this way, the situation is more simple.”
