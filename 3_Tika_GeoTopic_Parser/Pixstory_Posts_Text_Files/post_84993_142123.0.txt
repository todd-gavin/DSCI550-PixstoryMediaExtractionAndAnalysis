CB - Sergio Ramos

A real bargain for Real Madrid paid off handsomely as Ramos established himself as one ofthe most assertive defenders. During his 16 years at the club, he became a legendary playerfor Los Blancos, and was their only defender in history to score 101 goals in his 671matches.

After Casillas left, Ramos took over as captain and was an influential figure in the dressingroom. Real Madrid won three Champions Leagues in a row under his captaincy, and he alsohas been named to the FIFPro World XI every year since 2011.

Carles Puyol – CB

Barcelona still misses him as a leader and a player whose presence gave the clubtremendous confidence. His 15 years at the club made him one of Barcelona's best leaders,and his defensive abilities and leadership earned him the nickname "El Tiburón" ("TheShark") from teammates and fans.
Puyol appeared in 683 games for Barcelona, winning three Champions Leagues and six La
Liga.

LB - Roberto Carlos

Roberto Carlos, a left-back with every quality, contributed significantly to Real Madrid'sattack and was the club's first free-kick taker. As a left-back, Carlos also had offensivequalities too, registering 101 assists and spring 70 goals in 527 matches for Real Madrid.
His long-range goals earned him a European reputation, but his powerful free kicks made
him famous. Carlos arrived in 1996 and immediately established himself as a key player,
playing 500 matches and winning three Champions Leagues during his time at Real Madrid.
