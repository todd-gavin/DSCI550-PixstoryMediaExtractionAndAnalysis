How lucky I am Unmatched knowledge of life Mehr University The school of joy and happiness Every morning Sun Sun Moon month It rises from the east of my house I will learn with you Do not kill Do not harass Do not abduct I will learn with you The blessing of life And the abundance of God That on people s tables every day To the alleys and streets To the mountains and deserts The sea flows You told me to tell people Evil abduction and terror To their daughters and their sons Who are still raining and sea to take refuge My mother is my refuge
