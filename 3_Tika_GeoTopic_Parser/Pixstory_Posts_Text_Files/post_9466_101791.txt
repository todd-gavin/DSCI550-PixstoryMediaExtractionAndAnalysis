Fear is a powerful tool for directors to lock the viewers When the attacker is invisible it thickens again Such plots mostly anchor on women to build an emotional trauma The Invisible Man has all these ingredients Also the film is inspired by H G Well s Invisible Man In the first scene Cecilia escapes from a beautiful glass mansion which was a glass cage for her Her guy is a wealthy Optics engineer with exceptional skills in the field He can even disappear and act So if you expect an edge of the seat thing here well it s just half For Cecilia it was a well planned one So we just need to follow her From then the script shows the same character ahead Don t think of a hollow man terrific effect anywhere It s more realistic in approach Fear is induced in scenes right from her stay in the apartment of her close friend His daughter is also staying there Flipping bed sheets stalking footsteps and invisible attacks inside scare them not us But the execution of such attacks on screen with the support of a decent background score seems very natural I was anxious when Cecilia was crawling into the attic and pick the mobile Leigh Whannell s cold direction doesn t bring more of such moments Less exposure in this genre He has in fact Considering the entire sequences in The Invisible Man it might be a wave of change This slow movie gets some fast rhythm in the second half Not as fast as you think The subplot was pretty obvious Ending was more appealing Even then not a surprise for us as Cecilia tells Adrian I feel we couldn t relate to this couple with the lack of a live flashback All agree on Elisabeth Moss s emotional acting as Cecilia She could draw fear pain anxiety hunted feel a bit of revenge faking and all Rest of the actors had nothing to prove in their roles The Invisible Man is a watchable film with less excitement
