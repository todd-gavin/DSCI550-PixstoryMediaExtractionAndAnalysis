Russia has detained around 15000 people from across the country who were protesting the war their government has imposed on Ukraine. Late last month, people came out on the streets in their thousands. That surprised the world, as the Russian media has been largely quiet about the invasion.

Despite the crackdown, protests continue within Russia to this day. For instance, on Sunday, protests against Vladimir Putin's war saw over 700 people detained by police. According to reports, some of the riot police had the letter "Z" in the colors of the Russian flag. Letter 'Z' is seen as the symbol of support for Russia.

According to Human Rights Watch, police have used excessive force while detaining the protesters. The police also "inflicted abuse amounting to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment" on people who are in their security forces' custody.

 According to OVD-Info, the leading human rights project working to protect freedom of assembly in Russia has said that people who are taken to the police station are being tortured. So far, nearly 15,000 people have been detained by the Russian authorities ever since the invasion of Ukraine. ( https://ovdinfo.org/ )

After the protests against the government increased, the Russian government, on March 4, passed a law in the Duma, Russian parliament, making it illegal to "knowingly" spread "false information about the activities of the armed forces of the Russian Federation." The law has been criticised by journalists and others. ( https://www.dw.com/en/russian-activists-defy-putin-to-protest-war-in-ukraine/a-61073902 )

It shows the solidarity that many Russians feel for Ukraine's plight and also register their protest against Vladimir Putin.
