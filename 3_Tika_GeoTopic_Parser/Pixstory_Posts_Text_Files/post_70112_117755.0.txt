Salgaocar FC relieved their famous 1997 Federation Cup triumph in Kolkata, exactly 25 years ago on Wednesday. 

Club president Shivanand Salgaocar was delighted to welcome yesteryear stalwarts at a special ceremony held at the Taleigao Community Centre, near Panaji. 

It was Arjuna awardee and star forward Bruno Coutinho who silenced the massive crowd at the Salt Lake Stadium in the 2-1 victory for the Goan heavyweights that day. 

The wet ground and vociferous supporters should have worked in East Bengal’s favour but Bruno had gave Salgaocar a perfect start in the 23rd minute when he played a one-two with his Nigerian strike partner Jude Odegah just outside the box and unleashed a rasping right footer to the top corner of the East Bengal goal. 

The Kolkata giants did get back into the match when Kenyan international Sammy Omollo headed in the equaliser seven minutes from time. 

Time was running out for Salgaocar but there was a glimmer of hope and in extra time Bruno thundered another shot that not only gave Salgaocar their third Federation Cup title, but also pierced the hearts of East Bengal fans. 

Some of the Salgaocar legends flew especially from abroad to attend the felicitation ceremony on Wednesday. 

Videos of the match were cheered loud and clear, especially those two delightful strikes from Bruno that still send shivers down the spine. 

The 1997 Salgaocar Federation Cup winning team:  Juje Siddi (GK), Francis Coelho, Franky Barreto (captain), Roberto Fernandes, Roque Pereira, Shanmugam Venkatesh, Jules Alberto, Savio Medeira, Domingues Vaz, Bruno Coutinho, Jude Odegah (Nigeia). Substitutes: Sanaton Singh and Gaspar Castro.
