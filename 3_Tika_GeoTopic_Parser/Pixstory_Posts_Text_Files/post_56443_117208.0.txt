Former prime minister Scott Morrison has told churchgoers they should put their trust in God — not governments — during a speech focusing on anxiety in Perth.

Mr Morrison was a guest speaker at a birthday event for Pentecostal church the Victory Life Centre, founded by tennis champion Margaret Court, on Sunday.

In an address lasting almost 50 minutes, the sitting Cook MP said government was "important" but he was thankful "we have a bigger hope" than politicians.

"We trust in Him. We don't trust in governments. We don't trust in United Nations, thank goodness," Mr Morrison said.

"We don't trust in all of these things, fine as they might be and as important as the role that they play.

"Believe me, I've worked in it, and they are important.

"But as someone who's been in it, if you are putting your faith in those things like I put my faith in the Lord, you are making a mistake.

"They're earthly, they are fallible. I'm so glad we have a bigger hope."

The comments came in a speech centred on anxiety and mental health in the community, an issue Mr Morrison said he was concerned about "as a Member of Parliament".

He said God understood anxiety was part of the human condition and pointed to stories in the Bible — such as Mary's pregnancy with Jesus — as evidence "he gets it, he understands it, he sees you".

"He ensured this was written for what you're going through right now ... so you can know that he knows," he said.

"And he is there, an ever-present help, in times of need."

He clarified he meant "everyday anxieties", such as worrying about the effects of climate change, and not mental health conditions requiring clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Mr Morrison said identity politics was something he had "always railed against", saying people were not defined by their beliefs or grievances.
