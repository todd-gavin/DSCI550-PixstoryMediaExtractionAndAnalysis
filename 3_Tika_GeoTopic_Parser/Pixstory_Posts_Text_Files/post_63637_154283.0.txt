PS1 or Ponniyin Selvan 1 is a live action film adaptation by director Mani Ratnam of legendary Tamil author Kalki Krishnamurthy’s magnum opus of the same name where he presented a fictionalized take on the mighty Chola Empire, focusing on the story of Aruolmozhi Varman who later became Rajaraja Chola 1, the greatest among the Chola emperors.
The novel is among the most epic pieces of Tamil literature and is epic enough in scope that it can be considered India’s version of The Lord Of The Rings. Given that fact, it is all the more reason that directors in the Indian film industry wanted to adapt this novel to film format, but for years they failed.
Well, now that long wait is over as we finally have a film adaptation which is more than worthy of Kalki’s epic novel, triumphantly bringing out in full scale its grandiose, majesty, bombastic nature, epic scale and ambition.
First of a two part adaptation, right down from its visuals to its design PS1 manages to present the might, power, culture and lifestyle of the great Cholas with great sincerity and honesty, while the battle scenes, be it the land battles or attacks from the sea are engrossing enough with such spectacular choreography, VFX and design that you often tend to lose yourself in them. 
The design of forts, palaces, villages, towns, temples really make you feel like you have taken a step into history as the unnerving complex but exciting political drama takes place in the background.War, politics, bravery, ambition, friendship, enmity, vengeance, suspense, tension, twists, devotion, scheming, beautiful landscapes, designs, costumes, the movie has it all.
PS1 also has a great score and some amazing songs by AR Rahman though just like ‘RRR’ every single song or dance feels part of an interconnected whole which is integral to advancing the story and highlighting the characters and their motivations.
The tone of the film is highly focused and the performances whether of the main or the side characters are absolutely great Furthermore, a lot attention has been paid to overall character development making every person on the screen feel very relatable.
Score: 9.7/10
