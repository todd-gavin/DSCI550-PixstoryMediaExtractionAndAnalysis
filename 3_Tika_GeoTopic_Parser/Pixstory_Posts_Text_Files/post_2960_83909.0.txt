Hitler and Putin. Two leaders, known for hunger for territory and no qualms about resorting to armed conflict to satisfy it. Comparison began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea. The Ukraine invasion has refueled them. There are, however, crucial differences too, especially when it comes to ideology and populism.

“Now if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the ’30s,” Hillary Clinton, secretary of state when Putin annexed Crimea, said back then: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/03/05/hillary-clinton-says-putins-action-are-like-what-hitler-did-back-in-the-30s/ Prince Charles agreed: “And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler:” https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-fair-compare-putin-hitler When Russia hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup, it was Boris Johnson, then foreign minister, who said Putin would use the occasion the way Hitler did Germany’s hosting of the 1936 Olympics: https://theconversation.com/why-boris-johnson-was-right-to-compare-vladimir-putins-world-cup-with-hitlers-olympics-93922

But Putin’s territorial dreams did not begin with Crimea. In 2008, his campaign in Caucasus had prompted Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security advisor to President Carter, to alert the world that Putin’s tactics were similar to those of “Hitler or Stalin”: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/georgia

The Ukraine invasion is compared with the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939 – which Hitler said was the happiest day of his life – just before World War II: https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/02/24/hitler-czechoslovakia-sudeten-putin-ukraine/

On February 24, as Putin launched the offensive, a cartoon came up on Twitter, depicting Hitler patting Putin, and the caption read: “This is not a ‘meme’, but our and your reality right now.” https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1496716168920547331

Well, the two have much in common besides land grabs and turf wars. Here are two ruthless autocrats, whose power can be explained simply by the adage of ‘Fear is the key.’ Both are exceptional masters in disinformation campaigns. On a sympathetic note, like Hitler for Germany, Putin too feels strongly for Russia, nurturing a grudge that the world has not treated his motherland well.

Comparisons end there, though. Hilter was a populist rabble-rouser who manipulated crowd psychology and created a mania in the name of ideology – ethnic nationalism – that continues to inspire some people around the world even today. Putin is not into racism. Like Stalin before him, he has no such grander ambitions of rewriting world history: https://globalnews.ca/news/1345844/comparisons-between-hitler-and-putin-dont-run-deep-historians-say/
