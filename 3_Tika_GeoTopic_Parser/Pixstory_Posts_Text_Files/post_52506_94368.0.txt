One of the important festival celebrated by the christians is Easter. Jesus was sentenced to death by crucifixion, for claiming to be the 'Son of God.Easter Sunday marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ after being crucified. Easter is a holy festival of joy. There is a tradition of sacrificing lambs as a holy sign for the the festival. 

For Christians, the lamb is more a representation of Jesus sacrificing himself and dying on the cross, Jesus being “the lamb of God”. It's most likely that Christians eat lamb at Easter to remember this sacrifice. This tradition carries a lot of believe and  faith in the name of God. 

As the world is evolving and we as humans have started thinking about all the living beings on this planet. Right from the killing of mosquitoes to the rhinos everything is protected. Some people have their ideology that the sacrifice of the lambs on Easter should be banned. According to them we cannot sacrifice any animal in the name of God or traditions. But we if see, this world has an eco system. A system where a cycle keeps on revolving. The grass is eaten by the goat and the goat is further eaten by the humans. We kill a goat, chicken, a cow and several other things just for the pleasure of having good food. So here we kill an animal. Be it sacrifice or our food habits. We can't just quote that sacrificing a lamb is unethical and eating a goat is ethical. Either ways the animals are dead. And the sacrifice is not something which is done always. It's done on the date of a festival and as a holy belief. Nobody has seen god for real. If we trust in God, we must trust in the traditions that comes with the religion. Or else we must not believe in the existence of God. We can't have a believe by disobeying the traditions. This makes you a non believer. As humans we can either have all our faith in God, and we follow everything. Or else we just stop believing and take ourselves forward with the modern day thoughts.
