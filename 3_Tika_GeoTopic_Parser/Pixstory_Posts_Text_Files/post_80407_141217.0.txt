Mikel Arteta was appointed as Arsenal manager in 2019. The Spanish manager had spent years under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, learning the game and how to manage from one of the best to ever do it. Arteta felt it was the right time to leave Manchester City in 2019 to take on the job of managing Arsenal, one of the clubs he played for as a player. Arsenal
were a struggling side at the time and had been struggling ever since the departure of clun legend Arsene Wenger. Arteta had a challenging job ahead of him but after being backed by the owners and being given time and trust by sections of the Arsenal fanbase, he has relished the opportunity as the Gunners currently sit top of the Premier League table. The
question now is whether or not he's able to keep this Arsenal side fit and motivated enoughto maintain this great start through the rest of the season and to win another PremierLeague.
The last time Arsenal won the Premier League was in 2004. This was their astonishing invincible season when legends such as Ashley Cole, Dennis Bergkamp, Freddie Ljungberg, Sol Campbell, Robert Pires, Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry played at the club, amongst
many others. Despite that amazing season, Arsenal never built up to winning any more leagues, though they did make finishing in the top four a regular habit.
Since joining Arsenal in 2019, Arteta has had a bumpy time at the club full of ups and downs. His tenure started off with a huge success, beating London rivals Chelsea in the FA Cup final. Silverware has been scarce for the London side ever since and even a finish in a Champions League spot hasn't been possible. Arsenal played out of all European competitions last season after finishing eight the season prior and failing to qualify. This had
a terrible effect on the club financially as they would lose out on the profits of playing in Europe. However, the board decided to back Mikel Arteta through this tough time.
