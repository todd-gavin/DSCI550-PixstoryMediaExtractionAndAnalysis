Yes Yes Yes and Yes. Everyone should be a feminist and most importantly men. Reasons might hurt people because sadly patriarchy and internalised misogyny is the root cause of the suffering of women. Men deemed women as inferior, stupid and weak through the years making us unequal counterparts and denying our equality. Well, we choose to fight. The fight ignited light inside many men too who were clever enough to understand feminism is for everyone and male privileges are real. Many a time being male burdens expectations and responsibilities upon men which is difficult for a human to endure. 

Men can be a part of feminism by understanding the movement and identifying themselves as feminists. Not half-feminist, good feminist or quarter feminist but simply feminist. Feminism is an umbrella term for everyone who believes in equality. If you believe in gender equality and recognise male privilege you are already a feminist. Just put aside any ego and identify yourself as a feminist.

Be ready to question the gender stereotypes. Break the gender stereotypes. Boys are trained to be invulnerable and toxic masculinity destroys the world around you, the people you love and most importantly yourself. It will lead to severe anger issues, violence, and mental problems and can also trigger homophobia. 

Identify the misogyny around you. Listen and analyse the conversations around you. You can identify sexist, classist, racist remarks and don't ever encourage such conversations. Identify this by yourself and remember it is not the duty of women to educate you. This is least expected from you. Yet here we are! Call out sexist jokes and use your position as a feminist to ensure inequality and unlearn gender stereotypes.

Always remember you shouldn't expect any special treatment because of your gender. Don't expect shout outs for all the little deeds you have done for gender equality. Women have been doing this for ages. Yet you will be encouraged!
