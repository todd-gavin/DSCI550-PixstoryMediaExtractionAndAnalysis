Although we hear a lot about carbon dioxide emissions in conversations around climate change another greenhouse gas plays a significant role in warming our atmosphere methane Methane is times more potent at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide and it accounts for up to of global warming since pre industrial times A majority of human caused methane emissions come from animal agriculture with coming from livestock digestion and waste This is because cows actually belch out methane while digesting their food Each year a single cow belches pounds of methane into the atmosphere Multiply those emissions by the billion cows in our global food system and it adds up to a dangerous amount of methane in our atmosphere In order to stop methane emissions the UN recommends shifting toward plant based diets and embracing alternative sources of protein They estimate that humans could cut methane emissions by which would be critical to slowing global warming
