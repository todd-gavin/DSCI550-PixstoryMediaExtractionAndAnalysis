Crystal Palace fullback Tyrick Mitchell shared a heartwarming moment after receiving his maiden England call up. The player was emotional about getting his first call up for the international side. 

After several players were ruled out of the team, England announced that Mitchell was one of the four players who’ve been called up ahead of the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.

The 22-year old in an interview after receiving the news about the call up said, “It’s a dream come true. I never, ever thought it would happen so quickly, so I’m literally over the moon, I found out [Saturday]. I got the text. I couldn’t believe it, I was just lost for words.”

The youngster has performed really well for his club. After making his senior debut in April 2020, Mitchell has made 33 appearances in all the tournaments for Palace. 

When asked about the contribution of his club in getting the call-up, he said, “I think my team-mates, the manager, everything about Palace has pushed me to understand that last year I did well, but this year I know what I’m capable of and I’m just trying to show it,”

When asked about playing at Wembley, he said, "Wembley is so close to home so to be called up for England and be around it and be in Wembley Stadium is literally a dream come true itself."
