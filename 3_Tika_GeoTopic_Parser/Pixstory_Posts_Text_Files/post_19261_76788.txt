Jesse Lingard at Manchester United Football Club is currently a mess that just keeps on growing A player at his boyhood club who should have been sold years ago is still at the club and now due to the wages obviously and certain other issues the club is finding it difficult to find suitors for him If clubs do come calling for Jesse the player gives a green light but the club stands in his way So in a way the club also is to be held responsible for the treatment of the player Last season a London club in West Ham came calling for him in January and MUFC did it s part and let him go on what was an initial loan deal until the summer Jesse thrived and was so good that his performances made West Ham finish strongly in the league A debut European football season was upon the London club which made them move for Lingard on permanent basis But again MUFC and it s demands for a player whose contract was running out made the deal fall apart The same thing is happening like a vicious circle this time it is Newcastle United with it s new owners who are all in for the Englishman and in for a loan deal until the summer as the player wants his options open after his contract expires With a few days left for the window to shut but surely lot of things can still happen with Lingard being stuck at his current club or move to Newcastle Everything lies in the hands of MUFC now and hopefully the player does all it takes to push for a move because what more does a player require apart from game time
