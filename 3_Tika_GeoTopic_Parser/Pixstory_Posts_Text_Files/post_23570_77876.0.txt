On January 25, BLACKPINK treated fans to a special and unexpected OT4 live broadcast.
Of course, the broadcast couldn’t ignore the fact that Jisoo had made her acting debut in Snowdrop… and that kiss! As expected, all the members watched the show and supported Jisoo, yet Lisa seemed to have a reaction that was #relatable. 

A fan asked Lisa whether she had already watched the kissing scene, and she replied, “Yes, of course. I watched it, okay.”

Yet, that wasn’t the end of it as Lisa couldn’t stop teasing Jisoo throughout, referring to her as “Kisoo,” and saying, “Unnie, are you kissy-Jisoo now.” What was funny is that Jisoo isn’t known as a member who likes showing affection towards the members, but she was even pretending to kiss Lisa after she called her “Kisoo.”

Considering how close the members are, it isn’t surprising that Lisa was anticipating the kiss. However, Jisoo pointed out that as Lisa watched it, she got very excited and was even ready to record it on her phone.

"The kiss scene was pretty long, like ten minutes. Lisa took a video from the beginning. She was excited, like, ‘Oh my.’ But, ten minutes later, ‘Come on, when will the scene come out.’ "

If that wasn’t enough, like BLINKs, with the final episodes approaching, Lisa wanted to try and get spoilers, asking, “Unnie can you give spoilers? There will be more kissing scenes, right?” As a true professional, Jisoo tried to throw her off the scent, saying, “No.”

Yet, Lisa wasn’t going to let it go so easy and kept prodding the group’s oldest member until Jisoo explained, “You’ll have to watch it when it airs to find out.”

 Lisa had the perfect answer for more 'KISOO' scenes that every K-Drama fan has said at least once in their lives, and it was, “HOW!? DO I WAIT UNTIL SATURDAY!”

Considering how passionate Jisoo and Jung Hae In’s first kiss was, it isn’t surprising that Lisa wants to see more and know what’s going to happen in the final few episodes.
