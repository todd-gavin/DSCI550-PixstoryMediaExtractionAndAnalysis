Tongue thrust has a number of telltale signs that manifest in children who have developed the pattern. These can include:
👉The tongue is visible between the teeth. The tip of the tongue sticks out between the teeth, whether the child is resting, swallowing, or speaking.
👉Mouth breathing.
👉Inability to close the lips completely. This could be due to a structural abnormality or habit.
👉Open bite. An open bite occurs when the front teeth don’t meet when the teeth are closed.
👉Slow, fast, or messy eating.
👉Speech impediment. Lisping of s and z sounds is common.
