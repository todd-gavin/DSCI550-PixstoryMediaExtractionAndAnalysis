Atletico Madrid locked horns with Real Madrid on Sunday (September 18) at the Metropolitano Stadium in a La Liga fixture.
As expected, the game was a highly intense battle between two of the best Spanish sides fighting for three valuable points in the race for the La Liga title.
In the end, the current Spanish champions extended their good run this season by winning the derby 2-1, thanks to goals from Rodrygo and Federico Valverde.
Following the defeat, when asked to comment on the match, Atletico manager Diego Simeone praised the opponents but also took a sly dig. He linked Real Madrid’s playing style with Atletico’s past team which had Diego Costa as a striker.
Back then, Simone’s side used to defend deep and rely on counter attacks to score goals. However, he used to face a lot of criticism from fans, rivals and ex-footballers for the boring style of play.
'I am left with the feeling of not having lost the bulk of the game despite (the) result. Their forcefulness is wonderful to see, a team that defends in a low block, and counterattacks. 'It reminds me of the team we had with Diego Costa, when they criticised us back then!'
What’s happening with Atletico Madrid?
With Barcelona and Atletico Madrid close to reaching an agreement for a permanent transfer, Antoine Griezmann got his first start of the season in the Madrid derby. But it wasn’t enough to seal a win for his side.
With the defeat against Real Madrid, Atletico are now standing at No.7 in points table. They have managed to accumulate only 10 points in six games and have already suffered two losses.
Simeone’s side have to step up their game in the upcoming fixtures if they want to stay relevant in the title race. Real Madrid and Barcelona are already eight and six points ahead of them.
