Had he not been associated with the IPL, we might have lost a gem of a player. This is an example of just one player, we have a long list of such great cricketers who has been explored through IPL and created an inspiring impact on the Indian Cricket Team. Because of the IPL we have got to see different players as potential captains for the Indian cricket team. In the last season of IPL, Hardik Pandya debuted as the captain of Gujrat Titans. Who would have thought that he would lead the new team till the finals to win it. Hardik Pandya would not have been even considered if it was not through the IPL. Now the question comes, Is the IPL helping the Indian Cricket team?

In many ways. There are so many uncapped players who got a chance to showcase their talent with top international cricketers, these will be the future of the Indian team. Players get an opportunity to groom themselves as world class players. They get a chance to compete while learning new skills and techniques. Many might get an opportunity to be a captain or a vice-captain, like KL Rahul. Has Mumbai Indians not won so many seasons, we would have not known how much depth Rohit Sharma has as a captain. 

There are always two sides of the coin, IPL has its effects as well. Injuries of the main players is always a concern. We expect our players to be more responsible for the national team and international tournaments. It also helps international players to get familiar with Indian cricket grounds, which is also a disadvantage in terms of international matches. 

But the positives are more which tends to go in support of IPL. It is celebrated as a festival in India which is witnessed by major countries all over the globe. IPL not only promotes cricket but also introduces the world to India's rich cultural heritage through its opening and closing ceremonies.
