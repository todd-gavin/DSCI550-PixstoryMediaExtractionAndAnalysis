In recent years, the population and competition of children has been exponentially growing. With academic and personal achievements by children being larger thain it has ever been, it's obvious that the competition amongst children is also more prominent. At first glance, this seems perfectly normal, but if you think about it, these competitions with the idea of winning and losing, in turn, winners and losers, can lead to some issues that could lead to worse problems growing into adulthood, dealing with self-esteem issues and eventually, insecurity.

~ Brain Chemistry
~ Hormones
~ Inherited Traits
~ Trauma
~ Pessimism of society
