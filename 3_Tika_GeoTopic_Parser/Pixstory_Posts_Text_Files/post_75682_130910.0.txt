Most of the people think travel is just for fun or its a way to enjoy in life but I always denied it. Travel is something which can mentally or physically heal a person.
In January 2022 , things are not gonna work for me and I frustrated from everything then one of my friend told me to take a solo trip wherever you want. At first it seems an excuse for me to running away from problems in life. But I gave a chance to solo trip to rishikesh, in the lap of GANGA. At their I used to sit in bank of Ganga in the morning with listening the "Ganga Aarti" which heals me a lot. It fills me with diffrent type of positive energy. Actually, I'm a content writer from last two year so I usually sit and start write in ghats of rishikesh. I cannot describe that feeling of writing it fills my mind with different ideas to write.I choose travelling in my hard time because i like it. I like to travel and explore diversity. So I suggest you all , In your hard time you should do whatever makes you happy only the point is to be happy and forget the problems of life because happiness can create a healthy mind which can give you solution to your problems.
Thankyou
