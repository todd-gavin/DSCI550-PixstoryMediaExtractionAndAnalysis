The Pelicans currently sit in ninth in the West at 33-43 while both the Lakers and San Antonio Spurs are tied for 10th at 31-45. Considering both the Pelicans and Spurs hold tiebreakers over the Lakers, L.A. will have to surpass one of the two if they want to make the Play-In Tournament.

That will be no easy task given the Lakersâ€™ tough schedule to finish out the season, but if they want to have any hope of doing so, James will have to be in the lineup for as many of those games as possible.
