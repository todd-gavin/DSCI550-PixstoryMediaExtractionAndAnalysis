The UEFA Nations League returns this weekend with a Scandinavian rivalry between Norway and Sweden on Sunday. On their best days, both clubs are capable of packing a punch and will be desperate to win this game.


Last season, Norway finished second in their group and missed out on promotion to the top level. Last week, the away team beat Serbia 1-0 and will be optimistic going into this match.


Sweden, on the other hand, finished last in their League A group and will have to work hard to return to the top of the tournament. The hosts defeated Slovenia 2-0 in their previous match and will be hoping for a repeat performance this weekend.

Norway vs Sweden: Probable Playing XI

Sweden: Robin Olsen; Emil Krafth, Carl Starfelt, Joakim Nilsson, Ludwig Augustinsson; Emil Forsberg, Jesper Karlstrom, Kristoffer Olsson; Dejan Kulusevski, Alexander Isak, Viktor Claesson

Norway : Orjan Nyland; Morten Pedersen, Stefan Strandberg, Leo Ostigard, Birger Meling; Fredrik Aursnes; Morten Thorsby, Sander Berge, Martin Odegaard, Mohamed Elyounoussi; Erling Haaland

Norway vs Sweden: Prediction

The odds on Norway starting their campaign with three straight wins would have been fairly long before the action kicked off last week, but having seen off stronger challengers, they will surely not slip up at home.

Sweden is now without a number of key players and will have to make the most of their existing lineup. This year, Norway has been the superior squad, and they have a tiny advantage coming into this game. We anticipate the away team to win by a slim margin.

Prediction:Norway 2-1 Sweden
