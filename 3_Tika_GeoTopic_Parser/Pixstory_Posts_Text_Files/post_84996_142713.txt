Liverpool narrowly missed out on the Premier League last season finishing runners up to Manchester City on the final day of the season The Reds went on to have a busy transfer window They signed Darwin Nunez Fabio Carvalho and Calvin Ramsay whilst offloading the likes of Takumi Minamino Divock Origi and Sadio Mane Liverpool fans were excited to see how these new players would perform and how Jurgen Klopp would improve Liverpool s style of play However the season has been very lacklustre so far and the Reds have been one of the most underperforming teams in the Premier League Liverpool kicked off their season with a lunchtime kick off against newly promoted Fulham This was a game you d expect Liverpool to win rather comfortably However Fulham showed grit and put up a good game against the Reds Most people agreed that Fulham deserved to take a point from this tight fixture Next Jurgen Klopp s Liverpool side had taken on Crystal Palace in their first home game of the season Liverpool once again failed to win drawing to the Eagles This is when people started questioning whether or not the Reds still had the quality to challenge for the league Liverpool s third game was against their rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford Both teams were winless heading into the game but Erik ten Hag s side managed to take the three points Goals from Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford put Manchester United ahead and Mohamed Salah s late goal was nothing more than a consolation This is when Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool were seriously under the spotlight Three games in the Reds sat winless with only two points to their name Luckily Liverpool had Bournemouth next whom they battered Everyone thought that Liverpool had finally found their form after this win but that wasn t the case at all
