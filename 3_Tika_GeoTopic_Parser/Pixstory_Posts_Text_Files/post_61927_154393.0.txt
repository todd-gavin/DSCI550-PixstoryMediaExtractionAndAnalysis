The latest episode of House of the Dragon paves the way for the real hell that’s about to break loose as King Viserys I (Paddy Considine) has finally passed away. He hasn’t made one single sensible decision on the show, but ironically, he held the House Targaryen and, well, the series somewhat together. We’ve seen his slow decline for the past few episodes, but we weren’t quite so ready to see him rotting away.
Nevertheless, Paddy Considine brought some gravitas to the character in one of the turning points of the show where a feeble, yet determined Viserys I stumbles into the court, staggering and just about makes his way to the Iron Throne. It’s the last time where we will see him exude any sort of power, or well, whatever it is that he did try. The episode ends with him making a prophecy about the Song of Ice and Fire — a hint at Jon Snow from Game of Thrones, but that’s a hundred years later. Well now, he’s gone, it’s time for a civil war to break out.
Daemon is still got a hot temper, and this show seems to revel in it (as do we, let’s be honest) — but now, it’s only for very specific occasions, like when his wife is slandered in court. It’s actually a tragically hilarious scene in the show. Vaemond Corlys insults Rhaenyra and her children, and a doddering Viserys demands his tongue. Daemon coolly steps in and chops off his head, as nonchalantly as one cuts vegetables. “He can keep his tongue,” he says. Matt Smith’s Daemon is a deliciously different character and he brings something exciting to the show—there’s a definite lull when he isn’t around.
House of the Dragon is nearing its end and it’s finally getting a lot more interesting. The King’s gone, what’s going to happen next?
