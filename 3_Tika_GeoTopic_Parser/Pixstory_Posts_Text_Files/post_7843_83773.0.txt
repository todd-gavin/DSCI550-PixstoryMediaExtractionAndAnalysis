What a player, many team-mates called him the most underrated player of their generation. Sir Alex Ferguson himself said he was his most important. Could play any role he wanted. He was perfect. He played as a CMF mainly and LMF. He could man mark any player and they couldn't get past him, he once man marked Messi and left him with no room to play the flowing style of his magical feet. Happy birthday to Ji-Sung Park, one of my favourite Manchester United players
