On the outskirts of the remote town of Roebourne in WA's north, a community gathers to celebrate a birthday shared by some of its oldest residents.  

Affectionately known by locals as the "Old People's Birthday", July 1 was the date allocated to many First Nations people who did not have official records of their birth in the 20th century. 

Many Aboriginal people in Roebourne are Yindjibarndi people, who were moved off their country in the region's tablelands by authorities with very few – if any – recognised documents.

"Maybe up until the mid '60s, but definitely before the '50s a lot of people born out bush didn't have a registered birthday," organiser Beth Smith said.

Beth Smith started the event in Roebourne about 30 years ago and said the community had embraced it as a chance to celebrate locals' culture and honour elders, including those who have passed.

"I think that's why people love it; because it's a happy occasion," she said.

The annual celebration attracts hundreds of people.

Ivanna Sambo is a Torres Strait Islander who moved to the nearby town of Karratha 16 years ago.

She has attended the Old People's Birthday celebrations in Roebourne every year since moving to the region.

"I love coming out here to celebrate with our elders. It reminds me of home, just our togetherness and how we collaborate and come together as a family," she said.

"I think it's important for our young ones, the togetherness."

While many of the elders have passed away, the event has grown over the years and locals hope it has a long future ahead as a celebration of the region's heritage.

"When our elders pass I'd like to see this event still happen on the 1st of July just to remember the ones who have passed," Ms Sambo said.
