The National Film Awards according to legendary director Adoor Gopalakrishnan have devolved into a nasty practical joke Previously well known film directors theatre performers and critics made up the jury Now though an anonymous jury has been making fun of all of this Adoor remarked He was speaking at the John Abraham Memorial Award ceremony hosted by the Film Societies of India The head of the jury that selects recipients of prizes is chosen at random Nobody needs to explain why they won the prizes because everyone is aware of it I can only state that these inclinations are unfair Many individuals believe that movies provide variety entertainment But cinema is a creative medium The majority of the jury is a fan of Bollywood films An ex central minister once stated with pride that a well known Bollywood actor answered his call In the meantime a friend in Delhi informed me that many jury members had grown weary after just two films The award winning filmmaker observed that some people give awards to a select few people out of courtesy since they don t watch movies or understand anything about them Adoor continued These are just my musings
