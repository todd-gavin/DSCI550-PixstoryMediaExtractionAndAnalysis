24th September, 2015. Bayern Munich were down 0-1 against German club Wolfsburg. At halftime Pep Guardiola decided to sub out Thiago for an injured Lewandowski (Injured ankle) to avoid a loss, little did Guardiola know that was probably the best decision he ever made. 
8 minutes and 59 seconds later, Bayern Munich led 5-1, with all five goals scored by the one and only: Robert Lewandowski. 
This godlike performance of his is remembered even today. 
Lewandowski is the first player to score 5 goals in a Bundesliga match since Michael Tonnies in 1991, and the 14th player to ever do it. 
Till date, I consider this to be the finest plays in the game. 
Let me know what your favorite play is.
