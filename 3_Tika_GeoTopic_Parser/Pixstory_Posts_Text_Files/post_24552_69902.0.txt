Netflix has confirmed the production of Black Knight with director Cho Ui-seok and a mega cast lineup of Kim woo-bin, Kang you-seok and E Som. In this new Netflix Series, Cho and Kim woo-bin reunite after their blockbuster hit film Master. 

Black Knight illustrates an air polluted world in 2071, where people depend on respirator masks to breathe. Only one percent of the human race has survived, and a strict social stratification has been established in the deserted lands of the Korean Peninsula. Delivery drivers play a crucial role within this system, and for refugees, becoming a delivery driver is their only hope for survival. Amid chaos, Black Knight tells the story of a legendary delivery driver “5-8” with exceptional battle skills and a refugee “Sawol” who dreams of following in his footsteps.
