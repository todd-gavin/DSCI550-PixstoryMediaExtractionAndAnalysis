The rule my the house was to watch what my elder siblings would watch on TV Thanks to my older siblings for introduction me to such wonderful series which I can binge watch all the time The first drama series I was introduced to was LOST survivors of a plane crash find themselves stranded on a mysterious island They are forced to work together for their survival when they realise that they are not alone on the island This series was full of mystery and suspense and I would watch it with full dedication with my older siblings Anyone who loves mystery and suspense should definitely watch this VAMPIRE DIARIES was one of the most adventurous series I ever watch but absolutely love the suspense that kept unfolding episodes after episodes Stephen was the epitome of an ideal boyfriend caring understanding and an ardent lover any girl would want But Damon Salvatore had something to fall for in the series his wittiness deep eyes and attitude overshadowed the ideal boyfriend traits of Stephen I can confidently say that there is no character in this new area of Netflix and Prime videos who can March Demon Salvatore HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER was another amazing sitcom I watch and can watch all over again and again This series was about Ted Mosby an architect who recounts to his children the events that led him to meet their mother His journey is made more eventful by the presence of his friends Lily Marshall Robin and Barney While Ted was supposed to get all attention in the series it was Barney Stinson who rock the entire show F R I E N D S I am not going to say anything about F R I E N D S because those who know knows it all Plus the picture I share of F R I E N D S says it all Well I started with DARK and LUCIFER and some more series with my younger brother when I was in Afghanistan but never got the chance to pick from where I left
