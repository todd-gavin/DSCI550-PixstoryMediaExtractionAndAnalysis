In one of the best but also one of the worst things that can happen to a mathematician happened to James Maynard Fresh out of graduate school he solved one of the discipline s oldest and most central problems about the spacing of prime numbers It was an achievement that ordinarily would have garnered him fame even beyond the cloistered world of pure math research There was just one difficulty Another mathematician had proved the most headline grabbing part of Maynard s result a few months earlier using a completely different method Number theorists however instantly recognized Maynard as someone to watch In the years that followed Maynard more than justified those early hopes knocking down one fundamental problem after another Today July the year old mathematician now a professor at the University of Oxford was awarded the Fields Medal for his spectacular contributions in analytic number theory according to the award citation His work is highly ingenious often leading to surprising breakthroughs on important problems that seemed to be inaccessible by current techniques Fields Medals shine a spotlight that usually follows a mathematician for the rest of their career but Maynard cherishes the hope that his research life won t change too much I m still going to be working on the same problems and interested in the same things he said
