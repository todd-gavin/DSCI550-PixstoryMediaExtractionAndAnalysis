The fiery snack is an adaptation of paan a common street food snack in India that normally consists of areca nut wrapped inside a betel leaf Paan is sometimes combined with tobacco and people eating it can often be seen spitting out red saliva The fire paan combines spices dried fruits nuts and sugar which is then set on fire and thrown straight into the mouth of the customer by the street vendor It seems totally crazy for a few reasons hygiene aside the idea of someone throwing hot melting sugar into your mouth on the side of a street in Delhi just seems like asking for trouble Have you ever had a caramel burn As mad as it seems people in India are happily standing in line for a shot
