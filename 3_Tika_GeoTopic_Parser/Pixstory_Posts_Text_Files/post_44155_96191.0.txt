This summer, Marseille are allegedly interested in signing Manchester United defender Eric 
Bailly. In recent years, the Ivory Coast international has been a peripheral character at Old Trafford, and he may seek a move away from the club.

According to French journalist Fabrice Hawkins, the Ligue 1 team sought to recruit the 28-year-old on loan during the January transfer window, but the deal fell through. This summer, Jorge Sampaoli's side is expected to restart their chase of Bailly.

In the summer of 2016, the center-back left Villarreal for Manchester United in a £30 million transfer. He quickly established himself as a regular starter for the club, making 38 appearances in his first season at Old Trafford and contributing to the Red Devils' Europa League and EFL Cup victories.

However, injuries have decimated the Ivory Coast international, and he has plummeted down United's pecking order. In the last five seasons, he has only made 45 Premier League 
appearances for United.

Due to his quickness, physical size, and determination, Bailly is now the club's fourth-choice center-back despite being considered one of the most naturally gifted defenders in the team.

A lot of teams around Europe were impressed by his performance for Ivory Coast in the Africa 
Cup of Nations. Bailly's deal is due to expire in 2024.

As a result, Manchester United may decide to trade him this summer rather than risk losing him to a bargain next year. To restart his career, the defender may seek a transfer away from Old Trafford.

Under Jorge Sampaoli, Marseille had a successful 2021–22 season. The team is presently in second position in Ligue 1, fifteen points behind league leaders Paris Saint-Germain.

Les Olympiens will be looking to add to their team this summer in order to maintain their 
improvement under the Argentine boss.

The Ligue 1 champions might face heavy competition to acquire Bailly. A number of Serie A teams are thought to have made proposals for the center-back.
