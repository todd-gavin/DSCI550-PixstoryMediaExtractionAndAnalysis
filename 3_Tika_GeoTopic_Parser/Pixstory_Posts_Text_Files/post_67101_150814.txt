Living people must communicate To rescue our world and create a happy humanity we must share our duties It is outdated to think of others in terms of we and them This is why I am dedicated to developing a sense of our human family s unity Everywhere I go I try to remind people that we are all human beings The moment has come to recognise that our future is in the hands of others We must be concerned about others and take care of them in our own interests This is the wise method to protect our own interests It is a dumb approach to ignore others and think only of yourself
