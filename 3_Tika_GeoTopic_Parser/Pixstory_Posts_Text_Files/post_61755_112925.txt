First Kevin Durant s trade demand turned the entire NBA world upside down Now it has put the league on hold With more than half of NBA teams contacting the Nets with trade packages the normal free agency frenzy has been slowed to a crawl As Nets general manager Sean Marks and owner Joe Tsai sift through all those offers for the foundation of their upcoming rebuilding process and fans have started to eye names such as Donovan Mitchell the league is essentially in a holding pattern After three years of acquiescence to the wishes of Durant and even more so of Kyrie Irving the Nets finally held firm They did not give Irving a full max extension and Durant was reportedly not pleased when director of player development Adam Harrington with whom Durant has been tight since their days together in Oklahoma City was let go Many of the NBA teams are chomping at the bit to get Durant s services While it is clear that Durant wants to go to either Miami or Phoenix the Nets would be on the lookout for the deal that heavily favours them rather than picking a perfect locale for Durant
