The energy-rich Gulf monarchy Qatar  supplies some European countries with gas in the form of divertible contracts, which means they are able to divert supply across to other customers. 

“We're not going to divert [contracts] and will keep them in Europe, even if there is financial gain for us to divert away, we would not do that,” Al Kaabi said. 
“That's in solidarity with what's going on in Europe,” he said.

Still, the minister rejected imposing sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, saying “energy should stay out of politics” and reiterated that completely stopping Russian gas supply to Europe is “not practically possible.” The minister also said that his nation is not “choosing sides” in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
