We can reform a flawed system but a broken system need mending We can t just keep accepting it and try to work our way around it The suicide rates among children is heartbreaking the depression rate is even high You can t work your way around a system that literally kills It s kind of sad just how much we don t care about what s happening to our society especially our children The system has trapped them into a vicious cycle of struggling alone and not getting help because it is how it is They don t need that they especially don t deserve that Change starts early How many generations will fall victim to this We actually need to teach our kids to be able to live along with work It s a lazy way out to not want to change this system which is just preying on our children Homework is not the only wrong thing about it It is also forcing kids to indulge in subjects they don t like or worse they don t understand It is purposefully pushing them into a life they feel suffocated in As a wildlife blogger I can assure you school was little to no help in my career I had to learn stuff on my own for the most part School was just a stressful hurdle between me and my dream In today s age of technology you can learn almost anything on your own Of course except fields that need expert guidance and practice like medical or engineering But for those who don t want to have those careers making them hustle like that is unfair
