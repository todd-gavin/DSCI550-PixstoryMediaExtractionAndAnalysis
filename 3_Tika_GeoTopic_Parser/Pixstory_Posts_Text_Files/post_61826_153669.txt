Taylor Swift is debuting a new song Lavender Haze about longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn finally giving fans a glimpse into their love story Swift has kept her relationship with the British actor incredibly private for six years now and in a new video promoting her upcoming album Midnights she revealed exactly why The singer shared a clip on Instagram to discuss Lavender Haze the first track of her much anticipated album I happened upon the phrase lavender haze when I was watching Mad Men and I looked it up because I thought it sounded cool Swift says in the video And it turns out that it s a common phrase used in the s where they would just describe being in love She explains further If you were in the lavender haze then that meant that you were in that all encompassing love glow and I thought that was really beautiful The singer adds that because of social media a lot of people these days have to deal with scrutiny over their relationships She and Alwyn of course are no exception Like my relationship for six years we ve had to dodge weird rumors tabloid stuff and we just ignore it Swift says And so this song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff Though Swift rarely speaks of her personal life with her boyfriend her album Lover was essentially an ode to him
