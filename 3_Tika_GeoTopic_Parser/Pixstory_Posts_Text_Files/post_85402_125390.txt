Honestly I was very excited for Batgirl The decision to write down a fully shot million live action Batman verse movie instead of releasing it on HBO Max was incredibly surprising especially given the optics of ditching a DC superhero project that starred Dominican actress Leslie Grace In an age where so many subpar projects are put onto streaming services with a throw it at the wall and see what sticks mentality Comic book master Kevin Smith said It s a really poor look to cancel the Latina Batgirl movie As per Hollywood Reporter David Zaslav CEO of Warner Bros Discovery defended the choice by saying that the movie from directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah We re not going to launch a movie until it s ready We re not going to launch a movie to make a quarter and we re not going to put a movie out unless we believe in it We re going to focus on quality
