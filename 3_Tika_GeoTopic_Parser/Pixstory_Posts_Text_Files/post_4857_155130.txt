 year Srihari Natraj an Olympian and Indian Swimmer while returning from National Games held in Gujarat via Indigo airlines faced rude behaviour of its staff and were also charged extra for the excess baggage they had which was medals and goodies the athletes won The athlete tweeted Dear IndiGo E I was returning from the National Games held in Gujarat and the staff not only behaved badly but also charged us a hefty amount for excess baggage which was the medals and goodies that we athletes had won Honestly the amount wasn t an issue it s the the way they treated me and my teammates Should we leave the medals we win back at the venue he further tweeted What s ironic to see the next day the airline tweeted in support of the deaf athletes mentioning they re proud of the Indian teak for Winning the DICC T Champions Often Indian athletes inspite of winning multiple accolades and medals in tournaments like the Olympics and Commonwealth face discrimination and disrespect in multiple areas Neitzens commented on his tweet condemning the behaviour of the airline they feel this is not the treat champions and national treasures of the country Though the airline did reply to his tweet wishing him way to glory for the nation But I wonder if they Crickets and not National Games athletes will the airline will be treating the players in a similar way What s heartbreaking is the state of athletes in the country is sad they inspite of winning medals and adding glory to the nation aren t getting the minimum respect they deserve and also tend to face discrimination at different levels
