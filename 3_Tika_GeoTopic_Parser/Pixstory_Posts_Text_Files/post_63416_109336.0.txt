Beginning from the day of industrialization, the carbon dioxide emission and the release of carbon from the fuels have been a major challenge for the scientific world to convert carbon dioxide fuel into green fuel. Recently it has been found that certain catalysts, as well as biological enzymes, can produce fuels that are clean and green using renewable sources such as light, but the major drawback is the low efficiency of those respective fuels. Research in the laboratories shows that carbon emission can be altered into cleaner green fuels without any expense of energy and any unwanted by-products such as hydrogen. Though the production of by-products can be minimized, this also influences the performance of carbon dioxide as a fuel. The process of electrolysis in which the enzymes are being isolated from bacteria, powers the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide into fuel. Adding another enzyme to speed up the reaction helps to increase efficiency and reduce unwanted by-products. Electrolysis is the backbone of reducing carbon emission based on the concept of capturing carbon and making something useful from it. The efforts are being made to eradicate the use of carbon dioxide from the air where enzymes can act perfectly as it provides suitable conditions for the working properties of enzymes. In a nutshell, it can be concluded that the base to a more efficient carbon dioxide electrolysis which is the working structure of the sources, lies in the catalyst. Improvements are being done for the enhancement of artificial catalysts still it falls short because of its importance for the development of better synthetic catalysts which is going to deploy carbon dioxide electrolysis at large scales.
