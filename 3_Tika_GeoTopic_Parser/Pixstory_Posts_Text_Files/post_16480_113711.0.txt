Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor are soon going to be parents.
One of the happiest persons in the industry is Karan Johar. The filmmaker treats Alia Bhatt as his first-born.
Karan Johar told ETimes, "I was like I can't believe you are having a baby. It was like your baby is having a baby. It was a very emotional moment for me, it still is! I've seen her from a girl transforming into an outstanding artiste, into this wonderful self-assured woman."
