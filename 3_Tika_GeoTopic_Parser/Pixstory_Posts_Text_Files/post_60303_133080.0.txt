FIFA announced on Friday that it has removed the suspension placed on the All India Football Federation (AIFF) earlier this month as a result of improper third-party influence.
The Under-17 Women's World Cup, which was slated to take place in India from October 11â€“30, will now go on as scheduled due to the lifting of the suspension.
