A relationship isn't always 100/100 it has its ups and downs always remember to respect your partner even during disagreements. Having bad days is okay having doubts is okay when you can freely discuss them and find a solution.

It's not okay to blame and put a person under so much mental stress. Always aim for a healthy relationship .
