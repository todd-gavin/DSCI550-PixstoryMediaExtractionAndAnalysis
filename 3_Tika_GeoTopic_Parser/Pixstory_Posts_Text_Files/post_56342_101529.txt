In the State of the Union I said that it is time to strengthen privacy protections ban targeted advertising to children and demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children I want to commend the Federal Trade Commission for unanimously taking a big step in that direction today When children and parents access online educational products they shouldn t be forced to accept tracking and surveillance to do so The FTC is making it clear that such requirements would violate the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act and that the agency will be cracking down on companies that persist in exploiting our children to make money
