Irresponsible wildlife tourism is not only harmful to the environment but also to humans and animals In the event of too much human intervention shy and solitary animals such as tigers would relocate their territory How does that affect us Well for once it means the rising population of herbivores in the areas without the presence of an apex predator That will destroy the ecological cycle of the area which includes its soil and food production More is that it s also a direct threat to humans Tigers can feel too threatened OR get used to us in either cases they can become maneaters These unethical ways have the greatest impact on birds For better viewpoints many tourists and photographers clip tree tops resulting in habitat loss for the birds Not to mention this results the birds and their babies in a nude view to predators who can easily prey on them Uninformed environmental tourists and irresponsible photographers who fail to comprehend that the jungle is home to wild animals are posing a new threat to the forests and wildlife
