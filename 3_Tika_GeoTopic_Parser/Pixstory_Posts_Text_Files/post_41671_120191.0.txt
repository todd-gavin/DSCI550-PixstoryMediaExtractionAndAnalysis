Because they don't want to wear their team's inclusion shirt, seven Manly Sea Eagles players have withdrawn from an Australian National Rugby League match. 

As USA Today reported, to support LGBTQ inclusion in sports, the jersey has rainbow stripes and a rainbow collar in place of the traditional white sections. The team intends to wear it for one game against the Sydney Roosters. 

Des Hasler, the Sea Eagles' head coach, said on Tuesday that seven players had informed the club's administrators that donning the pride jersey goes against their cultural and religious convictions.

“The players will not play on Thursday and we accept their decision,” Hasler said. “These young men are strong in their beliefs and convictions and we will give them the space and support they require.

“The playing group are solid and understanding of each other’s views. As a club we will wear the jersey on Thursday night.”

Moreover, Hasler apologized for the fallout which stemmed from the club’s lack of advance consultation with the playing group.

“Our intent was to be caring towards all diverse groups who face inclusion issues daily,” Hasler said. “Sadly this poor management has caused significant confusion, discomfort and pain for many people, in particular those groups whose human rights we in fact attempting to support.

“We wish to apologize to the LGBTQ community who embrace the rainbow colors, who use these colors for pride and advocacy and human rights issues.”
