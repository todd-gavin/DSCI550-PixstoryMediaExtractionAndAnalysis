I still remember how it all started. How I got into Photography in the first place. It was high school. This senior of mine got a new Camera and I still remember how excited I was to get my hands on it. And suddenly, it “clicked” 
I offered him to take his Camera on rent and paid him by doing portrait shoots. But this was the first Photo I ever took on a DSLR and that’s why it is really special for me. Straight from 2016 ❤️
