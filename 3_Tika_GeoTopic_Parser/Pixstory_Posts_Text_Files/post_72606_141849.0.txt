 Srilanka won the final match against Pakistan by 23 runs in the finals...!!!
It was an unexpected comeback by the Lankan team under the stuartÂ  leadership of Dasun Shanaka to win the title.
Kudos to the Srilanka team as the batting, bowling and fielding performance of the team members were incredibly exceptional.
Cheers to the captain and the team members ğŸ¤—ğŸ¤—ğŸ¤—ğŸ’¯ğŸ’¯ğŸ’¯ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚ğŸ™‚
