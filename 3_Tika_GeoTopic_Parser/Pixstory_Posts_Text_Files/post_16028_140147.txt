 Abstract An association between physical inactivity and obesity risk has been established However the relationship between sports activity and the risk of diabetes among Chinese populations is still unclear We prospectively investigated the association between sports activity and incidence of type diabetes in a Chinese population Habitual physical activity in the presumed last year was obtained from a questionnaire developed by Baecke and colleagues During a median year follow up period among the participants with complete questionnaire data participants developed diabetes After adjusting for age gender and body mass index the relative risk RR of diabetes according to quartiles of sports activity were and Confidence Interval CI P for trend Participants with the highest quartiles of sports activity had a significantly lower risk than the participants with the lowest quartiles among the obese group multivariate RR CI P for trend Furthermore the RRs of diabetes were CI for participants who were obese and sedentary compared with those who were of a healthy weight and participated actively in sports The findings suggest a significant inverse association between sports activity and incidence of type diabetes in middle to older aged Chinese individuals Sources
