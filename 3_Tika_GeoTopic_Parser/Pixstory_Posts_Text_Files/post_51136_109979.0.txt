For one or many reasons, people often turn to drugs in teenage years. Factors, such as broken homes, divorce of parents, or intolerable living and financial conditions are among the many reasons why teenagers resort to drugs to relieve their stress and find some emotional comfort. However, what many youngsters do not consider are the social, health and other problems that come with a life of drugs. What is more concerning is that the longer you are on drugs, the harder it becomes to become clean again.
