Back in when the Delhi Metro extended its routes to cover many more parts of the city things began to look as good as they get A city with a good public transit system one that is safe clean accessible is what they call a world class city Soon after Delhi Metro introduced an all women s coach There had seemed to be a need for it As someone who has lived in Delhi all along I recognise how indispensable and alluring the idea of an all women s coach is When that exclusive coach was installed it s all I ever used when taking the train Seemed like a great idea at the time but here s why it s not When you introduce an all women s coach you make it increasingly difficult for anyone identifying as a woman to commute in the general coach You demarcate gender identities more distinctly than ever before You subtly convey the message that women s safety security and privacy are dependent on their own choices and by choosing to commute in the general coach they are taking a risk thereby absolving everyone else of any blame It also seems to suggest subliminally that women are safe among other women This is of course the finest instance of benevolent sexism I have witnessed several times women in the Metro haranguing complete strangers on their choice of clothes recreation the company they keep and whatnot At best they stare at you mercilessly silently rebuking you for being the way you are There s hardly any freedom where there is expected to be The women s coach then becomes akin to the home providing the illusion of safety but that s about it When done right a city s public transit system is its lifeline the great leveller of social disparity the enabler of employability the facilitator of freedom While the all women s coach enabled many women to commute freely and acceptably for the first time thereby allowing them a safe space outside of the home it also crippled us in many ways What s your experience of the Delhi Metro
