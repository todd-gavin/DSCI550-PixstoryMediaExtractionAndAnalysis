Alessia Russo is a gem. It is a pity she was injured last season, which derailed her season. But no injury could keep her down. Even though Manchester United Womenâ€™s team manager Marc Skinner is taking it cautiously and introducing her to the scene slowly, she has come up with 9 goals and recently went on to win the Barclays FAWSL Player of the Month award for March. Next season onwards you can expect an improved Alessia Russo to fire all guns blazing and lead Manchester United to glory.
