Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, and Lalu Yadav, the leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, will meet Sonia Gandhi, the chief of the Congress, on Sunday night in Delhi, according to reports. They will finally meet after more than six years at this time. According to sources, the two Bihar leaders also expected Rahul Gandhi to attend the meeting. While conducting the Congress' Kanyakumari to Kashmir Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi is currently in Kerala.
The last time Nitish Kumar and Sonia Gandhi interacted was at an Iftaar before the 2015 elections in Bihar.
Earlier this month, during his most recent trip to Delhi, the Chief Minister of Bihar held a meeting with Rahul Gandhi. Gandhi was away receiving medical care at the time.
Regarding Yadav, he was imprisoned in 2018 for a number of fodder scam instances before being placed in isolation due to the pandemic. The sick leader, who is currently on bail, will go to Singapore in the upcoming weeks for a kidney transplant.
Although reports claimed that this would be a courtesy visit, there is a chance that some significant issues, such as expanding the Grand Alliance to a national level, could be discussed.
The leaders in Bihar are looking into that prospect, especially as Kumar attempts to unite the opposition against the BJP in advance of the 2024 presidential race.
The meeting takes place as Congress gets ready to choose its next leader. On Thursday, the election's nominating procedure began.
Most significant opposition figures were visited with by Kumar during his previous trip to Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal, the president of the Delhi government, Sharad Pawar, Akhilesh Yadav, the leader of the Samajwadi Party, and other Leftist figures were on the list.
