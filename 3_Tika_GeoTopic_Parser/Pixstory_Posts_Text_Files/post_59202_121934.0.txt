Sachin Tendulkar saved the Indian team from inevitable defeats on numerous occasions and collected a multitude of awards for his contributions to Indian cricket. Amongst all his glory and achievements, his biggest individual achievement remains ‘Bharat Ratna’, India’s highest civilian award which he acquired on February 4  2014.
On February 4, 2014, Tendulkar was conferred the Bharat Ratna by the then President of India, the late Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan's Durbar Hall. The Tendulkar Bharat Ratna win made the cricketer the first sportsperson, as well as, the youngest person to receive the prestigious award. 
With Sachin Tendulkar completing seven years since winning the coveted Bharat Ratna, fans started trending the legendary batsman's name on Twitter. Several reactions poured in as fans lauded Tendulkar for becoming the first sportsperson to win the award. Here's a look at a few reactions.

Sachin Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of 11, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of 16, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.
