Some people prefer the written words that calm and soothe them and give them the boost, the push they need while some require a more logical and technical explanation to doing something. The human mind is a complex machine by its sheer capability and what we know of it by experiences to be capable of, but an understanding into its processes, not just experiential knowledge but biological, physiological and psychological knowledge together help people understand more and gain a deeper satisfaction as a result for why things happen the way they do with our brains and thoughts. MIT Open Courseware has an Introduction to Psychology course, an online and open for all class that gives this particular kind of explanation and knowledge to whomever would what to have it. Compared to the vast studies one may do while pursuing a psychological career, it still has a great scholarly syllabus that teaches a lot of basics and causes in detail. If you don't want to enroll in the official course, you can still access the video lectures on their YouTube channel. Such efforts into educating people wherever, whenever is truly useful and amazing for those unable to get such knowledge for whatever reason, via an official source.
