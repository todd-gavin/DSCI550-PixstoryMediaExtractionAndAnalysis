What kind of Aussie are you if you donâ€™t remember Mr. Squiggle?

Over the course of its 40-year run, this popular kids' programme grew to resemble Australia's response to programmes like Captain Kangaroo or Bozo the Clown. 

As per Collider, the puppeteer Norman Hetherington series, which aired from 5-minute intervals to 30-minute variety shows, had a straightforward premise. First, a marionette puppet like Pinocchio arrives from his residence on the moon. 

He received "squiggles" on paper every week from a different spectator, who had a pencil for a nose. He then created original drawings by circling those squiggles with his nose and displaying them to his television audience. 

This type of interaction made Mr. Squiggle a fixture for many generations, while being undoubtedly simple.

BRB, watching it again!
