Three MLAs—Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi, RTDC Chairman Dharmendra Pathak, and Shanti Dhariwal—who held the parallel meeting of MLAs when they passed a resolution on the next Chief Minister—have been urged to face disciplinary action.
The MLAs discussed Sachin Pilot's uprising in 2020 during the meeting and adopted a resolution mandating that the Chief Minister be picked from among those who supported the government at the time.
After Mr. Gehlot's replacement was supposed to be chosen at a legislative party meeting, 92 MLAs met with the Speaker and threatened to resign en masse if Mr. Pilot was not given the top job.
Additionally, in opposition to party chief Sonia Gandhi's efforts to mediate the dispute, the MLAs turned down one-on-one meetings with Central leaders.
