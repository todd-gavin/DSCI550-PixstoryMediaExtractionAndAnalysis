Had the Tastiest Ceaser Salad Ever!! ğŸ¤©
Â Â  Whenever I go to a Italian or Continental based cafe or restaurant i often prefer to order the classic ceaser if its present on the menu! Its very basic and generally it's taste dose not vary a lot no matter where you have it ,But at this Cafe I visited last weekend ,it almost felt as if I was tasting an entirely different dish! The added dash of lime juice made its texture and taste so much more interesting, I already see myself frequenting the cafe for this salad alone!!
Do you also like salad??!ğŸ¥—
