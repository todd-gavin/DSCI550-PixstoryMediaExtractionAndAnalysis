The Russian forces are on it with their attacking legacy this early morning of Friday, 4th March 2022. This plant generates over 1/5th of the electricity in Ukraine. However, while the Russian troops accumulated the Plant, the reactor had already safely shut down beforehand. And it didn't cause any change in the radiation level as for now.
