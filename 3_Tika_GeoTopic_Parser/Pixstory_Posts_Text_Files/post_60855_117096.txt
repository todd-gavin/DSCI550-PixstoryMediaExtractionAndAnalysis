The most thrilling part of my course work this semester has been studying films and familiarizing myself with exemplary works in movies across the world We began with the earliest filmmakers and directors To be honest one semester is too short a time to learn this subject Today we had a discussion about George M li s and his influence on modern cinema Marie Georges Jean M li s was a genius French illusionist who gradually transitioned from theatrics to making movies He embedded much of his magic tricks and illusions into his films narratives He took a keen interest in making motion pictures after attending a private event organized by the Lumi re brothers cinematograph He tried buying their technology but the Lumi res disagreed because they wanted to monopolize their invention Soon after M li s managed to acquire a animatograph and began his first works in film making M li s is considered to be the first person to use editing montage and special effects in his films Coincidentally the discovery that he could use editing in films to trick the audience was an accidental discovery While he was shooting Parisian streets his device stopped working for sometime After fixing it he filmed the rest When he developed the film he discovered that the two clips had combined to create an interesting transitioning illusory trick He applied the technique of editing to create superb fantasy themed science fiction movies Jules Verne adventure kind He also employed special effects splices tinted coloured backgrounds multiple exposures lapses etc Some of these special techniques did cost a good fortune but nonetheless he continued creating and had made more than of these short animations Sadly only part of his work exists today He is now known as the father of sci fi and fantasy cinema We have come a long way since that time in film making but it s interesting to trace the evolution of cinema It s amazing how they made such amazing works even with limited technology Do watch A trip to the moon a short film by M li s and observe the tricks he uses
