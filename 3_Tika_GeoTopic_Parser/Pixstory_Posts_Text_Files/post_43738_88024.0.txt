David de Gea, the goalkeeper for Manchester United, has been dropped out of Spain's team for the upcoming March internationals, and has been replaced by Robert Sanchez of Brighton and David Raya of Brentford.

With United, the 31-year-old has had a mixed season. While he has saved their blushes on the field and faced the media when the chips are down off it, he has not been immune to the occasional gaffe.

His club side has been hampered by his inability to control the ball at his feet, particularly since the arrival of Ralf Rangnick. De Gea has been left out of Spain's team to face Albania and Iceland later this month, according to coach Luis Enrique.

De Gea had already fallen out of favour with La Roja and was not as well-liked in his homeland as he is in England, having lost his starting status to Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga a few years back before being replaced by Athletic Club's Unai Simon.

What's more damaging for De Gea is the fact that Enrique has chosen two other Premier League goalkeepers? Sanchez of Brighton is already a semi-regular in the Spain system, whereas Raya of Brentford has never represented his country at any level and has only recently returned to the Bees' line-up after a knee injury.

While De Gea's troubles with the ball have been highlighted this season, Sanchez and Raya are both superb at it, indicating that this is a quality Enrique is looking for in his goalkeepers going forward.

Unai Simon of Athletic Bilbao has been a regular starter in recent months.

After suffering a significant knee injury in Brentford's 2-1 loss to Leicester City in October, Raya has missed 14 Premier League games this season. On February 9, he made his comeback in a 2-0 loss to Manchester City and has been in goal ever since.

This season, he has five clean sheets in 15 league games for Brentford, and his eye-catching passing has earned him praise.
