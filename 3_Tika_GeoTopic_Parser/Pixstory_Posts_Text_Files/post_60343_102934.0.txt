During the Delhi riots following anti-CAA protests, Pathan was shown in viral footage pointing a gun at a police officer (Citizenship Amendment Act). He was arrested and found guilty by a judge.

Rioting, provocation to religious hatred, and attempted murder are among the charges filed against him.
His lawyers contended that he was granted parole for a day in March, when his father was set to have coronary angioplasty surgery. He stated that he was unable to meet his father because he was undergoing surgery at the time.


Over 50 people were killed and 200 were injured during a three-day riot in Delhi over the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) demonstrations.

Pathan was greeted warmly by muslim community and his neighbours.
 Pathan returned home on Monday after being allowed four hours of parole to visit his ailing father.

Pathan is seen being followed by a crowd as he goes about his neighbourhood in north-east Delhi, escorted by police, in a widely spread video. People can be seen cheering him on, and some even want to shake his hand. He was returned to jail a few hours later.
