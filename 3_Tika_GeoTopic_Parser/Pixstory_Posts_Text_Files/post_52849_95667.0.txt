If the pandemic has left any group with a sliver of happiness, it should be us. 
With fewer people around and all in masks, there was no need to smile or talk. The new way of life has been perfect for us, as the social distancing measures have given us the freedom to be what we are. 
The shy and socially anxious me feels blessed to have been given this anonymity. It is dreadful to even think that this mandate which I so religiously follow will cease to exist someday and I'll have to come out in the open, unconcealed, to be looked on by the world.
