Professor Mahan Mj is a young geometric topologist at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University, who combines an esoteric career as a research mathematician and teacher with that of a monk. He belongs to the monastic order, Ramakrishna Mission, founded in 1897 by Swami Vivekanda, a renowned Hindu philosopher. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Mathematics, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University.

Mahan Mitra graduated from St. Xavier's College, Kolkata. After clearing IIT entrance with rank 67, he entered the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where he initially chose to study electrical engineering but later switched to his true love- Mathematics. He graduated with a Masters in Integrated Mathematics from IIT Kanpur with near 9.8 CGPA.

Later, he joined the PhD program in mathematics at University of California, Berkeley. He received the Earle C. Anthony Fellowship, U.C. Berkeley in 1992–1993 and the prestigious Sloan Fellowship for 1996–1997.

After earning a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1997, he worked briefly at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Spiritually inclined, he joined the Ramakrishna Math as a renunciate upon being impressed by the life and work of the Vedantic philosopher Ramakrishna Paramahansa. He was ordained a monk and received his saffron robe in 2008.

Later, in 2011, he was awarded Shanthi Swarup Bhatnagar Award for Mathematics- India’s most coveted science honor.

He also won Infosys Prize 2015 for Mathematical Sciences for his work in hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory, low-dimensional topology and complex geometry. Currently, he is Professor of Mathematics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Mumbai.

He has been quoted as saying- "I am enjoying being a monk as much as I enjoy my mathematics."
