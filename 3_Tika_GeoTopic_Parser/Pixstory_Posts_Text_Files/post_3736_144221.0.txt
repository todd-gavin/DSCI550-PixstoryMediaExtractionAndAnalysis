Programmatic advertising has gained prominence in digital advertising with brands consistently looking out for ad-tech and mar-tech options in order to achieve an increased reach, leads and conversion rate. As a result, marketers are also on the lookout to explore newer ad formats in the new-age mediums like Connected TVs and DOOH to make a mark.
As per Bhairavi Rangarajan, Head-Digital Marketing and MarComm, Kohler India, “Being a marketer, one is always asked about Returns On Ad Spends (ROAS), so the first focus always goes to in-market or the bottom funnel and then to build the top-funnel. It is crucial to first define the purpose of your bottom-funnel and top funnel and then use measurement metrics.”
Delving into the nitty-gritty of the top and bottom funnel, Rangarajan said, “While the bottom funnel mainly involves conversions, leads and traffic as the measurement metrics, it is the top funnel which needs to be more attention and engagement-specific in terms of the scroll on pageview, click-through rate, interaction on the website, etc.”
Additionally, she also highlighted that when programmatic campaigns are run systematically, over a period of time, it helps in increasing direct traffic on the website and the brand search queries.
She further went on to add that when one looks at the top funnel, the reach and frequency become very crucial because one saturates the bottom funnel as much as possible, but that approach can be adopted for the top funnel owing to the limited budget.
“At such a point of time, making cohorts of people with certain interactions and time spent on the website can help increase the reach and frequency,” she said.
