Have you ever imagined ?? Having your favourite food inside bus ?? Sounds strange i know ! 🤔🍝🚌

The Food Bus india Is the same concept I'm talking about . As the Name - Food Bus ; simply means having food inside bus . 😍🚌

📍 Food Bus of India Vishwavidyalaya Metro Station Gate No 04 ,Delhi , New Delhi , Delhi 110007 .

I was welcomed with a delightful smile by the staff . He further guided me and my friends to table ! First of all the staff was very polite , friendly and soo good . The ambience was really cool and totally different . You might think it is congested but it was very spacious and comfortable . I personally loved the concept . The seating area was very unique , just like we sit in bus . The vibes were too good ! 😍😍

Diversity in the menu ! The service was quick . The Food was soo good and yummy 😍 We ordered Indian Masala Fries , cold Coffee and pizza🍕 . Let me tell you they have the best cold coffee ! The fries were crispy and the touch of masala was making them more tasty . Both the pizza's were too good . Cheese was perfect and flavours were amazing . The food here and everything is worth spending ! The costing was also in budget . ❤️

Didn't felt like I am in a fancy place where the food items are overrated . They are getting better with time and with more and more love and support it will become a very amazing place . 🚌❤️

I Enjoyed my visit here today ! And i will surely gonna visit again . 👍
