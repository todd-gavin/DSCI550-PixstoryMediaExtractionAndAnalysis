Project Cheetah- World's first intercontinental large wild carnivore translocation project.
This cat species, the Asiatic cheetah became extinct more than 70 years ago in India, primarily as a result of poaching. As part of Initiative Cheetah, eight African cheetahs were brought to India on 17 September from Namibia.
This reintroduction project aims to diversify and revitalise Indian wildlife populations and cheetah habitat. Additionally, Project Cheetah is anticipated to increase ecotourism in the area.
