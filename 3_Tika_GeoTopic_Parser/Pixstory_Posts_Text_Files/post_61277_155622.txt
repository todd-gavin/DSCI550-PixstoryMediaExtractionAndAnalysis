Model turned actress Manushi Chillar who made her debut this year with the film Samrat Prithviraj is finally done shooting for Tehran The film which also stars John Abraham went on floors a few months back and was shot in Delhi Mumbai and Glasgow The last and third schedule of Tehran was shot over a span of days beginning from the last week of September Since this consisted mostly night shots through the Delhi bayline Manushi had to spend sleepless nights for it not that she is complaining In fact talking about her experience she said Shooting for Tehran was an enriching experience I learned something new every single day In the run up to the film s wrap I was only shooting nights So I might have ended up with sleepless nights but I was satiated as an artiste because I got to understand the craft so differently primarily because the genre is so exciting This was my first long night shoot schedule of my career and I enjoyed it every single night
