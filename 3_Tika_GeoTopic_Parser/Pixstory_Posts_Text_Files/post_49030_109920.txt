Put on the blandest outfit you can find It is helpful to plan ahead and do whatever that will make you stand out from the crowd the least Have a change of clothes on hand for after Most importantly cover the tattoos They use them to identify you and often take anyone else with a similar tattoo too It is adviced against wearing sunglasses because apparently the cops are trained in using your sunglasses as a rare view mirror Put on a mask Turn off the location and GPS on your phones shut them down and if you can leave them at home Like Jessica said get a burner And do not take any selfies Don t do anything that d give away who you are Bring cash avoid using a card or an online payment system DO NOT ever give your RSVP They do not care if you re in a legal protest they will attack and assault you if they want Police brutality is legal especially when it comes to the marginalized communities at the protests Women especially please always have someone with you Don t get out of the crowd That s the safest place for you The system is anti women cops are anti women
