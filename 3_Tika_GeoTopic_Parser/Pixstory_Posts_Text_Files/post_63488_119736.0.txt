Manchester United has revealed the squad number for new signing Lisandro Martinez. 

Martinez officially completed his transfer to Manchester United on Wednesday, putting pen to paper on a five-year deal.

Now, the club has revealed his shirt number with the defender set to sport the number six (6) on the back of his shirt next season.

Before the move to Old Trafford, Martinez wore number 21 at Ajax throughout his time at the Eredivisie champions.

The 24-year-old is now the eighth player to wear the number six (6) shirt since squad numbers were introduced in 1993/94.

This follows that the former Ajax player will take over Paul Pogbaâ€™s no.6 jersey which the Frenchman wore during his stint at the club upon his return to Old Trafford from Juventus in 2016.
