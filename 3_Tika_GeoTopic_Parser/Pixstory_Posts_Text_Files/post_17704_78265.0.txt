The Ayushman Bharta Digital Mission
( ABDM) has been successfully linked with 695 Indian Railway hospitals and health centres across the nation. 

The move will benefit around 80 lakh Railway employees, Railway pensioners, and their family members by allowing them to access health care facilities at other hospitals that are integrated with ABDM, as well as allowing the general public to benefit from health care facilities available in Railway hospitals and health centres in a seamless digital manner. 

If Railway patients seek specialised treatment outside of the Railway Health System at one of the ABDM integrated hospitals trial across the country, the exchange of medical records will be facilitated digitally. Thus it helps beneficiaries or patients things easier, faster, hassle-free and more efficient. 

RailTel Corporation of India, a Miniratna Central Government PSU under the Ministry of Railways, has completed this huge work of integrating the Railway health system with ABDM. It was done in partnership with the National Health Authority(NHA), the main authority in charge of implementing the ABDM to create a National Digital Health Ecosystem. 

It would use digital highways to bridge the gap between different stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. The objective of ABDM is to provide the backbone that will support the country's integrated digital health infrastructure.
