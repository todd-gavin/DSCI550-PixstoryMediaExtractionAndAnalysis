Does dental hygiene have any association with Alzheimer’s? Yes as per a study that's published in Journal of the American. 
The study found that poor kind of oral health could impact the tooth and could lead to teeth loss and it also increased the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. 
The study authors wrote that, “From a clinical perspective, our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring and management of periodontal health in the context of dementia prevention.” 
“Given the impact of cognitive deterioration on periodontal health, oral health professionals are well-placed to track and intervene in early changes in periodontal health and oral self-care,” they added. 
Maria del Cielo Barragan-King, DDS, Ph.D., a dentist at The University of Kansas Health System, she says that the finding from the study is an important reminder to know how oral hygiene plays a huge role in the overall health. 
“Our mouth is full of bacteria (good and bad). We need these bacteria to live in equilibrium and when our dental hygiene is missing, the bad bacteria can overcome and install in our gums. There is evidence that bacteria can travel to the brain and participate with neurodegeneration that will ultimately decline our cognitive health,” she told Healthline. 
“Oral health is important for our overall quality of life. Taking care of our mouth is as important as taking care of our body. Our mouth is more exposed to the environment, and it is the entrance to our entire body,” she added.
