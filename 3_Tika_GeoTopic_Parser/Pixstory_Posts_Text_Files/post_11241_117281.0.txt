It may seem like the last few years of the COVID-19 pandemic have dragged on, but infection and vaccinations are still relatively new, and more is being learned about the virus and its full effects every day.


When vaccines to fight the virus were released in late 2020, they came with the promise of reducing severe infection. But for some people, the vaccine raised even more questions.


Some people were reporting breast pain after vaccination. In addition, changes in the shape and size of the lymph nodes in the armpit (axillary area) began appearing on mammogram screenings.


This article will explore how the COVID-19 vaccine can cause breast pain and changes to a mammogram, why you shouldn’t delay your mammogram after a COVID-19 vaccine, and when you need to worry about breast pain.

Swelling of the lymph nodes near the breasts isn’t common outside of being a breast cancer symptom, so the appearance of this as a side effect caused initial alarm.
