A WOMAN SHE IS By Angel Bansal Gifted by God was she a shining star To a society where equality to girls was still far Her birth was too an event hard For her father opposed the cry of a girl in his yard Being blamed for every loss her family faced The little one was hence unlucky named She was made to work at the age of But to be a rising star was written in her fate Education was miles apart For hard won food was also dependent on the cruel heart With fears abound laid her life But soon she decided to change her plight With books from scrap she learned to read and write And went on to become an idol for those who wished to shine bright Just like a small bud she blossomed beautifully Into a woman full of confidence courage and glory Married was she to a man unknown But the stranger became the reason of her happiness grown It was he who helped her reach high And become a doctor upon whom the world could rely Today she is a woman proudly known And for her children she is the backbone Her untold story has now been revealed To inspire women who are in need Image Source
