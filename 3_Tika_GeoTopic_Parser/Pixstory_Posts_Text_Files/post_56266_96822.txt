LeBron James and Anthony Davis campaigned for the Los Angeles Lakers to sign Russell Westbrook last summer hoping to create a dominant Big that would help them fight for the title The Lakers trio never got a chance to test its true potential due to injuries But even when James Davis and Westbrook played together L A didn t seem like a title contender The Purple and Gold went when they had all three of them on the floor James has a history of falling out with teammates when things go wrong former Cleveland Cavalier co star Kyrie Irving being perhaps the best example But Westbrook said the failures of the season didn t impact his friendship with James I mean it didn t affect it like off the floor and trying to figure out on the floor he said Obviously the ultimate part is that we both know that this season didn t go the way we wanted it to At least from my perspective I know Bron as well but it didn t affect any aspect for me I was trying my job is to try to make the game easier for him and I was trying to do that when I had abilities to better do so And then after off the floor we still stayed tight and then that won t change While Westbrook s tenure with the Lakers did not go as either he or James had hoped when the deal went down some things are bigger than basketball so it is good to see that their relationship off the court remains in tact
