Five ballistic missiles launched by China s military during exercises around Taiwan on Thursday were believed to have landed inside Japan s exclusive economic zone for the first time Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said The Defense Ministry said all five of the missiles that landed within Japan s EEZ which extends nautical miles kilometers from Japan s coast had fallen into waters southwest of Hateruma Island in Okinawa Prefecture This is a grave issue that concerns our country s national security and people s safety Kishi told a hastily organized news conference The defense chief said the Chinese military had launched nine ballistic missiles though China s Defense Ministry said earlier Thursday that it had fired off ballistic missiles into waters to the north east and south of Taiwan Taiwan s Defense Ministry also confirmed launches The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear A map of the missiles trajectories showed that at least one of the weapons was believed to have flown over Taipei before landing in Japan s EEZ a move that would be seen as a major escalation by Beijing China announced late Tuesday that it would hold some of its largest scale military exercises including ballistic missile launches in response to a visit to self ruled Taiwan by U S House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Pelosi who is leading a congressional delegation on a multicounty tour of Asia landed in Japan the last leg of the trip later Thursday China which considers democratic Taiwan an integral part of its territory that must be brought back into the fold by force if necessary claimed the visit by Pelosi represented yet another attempt at hollowing out the United States s long standing One China policy Under that policy Washington officially recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei The U S however is also bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide the self ruled island with the means to defend itself But while the latest Chinese missile drills are ostensibly focused on the U S and Taiwan they re also a clear warning to Japan experts say with some of its far flung southwestern islands sandwiched between the exercise zones according to coordinates released by the Chinese military Source
