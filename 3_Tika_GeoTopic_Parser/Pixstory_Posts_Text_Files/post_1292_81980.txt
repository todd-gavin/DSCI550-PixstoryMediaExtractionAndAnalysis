My mother has always had a lifelong dream She wants to play the dhol at my wedding While a wedding seems like a far off eventuality at the moment it would help for her to start practising if she wants to be any good for when the time does come This is why for her birthday earlier this week I bought her a dhol She loved it when she saw it for the first time Words cannot describe the happiness Words also can t describe the racket it creates
