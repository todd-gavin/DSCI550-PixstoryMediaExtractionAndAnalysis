Love triangles have always been something to be explored in Indian films and various directors like Mahesh Bhatt Yahs Chopra Satyajit Ray have explored relationships of marriage engagement friendship age gap everything Though they all had their own unique style of presenting which which I think properly portrayed what Indian cinema actually looks like As per various critics Shakun Batra was inspired by Woody Allen for this project he did his best no doubt but lost his unique style which was portrayed properly in his previous Kapoor and Sons Gehraiyaan the literal translational of depth was I not properly conveyed for me the first mins very enough to understand that the movie will be getting depressing over all further the storyline showed the brutal dark realities of a relationship and as the situation starting with a lie turned into a spiral of lies and just making the situations worse The characters individual stories were also tried to be explored but got very confusing for me It should have been just based properly on Deepika s character which she was performing phenomenally but then also went too deep towards Siddhant s character and his current troubles not past even when it was discussed in the film for just mins I felt really depressed and dark because it does happen with us quite often I honestly took a breather rather than continuously watching because I didn t wanted to remind of my own dark situations which I have gone through The parts of Ananya and Dhairya s friendship were not in place for me I thought it was indicating that since Deepika and Siddhant were together now maybe these two will also get together The premise for was out place Films such as Ijazaat also portrayed these things and was based on a book Gulzar did a wonderful job with that picture because I felt more connected with not just Rekha s character but everybody After all that said Gehraiyaan was a one time watch for me the background score and soundtrack is a memorable one
