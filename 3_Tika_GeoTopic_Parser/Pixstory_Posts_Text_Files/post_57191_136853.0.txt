People choose a diet for their reasons and interests, but surprisingly pescatarians answer many concerns by choosing to be one of them.
Adding fish or seafood to your vegetarian diet can do wonders for your health.
Being a vegetarian, most people think that avoiding all animal products could lead to low nutrient intake.
Like it becomes harder to get  "vitamins B12, zinc, calcium and protein can be somewhat harder to get on a vegan diet."
Fish is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are necessary for your body.
Moreover, it's hard to fulfil the high protein demands through a vegetarian diet, so eating seafood is beneficial because of not just proteins; it has a cornucopia of nutrients. For example, oysters are incredibly high in vitamin B12, zinc and selenium. "Just one oyster delivers 133% of the RDI for vitamin B12 and 55% of the RDI for zinc and selenium. Mussels are also super rich in vitamin B12, selenium, manganese, and other B vitamins. White fish varieties such as cod and flounder don’t deliver many omega-3 fats but are a source of extremely lean protein."
