Quantum technology harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to find explanations for problems which are too complex for normal computers It is a rapidly growing technology and entails a broad range of new materials devices and information technology protocols They become an ally to cyber security by securing the communication through a method that is expected to be quantum safe in the advent of quantum computing systems that could break current cryptography systems using methods such as Shor s algorithm These methods include quantum key distribution QKD a method of transmitting information utilizing entangled light in a way that makes any interception of the transmission apparent to the user Another method is the quantum random number generator which is capable of producing truly random numbers unlike non quantum algorithms that merely mimic randomness Some of the examples of emerging quantum technologies include quantum computing simulation measurement sensors cryptography and imaging etc Under the constant threat of Cyber Attacks the US government has been trying to find new ways to boost cybersecurity to defend against the next generation of these supercomputers The US has announced a new policy framework to maintain its competitive advantage in quantum information sciences QIS and mitigate the risks of quantum computers to the nation s cyber economic and national security by instigating the process of migrating vulnerable computer systems to quantum resistant cryptography It also laid out a new structure for the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee placing it directly under the White House to advise the president on the emerging technology Quantum computers can work millions of times quicker than today s advanced supercomputers The difference is that a classic computer performs one calculation at a time while a quantum one can do many calculations at the same time This is why several nations like the US are rushing to develop quantum technology It could also lead to advancements in materials science artificial intelligence and chemistry Source Wion and WH GOV
