Hello So today we had our st exam for semester and I was not prepared at all I have gone through some youtube videos about the subject that s all There were hardly topics to cover so I had decided to study days before the exam date But failed I procrastinated from the start and I was like abhi toh din baaki hai days to exam that s enough for revision days to exam ok I will do it tomorrow days to exam ab kya hi padhlenge days to exam thoda toh padh lete hain So I procrastinated till last But the strange thing is I was confident without being prepared for the exam I was always told that Confidence comes with Preparation And what s happening to me is just the opposite Because I believe that Confidence is not something that you feel before doing something it s after you ve done that thing Don t panic if the paper didn t go well because a piece of paper cannot decide your life But there is a catch in this also A peace of paper will decide your life only if you let it to do so So it always depends on you how you perceive things Thanks Stay khush
