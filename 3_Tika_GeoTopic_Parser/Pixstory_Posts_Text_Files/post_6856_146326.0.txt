Bisexual policing blaring sirens were silenced last night by Cardi B: “I *te b****** **t before you was born…..Sorry I don’t have razr phone pics to prove it to you 😅😅” the Grammy-winning rapper posted, in response to a tweet that had their photo beside Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, and Harry Styles, with the caption: “Celebrities that came out as bisexual but never dated someone of the same gender.”We are all sick of the broken record of bisexual policing: Who’s got the time to tally the gender of a celebrity’s partner? It’s borderline stalkerish to say the least.
