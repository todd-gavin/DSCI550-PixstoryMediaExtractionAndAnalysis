A folded diamond doesn t sound entirely plausible But that s exactly what we ve found inside a rare group of meteorites known as ureilites which likely came from the mantle of a dwarf planet or very large asteroid that was destroyed billion years ago in a giant collision Within these space rocks we found layered diamonds with distinctive fold patterns Our discovery is published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Now of course everyone knows diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material so the obvious question was how on Earth or in space could a folded diamond possibly form This was exactly the sort of curiosity piquing observation that sends scientists diving down rabbit holes for months on end A new analysis technique Carbon one of the most abundant elements in the universe can form all kinds of structures Among the more familiar ones are graphite and of course diamond But there s also an unusual hexagonal form of diamond known as lonsdaleite which has been suggested to be even harder than standard cubic diamonds Our team includes a bunch of people who drive development of advanced analysis techniques At CSIRO Nick Wilson Colin MacRae and Aaron Torpy developed a new approach in electron microscopy to map the distribution of diamond graphite and lonsdaleite in the meteorites When our mapping suggested the folded diamond might actually be lonsdaleite we Dougal McCulloch Alan Salek and Matthew Field at RMIT performed a more detailed investigation via a method called high resolution transmission electron microscopy TEM The results were exciting we had found some of the largest lonsdaleite crystallites microscopic crystals ever discovered about micrometre across So those intriguing fold shapes were composed of polycrystalline lonsdaleite meaning they were made from numerous tiny crystals Read more
