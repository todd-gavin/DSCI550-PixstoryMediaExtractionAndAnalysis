It s always okay to be a third person and ask the grieving person to move on or judge them for not moving on in their life Imagine losing somebody who has been a part of your life for days or years makes it even harder Even then you can only guess the pain a person is going through In addition to that they might experience post traumatic stress which they fight every day So throwing your sympathy patterns or dialogues won t help them Grieving is a very slow process they have to believe first that they lost somebody permanently which happens only after years for some people They live under constant fear of losing somebody else they love or even have the fear of death Imagine people who deal with consecutive deaths its even harder for them Grieving could also happen when you break up with somebody or lose a job depends on the priorities in your life What everyone needs at that time is love and support Ensure that there are people who love them and who want them to live Give them time they might break down at a song or an object or during a conversation Let them grieve for years while moving on People have different ways Let them find out their own ways
