Today, we celebrate India's 75th independence day from British colonial rule. While the whole nation celebrates this auspicious day, let's take a look at some of the rare finds of our brave freedom fighters, whose struggles led our beloved motherland to independence from centuries of oppression.

1. Rani Lakshmi Bai

The Queen of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. She played a huge role in the revolt of India in 1857. She is still remembered as the bravest queen who fought alone with the Britishers, without fearing anyone. Rani Lakshmi Bai was the leader of the forces who fought against the British. She is one of the greatest freedom fighters in India. The revolt went on for two weeks and Rani Lakshmi Bai led the troop of men and women to fight against the British army.

2. Khudiram Bose

The young Bose actively participated in the protests against the British after the partition of Bengal in 1905. He was merely 15 years old when he joined Anushilan Samiti, an early 20th-century organization that propounded revolutionary activities in Bengal. Bose learnt how to make bombs and plant them in front of police stations within a year. 

3. Subash Chandra Bose

Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian Nationalist, great leader, thinker, and fighter, who defied British authority. His political activities and ideologies are marred by controversies but the legacy he left behind motivates each Indian to date.
