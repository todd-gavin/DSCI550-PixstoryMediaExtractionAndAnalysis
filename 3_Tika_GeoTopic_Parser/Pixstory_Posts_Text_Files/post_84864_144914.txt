Everton endured a disastrous campaign last season and escaped relegation by the skin of their teeth Eyebrows were raised when former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez was appointed and it turned out to be an unsuccessful move from the hierarchy at Everton Frank Lampard was brought in and there was a sense that the club had a long term vision in mind with Lampard being the manager The main challenge for Lampard was to ensure that they avoid relegation and while this was achieved there were some bumpy periods along the way Nonetheless Everton managed to stay up and we will analyse their squad for this season Strengths The club had to strengthen in the summer transfer window as the squad appeared to be extremely thin last season Connor Coady James Tarkowsi and Neil Maupay have been brought in along with a couple of other players and this gives Lampard something to work with While there are some talented youngsters at the club it is essential to have experienced Premier League proven individuals to ensure the team remains competitive This also makes the transition for the younger players to integrate into the team easier and this obviously makes Lampard s job easier Everton s best performance so far this season came in the Merseyside draw against Liverpool where they looked like a proper Premier League side There was a massive contrast to the team of last season and it also seems the fans are prepared to back this team as the players showed aggression grit and fight in that performance Weaknesses One clear weakness that is able to identify from this squad is that they are missing a consistent goal scorer Anthony Gordon has been terrific since he broke into the first team and has been a breath of fresh air but it appears to be that his best position is a wide role off the right where he is able to run at defenders and cut in on his preferred right foot to create attacking opportunities Neil Maupay has been signed from Brighton and Everton fans will hope he will provide goals on a consistent basis but he is not a prolific goal scorer
