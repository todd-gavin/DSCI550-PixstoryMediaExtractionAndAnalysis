Consecutive losses to Mumbai City FC and FC Goa have ensured that Chennaiyin FC are dangling by the thread in this season s Indian Super League The Marina Machans have had three losses in their last four games courtesy of this the Blues have points from games After a great start everything fell flat for Chennaiyin FC once coach Bozidar Bandovic started playing a back instead of the back Chennaiyin FC probably never settled after that and as a result they are almost out of the playoff s race Why isn t the coach changing the system Fans and pundits have both asked the same question Why isnt Bozidar Bandovic changing the system But it looks that their questions have fallen on deaf ears The coach has complete belief in his system which is great But when the results are not going your way shouldn t there be changes Chennaiyin FC s attack has been so blunt that the club have failed to register a single shot on target in their last two games CFCs game against FC Goa was supposedly a must win game Yet Chennaiyin did manage to even trouble the Goan goalkeeper Can Chennaiyin FC still make it to the playoffs Technically yes Practically No The club can still get a possible points from their remaining games this would take CFC to points which would be near the playoffs cutoff But with their current form it does not look like Chennaiyin can even win one game Anyways it has to be seen if Mr Bandovic can do the unthinkable If there is one club who can do this it has to be Chennaiyin they have done it twice before but surely they won t get a third time lucky or would they
