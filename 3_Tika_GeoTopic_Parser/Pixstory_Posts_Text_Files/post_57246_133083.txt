The idea in the parent post was to address the inappropriate and immature behaviour of fans who deem everything acceptable if it is to preserve and protect their object of interest It is not about whether having a fan identity is wrong or something instead it does play an important role in triggering the unacceptable behaviour of these people When a fan starts seeing their fan object as a part of their self concept they see everything as a threat to their identity There is a need for everyone to understand that we can like or dislike anything but everything we are investing our time and interest into has its own space which couldn t be considered yours The best example here would be of fans who adore some celebrity couples but when they get separated they feel it as a personal loss Although there s nothing wrong with feeling bad about it there should be rational thinking associated with everything Just because you have emotionally invested your interest in them doesn t mean they ll do all of it according to your wishes and personal interests We can t enter these people s space and then keep calling it our personal identity it would be akin to interfering in someone s personal life which is definitely not part of your life
