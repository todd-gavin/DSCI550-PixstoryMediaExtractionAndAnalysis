Quite amazing how this overweight man joined Real Madrid at the age of 31 and went on becoming one of the all time greats and protagonist of many important feats of the Club's golden era. 
His legacy lives on forever at Real Madrid. FIFA paid him a great tribute by naming their award for the best goal of the year after him (Puskas Award). Football is forever indebted to him ❤. 

Happy 95th Ferenk Puskás 🎂
