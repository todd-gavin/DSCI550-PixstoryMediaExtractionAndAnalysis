 Meet Ravish Make him your friend that s how my then boss Pranab Dhal Samanta introduced Ravish Tiwari to me I was a year old in Indian Express then and it was Ravish s first day in office All it took was a cup of tea and a few minutes of chatter for us to become friends Indian Express national bureau was making a generational transition then Most of us in the team were very young It was absolutely fun to be at the Express though we all felt like we were inside a pressure cooker all the time Ravish got hired by then Indian Express editor Shekhar Gupta after they had a discussion during an accidental stroll on a Mumbai beach Ravish was an IITan and a Rhodes scholar from Oxford In the beginning he used to cover rural development and Samajwadi Party As our then colleague from Financial Express Jigeesh AM used to say only Ravish could understand what Mulayam Singh Yadav actually means when he utters those muffled words Talking to Ravish was always an education whether it s over aloo paratha at an ITO pavement stall or over tea from Guptaji s shop in front of INS building He was erudite and a quintessential analyst of everything around which often made our then editor Rajkamal Jha ask in deadline pressure Boss well but what s the story Well when most of us had one story Ravish had many stories to tell Always But inflexibility of fate has taken him away so soon Then our deaths are not obliged to happen in the same order as our births Rest in Peace my friend
