The most important argument against the existence of the afterlife is that there is no evidence to support it.
There are a variety of reasons for not believing in afterlife. First, there's the fact that we cannot experience death itself. If death really did exist like religion mentions it, then we would be able to observe it firsthand. But as it stands, we only have second-hand knowledge of what happens after we die. 
Second, many people believe that life on earth is the only thing that matters in the grand scheme of things. If there was an afterlife, then why bother working hard in this life? It makes no sense to them – and to reason otherwise would go against everything they know about human nature. 
And finally, there's the question of why God would want us to continue living after we die if He doesn't intend for us to get anywhere or achieve anything. After all, if Death is truly an end to everything – as many believers claim – then why would God put us through all this misery just so He can take us away? There seems to be too much inconsistency and chaos here for anyone to believe in an afterlife without good reason. Like seriously, why would God want us to suffer even after death?
