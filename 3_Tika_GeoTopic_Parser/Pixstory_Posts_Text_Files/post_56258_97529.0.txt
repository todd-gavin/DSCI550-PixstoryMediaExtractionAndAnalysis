In many ways Los Angeles is a city as hard to define as it is to navigate without a car. A sprawling urban mass covering 500 sq miles (1295 sq km), it was famously described by Dorothy Parker as ‘72 suburbs in search of a city’. Its origins stretch back to the 18th Century, and yet it can still seem like a young city, having expanded alongside the film industry in the early 1900s.

Although literally the ‘City of the Angels’, its status as the entertainment capital of the world means that it is also thought of as ‘the city of broken dreams’, the lure of success and stardom being inextricably linked with the inevitability of disappointment and defeat. The history of cinema is littered with such tales, from Billy Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard to the Coen brothers’ Barton Fink or David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive.

The city’s rapid expansion in the early 20th Century went hand in hand with corruption of city officials and police which, along with real-life headline crimes, such the notorious Black Dahlia case, inspired a generation of hard-boiled fiction writers. Among them were Raymond Chandler and Dorothy B Hughes, whose explorations of LA’s dark underbelly would be instrumental in the development of film noir in the 1940s and ’50s.

In choosing works that define LA, those that involve Hollywood and detectives therefore come naturally to mind. Nathanael West’s novel The Day of the Locust is a literary forerunner of Wilder and Lynch that mercilessly reflects the anger, frustration and violence simmering just beneath Hollywood’s shiny façade. The movie Chinatown viscerally updates the noir genre for the 1970s, while also painstakingly recreating the LA of the 1930s using surviving locations. In Judith Baca’s monumental mural sequence, The Great Wall of Los Angeles, the histories of the ethnic minorities – who appear in minor roles in both the novel and the film – are fully visualised in an epic artwork that stretches over half a mile.
