People are understandably worn out, tired of thinking about COVID-19 and wanting to get back to a true normal.

This so-called “pandemic fatigue” is real. But it’s also contributing to lapses in COVID-19 precautions and to more people getting infected with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.

It is become starkly clear that this pandemic is not behind us yet. Since late December 2021, COVID-19 infections have been surging, exceeding the rates seen at any other point in the pandemic. The people who are becoming most sick – needing hospitalization or even dying from infection – are the unvaccinated.

But new data suggests that older adults who have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccine but who have not yet received a booster shot are also getting sick and having poor outcomes. The omicron variant, which spreads very easily, is putting a spotlight on how critical it is for these seniors to get a booster shot – especially older adults living in close quarters with others.

As a geriatrician at the University of Virginia, I see patients who are over 65 years old. Many of them have experienced someone close to them becoming ill or even dying from COVID-19 infection in the past two years.

Having witnessed this directly, most of my patients continue to practice safety measures to minimize risk of infection, like wearing masks, limiting their exposure to large crowds and practicing social distancing. They want to be able to safely visit with their families and friends. A booster shot has now become an important part of protecting them against infection and poor outcomes.
