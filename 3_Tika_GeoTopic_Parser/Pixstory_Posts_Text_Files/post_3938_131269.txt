In the run of getting many things done I saw a stranger who was standing with a side bag was desperately waiting for a response The tensed face crossed eyes with me The smiles we passed to each other was like the usual one which I always do I couldn t capture the moment through my phone But that smile I got in return was heartwarming That smile stands up in my memory as the most purest and the most sweetest one I felt a connection of a long lost grandpa that I was not fortunate to meet but I met him today through that smile of his own
