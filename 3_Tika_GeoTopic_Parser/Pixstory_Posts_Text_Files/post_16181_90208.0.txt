The first song of Heropanti 2, DaFa Kar, was launched today, 26th March, amidst much fanfare in the presence of the film's lead stars,  Tiger Shroff and Tara Sutaria, along with Director Ahmed Khan, producer Warda Khan Nadiadwala, music composer A.R. Rahman and the song's lyricist. 

When tiger was asked his thoughts taking Salman's Eid date, he replied, “There's only one Tiger and that's Salman Khan. I'm a cat in front of him. You can say, I'm Simba (from The Lion King) in front of him. Arriving on Eid is obviously a big thing, but I can't take the credit for that, it's all Sajid Nadiadwala and the producers. I just hope that it receives the same love and success on Eid.”
 
Opening up on if he feels any pressure to reinvent himself or up the scale and feel of action with each new film, Tiger added, “I don't take any pressure or stress. I just listen Ahmed Khan sir, who's like family to me, like an elder brother, and I just follow what he tells me to. I can't take the credit for it, I work with a fantastic team and all the credit goes to them.”
