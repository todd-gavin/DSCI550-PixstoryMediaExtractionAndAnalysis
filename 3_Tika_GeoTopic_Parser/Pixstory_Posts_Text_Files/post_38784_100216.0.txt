He is dangerous from free-kicks and dead ball situations, as he made 376 dead ball passes and 70 passes from freekick taking his percentile to 95 and 98 percentile, having 13.54 and 2.57 per 90. While Shaw and Telles have made 221 and 14, and 195 and 21 passes from dead ball and free-kicks respectively. They both rank 87, 58 percentile, and 84 and 87 percentile in dead-ball passes and passes from free-kick. Per match both the footballers rank 12.50 and 1.02 for Luke Shaw, and 12.07 and 1.57 per 90 for Telles.

Borna is a good progressor of the ball. The 24 year old is not the tallest player in his team(5 ft 9 inches), but he is very good in carrying the ball from deep unscathed. He has made a total of 166 progressive passes, ranking 94 percentile, and he has made 6.08 progressive passes per match. Coming to his carries, he carries the ball progressively. He has made a total of 206 progressive carries, covering 4552 meters, and being the highest in carrying the ball. On the other hand Luke Shaw has 78 times made progressive passes and has carried the ball progressively 96 times covering distance of 

2522 meters. 


Alex has made 54 progressive passes, and he carried with the ball progressively 76 times, covering a distance of only 1958 meters. We can see that Sosa ranks ahead in both of them. If we compare the percentile rank of all three players, we can see that Borna ranks 94 and 93 percentile in passes and carries, while Shaw and Telles ranks 84 and 73,and 41 and 49 percentile respectively.

Borna Sosa’s passing heatmaps, and his progressive passes which he made for other players to receive. No wonder he is compared to David Beckham. ‘Becks’ was known for his killer passes, shots and passes from dead balls and free kicks and whipping dangerous crosses inside the penalty box.

Sosa is often seen bombarding up and down the left flank, consistently providing his attacking presence, plus his deadly vision to find his man makes him even more lethal and the comparisons with Beckham goes strong
