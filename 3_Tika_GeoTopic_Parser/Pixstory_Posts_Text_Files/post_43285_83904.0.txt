A few weeks ago I was living in a beautiful house surrounded by greenery. It was situated in a small town with little night life and very few places to visit. I started cribbing after a while but when I came to Delhi and got hit by the smell of pollution, fed up by the traffic and annoyed by lack of greenery I couldn't help but miss my small town house. The night life didn't seem so glamorous anymore and I couldn't help but wonder if this is how my life will be - chasing a dream that never was.
