Opportunities
As mentioned earlier, Bournemouth’s main strength is their attacking impotence, and they must play to this strength in order to find success in the league this season. Home form is key to any side which comes up from the Championship and we saw in the first league game the positive effect the home atmosphere had on the side as they defeated Aston Villa. They must also continue this good patch of form for as long as possible as 12th position after 7 league games is reasonably good and any new side in the Premier League would be happy with that.
Threats
The biggest threat to Bournemouth this season will no doubt be how they cope with the immense attacking quality of the Premier League. The heavy defeat to Liverpool is a clear example to them the fragility their defence possesses and they must look to improve this department. One option is to invest in this position in the January transfer window but until then, the current set of defenders must ensure that they attempt to improve and become a more solid back-line. This is the major area of concern for Bournemouth fans at the moment.
