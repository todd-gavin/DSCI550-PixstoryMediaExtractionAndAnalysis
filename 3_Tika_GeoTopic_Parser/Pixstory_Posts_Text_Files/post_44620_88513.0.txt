1. More than twice the size of the Indian sub-continent, in fact, taking China’s land area to be 95,96,961 sq km, India’s to be 32,74,600 sq km, Bangladesh with 1,43,398 sq km, Nepal with 1,40,797 sq km, and Bhutan with 47,000 sq km, for a total of 44,09,739 sq km, not including the island of Sri Lanka of 65,610 sq km. Including Sri Lanka the Indian sub-continent has an area of 44,75,349 sq 
km, still less than half the size of the People’s Republic of China. India alone is about one-third the size of China.

Cantonese: Ton Sam Jong.

3. The popular Chinese classic ‘Visit to the West’ by Wu Cheng-en, published 
anonymously in the CE 1590’s during the Ming Dynasty. It is a fictionalized account of the overland travel to India and back by the Buddhist monk Hiuen Tsang (602-664 CE) in the 7th Century during the Tang Dynasty. His pilgrimage and study tour to copy or collect Buddhist sutras lasted 17 years. He visited 
during the reign in northern India of the Emperor Harshavardhana, with whom 
he also stayed. His name is variously Romanised as Yuan Chwang, Xuanzang, Xuan Zang (Pinyin), Hsuan-tsang (Wade-Giles), and also Tangsanzang, or Tang Seng, ie, ‘Tang monk’, or Tong Sam Jong (Cantonese).
