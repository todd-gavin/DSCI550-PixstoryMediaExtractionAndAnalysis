Inter have signed Marcelo Brozovic to a contract deal that will keep him at the club until June 2026.

The Croatia international's contract was set to expire at the end of the current season, prompting interest from Barcelona, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.

The midfielder, though, has put a stop to the rumours by agreeing to new terms, with the reigning Serie A champions announcing the new four-year contract on their website on Wednesday.

Brozovic first joined Inter in January 2015 on a one-and-a-half-year loan from Dinamo Zagreb, with a conditional option to buy from the Serie A club.

Inter's success has been attributed to the 29-year-old, who played a major role under Antonio Conte as the Nerazzurri won the Scudetto after a 10-year wait last season.

Brozovic was a key player on both ends of the pitch during the title-winning season. In the season, he made a league-high 324 passes into the final third, resulting in six assists.

Only teammate midfielder Nicolo Barella had more tackles than him (58).
Only Barella (47) and Romelu Lukaku (52) generated more opportunities than Brozovic (45), who appeared in three less games than the pair (36).

Simone Inzaghi, Conte's successor, has likewise put his faith in Brozovic this season. In all competitions, he has started 37 games, a total only Samir Handanovic (40) can match among Inter players.

In Serie A, he leads the Nerazzurri in a number of categories, including tackles (55), passes (1,924), and passes into the final third (251).
When Inter returns to league action on April 3 against Juventus, Brozovic will be hoping for a win after back-to-back draws.
