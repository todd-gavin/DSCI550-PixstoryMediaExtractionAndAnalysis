Boston Celtics Milwaukee Bucks Very heavy victory for Milwaukee on Boston&#39;s field which leads thus on and with the game to be played at home A very tight game that was decisive only in the last quarter when the Bucks recovered from a points deficit led by Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday The Greek scored points and collected rebounds while his partner, in addition to scoring points with rebounds and assists, was the protagonist of the decisive defensive action in the last seconds with a block and steal on Marcus Smart. Jayson Tatum&#39;s points are not enough for Boston, author of a bad three-point shot from the field points Memphis Grizzlies Golden State Warriors Albeit without the injured Ja Morant Memphis overwhelms Golden State with a perfect game and extends the series in which it is now down There has practically never been a game with the hosts above the points at halftime In a match with well men in double figures are three of the best scorers Jaren Jackson Desmond Bane and Tyus Jones Warriors too ugly to be true and called for a prompt redemption in the match they will play at home
