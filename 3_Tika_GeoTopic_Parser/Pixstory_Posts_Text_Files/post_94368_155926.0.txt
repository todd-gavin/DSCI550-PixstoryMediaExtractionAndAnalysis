Jimmy Sinclair did more than anyone to put South African cricket on the map. 
Tall and powerfully built, he liked nothing more than to hit the ball hard or bowl as fast as he could. In 1898-99 he scored 86 (as an opener) at Johannesburg and followed with a brilliant 106 at Cape Town (South Africa's first Test hundred) against the all-conquering England side led by Lord Hawke. At Cape Town he also took 6 for 26 and 3 for 63. In 1901 he toured England and cemented his reputation as a big hitter but failed to put together many innings of substance - the same could be said of his visits in 1904 and 1907. But as a bowler he excelled on the green wickets, with his high action to the fore, and he took 107 wickets in 1901 and 100 in 1904. He was fortunate to make the 1901 tour - he was captured by the Boers (the Boer war was taking place) and had to escape from a POW camp and make his way to safety behind the British lines. At home his form remained breathtaking. In 1902-03 he scored back-to-back centuries against Australia at Johannesburg and Cape Town - his second hundred taking 80 minutes - and in 1905 grabbed 21 wickets against England. By 1907 South Africa were dominated by their quartet of googly bowlers, and he was largely marginalised, although his slogging continued to thrill. Against England in 1909-10 and Australia the following winter he struggled to impose himself with either bat or ball, and he died in 1913, aged 36. Sinclair not only excelled at cricket; he played rugby for South Africa and England, and was also a skilled hockey and football player.
