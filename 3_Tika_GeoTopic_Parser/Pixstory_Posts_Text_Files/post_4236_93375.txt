We have been appreciated and applauded when we start walking speaking words and writing letters Some day or other these appreciations stopped and I started looking for validations Validations seem so important that I didn t realise my worth and nothing was enough for me I realised this urge to be the best in everything where does it come from My priorities or am I doing it for others One day it struck me Yes you need appreciation but it s not your fodder It s you self love and pride that you need to be yourself Once you start loving everything you are you do know how to face anything Be the best in things that you really want Not because somebody demands it Take a rest work hard and love every single thing about yourself Know your worth No one is perfect but unique Write self appreciation notes to yourself and always look back when you feel your confidence is low Love yourself so abundantly that you don t need any validation and appreciation just become a bonus Realise everyone doesn t have the same situation One word could do miracles to a person Try to appreciate something you feel good about even if it s a behaviour You could make somebody s day Even yours Swipe to see the text I sent myself to look back and rise and shine on a bad day
