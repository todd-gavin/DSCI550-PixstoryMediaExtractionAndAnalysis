The director picks up what he had left two years ago and finally the Season of the most awaited series is here The series ensures equal footage to each of its lead casts The plot revolves around how Dimple aka Prajakta Kohli is debased by the fact that her oh so extraordinary app has been stolen and even sold She is also seen contemplating her love life switching between Rishi and the NRI Guy Harsh Overall Mismatched Season lacks humour and the series could have done with more laughs and lesser moaning n whining
