WOMEN SAFETY IN INDIA Hey everyone Hope you all are doing well Today I am gonna talk about a very crucial topic Women in India Today are becoming the vulnerable as for as there safety and security is concerned When we turned the pages of newspaper we come across many headlines reporting cases of molestation harrasment trafficking ill treatment of women in houses Violence against women in many remote areas Women feels unsafe and unsecure and feel that this freedom is jeopardised It is unbearable to imagine the plight of women who suffers from such crimes It is the jold on the confidence of women and on our judiciary system We generally play the blame game for any such incident and hence we have not succeeded to reach the root cause of this issue The effective implications of women rights is the first step in this direction There should be stringent laws and the preparators of such crimes should be severely punished We also need to create social awareness about this issue and exclude those who commit such crimes but not the victims Better surveillance by laws enforcing authorities were also required Self defence techniques to girls should be taught in schools colleges offices and residential colonies Only when these measures taken India can become a carefree and enjoyable place for women
