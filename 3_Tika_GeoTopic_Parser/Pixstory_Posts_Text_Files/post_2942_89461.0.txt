Russia has been a major supplier of oil, gas and coal for the West. Given its invasion of Ukraine and western powers’ criticism of it, the West would have to explore other sources, and even Russia itself may resort to cutting off its supplies in retaliation of western sanctions. Either way, energy security will be a top priority for many countries, forcing them to explore any and all options. It can turn out to be a trigger for cutting dependence on traditional, hydrocarbon energy and taking up renewable energy. But such a switch cannot happen at short notice. More likely, the Russian question would impact climate action.

For example, Germany, a leading economy heavily dependent on Russia’s energy supplies, plans to reduce its dependence on Moscow and is looking at the Gulf for oil: https://www.dw.com/en/qatar-to-help-germany-cut-reliance-on-russian-gas-says-minister/a-61191584 It is also building terminals to receive imports of liquefied natural gas.

The US, on the other hand, wants to step in and help other by producing more oil and gas: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/07/oil-industry-production-hikes-russia-00014778

This scramble for oil and gas comes at a time when a new report says the rich nations must end fossil fuel production by 2034 if the world is serious about meeting the Paris Accord targets. If the advanced economies do so, the developing world will have a “fair chance” to calibrate their poverty reduction plans while sticking to climate action: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/rich-countries-must-end-oil-gas-production-by-2034-report-says/

This paradox was flagged by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres this week, when he spoke of the threat of “mutually assured destruction” through climate change. “Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.”

Guterres is right in saying that instead of suddenly applying brakes on the decarbonization of the global economy, this crisis should be taken as an opportunity to take up renewable energy on, well, war footing: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-climate-business-antonio-guterres-environment-83cf02697f84ad7b19d18cf59f9aa7c8
