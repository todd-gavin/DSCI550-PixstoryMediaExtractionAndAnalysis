We all know folks who master their emotions. In a tense circumstance, they remain calm and make sensitive decisions.

We know persons who can read others' emotions. They know how to make people feel better and motivate them to action.

People like this have high EQ (or EI). They have good relationships and handle challenging situations well. They're also prone to be resilient.
Emotional Intelligence Traits
Emotional intelligence has been defined by psychologist Daniel Goleman. These:

Self-awareness.
Learn mindfulness to develop self-awareness. Focus on the current moment, including your feelings. Also, keep a notebook where you can record and examine your daily emotional experiences.
Self-regulation.
If you frequently get angry, think about what makes you angry. Allow yourself time to stop before responding to emails or inquiries so you don't say something you'll later regret. (Read more about rage control in this article.)
Motivation.
Emotions profoundly influence self-motivation. Emotions can distract you from tasks.

Find and celebrate tiny successes â€” basic tasks that, when performed, offer you a sense of accomplishment.

Set long-term goals. When you set goals, you focus on what matters most to you. This is especially motivating when personal and professional aspirations are linked.
Empathy.
Begin by considering other people's perspectives. Imagine how they may be feeling and utilise active listening skills to completely comprehend their emotions.
Social IQ.
Don't avoid unfavourable situations. Learn effective dispute resolution techniques.

If you're shy in social situations, focus on your confidence. Begin cautiously, then seek for opportunities to practise with larger groups. You could offer to represent your team at conferences.
