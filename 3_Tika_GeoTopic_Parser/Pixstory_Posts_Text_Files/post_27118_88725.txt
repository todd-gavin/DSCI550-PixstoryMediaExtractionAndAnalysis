Probably the most controversial review I am doing on this page but here it goes The Irishman has been referred to as One of those movies with utmost movie culture as a movie buff and a Scorsese fan I did not find the culture anywhere The Irishman has the same problem I have with many other films pacing and weakness in its plot structure To be honest the hype about the movie was valid to think of Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Al Pacino coming together on screen the three living legends and to put cherry on top be directed by Martin Scorsese makes things so much better But Irishman fails and fails bad according to me it is way too long and with no real structure and uneventful halves that just don t get you to love what is in front of your eyes It is offensive to movie buffs I know But it is the truth in which I believe I believe that if you know Scorsese s filmography you will find this movie to be weak among its peers Scorsese is at his prime when seen in works like The Departed Silence and several more but not in The Irishman With all due respect to the legend involved in this film it is just not worth it It is way too long with a formula that has been way overused with a narrative that just does not scream Prime Scorsese
