Shehnai maestro Bharat Ratna Ustad Bismillah Khan’s house at Harha Sarai in Varanasi is a picture of abject poverty as his family members fight for survival every day since his death in August 2006.

The family lives in penury in a dilapidated house that would collapse any day. A redundant desert cooler that could not be repaired due to financial constraints.

The economic condition further worsened during the Covid pandemic.

There was a time when Khan sahib would get a 6-kg thali (a big plate) of Malai and Rabri from nearby roadside shops for his large family, consisting of five sons, four daughters and several grandsons and granddaughters.

And after his death, the family members don't have enough money to support themselves. They don’t even have money to fix the seepage in their drawing room. 

Two long wooden ballies are seen giving support to avoid the collapse of the dilapidated slab. A water cooler is kept in the drawing room where Khan sahib used to meet the visitors. It is defunct now and could not be repaired due to financial constraints.

To be continued.......
