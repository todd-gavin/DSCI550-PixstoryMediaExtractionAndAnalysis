Stress has been a part of our lives since always, but the past two years of the Pandemic have given rise to many mental health and stress problems.
According to a survey published in U.S News, 78% of Americans have claimed that Covid 19 is a great deal of stress.

The American Psychological Association’s Stress in America 2020 survey reveals that the nation is faced with many stressful situations these days. There are varied factors on which a person can take stress; it can even be the stress for the environment and climate crisis.

It is said that a certain amount of stress allows a person to manage and do much work in time. But as the intensity of stress increases, it becomes harmful. 
As the awareness increased, people started taking care of their health.
Vitamins and minerals are essential for many aspects of health, including mental and emotional health. Aiming to make half the plate fruits and vegetables and choosing from various colourful produce can help meet the body's vitamin needs and help protect against cellular damage,” said dietician Majumdar.
She also shared, “Foods that are bright and rich in colour tend to be high in antioxidants.” Her list includes the entire visible light spectrum:
Red (red peppers, beets, pomegranate, cherries).
Orange (sweet potato, butternut squash, oranges, carrots).
Yellow (squash, lemons, melon).
Green (dark leafy greens, lettuces, kiwi, broccoli).
Blue (blueberries).
Purple (red cabbage, purple potatoes, red onion).

Maintaining a sound diet full of vitamins and nutrients can help alleviate the risk of high stress.
