Chelsea striker Hakim Ziyech has quit from Morocco duty after a fallout with the national team coach Vahid Halilhodzic. Speaking to Abu Dhabi Sports TV, he said that he is not intending to return to the team even if they qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

"I understand them, but I will not return to the Moroccan national team and this is my final decision. It's all clear for me how things are going over there and I am focusing on what I am doing and, right now, that is my club." The player told.

"At the end of the day, it's a decision he makes and you have to respect it. All the lying that comes with it, it's, for me, clear and I will not return to the national team. I understand and feel sorry for [the fans], but that's the situation we're in," he added.

The 28-year old failed to make the final cut for the recently wound up African Cup of Nations team and hasn't played for the Atlas Lions since June, last year as he was involved in a war of words with Vahid. 

The former Ajax super star had missed all six group-stage fixtures in Morocco's World Cup qualifying campaign.

A statement from coach Halilhodzic hinting that he is not planning to call back the player for the crucial two-legged World Cup qualifying playoff match against the Democratic Republic of Congo in March was a turning point in Ziyech's decision to retire.

Ziyech was born in the Netherlands and he represented the Dutch team at youth international level before changing the allegiance to Morocco in 2015.

One of the most decorated player in Morocco, he has scored 17 goals in 39 appearances internationally. He joined Premier League side Chelsea in 2020 on a five year deal after leading Dutch champions Ajax to Champions League semifinal of 2019-20. 

Ziyech who failed to make expected impact under Thomas Tuchel, has scored five goals and registered five assists in 36 Premier League appearances. In his last domestic League match he scored a screamer against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur.
