Stress is a natural response to the information being received by the body as potentially dangerous or problematic.
Theoretically, this is a useful reaction, as it helps us survive in hostile surroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response to our surroundings. we have used this response to deal with difficult situations and to flee from harmful creatures.
When we encounter any specific situation the alarm that goes off in our head makes our neurons activate the pituitary gland, which produces hormones that release corticotropin (ACTH), which in turn circulates through the body via the sympathetic nervous system.
The adrenal gland is then triggered by corticotropin to release adrenaline and cortisol (a steroid hormone). Adrenaline raises our respiratory rate and pulse and prepares our muscles for action, getting the body ready to react to perceived danger, while cortisol increases the release of dopamine and blood glucose, which is what gets us “charged up” and allows us to face challenges.
In addition, Stress has a degenerative effect over time. A sustained state of emergency affects the neurons associated with memory, as well as inhibiting the release of certain hormones, the absence of which can cause depression. Its secondary effects include irritability, insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure.
