Researchers at the Center of Bible Engagement recently discovered thatÂ when a person reads the Bible at least four times a week, it affects nearly every major area of their lives in positive ways:
Feelings of loneliness dropped 30%
Anger issues dropped 32%
Bitterness in relationships (marriage, children, relatives) dropped 40%
Alcoholism dropped 57%
Feeling spiritually stagnant dropped 60%
Viewing pornography dropped 62%
Gambling dropped 64%
Sharing the Gospel increased 200%
Discipling others increased 230%
These people read the Bible at least 4 times a week and they saw such a great improvement in their being. Reading the Bible will make your life better. Try for yourself! Sometimes I wish I could experience reading the Bible for the first time. I don't remember when I first read it but I do know it feels great to read it even today.
