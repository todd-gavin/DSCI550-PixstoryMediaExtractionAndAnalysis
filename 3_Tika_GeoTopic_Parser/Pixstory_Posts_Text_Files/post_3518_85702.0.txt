FCB Ulka bagged the prestigious Grand Prix at the recently held 35th edition of Spikes Asia. The agency won the award this time for the “Nominate Me Selfie”, which was crafted for Political Shakti, in collaboration with Times of India, making it four years in a row.

 The previous winning campaigns by FCB Ulka include ‘Sindoor Khela’ in 2018, ‘The Open Door Project’ for The Millenium School in 2019, ‘The Times Out & Proud’ campaign for Times of India in 2021.

Speaking with BestMediaInfo.com about the “Nominate Me Selfie” campaign, Swati Bhattacharya, CCO, FCB India, said, “During Covid, when we were all locked up inside out homes, I got a call from Tara (Tara Krishnaswamy, Founder, Political Shakti) and she told me about the work there were doing and she asked me if I would be interested in doing a campaign. So basically, it was like actually getting to partner in a movement.”

The campaign involved around 140 grassroots organisations that spread the message to 45,000 Indian villages. As a result, for the first time in the history of Bihar, 22 out of 115 nominations were given to women. The ruling party in the state of Bihar included 72 women in public policy committees.

To further amplify the initiative 
Shakti is aiming to travel to other Indian states to spread the word and create a pipeline for women leadership in the Indian political space.

During the conversation, Bhattacharya also revealed that after Spikes Asia, FCB is now even more excited about Cannes and her focus is on three special campaigns – “See me as I am”, “Chatpat” and something that the team is working on, for the global award festival.
