It was February 3, 2020 I was at my village with my cousins. We decided to go for a sightseeing.✨ On our way we came across numerous beautiful sceneries but this particular sunset was the best part of the day.🤩 Being a music lover, I always have headphones in my ears. " Music Freak", yeah that's exactly what they call me. 😂Back to this particular view, I still remember a lofi song playing in my ears and the birds chirping in the background. The river water was quite and serene. And the sun which was shinning brightly just a minute ago started sinking slowly and was almost nearer to the surface of the water. The next thing I remembered was seeing just the dusky sky as if the river water has engulfed the sun within no time. The cool breeze was giving me shivers and so was the enchanting view. I still don't remember the joke my cousins told me all the while but I could still remember the vibe, which is more than enough to give me goosebumps.🥶 If granted a wish to go back to the past and relive some memories. No doubt I will pick this particular day or to be much more specific this particular part of the day! 😩♥️
