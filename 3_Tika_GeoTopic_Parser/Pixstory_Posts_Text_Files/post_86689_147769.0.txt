The 2022 World Cup, the first men’s World Cup outside its traditional summer window, will be played in November and December in Qatar. In many ways, at least on television in the U.S., it will look very similar to other editions of the world’s most popular sporting event. But in other ways, it will be strange, unique and controversial. Here’s everything you need to know about it.
When is the 2022 World Cup?
The 2022 World Cup begins Nov. 20 — one day earlier than its original start date — and concludes Dec. 18.
FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, made the unprecedented decision to move the tournament out of June and July to avoid Qatar’s scorching summer heat.
European clubs, whose seasons run from August through May, will pause for the World Cup, which will be compressed into four weeks. The group stage will last just 13 days instead of the usual 15. The knockout rounds begin Dec. 3. Here’s the schedule.
Where is the 2022 World Cup?
The 2022 World Cup will be held in Qatar — a tiny peninsular emirate on the Persian gulf — and specifically in metropolitan Doha, where over 80% of the country’s 3 million people live.
All eight stadiums are within 40 miles and 50-minute drives of one another, in and around the Qatari capital. Six of the eight did not exist in 2010 when Qatar won hosting rights.
Some estimates say Qatar has spent over $200 billion on World Cup-related infrastructure.
What time are games? And what’s the time difference in Qatar?
The biggest games, including all three U.S. group games, kick off at 10 p.m. in Qatar, which translates to 2 p.m. ET. The time difference will be eight hours to ET, nine to CT, and 11 to PT.
Round of 16 and quarterfinal matches begin at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. ET. The semifinals and final are at 2 p.m. ET.
