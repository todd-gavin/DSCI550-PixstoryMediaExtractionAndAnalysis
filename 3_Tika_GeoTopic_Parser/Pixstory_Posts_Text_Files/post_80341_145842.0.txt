Threats:
Though Juventus has been a top quality club in the past and has a glorious history, the style of play adopted by the players often turns out to be a threat to their own team. The major strategy involves playing the safe game and not trying to press too much higher up into the opponent's half of the play. This in turn results in too many sides passes from the Juve players and soon attracts opposition attackers closer to their box. To beat the press from the opponents who keep on chasing the ball becomes difficult. 
The players in Black and white end up committing too many errors and thus providing the opposition with an opportunity to make the most of the possession and create a chance for a goal. Losing possession too many times in a game never lets Juventus maintain a stable rhythm and grip on the game. 
This results from too many errors by the players who are under pressure to find their teammates who are stranded at far-off places not maintaining proper positioning off the ball. As a result, the possession is lost inevitably and the side concedes a goal.
