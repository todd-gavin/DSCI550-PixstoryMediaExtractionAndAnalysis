Yes, octopus actually have three hearts - one at the front, one in the middle and one at the back. These hearts are responsible for pumping blood around the body and enabling them to change color to blend in with their surroundings. 
Octopuses also have a highly developed nervous system that allows them to control their tentacles and even their eyesight. In fact, they can even change the color of their eyes to camouflage themselves!
Octopus' hearts are unique in that they have three chambers, just like humans do. This means that octopus' hearts can pump blood around their bodies three times as fast as a human's heart can.
Additionally, octopus' hearts are also very flexible - they can contract and expand up to ten times their original size! This allows them to squeeze through tight spaces and avoid getting crushed. 
Octopus' hearts are also surprisingly efficient - they can pump up to 200 pounds of blood per minute! This is more than triple the amount of blood that a human's heart can pump. 
All in all, octopus' hearts are an impressive anatomical marvel that you should definitely know about if you're interested in biology or physiology.
