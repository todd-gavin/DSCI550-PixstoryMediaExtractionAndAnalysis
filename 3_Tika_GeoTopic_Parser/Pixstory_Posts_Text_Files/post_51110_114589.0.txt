4. Release Tension Through Light Exercise Although exercise might be the last thing you want to do when you have cramps, it’s actually one of the best ways to reduce your period pain. That’s because exercise releases hormones known as endorphins.
These endorphins give us an all-around feel-good sensation. 🧘‍♀️

5. Practice Slow, Deep Breathing Slow deep breathing refers to breathing with the belly and diaphragm.
Simply put, it means you allow your belly to expand when you inhale, and then you relax the belly toward the spine on the exhale.
When this type of breathing is done slowly, it triggers the nervous system to calm down, ultimately reducing the intensity of pain.🫁


6. Use Anti-Inflammatory Herbs Cramp bark, ginger and turmeric are three herbs that have been shown to be very effective at providing relief from period pain. You can make tea with them.

7. Drink A Pain-Fighting, Hormone-Balancing Smoothie
Everything about our cycle is tied to hormones.
Therefore, starting your day with a hormone-balancing smoothie that also relieves pain can make your life much easier.🥤
