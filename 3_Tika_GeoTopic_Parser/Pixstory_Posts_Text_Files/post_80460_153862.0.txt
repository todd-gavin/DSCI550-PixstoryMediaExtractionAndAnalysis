Arsenal without a doubt has been one of the most decorated clubs in the history of the game. The club has managed to achieve several incredible feats in its history so far. 
Players like Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Denis Bergkamp and many others who helped the club reach its greatest heights in the early 2000s will forever be remembered by the gunners and their fans in the times to come. However there was a player amongst all of these who completely left a long lasting impact on Arsenal during his stay at the club. This led him to be called as "Mr. Arsenal". We're talking about none other than Tony Adams.
Tony Adams who made his Arsenal debut in 1993 at the age of 17 spent his entire club career at Arsenal which spanned for a long period of 19 years. His brilliant skills as a defender proved as a major reason which led Arsenal to winning the league Cup. He was handed the captaincy responsibilities of his club in 1988 at 21 years of age which he carried on for the next 14 years until his retirement in the year 2002. A major part of his career was negatively impacted by his addiction to alcoholism during the mid 1980s. He had to face several problems due to this addiction which lead him to being imprisoned once, a car accident and several fights in the nightclub. He began his recovery from alcoholism in the early 1990s. 
His battle with alcoholism was mainly initiated even more after Adams was aided by Arsene Wenger who newly joined the gunners as their manager in 1996. Arsene Wenger's brilliant managerial skills beside his way of reforming his dietary practices boosted Adam's career in a number of ways. Tony didn't disappoint his manager and achieved brilliant results thereon including two Premiership and FA Cup Doubles, in 1997–98 and 2001–02. The legendary defender by the time of his retirement had played a total of 672 matches for arsenal scoring a total of 49 goals. He is also the most successful captain in the club's history till date.
