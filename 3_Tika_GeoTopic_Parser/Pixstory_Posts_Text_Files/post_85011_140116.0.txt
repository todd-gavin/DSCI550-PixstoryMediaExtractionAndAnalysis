Fulham vs Chelsea Probable Winners
Chelsea have had a turbulent start this season and their late transfer window signings have just arrived. With a new manager coming in, it wouldnâ€™t be rational for them to go for a goal fest.
However, Chelsea looks the superior side on paper and have the capability to grind an away win
against Fulham.
Fulham, on the other hand, have lost 2, won 2, and drawn a game in their last 5 matches in the Premier League. Their defense looks a bit meager in front of the Chelsea forwards.
Prediction: Fulham 1-2 Chelsea
