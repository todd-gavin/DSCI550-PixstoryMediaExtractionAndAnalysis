The day after the victory against Inter, the Bologna players organized a surprise visit to Sini and Mihajlovi who was still hospitalized in the Sant Orsola Hospital. From under the window of the coach&#39;s room, the entire team, including staff and managers, began to sing chants and to applaud the visibly excited coach Last time you came to clear your conscience today instead you deserved it You made me ten years younger thanks I love you Then a joke in full Mihajlovi style Ah you&#39;re here after training eh that means no you did nothing today
