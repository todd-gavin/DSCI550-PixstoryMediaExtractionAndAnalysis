As Dwayne Johnson s Black Adam reaches closer to its release date speculations around Henry Cavill s Superman cameo arise more each day Rumours are already rife that the DC superhero will return even though the Man of Steel actor has said he is done with it Previously claims came from a Hollywood insider who said that the actor is indeed back though no names of any films were mentioned When The Rock referred to Cavill as the Superman of our generation and teased several times that he is making a comeback However no confirmation has ever been made on it Some people have even pointed out that bringing Superman back could be a mistake and a few reports suggested that Warner Bros wouldn t go that way either But it seems like the number of DC fans wanting Henry Cavill to return and believing he will be in Dwayne Johnson s Black Adam outweighs them
