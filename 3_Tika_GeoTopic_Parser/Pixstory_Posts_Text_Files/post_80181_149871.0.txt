Celebrities have been an easy target for body shaming . In fact, this is the price they pay for being in the public eye constantly judged for their physical appearance and attributes. While you scroll the social media, seeing the new mom get back in the shape and get inspired, these people also go through challenges alike us as they are expected to be what is called ‘perfect’. Recently, Kajol Aggarwal, an Indian actress wrote about body positivity for postpartum body and some struggles she has been facing with it while she embraced motherhood. She wrote that how her body isn’t the same as it used to be as pre baby she could endure very long workdays with taxing amount of physical activity and then hit the gym and how post baby her body protested the martial arts training that came so easily earlier to her. The caption further read and gave an inspirational message to the new moms- Our bodies can change/may change/will change but our indomitable spirit and burning passion need not. We have got to keep just keep showing up for ourselves and consistently making each day count.It’s all about what we choose to prioritise to focus on and not feel guilty about our choices. Going back to work after baby is overwhelming. With constantly dealing with mom shaming and work load , inculcating body positivity is a great start for new back-to work- mom.
