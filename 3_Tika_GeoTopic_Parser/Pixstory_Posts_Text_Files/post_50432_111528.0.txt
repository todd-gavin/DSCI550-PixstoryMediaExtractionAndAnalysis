Medical students spend most of their time with intense daily study and this is all towards a goal to help people one day.

It is not easy to become a doctor. There are lots of ups and downs to be faced. During the MBBS journey, one see a lot of struggle and sacrifices which start to become worth it over the time.

You'll have to sacrifice your sleep in order to study and pass exams and then take care of people around you in the hospital. Hospital shifts can be very long.
You'll have to sacrifice your personal life to some extent as your duty will always come first.

If you are a medical student, this is a huge opportunity that few have to begin this journey of adulthood. Medical school is extremely interesting. You are able to observe or even do things that no one else is able to (legally) and you are encouraged to develop the skills and knowledge to continue doing so. If this is boring, you are in the wrong profession.
