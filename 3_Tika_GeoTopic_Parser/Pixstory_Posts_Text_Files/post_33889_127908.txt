In Germany, a story that saw Manuel Neuer as protagonist a few weeks ago and which only came to light in the last few days is causing discussion. The Bayern Munich goalkeeper had in fact lost his wallet in a taxi and at the end of the day the driver found it under one of the seats rear Inside, in addition to all the documents, there were also euros in cash So the taxi driver thought it best to return the wallet to its owner and went to Neuer&#39;s house more than km away The German extreme defender was not present which is why the wallet was left with a trusted man after explaining everything that had happened since the episode up to the distance traveled to return it The taxi driver expected a reward from Neuer who instead sent him only a Bayern shirt unleashing his anger It all started in Munich where I went to pick up Neuer and a friend I recognized him immediately Cleaning the car I found the wallet with personal documents about euros in cash and two credit cards At the end of the shift I went to the apartment where I had accompanied him but no one was there he told Sky Sports DE In the end I handed everything over to the agent who I left my contact with In total I traveled about miles to return my wallet two weeks later I received a personalized Bayern Munich shirt with his name but no dedication or thank you note The reward is a joke I have four children concluded the taxi driver After driving so far to return his wallet he admitted that he was disappointed with Neuer&#39;s reward because he had spent a very high amount of around euros for the trip The law in Germany provides that anyone who returns property worth euros is entitled to the value and an additional one for property worth more than that. This means that the taxi driver should only have received euros for his noble deed.
