Once upon a space time a cosmic creation story unfolded thousands of never before seen young stars spotted in a stellar nursery called Doradus captured by NASA s James Webb Space Telescope Nicknamed the Tarantula Nebula for the appearance of its dusty filaments in previous telescope images the nebula has long been a favorite for astronomers studying star formation In addition to young stars Webb reveals distant background galaxies as well as the detailed structure and composition of the nebula s gas and dust At only light years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy the Tarantula Nebula is the largest and brightest star forming region in the Local Group the galaxies nearest our Milky Way It is home to the hottest most massive stars known Astronomers focused three of Webb s high resolution infrared instruments on the Tarantula Viewed with Webb s Near Infrared Camera NIRCam the region resembles a burrowing tarantula s home lined with its silk The nebula s cavity centered in the NIRCam image has been hollowed out by blistering radiation from a cluster of massive young stars which sparkle pale blue in the image Only the densest surrounding areas of the nebula resist erosion by these stars powerful stellar winds forming pillars that appear to point back toward the cluster These pillars contain forming protostars which will eventually emerge from their dusty cocoons and take their turn shaping the nebula Source
