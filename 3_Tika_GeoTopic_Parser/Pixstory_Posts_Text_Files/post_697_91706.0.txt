Modest cutlets with some spinach fritters, fruits and basil seed sharbat . 
Will share more mouth watering Iftaari in future . 

Holy month of Ramadhan works on the concept of intermittent fasting. Where for a month you give a discipline to your metabolism- eat in fixed hours and fast in the rest. 
All the faithful go without food and water from breaking of dawn to dusk - from the morning fajr prayers to evening Isha. 
One is allowed to eat between dusk and dawn. So on an average, those who fast in the month of ramadhan go without food and water for atleast 14 to 16 hours-Everyday for a month. 
The concept is to give a break to the metabolic system and kick start the process of healthy eating. It also brings a certain disciple in a persons life. One gives up food and even water and doesn’t even indulge when no one is watching. It teaches us self control and also for the faithful it reinforces our faith in God . 
Personally I always look forward to the month- it brings a certain peace for me. Last year after almost ten years I didn’t fast for about 15 days as I was fighting covid. The only other time I hadn’t fasted was when I was a child,  either pregnant or breast feeding - as one is exempted to do so in certain health conditions - even breast feeding mothers are also given an exemption as the suckling baby is dependant on nutrition on the mother .
Hope I can fast for the entire month.
