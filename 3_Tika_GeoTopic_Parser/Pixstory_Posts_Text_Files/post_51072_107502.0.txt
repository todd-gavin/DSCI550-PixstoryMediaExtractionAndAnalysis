If you’re tired of fighting against your hair and want to find a way to embrace your natural texture, give the hot tools and products a rest. Not only is it possible to style thicker hair sans heat, it will look better and feel healthier in the end. Perfecting the wash-and-dry technique is key to a low-maintenance routine for thicker locks.

Below, find everything you need to know about how to air-dry thick hair perfectly every single time.

1. Comb Your Hair in the Shower—and Don't Brush It After

2. "If you brush your hair when it's starting to dry, almost dry, or all the way dry, you'll experience unwanted frizz.

3. Rethink your towel technique: Toweling is often the downfall of great hair and one sure-fire way to frizz and tangle strands. "My best advice is to not towel-dry the hair too much because that generates frizz and poufiness. 

4. Use a leave in product: Even if it's just with coconut oil (which some people love), nourishing your hair is key for avoiding frizz and getting definition. 

5. Mind the ends: The oldest part of your hair is at the ends, which is why the tips are the most prone to dryness and breakage. And when your hair strands split, that gives way to a lack of definition and frizz, not to mention the further breakage you'll experience if it's left untreated. Schedule regular hair trims, and in the interim use a serum or hair oil to temporarily conceal split ends.
