The movie presents us with several hard hitting moments that reveal the ugly side of out society even today. 

Alia Bhatt starrer Darlings was released on Netflix on August 5. Directed by debutante Jasmeet K. Reen, the movie has stellar performances by Shefali Shah, Vijay Varma, and Roshan Mathew. As a black comedy-drama, the comedy does emerge from a dark place but, keeping the context in mind, it keeps you glued and you always root for Badrunissa while hating her husband with every move. With a runtime of two hours 14 minutes, the film is well-paced with interesting revelations being made one after the other. 
Some one-liners and comic punches are so subtle that if you don't pay attention, you won't understand why the person sitting next to you is laughing so hard. Wait for the climax that is funny and sad in its own way.

Here are some impeccable dialoges reflecting on the greatness of how the movie reveals several truth. 

1. "Some men are scorpions dear, they never change"
2. "The world’s changed for the people on Twitter, not for the likes of us"
3. "Why do men turn into monsters when drunk?"
4. "Why would I abuse you if I don’t love you? Why would you take it if you don’t love me?"
5. "Divorce tag is the worst, who will marry her then?"
