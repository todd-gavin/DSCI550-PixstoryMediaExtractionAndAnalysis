Anecdote of the Jar

I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

What actually happens in the poem remains unusual and baffling: the speaker tells us that he spotted a jar on a hill in Tennessee, and the wilderness of the surrounding land appeared to grow up around the jar until it was no longer wild.

 The jar is characterized as tall and remarkable as it stands on the hill. The jar takes over everything, despite being grey and bare (and presumably empty). 

It does not seem to care for the essence around it and is like nothing else in the whole of Tennessee. We might also interpret ‘Anecdote of the Jar’, more widely, as a poem about man’s conquest of nature.
