Westbrook s form has surged over the past couple of weeks during which the guard averaged points rebounds and assists shooting from the field and from downtown Frank Vogel said he believes the year old will keep up the good work even after James and Davis returned from their injuries I don t think it should change that much honestly Vogel said We want him always to be aggressive but never to force That applies if Bron and AD are out there or if we ve got the group we had tonight We want him to be as aggressive as he can but to be efficient with his turnover ratio and his shooting percentage So that shouldn t change that much
