Maya Angelou Awaking in New York Curtains forcing their will against the wind children sleep exchanging dreams with seraphim The city drags itself awake on subway straps and I an alarm awake as a rumour of war lie stretching into dawn unasked and unheeded Maya Angelou s creative words paint a portrait of the dizzying extent of New York City exuding a sense of both wistfulness and melancholy at the site of an awakening metropolis She lays bare the adrenaline of being fastened into the tapestry of a bustling city whilst simultaneously endangering the overwhelming sense of loneliness found in these most dazzling of places The poem uses techniques such as imagery and personification to establish an image of New York city that is equal parts wistful and draining The speaker interprets through vivid imagery the fantasies that children share with the angels the turmoil of the wind against curtains and the mundanity of day to day city life In the last line the speaker brings themselves into the poem dealing with their position how they wake up and how they consider the rest of the world
