Bayern Munich had an opportunity to sign Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. However, the Bundesliga giants passed up on the chance and are now struggling to replace the now departed Robert Lewandowski. Transfer specialist Fabrizio Romano had his say on this as the Italian claimed that Bayern had made a mistake by not signing Ronaldo. 
In his exclusive column for Caught Offside, Fabrizio Romano claimed, "Itâ€™s normal that any club would miss a player like Robert Lewandowski. I think Cristiano Ronaldo was a great option for them to replace their top scorer, but I understand their traditional policy on transfers is different." 
The Bavarians chose not to sign CR7 as the striker is in the final years of his magnificent career. With 3 draws and 1 loss in 7 games, Bayern Munich are currently at the fourth spot in the Bundesliga table. Hence Fabrizio Romano believed that signing CR7 to replace Lewandowski would have been the perfect decision for the club.
With the January transfer window fast approaching, Bayern Munich could still reconsider their decision to go for Ronaldo. With the club being the favourites to win their Champions League group, the 37-year-old's experience could play a key part in helping the club win the Champions League and the Bundesliga title this season.
