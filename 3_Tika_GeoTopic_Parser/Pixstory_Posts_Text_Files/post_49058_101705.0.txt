The Akuntsu (also known as Akunt'su or Akunsu) are a Rondônian indigenous tribe. Their area is part of the Rio Omerê Indigenous Region, a small indigenous territory where a tribe of Kanoê also live. The Akuntsu people were massacred by Brazilian cattle ranchers in the 1980s.

The Akuntsu people live in a small section of the Amazon near the Bolivian border(The Akuntsu). They are one of the numerous victims of the animal agricultural industry. After cattle ranchers invaded their area in 1995, only five Akuntsu people survived (Uncontacted tribes). The ranchers not only stole the property, but they also killed practically the entire tribe and demolished their homes, essentially erasing any proof that the tribe ever existed (Uncontacted tribes). Sadly, neither of these tribes' stories are very exceptional. Ten Indigenous leaders from four distinct places claimed threats or acts of intimidation in a 2019 Amnesty International study (Amnesty International, 2019).

The AnAg industry, much like many others, have constantly victimized indigenous people over the decades. It is horrifying and heartbreaking how so many natives become their victims.
