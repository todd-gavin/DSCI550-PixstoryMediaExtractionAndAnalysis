I don't think women could be the best managers. Of course, they could manage things, but saying they're better managers than men would be wrong.

Being empathetic and kind-hearted would not always help someone manage a whole company; as a professional, we need to take actions that would not be considered from an emotional perspective; it should be straightforward and tough.

Furthermore, men are always considered better leaders, and most women will agree with this. There's a queen-bee syndrome in women, which would unlikely support them being managers.
No matter what and how inequalities have existed to harm them, there are inherent qualities in women.
Women tend to compare themselves with other women; even studies have shown that women's perception of their own competence was boosted after they were able to malign a hypothetical female leader.
This existing competitiveness would make any situation uncomfortable for women employees and even contemporaries.
It is also found that this unnecessary competitiveness in women troubles the female employees, and they even endure psychological issues, which is not suitable for the functioning of a company.
Men don't possess such qualities and are not affected by any employees irrespective of whether they are men or women. These qualities would not make any woman a great manager.


Even men have better cognitive abilities when they deal with certain matters. They can identify, interact and understand the situation with good cognitive skills.
So I don't believe that women could be better managers.
