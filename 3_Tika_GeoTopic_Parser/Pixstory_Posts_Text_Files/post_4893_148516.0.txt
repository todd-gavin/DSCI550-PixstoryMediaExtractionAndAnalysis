Its Mahalaya, a day which marks the arrival of Goddess Durga to Earth, and a quintessential Mahalaya at a Bengali household is incomplete without hearing 'Mahisasura Mardini' in the sonorous voice of Birendra Kumar Bhadra.
His voice is like floating autumn air, recounting the story of Goddess Durga's victory over the demon King Mahisasura.
Though Bengalis might argue and debate about multiple things and might not agree about most of the things but every Bengali will agree Birendra Kumar Bhadra Mahisasura Mardini is the best of all.
In 1931, at the dawn of Mahalaya, All India Radio Calcutta at 4 am broadcasted Mahisashura Mardini, a collection of shlokas and songs.
The 10 days festivities of Durga Puja commence on the day of Mahalaya, and the idol makers give life to the Goddess by giving her eyes.
This ritual is known is 'Chokku Daan'
It is also believed Mahalaya marks the beginning of Durga’s journey to visit her father's house.
Hence the reason why the festivities are celebrated with so much grandeur, as when somebody visit their parents house after a very long time its all about  joy and celebration
