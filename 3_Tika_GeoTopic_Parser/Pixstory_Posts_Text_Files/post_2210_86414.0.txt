With a landslide win in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is set to increase its strength in the Rajya Sabha.

Out of the seven seats from Punjab, five will go to polls on March 31 and the remaining two by June this year. Â 

The term of Partap Singh Bajwa (Congress), Sardar Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa (Shiromani Akali Dal), Shamsher Singh Dullo (Congress), Naresh Gujral (Shiromani Akali Dal) and Shwait Malik (Bharatiya Janata Party) will come to an end on April 9 while Sardar Balwinder Singh Bhunder (Shiromani Akali Dal) and Ambika Soni (Congress) retire on July 4.

The AAP is set to win 91 of the 117 seats in the state while the Congress is leading on 19. The SAD is ahead on three, the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on one each.

The AAP is likely to win all the seven Rajya Sabha seats from Punjab and increase its tally to 10 from the present three (all from Delhi).

One of the possible AAP candidates could be former law minister Ashwani Kumar who resigned from the Congress just before the elections. However, he is yet to formally join the AAP.

Delhi chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal had faced flak for his nominations in Delhi and also resulted in the exit of Rajya Sabha aspirants Ashutosh and Kumar Vishwas from the party. 

There were allegations that two of the three seats were sold by Kejriwal to raise funds for the party in its bid to expand pan-India.
