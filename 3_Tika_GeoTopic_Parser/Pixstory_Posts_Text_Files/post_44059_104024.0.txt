Tunisia and Equatorial Guinea will begin their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification campaign against
each other at the Stade Olympique de Rades in Group J on Thursday.

Tunisia will be high on spirits, after securing their passage to the World Cup by beating Mali 1 - 0 over
two legs. Last time out, Tunisia reached the quarter finals of the African Cup of Nations and will be
looking to go further into the tournament this time around.

Equatorial Ghana also made it to the quarter finals of the African Cup of Nations last time out. The team
does possess a very rich vein of form - unbeaten in 11 of their last 15 matches with 9 wins and 2 draws a
piece.

Equatorial Ghana has never made the African Cup of Nations consecutively in their history and will be
looking to do so this time around.

Equatorial Ghana off.
