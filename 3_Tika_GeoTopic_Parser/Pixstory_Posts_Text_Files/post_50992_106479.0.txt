As the weather warms up in most parts of the country, we tend to get thirsty and sweat profusely. The mildest of dehydration can take away energy from your body; it can dismantle the body’s ability to carry out normal functions, and make you feel lethargic all the time. 

5 smart ways to stay hydrated during summers:
Here are some ways in which you can ensure to stay hydrated at all times during the scorching summer heat:

1. Add some flavour: If you find plain water too boring to consume regularly, you can add some zest and flavour, maybe slices of cucumber or lemon, fruit slices etc. 🍋🥒

2. Eat your water: Certain fruits and veggies have high water content, such as grapes, watermelon, strawberries, cucumber, lettuce, spinach etc. Their consumption can often lead to fulfilling the daily quota of water for the body.🥬🍇

3. Sip some energising smoothies: Prepare some tasty fruit smoothies, with strawberries, peaches, blueberries etc. this can work wonders too. 🥤🧋

4. Avoid loss of body fluids: Avoiding extreme sun exposure, especially during mid afternoon hours, when the sun rays are at their strongest helps keep the body temperature in control and prevents you from getting dehydrated or falling sick. 🧃

5. Go for snack alternatives: Instead of having carb packed pasta and noodles, try for zucchini noodles or healthier alternatives that contain water. Mixing them with tomato sauce which in itself is a powerhouse of water will make such meals hydrating and an overall healthy option for hunger pangs during the day.🥒
