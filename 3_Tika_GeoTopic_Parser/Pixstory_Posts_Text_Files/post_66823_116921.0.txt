Making such venomous remarks when there was literally no reason to do it, is so stupid. 

Daniels had an affair with Trump, she basically made a fool of melania all the while and now she's spewing hate towards her. 

Danilels should be apologising to her for what she did to her, and she's the one judging her for doing nothing. 

When will stop holding women accountable for the mistakes of their husbands?? When will we stop putting women on a pedestal and not allowing them to be human, and make mistakes???
