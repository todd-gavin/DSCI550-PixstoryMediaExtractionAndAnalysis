CHILD'S SONG
By ROBERT LOWELL

My cheap toy lamp gives little light all night, all night, when my muscles cramp.

Sometimes I touch your hand across my cot, and our fingers knot, but there's no hand

to take me home no Carribean island, where even the shark is at home.

It must be heaven. There on that island, the white sand shines like a birchwood fire.

Help, saw me in two, put me on the shelf! Sometimes the little muddler can't stand itself!

The poem talks about the dreams-the child has but cannot be fulfilled. It talks about specially abled children and how they are so dependent on their parents.
