Diet can play a HUGE role in balancing our
hormones!

Here are the best foods you can eat to balance yours!

Cruciferous vegetables: THE best for hormone
balancing as they help to detoxify the liver, and have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Favourites are broccoli, cauliflower, radish asparagus, Brussel
sprouts, kale, arugula, radish

Healthy fat: Omega 3s and 6s are crucial for skin health by helping produce the skins natural oil barrier, and are the building blocks of healthy cell membranes. My favourites
are avocado, fatty fish like salmon or tuna, olive oil, almond butter, flax seeds, or coconut oil

Eat fermented foods: eating fermented foods can boost the number of beneficial bacteria, or probiotics, in your gut- super important to get things moving! My favourites are kimchi, and sauerkraut whole grain carbs: These are all filled with fibre which is the best for digestion and circulation which supplies oxygen and nutrients to skin cells. favourites are brown
rice, quinoa, and buckwheat
