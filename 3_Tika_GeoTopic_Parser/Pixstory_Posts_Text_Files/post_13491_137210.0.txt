The Kyrgyz are one of the ethnic minorities of Afghanistan who live on the foothills of the Pamir Mountains in Badakhshan. The last point in the north of Afghanistan which is famous all over the world
It is said that this ethnic minority immigrated to this region after the October Russian Revolution. Some have come to Pamir after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This group is Sunni religious and speaks Kyrgyz and to some extent Persian
Livestock is the life of the people of this region. Women are also the main labor force
Unlike the majority of Afghan citizens, these people are not concerned about insecurity and are strangers to the sound of explosions and news of suicide. But they are familiar with many other pains
Here, the smallest basic facilities of life are not available; There is no news of the hospital, nor of the school and education
The increase in maternal mortality during childbirth due to the lack of health facilities has made Kyrgyz worried about the extinction of their generation in Afghanistan.
For Kyrgyz, opium, like food and water, is a part of life under the tents; Not only men, women and children are also addicted to opium smoke to relieve their pain
Pamirs don't know money and sometimes they give a sheep for a pair of shoes.
There are no telephones or mobile phones ,but local people use radio to communicate with each other. A system that works up to a distance of less than five hundred meters and each of them was bought for a goat.
Despite all these problems, the roof of the world now remains a stone cage stuck in the depths of problems and the cries of its people are not heard by anyone.
