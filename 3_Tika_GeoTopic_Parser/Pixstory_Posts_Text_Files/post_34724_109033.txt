After gold in breaststroke Nicol Martinenghi doubles his medals at the World Championships with silver in breaststroke hundredths from personal Behind him Michael Andrew just over two tenths and a half behind Martinenghi could have won but the first part of the race didn&#39;t go as he hoped he seemed a little slower than he showed in the semifinal Nicol&#39;s words at the end of the race This medal has two flavors sweet for the podium bitter because I made a mistake at the start and I left the cents that probably would have allowed me to win I&#39;m still happy for having approached the staff and for the medal for which I would have signed a hundred times on the eve of the world championship For now I tasted gold and I don&#39;t intend to settle for it anymore
