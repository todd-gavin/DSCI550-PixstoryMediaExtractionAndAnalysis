FC Goa players toured across Kolkata for a few hours of fun and frolic on their visit to Kolkata for the Durand Cup 2022 campaign.
One of their stops was the historic Victoria Memorial, one of the most famous monuments in Kolkata. Dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria who was the Empress of India from 1876 to 1901, the Victoria Memorial is now a museum administered by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.
