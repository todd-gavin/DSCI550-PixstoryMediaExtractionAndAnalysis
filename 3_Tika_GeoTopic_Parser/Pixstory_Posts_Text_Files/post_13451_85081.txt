This is not a new page The house is not new The cover is not new Mother s name I m a little kid brother This kid who did not fly a kite A child who has forgotten his dreams A child whose toys have become the protagonists of his story That s me that s me brother I really should have known something right Brother how is the taste of life really How does the world oppress human beings Who knows the smell of life Life Can you kill me in an instant A life that removes darkness with its fingers A life made by hand for forgotten human beings You lead me to life Just like paintings The cover is not new The house is not new Are your absences connected exactly from the navel alone I really had to give a life Do you rent love to me O life These are my wounds Love For Me The love of life never mind I m a street kid The one that hangs over the edge of the abyss and the sky A child whose toys have become the protagonists of his story This is me this is me brother There is no such thing as street children the streets do not give birth to children
