This is my opinion honestly and something I have fund very fruitful over the years.
 Mayonnaise is a cold emulsified sauce meaning it’s beater with egg whites, yolks, oil drip by drip, whisking  continuously  and incorporating air resulting into the white mayonnaise. The vegan mayonnaise uses pantry staples that you likely already have on hand. Apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard (or dried mustard powder), sugar, salt, pepper, and a touch of turmeric for color are combined with soaked cashews.
In any case mayonnaise is always a cold sauce and used as spread in burgers or salad dressings and sandwiches  but only on after toasting the bread. Never to be used on plain bread and then closed and grilled. Th result will only cause the bread to lose moisture, removing flavour from the mayonnaise and probably ruining your filling flavour as well.
Cheeses on the other hand, perfect blends with the flavours of bread, the crunchy crust of bread after grilling and stretch of hot cheese, is something I find to be superb combination when preparing a sandwich. 
Cheddar, Mozzarella, Swiss, Emmental, Amul Processed Cheese which is an Indian combination of cheeses heavily used in households and hotels .
Enjoy yourself with a nice cheese grilled sandwich along side a cold drink or Mocktail.
Cheers!
