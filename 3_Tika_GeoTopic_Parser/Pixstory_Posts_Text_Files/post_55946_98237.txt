 A country s progress is measured by the progress of women who have been oppressed for years We saw what happened to the plaintiff of Roe v s Wade her right to the decision was taken away from her This is going to happen to every woman as per a leaked report of an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled Alito writes in the document labelled as the Opinion of the Court It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people s elected representatives although it is unclear whether there have been subsequent changes in the draft it is the spear to end a half century guarantee of federal constitutional protection of abortion rights and allow each state to decide whether to restrict or ban abortion If the Alito draft is approved it would decree in favour of Mississippi in the closely watched case over that state s attempt to ban most abortions after weeks of pregnancy The draft opinion runs pages comprising a page appendix of historical state abortion laws The document is rampant with citations to previous court decisions books and other authorities and includes footnotes The appearances and timing of this draft are consistent with court practice As a citizen I am shocked shocked at how women are simply taken away the right over their own bodies No one has the right to decide what a woman should do in her body but herself The state is not going to bear the physical and mental pain she has to undergo for a lifetime This is pure misogyny and unconstitutional Women have the right to decide something very important like their choice to have a child This is not to be decided by the state I would like to make it clear Judge Alito says the decision should be left to the states whether or not to abort What tomfoolery is this Taking away women s rights is not what America wants
