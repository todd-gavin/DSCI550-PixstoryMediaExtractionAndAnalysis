The countdown has begun for the eighth edition of India’s biggest and toughest offroad motorsport competition and this year, four teams from Goa are gearing up to give a tough fight to the best off-roaders from across India at the Rainforest Challenge (RFC) India 2022. The event will be held in various parts of Goa from 23rd July to 30th July wherein 27 teams from all over India will be competing for the coveted RFC India 2022 Champion trophy.

Launched in 2014 by Delhi-based Cougar Motorsport, RFC India is the India Chapter of the Rainforest Challenge of Malaysia, which is ranked No. 3 in the ‘Five Toughest Off-Road Races in the World’ by Skoda Motorsport (2018). Today, RFC India is counted amongst the top two RFC Global events out of the 45 editions held across 22 countries and it enjoys a cult following in the Indian and international off-roading community. The off-road motorsport competition tests the contestants’ driving and vehicle recovery skills, team spirit along with their physical and mental strength under extreme off-road conditions. 

This year, Dattaraj Raut Dessai (co-driver Siddesh Yadav Naik), Ibrahim Firaz Shaik (Imran Garag), Tejas P Shindolkar (Yogesh Nandkarni) and Cedric Jordan DaSilva will represent Goa at the prestigious offroad motorsport event.
