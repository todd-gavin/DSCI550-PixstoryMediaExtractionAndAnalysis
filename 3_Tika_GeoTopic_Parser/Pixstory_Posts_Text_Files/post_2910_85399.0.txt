Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting Minister of Interior, is still on the Most Wanted list of the FBI, in connection with the January 2008 attack on a hotel in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed six people, including an American citizen. (https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorinfo/sirajuddin-haqqani) He hasn't been photographed for many years, not even after he was announced as the country's interior minister after the Afghan Taliban seized power in August. 

But on Saturday, he appeared before media at a police academy ceremony in Kabul and said that he appeared in public so that peoples' "satisfaction and for building trust."

It could also indicate that The Taliban are increasingly confident of their rule and hold on the country.  Haqqani belongs to the feared network that was responsible for many terror attacks in Afghanistan that resulted in hundreds of deaths. 

Haqqani claimed that the Afghan Taliban would uphold its commitments in Doha and not allow anyone to threaten any country from Afghanistan. "Our soil will not be a threat to anyone. The Islamic Emirate is committed to upholding the commitments it made in Doha," he said. (https://tolonews.com/afghanistan-176973)

His pledge came a day after a devastating suicide blast in Pakistan's Peshawar city Shia mosque that resulted in the death of over 60 worshippers. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/world/middleeast/pakistan-peshawar-mosque-explosion.html) Pakistani news reports say that the terrorists may have crossed over to Pakistan from Afghanistan to carry out the suicide blast. 

While Haqqani told police officers to "perform their duties ... and deal with the people with care and kindness." That was hardly displayed by the Taliban who shot dead a youth in eastern Kunar province for playing music at a wedding. (https://www.dawn.com/news/1678423)
