A late-night gathering of Congress MLAs has been summoned by Rajasthan's chief minister, Ashok Gehlot. After Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar's dinner with Mr. Gehlot, the MLAs have been requested to remain.
Tonight at 10 p.m. in Rajasthan, the Congress legislators will meet, according to a Congress leader.
Although the reason Mr. Gehlot requested the meeting is unknown, there is conjecture that it may have something to do with his possible candidacy for Congress president.
