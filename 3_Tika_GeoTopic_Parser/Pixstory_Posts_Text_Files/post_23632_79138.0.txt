The city of Guanghzou, also known as Canton, is often called the City of Flowers. The third most thickly populated city in China, it is also one of the topmost among commercial centres on the Chinese mainland. This giant metropolis is a blend of the modern and the ancient.

In addition, being a strategic trade port to the South China Sea, it has a culturally diverse population. The China Import and Export Fair - more commonly known as the Canton Fair-which is China's largest trade fair, attracts thousands of international visitors to Guangzhou twice a year.

Also, its proximity to Hong Kong means it is one of the most well-connected cities in China as well.
