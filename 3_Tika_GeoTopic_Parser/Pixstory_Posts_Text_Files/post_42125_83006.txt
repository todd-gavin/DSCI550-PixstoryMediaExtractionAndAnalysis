 Includes Spoilers As a girl this movie reminded me of all those unwanted stares one has to see everyday the unwanted touches and feeling completely powerless to act on it This movie brought up a much needed topic that requires more attention Even after all these years and such gruesome cases there is still no capital punishment for rapists due to which they roam free of charge while the victim s self esteem and confidence just crashes down Even in the movie when Yami Gautam identifies the driver as the rapist and the way her voice broke was heart wrenching I really hope that someday our law becomes strong and powerful enough so that all the women can feel secure and it s the culprits who roam in fear and not the victims
