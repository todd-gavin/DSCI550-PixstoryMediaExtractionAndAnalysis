The 2022 NBA free-agent landscape is looking a little sparse.

Only six teams are capable of clearing cap space that will allow them to spend more than the mid-level exception, and there's a dearth of high-end free agents available on the market.

Don't think for a second that'll stop teams from finding ways to overpay.

Special circumstances surrounding a handful of big-name free agents could result in prices climbing beyond the realm of reasonable. It happens every summer, and this one will be no different.

As always, a public service announcement: These players should get as much cash as they can. Viewing things any other way would mean taking the side of billionaire owners with generational wealth over players whose prime earning years expire in their mid-30s. So if we're criticizing anyone, it's the teams writing the checks—not the players collecting them. 

1. James Harden

James Harden's downward career trend line is what it is, and nothing in his profile suggests a reversal is in the cards.

Last year saw Harden take a lower share of his shots inside three feet than ever before, and he finished less efficiently at that range than he had in any season since his first with the Oklahoma City Thunder way back in 2009-10.

The truth is you don't even need the numbers to know Harden's waning athleticism has completely defanged his game. Anyone who watched him struggle to consistently get into the lane in the 2022 playoffs (before ultimately giving up on the endeavor entirely) knows what's happening. And let's not even talk about the defense.

Zooming out, Harden has essentially quit on three straight teams, the last two of which he wanted to play for. His well-documented history of extracurriculars and devolving conditioning suggests that even if he re-engages with the Philadelphia 76ers mentally, the physical component may not be there. 

The notion of paying Harden $270 million on a five-year extension is terrifying, and an opt-in with a four-year, $223 million extension has only slightly less disaster potential. But what are the pot-committed Sixers to do?
