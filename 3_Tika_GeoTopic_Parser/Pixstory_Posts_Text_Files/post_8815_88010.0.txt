If a proper estimate is ever made of these happenings and of the killings on either side, it seems to me that the loss of life of the Hindus and Sikhs and the number of their women abducted will come out to be considerably more than the loss in these matters suffered by the Muslims. Even at the present moment, though aggression on the part of the Hindus has completely stopped, the Muslim population is still out of control and cases of abduction of Hindu women and of killing of Hindus and
Sikhs by the Muslim population are still going on. The loss of property of 
Hindus and Sikhs is several times that of the Muslims. 

â€œIn the circumstances stated above, all that can be said is that on the reasoning employed by you, whatever communal trouble took place between the 15th to 30th October, the responsibility for it, in the absence of extenuat in circumstances, is on the then Government of His Highness. After the 30th October up to date whatever has happened or is happening and whatever loss, whether of life, property or abduction, the responsibility is on the Dictator and his Government as he has been in complete control of the administration. However, so far as I can see neither the Government of His Highness before the 30th nor that of the Dictator subsequent to that date can be made responsible for any happenings as in the circumstances in which the Government was placed whatever before or after the 30th, it was not humanly possible to stop all that took place when men had become insane and started behaving like jungle animals. In view of the extent of the territory no effective steps could be taken to completely stop the mutual killing. Sir Dalip Singh, Agent to the Government of India, was here during a part of this period.
