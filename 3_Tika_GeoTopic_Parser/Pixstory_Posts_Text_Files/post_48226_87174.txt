As the BJP swept clean the elections Yogi Adityanath is set to become the first CM to retain power in a subsequent election since This comes after the state government faced denunciation for the way they handled the pandemic and the farmers protests which may have suggested a decline in BJPs chances at the assembly elections While this may be the feature highlight of this election there are many other facets to this assembly poll More specifically for the congress party it has come as a setback and seems to raise doubts over their lok sabha polls and their ambitions of posing as an alternative to the current hindutva regime Correspondingly BSP s run in these elections was completely decimated with winning just a single seat of a total of seats The important factor here is the desertion of the dalit voters who have been the backbone of the Mayawati led BSP in the past and their inclination towards both BJP and the Samajwadi Party in the elections This has led to a steep decline in BSP s support base and left them at a crossroad For the Samajwadi Party they managed to double their numbers compared to the previous elections however failed to document a winning mandate yet again The preeminent reason for the loss was the BJP s hardline hindutva fundamentals which seemed to have overpowered the Samajwadi Party s rainbow coalition and ideals of equitable social order coupled with the development agenda wherein the main focus was the Ram Mandir Kashi Vishwanath Corridor and the prospects for five international airports in Uttar Pradesh Another major setback for SP was their failed attempt at swaying the Yadav OBCs to vote for Samajwadi Party and the lost opportunity of capitalizing their brief association with Chandrashekhar Aazad ravan The UP elections that are considered a semi final to the parliamentary elections the demographic maths have worked in BJPs favor putting Yogi Adityanath on a much higher echelon at the party level and making him a more favorable candidate for the parliamentary elections
