Preface This book is an endeavour to discover the true significance of the many sided contributions of Rajiv Gandhi the former Prime Minister of India in different areas of national life This theme has been chosen for the book because I believe that the nation is yet to fully grasp the momentousness of his contributions It will be a tragedy if these are allowed to be obscured or lost sight of These contributions have been highlighted unswayed by the adulatory or condemnatory writings already available about the man and his time Rajiv Gandhi s emergence on the Indian political scene as a reluctant entrant unsullied by political experience had a unique charm about it The freshness of his mind and his modern outlook in general were happily welcomed by an India in the throes of transition He created a new mood in the jaded politics of the country He compelled people to think of the next century its challenges and possibilities He was in a hurry to catch upwith the rest of the world in scientific and economic advancement He tried to recast education to meet the needs of a fast changing society He was as conscious about the need to protect the environment as he was about providing clean drinking water to the people He initiated the liberalization of the economy so that India could reach a higher stage of development He brought a new dynamism into India s foreign policy orientations The title of this book Resurgent India has been chosen after careful study of the contributions Rajiv Gandhi made during his five year tenure setting the trend for the country s economic and technological development By any yardstick this period can be described as a period of resurgence From the nation s point of view the contributions Rajiv Gandhi made and the trend he set in modernizing a traditional slow paced and lethargic society are phenomenal This book picks up and highlights this truth for the benefit of future generations To be continued
