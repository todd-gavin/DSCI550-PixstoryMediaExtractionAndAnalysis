Ahead of its second season in September, Battlefield 2042 has gone back to the drawing board with new updates for what is to come in the future for the game. Chief among it all are reworks to the existing maps and a reshaping of the game's highly controversial Specialists mechanic. The maps Renewal and Orbital will be receiving alterations in Battlefield 2042's second season,

Orbital will be getting more extensive changes, with the team shifting the spawns closer together, at the cost of two existing capture points, in order to facilitate quicker action at the start of a match. To make up for the two capture points, 128-player Conquest will now have a new point on the hills for players to fight over, complete with improved cover and barriers. Orbital's rework is set to drop a little later down the line in October.

Battlefield 2042 made a huge deal pre-release about its new “Specialists”, hero-type characters with flexible loadouts who would replace the series tried-and-tested “Class” system (multiplayer FPS archetypes like ‘Recon’ and ‘Assault’). 

For the unversed, Specialists, are essentially specialized hero characters with unique abilities. Specialists have proven highly controversial and became wildly unpopular within the fanbase, both for their gameplay implications as well as their design, convincing the devs to rework things from top to bottom.

Lastly, DICE is introducing Vault Weapons, which are weapons from previous Battlefield games featured in 2042's Portal mode. Players will be able to use these Vault Weapons in 2042's main mode, All-Out Warfare, and the first of these weapons are Battlefield 3's M16A3 assault rifle and the M60E4 LMG. These weapons will be unlockable by tackling assignments and will be released steadily throughout Season 2 and future Battlefield 2042 seasons.
