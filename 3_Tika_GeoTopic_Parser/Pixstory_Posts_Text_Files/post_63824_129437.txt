An icon of the horror survival genre which really played a crucial role in bringing the action to horror survival was Dead Space which is one of the greatest games ever created Dead Space beautifully merged bone chilling horror gore and incredible action along with several other aspects such as exploration storyline etc All of this was built upon developed and improved further in the sequel Dead Space Things took a tumble in Dead Space but it had great lore while the first two parts are nearly unrivaled masterpieces Dead Space perfectly understood the importance of good sound in horror thus featuring some of the best sound design in gaming Perfectly executed using stingers music and silence the game s audio cues knew how to keep the players on their toes and immersed the whole time A very unique aspect of Dead Space and its sequels lay in their approach to the protagonist and his combat abilities Unlike others of its ilk like Resident Evil Isaac Clarke is not some badass military action hero but merely an engineer caught in the worst situation possible and that role therefore influences all his tactics to survive For the most part there are no traditional weapons available but rather Isaac uses old engineer s tools to hack away at the horrifying Necromorphs Furthermore as a character Isaac evolves from a silent character in the first game to a speaking one in and who becomes highly relatable The combat is also another one of its strong points using a limb weakness system as its main aspect and basing the game s arsenal around this aspect makes it an original concept the use of the stasis and kinesis mechanics adds even more to the combat Atmospherically Dead Space features a very claustrophobic atmosphere while Dead Space makes it a lot more open as this time you are in a space station and not just a ship and yet you feel more confined in your choices than even before This gruelling haunting unforgiving and oppressive trial with its lack of resources really makes you feel desperate and helpless
