Later this month, the 62-year-old will manage the three-time African champions against Mexico
and Ecuador. Jose Peseiro has been named the next Super Eagles coach by the Nigeria
Football Federation. A statement made available to GOAL on Sunday evening verified this.

“The Nigeria Football Federation on Sunday announced the appointment of Mr Jose Santos
Peseiro as the new head coach of the senior men national team, Super Eagles,” it read.

“The appointment is with immediate effect, subject to the signing of agreed terms between the
NFF and Mr Peseiro.

“Jose Vitor dos Santos Peseiro, 62 last month, is a Portuguese who played as a striker in his
days and has wide and varied experience coaching top clubs and national teams across four different continents, namely Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.”

Peseiro has previously worked for Panathinaikos, Real Madrid, Sporting CP, Al Ahly, Braga, and
the Venezuelan national squad, which he left in August 2021 due to unpaid wages. Finidi
George (first assistant), Salisu Yusuf (second assistant), Usman Abdallah (third assistant), and
Ike Shorunmu (fourth assistant) will assist him (goalkeeper trainer).

The 62-year-old will make his debut during the Super Eagles' forthcoming trip of the United
States, where they will play friendly against Mexico and Ecuador. On May 28, the Eagles will try
on El Tri at AT & T Stadium in Dallas before travelling to Harrison, New Jersey, on June 2 to
face Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena. In December 2021, the 62-year-old was named Gernot
Rohr's permanent replacement. After the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, the NFF reversed its
decision.

Following Rohr's dismissal just days before Afcon 2021, Eguavoen was tasked with leading the
three-time African champions to Cameroon.
