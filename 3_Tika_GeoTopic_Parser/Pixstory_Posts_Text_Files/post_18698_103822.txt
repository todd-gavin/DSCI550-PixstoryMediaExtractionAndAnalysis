Very very soon and Ivan Pericis will be a Tottenham player The Inter midfielder has already undergone his medical in London and apparently has already signed a two-year contract and not a three-year contract as Perisic was rumored so he is leaving Inter Milan after disputed matches goals scored assists and trophies won This season was more decisive than any other and it is no coincidence that Inter lost important points for the Scudetto when the Croatian was absent The player took his leave and thanked everyone via social networks My adventure at Inter ends here Even if every end marks a new beginning, it is important to look back on these past years and share with you my sincere pride in the work done and the goals achieved together. It was an unforgettable experience that gave so much to me as a player and to my whole family. To the team to the staff to all the employees but above all to the fans you will always have a special place in my heart I leave feeling honored to have been part of this club With many emotions in my heart I leave you saying an infinite joy that lasts a lifetime Pazza Inter amala
