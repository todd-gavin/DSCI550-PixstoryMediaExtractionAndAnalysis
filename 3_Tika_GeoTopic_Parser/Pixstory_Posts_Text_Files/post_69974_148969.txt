Self compassion also means forgiving yourself Forgiving yourself for the times you disappointed yourself for the times you were in the wrong for the times you feel like you weren t enough for the things you said out of anger for the past mistakes you ve made for the times you could have been more empathetic for the times you ve realised you were the toxic one for the lessons you learnt a little too late for the times you didn t stand up for yourself Not that you won t try to do better next time but also stop blaming and Shaming yourself over and over again Better use that energy for support yourself in growth
