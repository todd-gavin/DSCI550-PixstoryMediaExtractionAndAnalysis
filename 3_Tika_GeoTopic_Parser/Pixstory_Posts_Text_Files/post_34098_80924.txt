In view of the match against Empoli Walter Mazzarri returned to speak at the press conference presenting the challenge after the good victory at Atalanta in the previous round against Empoli we suffered a lot from the revelation of the championship but we must not think that tomorrow&#39;s match will be simpler than the one in Bergamo the worst game that could happen to us now they play well they always triple a strong and well-trained team with no problems in the standings But we mustn&#39;t think that after Atalanta it&#39;s all downhill because just the opposite Then the rossoblu coach spoke of modules absences and new additions We have several strikers who can allow us to develop our fundamental game well having many important ones in such an athletic football Joao and Gaston can easily coexist but if the team allows me we can also see three strikers It all depends on the state in form with balance and always scoring one more goal than the others Keita is back brilliant and loaded also from a moral point of view in the group I saw him really happy he can be an important resource from now to the end Obert doesn&#39;t put me in difficulty on the contrary they are welcome the players who cause me problems I make my choices after Sunday and after the weekly work So far a bet has won a starter like the others Lovato Better not to talk about it anymore already too much in the spotlight But a speech that applies to everyone Credits photo cagliaricalcio com
