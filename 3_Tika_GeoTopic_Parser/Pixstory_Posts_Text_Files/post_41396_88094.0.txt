Kenny Payne made it plain that he will require assistance as he enters his first head coaching position at Louisville. 

Payne was announced as the Cardinals' men's basketball coach on Friday, and he was given a six-year deal to manage the school through 2027-28. The deal was authorised by the University of Louisville Athletic Association on Friday morning. Financial terms were not available right away. 

U.S News reported that former Cardinals player Payne was among the familiar faces during a packed news conference at the KFC Yum! Center, which included Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum and numerous former teammates he referred to as "brothers."

Payne, flanked by his family, including son Zan, a Kentucky player, requested everyone in the room to stand and stated that he would like their input. 

"I don't have all the solutions," Payne admitted, "but I know what I have to do is take this job and try to assist in the construction of the answers." I am a single individual. I'm not going to stand here alone any longer. "I'm not standing alone here." 

Payne, 55, is the first Black head coach in Louisville history, and he returns to his alma university after nearly two seasons as an assistant coach with the NBA's New York Knicks. He also worked for rival Kentucky's John Calipari for ten years and Oregon for five.
