A tiger's tongue is adorned in a plethora of papillae, or small, pointed, hook-shaped projections that face the back. The reason the tongue is rough, raspy, is to help peel the feathers, fur, and meat from prey. A tiger's tongue is as rough as sandpaper, as it is with all felines. They resemble a rough surface covered in thousands of tiny teeth that feel like a hairbrush. They are like hair in some ways because they are formed of keratin, the same protein that makes up our fingernails.
Additionally, the tiger often uses the papillae on its tongue as a brush to remove dirt and blood from fur, whether it is an individual's own fur or that of its offspring, especially when it licks its paws, chest, and other body regions.
