That being said, Manchester City have still looked very dominant thisseason which was highlighted in 4-0 and 6-0 wins against newly promoted sides
Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest, respectively. Erling Haaland has been the one to stealall the headlines, scoring 10 goals already in the Premier League. Manchester City are only
going to get more and more dominant as the season proceeds and they will undoubtedly
finish in the top four.
Liverpool are one of the teams who have had a dramatic start to the season, to say the least.
The Reds have only won two games so far and sit 7th in the table. However, even with thispoor start it's hard to imagine Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool side missing out on top four. IfLiverpool are able to string a chain of wins before the break for the World Cup they shouldreassert their aura and secure a top four spot. On the other hand, if they continue this shakyform then they could find themselves potentially missing out which would have beenunthinkable before the season started, though that is unlikely.
That leaves one spot open and several teams fighting for it. Chelsea recently sackedThomas Tuchel after the Blues lost to Dinamo Zagreb. This makes it hard to predict howChelsea will perform under a new manager. Manchester United will also be looking for a topfour finish after missing out last season. The Manchester side sit in 5th place and have hadan impressive run of form under Erik ten Hag. However, there appear to be a lot ofbackstage issues at the club between the board, fans and star players unhappy with theirposition in the squad such as Cristiano Ronaldo. This is why I believe Antonio Conte'sTottenham Hotspur side will take the remaining Champions League spot. Spurs are currentlyonly a point off first place and have been playing much better football under Antonio Contethis season. With players like Harry Kane, Richarlison and Ivan Perisic shining, Spurs lookset for a third consecutive top four finish.
