Edgar Allan Poe – A Dream Within A Dream 

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or a day,
In a vision, or none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

This poem can be considered a forerunner of inception! Edgar Allen Poe dealt with dreams. This poem of uncertainty is a puzzle and a half, with the protagonist grasping the strings of reality. It’s almost the literary text of The Matrix, and, like many of Edgar Allen Poe’s literary efforts, it’s ingenious. 

The poem portrays the unrest felt by the narrator as he watches the important things in life slip away. Knowing he cannot hold on to even one grain of sand, he has led to his final question of whether all things are just a dream.
It has been implied that the "golden sand" referenced in the 15th line signifies that which is to be found in an hourglass, accordingly time itself. Another interpretation holds that the expression elicits an image derived from the 1848 finding of gold in California. The latter interpretation seems unlikely, however, given the presence of the four, almost identical, lines describing the sand in another poem "To ——," which is considered as a blueprint for "A Dream Within a Dream" and preceding its publication by two decades.
