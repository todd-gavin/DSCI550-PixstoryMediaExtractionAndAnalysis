A verified account on Instagram , viralbhayani posted about Dr Govind Nandakumar, gastroenterology surgeon, stuck in traffic on the Sarjapur-Marathahalli stretch on his way to Manipal Hospital, Sarjapur where he was scheduled to perform a emergency laparoscopic gallbladder surgery on August 30. The doctor didnâ€™t take a chance and ran 3 kilometers to the hospital to save his patient. We all know a perforated gall bladder can even lead to death . Hats off and salute for such dedication
