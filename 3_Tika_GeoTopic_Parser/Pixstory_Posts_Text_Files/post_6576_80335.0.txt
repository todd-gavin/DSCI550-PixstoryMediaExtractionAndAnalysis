Violence has spread to several districts in Karnataka amid colleges prohibiting students to attend classes wearing hijabs and the government backing the ban. As Muslim students protest against the ban and Hindu students, several instigated by right-wing outfits, organise counter-protests, the violence has intensified.

After multiple videos depicting Hindu students heckling and harassing Muslims amid chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ came to light, a 27-second clip of a young woman in a half-conscious state being attended by a group of people has been shared online. It has been claimed that she was a “victim of stone-pelting clashes” that took place in Karanataka over the Hijab row.

The video is extremely viral on Twitter with various captions.

The video is viral on Facebook with the same claim.

Misleading
The video is from a government college in Rabkavi Banhatti, a small town in Bagalkot city, Karnataka. According to journalists on the ground, the girl was unwell, exhausted and had nearly fainted after which she was carried out of the campus by people present in the vicinity.

We performed a Twitter keyword search to check for reports of stone-pelting in Banhatti and found that 10 people were arrested for pelting stones on cops and students at a government college. As per a report by The Hindu, a male student had sustained minor injuries when unidentified miscreants started pelting stones at the college.

Alt News spoke with the principal of the government college in Rabkavi Banhatti who told us that no students were injured within the campus. He further added that the college started at 7:30 am and she (the student in the viral video) was attending classes purportedly on an empty stomach. She fainted on the campus ground.
