Gently wash your face at least twice a day. Use a gentle, alcohol-free, nonfoaming cleanser on your face twice a day and after sweating. 

While your skin is still damp, apply topical medication, wait a few minutes (see medication packaging for specifics), and then apply your moisturizer. If you use cosmetics, consider selecting cream or oil-based products. Apply moisturizer several times a day, especially when your skin feels dry and after handwashing or bathing while your skin is still moist. 

If nonfacial skin is dehydrated, you might want to use a thicker moisturizer (Eucerin, Cetaphil, others) or an oil, such as baby oil. Fat has more staying power than lotions and prevents the evaporation of water from the skin's surface. 

Use warm water and limit bath time. Long showers or baths and hot water remove your skin's natural oils. Limit bathing to no more than once a day and no longer than 5-10 minutes. Use warm, not hot, water.

Try a nonsoap cleansing cream or shower gel in the shower or bath, and use soap only in areas where needed, such as the armpits and groin. Avoid loofahs and pumice stones. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry.

Use a humidifier. Hot, dry, indoor air can parch sensitive skin and worsen itching and flaking. 
For laundry, use detergents without dyes or perfumes, which can irritate your skin. These products usually have the word "free" in their names.
