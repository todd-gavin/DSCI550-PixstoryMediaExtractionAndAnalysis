One of the most interesting and visual impact moments of the last Grammy ceremony was undoubtedly the one that involved the icon Donatella Versace Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion intent on presenting the award for best emerging artist they realize they are dressed in the same way Then at that moment a phantasmagoric Donatella Versace takes the stage and with two skilful moves changes the clothes of the two singers making them unique in its kind and then before leaving she says satisfied These are my girls The curtain a remake of the moment experienced at the VMAs years ago by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey Both stars wore a long brown dress by Vera Wang but then it was they themselves who changed the clothes years later we are happy to see Donatella regardless of what she says or does because she is still more than then an unrivaled icon
