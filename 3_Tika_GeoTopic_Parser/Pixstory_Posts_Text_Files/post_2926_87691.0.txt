The writing on the wall has been there for months now. It's been almost 7 months since the Taliban took over the reins of Afghanistan and the warnings from international agencies that the country could mass starvation could be coming true. 

A World Bank report says that food security in Afghanistan has worsened, with 70 percent of households in the country not covering food and non-food needs this year. It was 35 percent last year. The report says that both urban and rural areas are facing the problem. What is compounding the situation is high unemployment. The report released on March 15 was prepared after a household survey to assess changes in the basic living conditions in the early days of the Taliban rule.

The report says that almost half of households reported a decline in the number of meals consumed each day. The number is far higher than the previous quarter. 

The United Nations has said that the world should not ignore the humanitarian crisis facing Afghanistan and that it should engage with the Taliban. This has been reiterated by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, who is on a four day visit to Afghanistan. Grandi has referred to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that it must not make the world forget Afghanistan.

Ignoring Afghanistan could have other consequences too for the world. For instance, Tamim Asey, executive chairman of Kabul's Institute of War and Peace Studies has told DW that "a lack of international interest" in Afghanistan's crisis could mean that terror groups may again rear their head and pose a risk to international community.
