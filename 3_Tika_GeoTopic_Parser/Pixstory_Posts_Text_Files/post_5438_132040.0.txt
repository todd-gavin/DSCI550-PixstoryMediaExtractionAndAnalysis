So Kanye west yet take another drastic step in the fashion world And this time you wouldn’t have imagined what he did.  
So would you buy clothes which are inside construction bags aka trash bags in malls ?? or would you buy it off some fancy display ??? 

If you are a short person like me i would say the construction bags are a real deal and to display street fashion in such way is a genius idea but many people are against it as it is consuming more time to find them their size but i think that’s the fun part at least according to Kanye
