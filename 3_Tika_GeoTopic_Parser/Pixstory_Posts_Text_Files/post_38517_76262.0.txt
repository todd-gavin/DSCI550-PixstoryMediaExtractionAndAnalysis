Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony,rhythm, and timbre. Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But there's no line to art.🎵🎶🎼🎼
