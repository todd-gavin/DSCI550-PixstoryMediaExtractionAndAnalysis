World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) boss Vince McMahon, claims that he will retire in a flurry of misconduct lawsuits. 

Last month he stepped down from his roles in WWE  following reports he paid millions to suppress allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity. Mr. McMahon remains WWE's majority shareholder.

He has led WWE for decades, often occurring as a performer in the ring. In a statement that did not mention the allegations against him, Mr. McMahon said he has the "deepest appreciation and admiration for our generations of fans all over the world".

"Our global audience can take comfort in knowing WWE will continue to entertain you with the same fervor, dedication, and passion as always," the 77-year-old said.

"My thanks to our community and business partners, shareholders, and Board of Directors for their guidance and support through the years. Then. Now. Forever. Together."
