After six weeks of campaigning and about national polls the Coalition s position looks to have improved but not by as much as it would have hoped According to the ABC s average of national polls Labor currently has about per cent support down from per cent on the day the election was called If that figure turned out to be the election result on Saturday Labor would expect to be in the box seat to form government It means that to win on Saturday the government will be hoping the national polls have an error even bigger than last election and that it has successfully managed to sandbag key marginal seats Through the campaign the ABC has been averaging the polls using a model developed by Professor Simon Jackman from The University of Sydney It uses what we know about their sample sizes and margins of error to also calculate a margin of error for the average It averages the results of the five pollsters conducting national polls YouGov Galaxy Essential Resolve Ipsos and Roy Morgan The result is not a prediction of the election outcome but an effort to interpret the existing published polling The lines in the polling average chart show the trendline generated by the model while the shaded regions represent the margins of error on this trend
