Contributing to the support of oncological research in Italy to make cancer increasingly curable by investing in the training of young scientific talents and in human capital is the objective of the collaboration between the AIRC Foundation and the CDP Foundation, thanks to which one million euro is allocated to support projects by two female scientists active in Southern Italy Francesca Pisani of the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the National Research Council of Naples IBBC CNR and Clelia Tiziana Storlazzi of the University of Bari Aldo Moro The female researchers will each receive a grant of approximately 1,000 euros over the of five years during which technical checks of the ongoing activities will also take place. The resources will be used to support the purchase of scientific instruments and research personnel costs, in addition to the experimental activity, with the aim of achieving new methods of cancer diagnosis and treatment. were selected thanks to the international peer review method which consists in the evaluation of scientific merit by independent reviewers chosen among the leading experts in national and international oncology In detail the first study coordinated by the molecular biologist Francesca Pisani Research Director at the Institute of Biochemistry and Cellular Biology of the National Research Council of Naples IBBC CNR and focused on the role of a specific enzyme called DNA helicase FANCJ and related mutations. In people who are carriers, these mutations increase the risk of developing ovarian tumors and breast Cancer of the breast is the most widespread neoplasm by far not only in Italy while that of the ovary, even if rarer, is still difficult to cure The second project conducted by the biologist Clelia Tiziana Storlazzi associate professor of Genetics at the University of Bari Aldo Moro The aim of the study is to investigate the molecular characteristics of pulmonary microcytoma, a disease that is still very difficult to cure
