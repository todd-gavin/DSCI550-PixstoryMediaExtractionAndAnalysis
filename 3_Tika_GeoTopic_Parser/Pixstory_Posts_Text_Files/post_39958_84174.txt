Sponge cake Simple Sponge Cake is made with a few pantry staples This sponge cake is often used to build stacked cakes although it can also be served plain Soft spongy and incredibly tasty Any baker whether new to baking or not should have this recipe in their arsenal This was one of the first Yellow Sponge Cake recipes I learnt to make and it has shown to be extremely reliable It s in a lot of my cake recipes It s well liked for its lovely texture ease of preparation and flawless instructions Pro Tips for the best sponge cake Make sure to whip the eggs well The cake relies mostly on the volume of the eggs for the fluffiness so whipping the eggs until a thick ribbon flows off the whisk and doesn t disappear for seconds is very important Not whipping the eggs enough not only will yield a dense cake but will also give off an eggy taste in the finished product Sift the dry ingredients before adding to the whipped eggs as this ensures there are no clumps of flour in the finished cake Sifting also aerates the flour which will give you a light and fluffy sponge cake Do not overfold folding too aggressively or too much will deflate the cake and will yield a denser cake So fold carefully to preserve the aeration built by whipping the eggs Even rise for an even rise of the cake make sure to use baking strips like the ones here These strips are wet fastened around the baking pan before baking ensuring that the cake cooks from the bottom up instead of from the bottom and the sides This prevents the formation of an unsightly dome on the baked cakes Do not overbake or too much moisture will be lost and the sponge cake will be dry I have provided both recipes with egg and egress procedure stays the same mix ingredients with proper measure and follow the procedure above Please let me know your doubts in notes Cheers
