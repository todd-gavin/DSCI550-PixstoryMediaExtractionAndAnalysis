Multiple sources reported on Sunday that Neymar is looking to leave Paris Saint Germain in the summer. The Brazilian winger joined PSG from Barcelona in 2017 for a transfer fee of €222m. Since joining, Neymar has scored 100 goals for the French outfit in 144 games in all competitions. 

Though Neymar has been an integral part of PSG's success in France, the Brazilian has failed to lift the UEFA Champions League trophy for his club. The Brazilian had admitted that it was his "dream" to win the UCL with PSG! However, The QSI (PSG's owners) are allegedly being in complete agreement that the Brazilian should leave the club this summer.

 PSG president Al Khelaifi talked about Neymar recently. He said, "A possible departure of Neymar this summer? What I can tell you is that we expect all players to do a lot more than last season. A lot more! They all have to be 100%. Obviously, we weren’t good enough to go far. For next season, the objective is clear: to work every day at 200%. To give everything we have for this jersey, give the maximum and we will see the result. You have to become humble again. You have to change to avoid injuries, suspensions, and fouls that change a game."

Neymar reportedly felt targeted by this statement as per News 18. Hence this is being touted as one of the reasons for his potential departure this summer.
