Not many tourists are familiar with the name Astanmarg. Even some of the people I spoke to in Srinagar didn't know where it was. However the view it offered is what really piqued my interest. 
It was certainly a magnificent experience to be standing at Astanmarg in the evening and watching the sun set. It is one of Srinagar's top vistas and a must-see location for everyone travelling to Kashmir.
It is not among Srinagar's top attractions, so not many people travel in that direction. It will mostly be locals from Srinagar or any of the surrounding villages that you may encounter up there. 
Astanmarg is thus the ideal location for anyone looking to spend some time away from the crowds while soaking in a view that will live long in your memories.
