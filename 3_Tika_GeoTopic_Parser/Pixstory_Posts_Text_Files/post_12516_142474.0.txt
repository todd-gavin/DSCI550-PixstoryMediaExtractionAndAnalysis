In last few years we are much familiar with the term postpartum depression and when does this usually occur? 
It mostly occurs within 6 weeks after giving birth. But now according to the newest edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR), PPD can also occur to a person who is pregnant. Any new episode of depression which begins during the pregnancy period or within 4 weeks of delivery can be stated as PPD. 
Therapists and the medical professionals would use broader categories to define PPD. This is because many people needs help especially during the stressful postpartum period. 
The fact that PPD happens within a short time after delivery means that a person will not be able to notice their symptoms straight away. Some of the people mistakenly attribute their symptoms to sleep deprivation, stress and hormonal changes. 
And when they don't seek help for weeks or months, it could worsen the condition of the mother. Therefore it is important for a person to know that they do not need to deal it in silence. 
Some of the early warning signs of postpartum depression and they include: 
• Feeling low or sad most of the time 
• Being unable to feel the joy or pleasure 
• Having symptoms similar to depression 
• Facing difficulty in having a bond with the baby 
• Having several thoughts of self harm
