Enter the Dragon: Chinese Invasion 
of Tibet continues...

On 6 March, 2008, President President Hu Jintao stated: ‘The stability in Tibet concerns the stability of the country, and the safety in Tibet concerns the safety of the country.’ He added that the Chinese leadership must ensure the well-being of Tibetans, improve the work related to religions and ethnic groups, and maintain social harmony and stability. President Hu’s statement conforms to reality and we look forward to its implantation.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my pride in and appreciation for the sincerity, courage and determination of the Tibetan people inside Tibet. I urge them to continue to work peacefully and within the law to ensure that all the minority nationalities of the People’s Republic of China, including the Tibetan people, enjoy their legitimate rights and benefits.

The increasing Western interest in Tibet, in Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama, also appears to be going against Tibetans, as it makes the PRC harden its attitude towards Tibet.
