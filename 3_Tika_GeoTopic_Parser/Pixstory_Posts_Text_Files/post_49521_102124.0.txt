I enjoy country music, a lot! Everything you said about the beauty of those songs is spot on and I was furiously agreeing with it, until I read the last part. That alone turned my support post into a challenge. People don't hate country music because it comes from America. Almost all genres of music are made in America, so that claim is kind of bull.

Country music is still largely associated with white, southern cowboy culture. We can discuss aspects of the genre that have progressed beyond cowboy boots and pickup trucks, but if you look at the chart toppers, concert attendance, and country music media in general, you'll see the repeating patterns. The traditional gender roles about a girl that is "not like other girls" who makes a good wife and a mother, makes you breakfast and doesn't put on makeup. Heavily patriotic and even religiously patriotic. Always excluding of queer identities.

Country is still music made primarily for a straight white man when you dig deeper. People don't usually enjoy that. As women get more conscious about the kind of media they consume, they tend to drop those that treat them like inferior beings. Same with queer people. People enjoy raw emotions, which country music serves plenty but people don't exactly enjoy it at the expense of their own identity.
