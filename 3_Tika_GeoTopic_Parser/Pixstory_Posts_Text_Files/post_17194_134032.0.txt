Akshay Kumar and Arshad Warsi are going to be the part of Jolly LLB 3 and the cherry on the cake is that both the Jolly’s will have a face off in the movie and will be starring opposite each other in the court of law. 👨‍⚖️👨‍⚖️

The reports even suggest that the script phase of the film is almost finished and the makers are now heading towards the further stages of the film. A source reveals, “The idea is to create the ambience of a big screen courtroom drama and hence, efforts have been taken to make it a multi-junior film, with the right blend of humor with drama and print finishing touches are being given to the script at the moment.” ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥

Jolly LLB 3’s shooting is expected to be started by the first half of 2023 making it to the release after that. 🎬🎥🎥
