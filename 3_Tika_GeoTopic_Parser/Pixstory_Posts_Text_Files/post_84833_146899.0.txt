Alonso had the world at his feet and demonstrated his feature in Liverpool, winning numerous individual awards. Alonso left Liverpool for Real Madrid in 2009 after making 210 appearances for the club.




3 Dietmar Hamann
Hamann quickly became a household name at Liverpool, where he appeared in 191 games. He was an underappreciated player who could play any position from the centre of the field. He was a key figure in the club's triumph over adverse circumstances in the 2005 Champions League.

2 Jamie Redknapp 
Redknapp, one of the best passers of the ball, had players on the floor with his ability to pull anything into his vision. He played for Liverpool for a decade and shone in every game as if it were his last. Despite playing for Liverpool for ten years, he only made 400 appearances due to injuries that forced him to sit out the majority of his career.
Regardless, he was an accurate shooter with scintillating striking ability who could find the top-corner from 35-yards or find his target with his power-full right-foot and range did not matter from where he was releasing the ball.
1 Steven Gerrard
And we finish with the one and only Steven Gerrard, a specialist and a great operator from the area. Gerrard stayed at Liverpool for 17 years, becoming not only the ideal midfielder in the club's history, but also their finest player of all time. However, he joined the club at a time when they were struggling in the league, but in Europe, Liverpool reached three Champions League finals, two of which they won.
Gerrard imbued essentially everything as a midfielder, including physical strength, tactical intelligence, and shooting ability. His penchant for scoring from seemingly anywhere earned him praise from many world-class midfielders. The midfielder appeared in 504 Premier League games, scoring 120 goals and assisting on 92 others.
