The population density. Overcrowding was never intended for Delhi.
A tiny number of people can live in each sector of the old city because of the way it was constructed. Everything is currently four times over capacity, including roads, markets, parks, education, recreation, parking, drinking water, sewage systems, power distribution, medical facilities, public transportation, police, housing, and the judicial system.
And this is encouraging widespread corruption among law enforcement, the judicial system, and all levels of government employees while also creating a paradise for private players who will stop at nothing to extort money from hard-working citizens under the guise of providing them with housing, drinking water, education, etc.
And if the City must maintain itself at this level of population density, it will have to pull down the outdated system and install a brand-new, cutting-edge system while taking into account the substantial population it must deal with.
