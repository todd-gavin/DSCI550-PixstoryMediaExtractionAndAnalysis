I saw some quotes saying A Woman is a sister mother daughter wife etc I am not denying any of it but definitely that s not my identity What am I Where am I What have I made myself of Should I be defined by my caste religion surname The financial status of my family Keeping that all aside I thought without all that who am I Am I proud of it I am a girl who changed from the most annoying person in the world to a much better version of herself I am proud of the values I put in life I am proud that I choose empathy over sympathy I am proud that I have become less judgemental in life I am proud of my achievements I am proud of my skills I am proud of the changes I have made in my home and I have made to my friends and one that I hope I will make in the society I am proud that I don t give up I am proud of my confidence roots from my self love and not what others think of me I am proud that I fought for my rights and still am fighting though it s getting hard I am not proud of my anger issues my mood swings my anxiety But I am never sorry unless I hurt someone I am what I am A whole package with flaws which I am trying to improve It might improve or maybe I will live with Whatever it is I love myself my body my eyes my height I love everything of mine So take time to analyse who you are what you want to be on this womens day Get motivated do what makes you happy As Albert Einstein said if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid So find who you are what you want You are special unique in your own way You don t need any surnames to make you complete as you yourself is complete Happy Womens Day
