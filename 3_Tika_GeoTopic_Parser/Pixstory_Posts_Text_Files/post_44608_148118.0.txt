The Forward Policy and 
‘Operation ONKAR’continues...
On 14th August, 1962, the Director Military Operations (DMO) at 
Army HQ, Brig. D.K. (‘Monty’) Palit, visited the 4 Infantry Division’s 
HQ at Tezpur. Till fairly recently himself the Commander of 7 Infantry 
Brigade, during its induction period into the Kameng Division and the 
Tawang sector, Monty Palit was the only person in the GS (Operations) 
branch of Army HQ who had any idea of the terrain, and of the practical 
difficulties involved in implementing ‘Op ONKAR’. The progress of ‘Op 
Onkar’ and the issues regarding the McMahon Line in the Namka ChuThagla Ridge area were discussed in Delhi. The Army HQ aim was to see how the forward deployments desired by the Prime Minister could be speeded up.
Mao’s own weakening position within the Chinese leadership was 
also a significant factor in the Chinese leadership’s decision to go to 
war. He wanted to re-assert himself, after he had been openly ciriticised 
in January 1962, by Chinese President Liu Shaoqi who denounced 
Mao’s ‘Great Leap Forward’ policy before a large party conference. Jung 
Chang writes that China began preparing for war in May or June 1962. 
As per Xu Yan, a prominent Chinese military historian and professor at the PLA’s National Defense University, by late September 1962, the 
Chinese leadership had begun to reconsider their policy of ‘armed 
coexistence’, which had failed to address their concerns with the 
10 forward policy and Tibet, and consider a large, decisive strike.
However, Mao and Dang had already decided on 25th March, 1959 to 
attack India in order to humiliate Nehru. Between that time and 1960, 
the PLA had been preparing for the eventual attack on India.
