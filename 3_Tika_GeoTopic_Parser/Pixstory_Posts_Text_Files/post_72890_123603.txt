I may be a little late posting this but I m sure my BuMu will understand once he gets the treats bribe BlueMoon or BuMu for short is a ginger cat I rescued in Since that fateful day in December my life has changed so much I m so grateful to have this little angel in my life Of course he can be a devil too but I wouldn t have it any other way I say I rescued him but honestly he rescued me too When I found him BuMu was covered in flees and half his whiskers were burnt off And when he found me I was feeling the effects of the pandemic of quarantining and the pressures of online classes My mental health was in a state of rapid decline When I first saw BuMu on the farm his eyes were the first thing I noticed I loved him right from then But then again I loved his siblings too It was when he climbed my shoulder and sat there for the entire day that I knew I had to take him home I cried reasoned with my parents for hours and skipped lunch all so that I could take this little munchkin home It was only when we were leaving that my parents gave in Probably because I refused to leave his side BuMu is my first official pet I ve rescued several cats feeding them and giving them shelter but I could never call them mine They would always leave after a few months My sister has had pets dogs and a hamster and I loved them dearly but again I could never call them mine BuMu brought light to our house His antics brighten up even the darkest of days Although my parents were reluctant at first they fell in love with him very quickly who wouldn t and they can t imagine life without him Whenever we come home he s always there to greet us with a meow He loves to snuggle with my mom be carried in my father s arms and he still hasn t stopped climbing my shoulder Adopt don t Shop
