According to a new study, antibiotics have become the leading cause of death worldwide and are killing around 3,500 people every day. More than 1.2 million people died in 2019 alone because of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. According to a study conducted by the Lancet journal covering over 204 countries, 1.2 million deaths are higher than the deaths caused by HIV/AIDS or malaria. ((https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(2102724-0/fulltext)

In addition to the deaths linked to Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the Lancet study also found that around 5 million people may have died because of causes linked to it, but the patients did not die directly of AMR.

According to the study devised by Mohsen Naghavi of the University of Washington in Seattle and his colleagues, the conclusion was drawn based on the medical records of 471 million people with antibiotic-resistant infections from 204 countries.

What is concerning is that AMR poses a higher threat to children. Around one in five deaths of children aged under five years of age was due to AMR.

This is not for the first time that antibiotics are considered a great threat. For instance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that approximately 2.8 million people worldwide are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, accounting for 35,000 deaths each year in the U.S. and 700,000 deaths around the globe. (https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/policy/110721/antibiotic-resistance-is-at-a-crisis-point) But the Lancet study takes it to a different level.

A 2019 joint report by the United Nations, World Health Organization and World Organization for Animal Health also estimated that drug-resistant diseases could cause 10 million deaths each year by 2050 and force up to 24 million people into extreme poverty by 2030.

The healthcare-related world organizations may have to make hard decisions before the situation goes out of control. For instance, the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) claimed that in the UK, one in five antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily and, in the U.S., it is one in three. The numbers are alarming. (https://www.tbsnews.net/thoughts/antibiotic-resistance-major-public-health-challenge-354640)
