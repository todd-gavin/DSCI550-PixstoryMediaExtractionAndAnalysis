When it comes to movies, I know I can trust Obamas and their recommendations blindly. One might even say that our taste in movies is similar: elite. Therefore, I am not surprised that Summer of Soul got the stamp of approval from Michelle Obama herself. 
For Roots drummer Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson, winning an Academy Award on his first try was pretty good. Getting praise from the former First Couple, on the other hand? The icing on the gravy cake.

As Billboard reported, Quest was congratulated by former First Lady Michelle Obama on Monday (March 28), who lauded the beat-keeper for winning the best documentary feature Oscar for Summer of Soul. 

“Congratulations, Questlove and the team at SummerOfSoul, for your #Oscar win!,” Obama tweeted. “Barack and I were so moved by this celebration of Black music, culture, and joy. What you did in telling this overlooked story is so important—and we are grateful for artists like you leading the way!” Quest responded with a big “(((HUG))),” clearly moved by the praise.

Summer of Soul tells the underappreciated storey of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which featured performances by Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly & the Family Stone, Mahalia Jackson, and other iconic 1960s artists, arguing that if it hadn't been a primarily Black festival, it would have been as well remembered and celebrated as Woodstock, which took place in New York the same year.
