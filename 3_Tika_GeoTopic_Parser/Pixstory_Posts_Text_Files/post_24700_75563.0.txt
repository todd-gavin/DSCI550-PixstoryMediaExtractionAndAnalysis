They have lost just 4 matches even if they won 6. In the last 5 matches, 4 draws and 1 win (2-1 win against West brom). 

Potter's Plans

English coach Graham Potter uses 4-1-2-1-2 formation, making a diamond at the centre of the field. Maupay is the regular forward with Trossard or Welbeck. He uses 22 year old Poland player Moder along with Mac Allister and Trossard in midfield. Experienced Adam Lallana and Bissouma are there to balance the team. Spaniard Sanchez stands as goal keeper. Sometimes used 4-2-3-1, team have conceded and scored 23 goals, Maupay being the top scorer with 7 goals. 

Potter has a flashback of bringing Swedish club Ostersund to UEFA Europa League knockout in 2016-17. Even though they have so many draws, it doesn't mean all were one sided games, sometimes deserved wins. They won against Brentford 1-0, with Trossard scoring at 90th minute.
