#3 Gerard Moreno (Villarreal)

In 2020-21, Villarreal striker Gerard Moreno enjoyed his finest season ever. Villarreal won the UEFA Europa League for the first time in club history, and Moreno was the star performer. In reality, he scored a goal against Manchester United in the final.

In 32 games in La Liga last season, the tall, lanky striker scored 23 goals and added six assists. After Lionel Messi, he was the second-highest goal scorer in La Liga (tied with Karim Benzema) in the 2020-21 season.

In five games in the continental tournament, he managed two assists, but none of his 15 tries resulted in a goal.

#2 Sergio Busquets (Barcelona)

Despite his age, Sergio Busquets is a steady presence in the middle of the field for both club and country. Busquets was a member of the Spanish teams that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2012 Euros.

Busquets is one of the most intellectual holding midfielders in the modern game, with excellent positioning and tactical awareness. The 33-year-old has a keen sense of the game and is adept at predicting plays and intercepting passes.

#1 Dani Olmo (RB Leipzig)

Barcelona is scouting RB Leipzig winger Dani Olmo. Olmo is a La Masia product who has made a name for himself since joining Dinamo Zagreb in 2014. He is now one of RB Leipzig's main attacking weapons, and he showcased his abilities at Euro 2020.

Olmo was praised for his performances in the continental competition, where he had three assists in five games. The left-footed winger is a technically proficient player whose pace, passing range, and shooting range make him an excellent final-third asset.
