Paris Saint Germain have reportedly entered the race to sign Robert Lewandowksi. As per Marca, "The French champions are looking to disruptÂ Barcelona's summer transfer plans, taking advantage of the instability of Lewandowski's position with Bayern Munich."

Robert Lewandowski has decided not to extend his contract with Bayern. The Polish international still has a year remaining in his contract. But as per reports, the striker is being closely monitored by Barcelona as they look to add him to their ranks. 

However, PSG are now said to have entered the fray for the 34-year-old striker as well. As per the report, "PSG believe that the arrival of the striker would add value to the squad and believe that he could be a great complement to their famed trio of Messi, Neymar, and Mbappe. In addition, they would bring in a player with a great ability to score goals.


Will this signal Neymar's departure? 

Robert Lewandowski's arrival could in turn signal Neymar's departure from the club. Rumours have suggested that the Brazilian could be on his way out in the summer. However, these allegations are still baseless.. however, if Lewandowski joins PSG, the French champions could be open to letting Neymar leave the club in the summer. 

Hence it has to be seen what PSG decides to do in the coming days.
