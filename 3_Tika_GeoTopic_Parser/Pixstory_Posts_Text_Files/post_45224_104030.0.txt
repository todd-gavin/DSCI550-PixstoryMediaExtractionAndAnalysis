Former Premier League icon Mesut Özil has spent the last year and a half quietly in the
shelters of the Turkish super league. Following a controversial end to his term at Arsenal, the
German left for Fenerbahçe. The Turkish side have always been the club of Özil's heart
since his childhood.

Albeit quietly, he's since lit up the Turkish league with his skill and often leaves local fans in
awe with his technique and vision. As of recent Özil has gone from being a loved and hailed
star to the centre of more controversies in Turkey. On the receiving end of internal issues
with club staff and hierarchy, he was tipped by many to terminate his current stay after being
left out of the squad post-March.

However unpopular, Özil refuses to grant the claims of his departure any validity.

"Recently, I have had to make a statement regarding the allegations made about my career. I
had completed my career goal by signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with Fenerbahce,
my childhood love, without even getting paid for the first six months." the German tweeted.

Özil reveals he hasn't been paid for his services since the turn of the year as he remains suspended from the team.

"I repeat with emphasis: I will not end my career in a team other than Fenerbahce. For the duration of my contract, my only goal is to wear our Cubuklu jersey. This decision is very
clear and final."

He seems keen on retirement, however he will respect the terms of his current contract.

"As per the requirements of professional life, if our management takes a decision about me, I
will only respect this attitude. I will work hard and always keep myself ready. As I always say,
the main thing is Fenerbahce. With my love and respect to the great Fenerbahce fans."
