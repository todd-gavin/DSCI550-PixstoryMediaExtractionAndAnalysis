The conversation between friends was actually very satisfying to read about and engage in Sally Rooney books always leave you with a an ending that you can have endless conclusion as to how it would have or should have continued The plots twist always keeps you on your toes as well as subtle details left in about characters that makes you change your views about them often Overall I loved it as always with a sally Rooney book
