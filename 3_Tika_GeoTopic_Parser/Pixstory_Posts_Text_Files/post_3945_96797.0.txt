Since its the month of spreading awareness on preventing sexual harassment let's talk about it. We know that it's just not one gender who faces these assaults, all genders are exposed to these assaults and its just that we don't get to know more about the assaults happening in the male and LGBTQA genders. 

Harassment just don't happen sexually or physically alone it affects one entirely. 

Well we all know this is not right and we need to speak up when the harassment takes place, but time freezes us when it happens, we hate the moment, the cloth that we wore and everything associated to that time. The amount of PTSD faced by the survivors is immense and they really don't understand it until a point when they start observing the traumatic affects in their daily life. 

It's high time to call off the name calling in a funnier manner which is never funny, commenting with a laughÂ  under the name of "joke", sugared cringe talks and the list can go on.
