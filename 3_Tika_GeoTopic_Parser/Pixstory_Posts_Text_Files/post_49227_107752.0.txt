Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger"
I'm fairly confident everybody has sung this song on the top of their lungs at some point – e even if it's inside your bathroom. You still have a lot of experiences ahead of you if it hasn't happened yet. The strength and cunning of a wild jungle cat will fortify you with this music. Within your head. Isn't that the only thing that matters?

Eminem's "Not Afraid"
You don't have to be alone all of the time in life. You can overcome any obstacle in life if you have your loved ones by your side. This song encourages you to take action and help others. Similarly, offering someone your support could make their day better, so why not?

Kenny Loggins' "Danger Zone"
It's impossible not to visualise oneself walking in slow motion away from an explosion while this song is playing, which is why it was featured in the movie Top Gun. Let that explosion happen.
