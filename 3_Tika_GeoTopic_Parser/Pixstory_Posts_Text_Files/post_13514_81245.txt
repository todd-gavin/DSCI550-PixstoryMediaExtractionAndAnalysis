I do not understand some love and affection But because of my people who celebrate today with excitement every year friends family honorable couples parents in Kabul they leave the house for a moment of joy and to forget their sorrow under the pretext of Valentine s Day But this year loving is a crime a crime that bury the prison behind the stairs in darkness and silence forever I wrote this poem for my Afghan lovers maybe it is a little and meaningless Beyond every year Kabul And within every youth heart Inside the garden of Babar Shah Beautiful roses In the ambush of lovers To a server from the heart You Sit With Love And Friend And laugh like a flower And eager acceleration And kharaman because every day Full of vivacity Open your arms and hold Fresh air You are in your arms And leave it to the breeze And speak from the heart I love to the end of this black land Dear Kablian
