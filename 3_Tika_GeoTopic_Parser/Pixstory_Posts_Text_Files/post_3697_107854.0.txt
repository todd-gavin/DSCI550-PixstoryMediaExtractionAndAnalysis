The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity has announced that the entries from India for the Cannes Lions Awards are up 32% YoY, with the country’s top entered Lions including Health & Wellness, Direct and Film. The total number of entries from India is 921 in comparison to last year’s 699. 

The awards were paused in 2020 due to the global pandemic. In 2019, India sent 1,053 entries for Cannes Lions. However, the number of entries in 2022 is still 12.5% less than the 2019 levels. 

The Cannes Lions Awards has received a total of 25,464 entries from 87 countries this year.

Across the globe, entries from LATAM are up 12% YoY which is led by a strong YoY increase from Brazil of 31%, indicative of increased momentum after the country’s three Grands Prix wins last year and its consistently retained position as the third-ranked most creative country in the World. There have also been 402 entries from Ukraine which have been accepted free of charge and demonstrate the country’s commitment to creativity. 

Simon Cook, CEO, Lions, said, “This is always such a pivotal moment for us because the work entered provides a compelling insight into the global creative marketing landscape. Over the coming days at the Festival, our juries will curate a body of work worthy of Lions and set the global benchmark that will propel us into the year ahead.”

In their first year, the Creative B2B Lions have received 415 entries, which breaks down as 269 entries into the Services category and 146 into the Products category. 

Entries have come from 188 companies including from: Siemens Munich; Meta São Paulo; Indeed Austin; Intuit Quickbooks London; National Australia Bank; Amadeus Madrid; LTI Mumbai; Salesforce San Francisco; CMPC Santiago; and Azgard Nine Limited Lahore.
