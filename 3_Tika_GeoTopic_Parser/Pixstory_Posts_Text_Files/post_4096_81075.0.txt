(Continuation) The most stunning factor of the story is the homosexual relationship between Celie and Shug. Shug helps Celie understand herself, Celie is uneducated and full of superstitions unlearned with her experiences. The men in the novel also repent in their behaviour.  

Moreover, there is also a part in the novel that talks about colonisation and the loss of African Tradition in Africa through Celie's Sister Nettie. Also, the Character called Adam who is Celie's child marries an African Girl named Tashi. The most enduring factor is that following an African tradition, Tashi undergoes the painful rites of female circumcision and facial scarring. In solidarity with her, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual. 

The book gives so much hope to live and gives us the idea of how it is possible to make changes in life at any age. Each and every character in the novel had achieved the way they want to live their life through a lot of struggles. It is sad because women, the LGBTQ+ community always want to fight for their basic needs which men take for granted. Talking about women and feminism we often ignore the level of suppression faced. Coloured women face more suppression than White-Woman, similarly struggles faced by members of the LGBTQ+ community is on another level. For example In India, suppression faced by a member of the so-called 'lower caste' who is also LGBTQ+ could extremely different or even worse than others. They might experience dual suppression. The book addresses this phenomenon through African-American women. I recommend everyone to read this book as it might be what you are looking for, the change in your life.
