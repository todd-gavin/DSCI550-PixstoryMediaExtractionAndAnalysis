Atiya Azimi was up all night packing and repacking her bag, feverish at returning to school for the first time since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. The joy was shockingly brief. 

In the middle of a lesson, just hours after the school reopened, she learned the hardline Islamists had revoked permission for girls to study.

Suddenly we were told to leave until another order is issued," said Azimi, who was returning to grade 12 at Zarghona Girls School in the capital Kabul.

What have we done wrong? Why should women and girls face this situation? I ask the Islamic Emirate to start our classes."

"I did not sleep the whole night thinking about going back to school again," she told AFP.

Secondary school age girls have been out of education for around a year in many provinces.

Schools were first closed under the previous US-backed government as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, and after the Taliban took power the new rulers reopened all schools for boys.

But girls were allowed to return only to primary schools and were banned from secondary institutions in most areas.

The Islamists claimed that schools needed to be adapted so girls and boys could be segregated, despite the vast majority in conservative Afghanistan already operating separate classrooms. 

The Taliban's education ministry days ago announced that girls' secondary schools would reopen for the start of the new academic year on Wednesday. 

But an 11th hour U-turn by the Taliban leadership was a devastating blow for students, parents and even teachers.
