Went to Urban punjab in Murthal with my friends. And I think its an amazing place to dine in with your friends and family. They serves  tasty lip smacking food, I had a tandoori sizzler which had malai chaap, kabab, mushrooms, paneer tikka etc with shakes also had their spl.Thali that too was super delicious. Its so affordable- 600 for two approx. And the ambiance is amazing you can enjoy and click wonderful pictures there also the staff is so nice.
