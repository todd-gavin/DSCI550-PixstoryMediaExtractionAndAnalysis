Angere protestors today set fire to the home of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, signalling a worsening crisis on the island nation. Just a short while ago, demonstrators marched into the White House to call for Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation.
The demonstrators were observed causing damage to the prime minister's vehicles.

The Lankan Prime Minister's Office reported that protesters had broken into Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's home and set it on fire.

The 22 million-person country is suffering from a severe foreign exchange shortage that has restricted imports of fuel, food, and medication, throwing its economy into the greatest financial upheaval it has experienced in seven decades.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is often blamed for the nation's collapse. His resignation has been demanded since March in largely peaceful demonstrations.

As the cash-strapped nation ceased receiving fuel shipments, causing school closures and rationing of gasoline and diesel for key services, discontent has been worse recently.
