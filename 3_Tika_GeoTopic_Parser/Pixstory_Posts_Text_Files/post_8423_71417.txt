 THE RIGHT IS BACK Val rie P cresse solemnly announced after securing the conservatives nomination in the French presidential election slated for April She now stands as the last hope for a party in deep trouble France s conventional right The Republicans never redeemed from its ruinous defeat in when for the first time in nearly years it failed to qualify for the final round of a presidential race But after P cresse s unexpected victory over four other contenders in a primary last month and she becoming the centre right s first ever female presidential candidate the party s chances have dramatically improved The year old career politician describes herself as two thirds Angela Merkel and one third Margaret Thatcher I am a woman who consults decides and acts she says Five years back Macron used his youth to present himself as the embodiment of change Now with a female nominee the Republicans hope to show they eventually got the memo on gender equality Her being chosen as the conservative candidate is a sign of modernity in a country that has had male presidents said Geoffroy Didier her campaign s director Her biggest task now is to patch up a party that s split between moderates and hard liners on issues such as immigration the place of Islam in French society and economic policies She must also bring back the many Republican voters that have been siphoned away by Macron on one hand and by the far right on the other P cresse is also nodding to the far right on France EU relations an issue her party has long maintained a certain ambiguity for Last fall amid a row between Brussels and Poland over whether EU law trumps member states constitutions P cresse backed the supremacy of national constitutional identities She manages to get people with shared values but very different sensibilities to work together which brightens her chances against others but French presidential campaigns are notoriously unpredictable so it s still a long road less travelled for Valerie before she makes history
