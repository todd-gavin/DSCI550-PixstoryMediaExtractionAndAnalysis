By NewsDrum Desk Mysuru (Karnataka): Hundreds of people raised pro-Congress slogans as party leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday addressed them amid heavy rains and asserted that nothing can "stop us to unite the country" through the ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra.Soon after Gandhi arrived at the venue for the public meeting on the outskirts of Mysuru, a sudden burst of rain greeted him and the gathering.As the Wayanad MP chose to continue his speech, the crowds cheered for him, even as many were seen holding up chairs to ward off the torrential rain."This journey will continue from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and will not stop. It is raining, but the showers have not stopped this yatra. Heat, storm, cold can't stop this yatra."This river-like journey will persist and in this river you will not find any trace of hate or violence. There will only be love and brotherhood as this is India's history and DNA," Gandhi told the gathering.Earlier, during the day, Gandhi walked for over 10 kilometres from Badanavalu to Mysuru and was welcomed by a beeline of bystanders on both sides of the road. The police were seen struggling to manage the crowd and maintain order amid Congress supporters beating drums in their leader's welcome.While roadsides were dotted with young people eager to catch a glimpse of the Congress leader, women were seen on the terrace of their houses to watch Gandhi.At the venue of the public meeting in Mysuru later, the Congress leader said nothing can deter the Bharat Jodo Yatra which was aimed at "stopping hatred and violence spread by the BJP-RSS".On a day the Enforcement Directorate issued summons to Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar for appearance on October 7 in the National Herald case, Gandhi told the Mysuru gathering, "No matter how much hate and violence the BJP spreads, this yatra will achieve its goal and will unite people."Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/national/nothing-can-stop-us-to-unite-india-rahul-gandhi-at-mysuru-rally-amid-heavy-rains-as-crowd-cheers-97434.html
