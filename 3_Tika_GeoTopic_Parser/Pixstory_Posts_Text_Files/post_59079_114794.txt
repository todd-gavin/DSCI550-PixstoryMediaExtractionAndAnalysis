Before I watch the movie have seen some reviews about the movie believe me not so Encouraging But when I went to the theatre and watched the movie I had a different opinion Which was for sure a positive opinion I loved the movie Hmmm it s short and sweet But now I know why people don t really like the movie Want to know keep reading That is simply because after the first trailer release people were crazed and had too many expectations Many theory breakdowns happened online etc So hour and minutes of the movie did not reach their expectations That is the reason why the audiences were a little disappointed They really wanted the extra drama I wanted it too The Drama they could have shown a little more about Thor s love drama with Jane I did have that emotional connection with the pair I think nobody did Because there were not many Intense scenes between them Where the audience could connect Yeap that is all I think is the reasons for the movie having bad reviews and here ends my review
