I am me I might not be the most beautiful But I have beauty in full I might not be your first choice But I am a great choice I am me And I am good at being myself Its cool There is always a better to look at your critics Tell them you re not what they say I am myself what I always love to be The most concrete form of my ambitions Really proud of my creations I m about as certain as I can be I know I am not the person that I ll be tomorrow Nor the past of me Shared by the days that followed I m here at the moment that s all I can be This is what I am me
