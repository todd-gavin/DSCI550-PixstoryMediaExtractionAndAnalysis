The world is a beautiful place to live in because it is full of art and artists. Without art this World is meaningless and without artists you cannot define what's art. Artists are one the most important human beings on this earth. Without them there will be no sense of creativity and imagination. And in all these artists, the dancers play a very significant part. This world is a canvas and Dancers are the painters who paint the meaning of music and life on it. Once a dancer is famous and popular. They get all the love and recognisation. But do all the dancers get the same love and recognisation? No. Dancers have to   struggle a lot in life before they are successful. Once you get a job you are paid. You get salary, your family is happy. You are independent. But dancers, they don't earn till a very long time. They just love their art and with their passion towards dance they just keep going. Family issues, financial instability, improper training, poor mental state and a lot of severe problems are caused to thousands of dancers on daily basis. Nobody supports them when they are in the initial stage of their career. You can create doctors, engineers, architects etc by providing them knowledge. But you can never creat a dancer, because it's a gift from the gods, inherited into a special human being who is capable of making this world more beautiful by his art and talent. It's a very sad thing that even today, thousands of dancers quit dancing because of such problems. They give up on their dreams just to be a right fix for their society. If people try to understand and believe in them even if they are nothing, this world will be full of dancers and they will make it more beautiful. If you can't do anything for a dancer, just tell them that they are good at their art and you believe them. That's all a dancer needs.
