You have no choice but to see your body every day. Whatever you can't avoid seeing every day will have an impact on your happiness by sparking a series of thinking processes, which in turn create emotions. This process will repeat itself, and with each iteration, it will become stronger. 

Many people believe that you must believe your physique is lovely, but I am not convinced this is true. Here's why: what if anything happens to me that makes me look less attractive objectively? What if I burn my face or simply get incredibly old? It's a very conditional form of love if I can only be okay with myself if I can honestly believe that my body is lovely. 

Yes, it is , if you glance in the mirror and think "Hey hot stuff" or whatever hot people think when they look in the mirror, you're doing fine. However, there's a big difference between thinking you're the hottest thing on the planet and hating yourself. I prefer to be on the self-love end of the spectrum, where I can honestly state that there are many many individuals who are better looking than me, but that I adore the person staring back at me because she's very cool and interesting.
