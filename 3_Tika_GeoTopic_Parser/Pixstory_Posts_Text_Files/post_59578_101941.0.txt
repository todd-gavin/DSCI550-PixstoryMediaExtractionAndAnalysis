The girl who is scared to explore the world. My name is Riti Jain I study in 5th grade at Airaa Academy. A proud nation India is where I hail from. In my free time I mostly read because reading help me a lot. It gives me opportunities that I wish for and it helps me be more connected to the world. The picture and texture of a book all held fascination for me. I could feel the book before even I could read them. They give me the way into another world where it might be fantasy or sadness. The kind of books that I like to read other ones that of fiction as it is a world that never change in reality which make me curious. I just love researching about new things that are impossible. I am a big fan of Harry Potter Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus I have read all of the series many times and every time I read them it gives me the same pleasure. The magic and Supernatural element the does exist in the real world is the kind of feeling I get whenever I read fiction books. The also simulate the creativity and both vocabulary. Coming to my achievements I have one third place in the SOF competition in 2020 and I have one three gold medals and two silver medals in Taekwondo also I have on my yellow belt. I have received few medals from sports activity and many more things. I also have a book in progress
