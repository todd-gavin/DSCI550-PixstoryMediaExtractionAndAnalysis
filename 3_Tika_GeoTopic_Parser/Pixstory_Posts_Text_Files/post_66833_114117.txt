HOME SPACE NEWS Astrophysicists Create Time Machine Simulations To Observe the Lifecycle of Ancestor Galaxy Cities TOPICS AstronomyAstrophysicsKavli InstitutePopular By KAVLI INSTITUTE FOR THE PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS OF THE UNIVERSE JUNE Time Machine Simulations Scientists create time machine simulations studying the lifecycle of ancestor galaxy cities Many processes in astrophysics take a very long time making their evolution tricky to study For example a star like our sun has a lifespan of about billion years and galaxies evolve over the course of billions of years One way astrophysicists deal with this is by looking at various different objects to compare them at different stages of evolution They can also look at distant objects to effectively peer back in time because of the length of time the light took to travel to reach our telescopes For example if we are looking at an object billion light years away we are seeing it as it was billion years ago Researchers have created simulations that directly recreate the full life cycle of some of the largest collections of galaxies observed in the distant universe billion years ago reports a new study published on June in the journal Nature Astronomy
