A nice lil stroll through saharanpur while commuting from Delhi to Uttrakhand and you come across some local fruit peddlers Usually one doesn t stop but if you take a step further and embrace your wild side by hitting the breaks and actually seeing what these peddlers have to sell one might go a lil crazy and actually buy one of these fruits This photo is proof that the above mentioned scenario sometimes actually plays out and one ends up buying dozens after finding out that if god s nectar exists its in one of these mango husks
