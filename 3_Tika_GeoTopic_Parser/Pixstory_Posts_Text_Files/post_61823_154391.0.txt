Eminem and Snoop Dogg have Dr. Dre's 2021 health scare to thank for helping them repair their relationship.
The rappers, who first collaborated more than two decades ago, had long-simmering beef that reached a head in 2020, when public comments from Snoop, 50, insulting Eminem, 49, moved the star to diss Snoop in his lyrics.
But when Dr. Dre, 57, suffered a brain aneurysm in January 2021 and spent two weeks in intensive care, the hip-hop stars were inspired to let the past go.
"Me and Snoop had our little issue and then when Dre, when that thing happened with Dre, the brain aneurysm thing…" Eminem told his longtime manager Paul Rosenberg on SiriusXM's Paul Pod: Curtain Call 2. "We were like, bro this is stupid. This is stupid as hell to be feuding right now. So I don't remember if I called him, or he called me, I can't remember, but we talked it out."
Eminem said that he believes any tension between the two can be traced back to a "miscommunication" over a possible collaboration.
"I think he had wanted to do something with me and maybe gave you the idea or something," Eminem recalled to Rosenberg. "And you said something to the effect of, 'Well let's hear what the song is first. Let's see what the type of song is.' And I think he said the way that he took it was kind of like that I don't f— with him. That I didn't f— with him."
Eminem then said that he eventually explained to Snoop Dogg that he was deeply inspired by the rapper's 1993 debut album.
"Yeah, which I explained to him, like, 'Bro, Doggystyle changed my life,'" he said.
Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) and Snoop (Calvin Broadus Jr.) have since collaborated several times, and even shared the stage at Super Bowl LVI earlier this year alongside Mary J. Blige, Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar.
