Does it look like a Bollywood movie? I'd say nope. The VFX we've seen in bollywood movies usually loses the lustre after 3–4 years. But this seems to be a movie which is visually stunning and spectacular in every frame. It almost felt like I'm watching a trailer of a Marvel movie.🔥🔥

Plus, they are making a story of ancient Hindu gods and their astras. I honestly feel it would be a nice comeback for the bollywood industry and they should not try creeping in propagandas.❤️

It's after a very long gap of time that I'm excited and look forward to watching a Bollywood movie in the theatres. 🎥🎥
