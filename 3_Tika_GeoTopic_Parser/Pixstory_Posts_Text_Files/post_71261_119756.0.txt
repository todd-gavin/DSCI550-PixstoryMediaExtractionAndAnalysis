If you love her with all your heart she will love you back beautifully and eternally.🌟
But if you break her heart she will live the rest of her life with a damaged heart unless she finds someone who can heal her heart with his pure love.❤She will stop waiting for you to come back to her.🌪
She will stop waiting for your phone calls and messages. She will stop expecting
any love and care from you.☄️
But still she won't hate you for betraying her. She will forgive you and move on.🌦
 She will cry behind closed doors, but she won't let you come back in her life to hurt her again. She will move on with her painful heart and aching soul, but she will never turn back to you.✨She will ignore you but not because she will hate you but because she
will be deeply hurt.💔She will neglect you but not because she doesn't care anymore but because she will fear falling in love with you again. But no matter what she won't beg for your time and attention.💥
She will learn to live without you.🪐
She will move on gracefully🌈
