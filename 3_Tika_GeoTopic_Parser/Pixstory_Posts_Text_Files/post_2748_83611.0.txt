Last year hundreds of manatees died off the Florida coast. The main reasons were cold weather and starvation. Officials fear that there may be a repeat of the same even this year. According to some estimates, there are nearly 7,500 manatees in the state.

Officials say that most deaths have taken place in Indian River Lagoon, an estuary stretching over 150 miles down the middle of Florida's east coast. (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/floridas-beloved-manatees-are-dying-in-alarming-numbers-again-heres-why)

Manatees have been facing existential crisis ever since their main food, seagrass, has seen a decline in because of water pollution. Farm fertilizers and residential areas on the coast have been blamed mainly for the decreasing population.

The officials have found a way. They are supplying tons of lettuce to feed the manatees. According to experts, an average of 350 manatees a day are now coming to eat the lettuce in Cape Canaveral, along Florida's east coast.

Experts say that Florida manatees are vulnerable in winters as they find it hard to survive when the temperature drops below 68 degrees. While mammals such as whales and seals can survive because of a significant layer of fat or blogger, manatees don't have it.

Lettuce, for now, maybe saving lives of the sea animals, but officials say that the problem needs a long-term solution. That would be for the state to take action and reduce water pollution in the coastal waters so that manatees can feed on what grows naturally in the sea rather than depending on humans.
