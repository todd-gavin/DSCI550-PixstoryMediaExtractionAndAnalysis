According to BBC, men with a reported history of violence are using social media to connect as hosts and sponsors. UK government has their safety gears up. These included "Home Office security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued", and at least one council visit to a sponsor's property. In March, the government declared the scheme would allow anyone to host a family or individual if they agreed to house, criminal records and other background checks.
But many are misusing this. 

On a Facebook group set up to help match Ukrainian refugees, BBC News found one would-be sponsor who seems to live in a one-bedroom flat posting multiple offers to host young women. His acquaintances claimed that he had multiple convictions, including for burglary and affray.

BBC News has also brought out the issue of a Ukrainian who said she had been shown pictures of the bedrooms she and her two young children would be using. But on arrival, her entire family had been expected to sleep in one small reception room next to the kitchen, with no privacy.

The property had not been examined. There had been no DBS checks. And she says the house was filled with Nazi memorabilia.

"The family... have Nazi pictures and Soviet symbols," she said. "I don't feel safe."

She left and found a better host through social media but feels deeply damaged by the experience.

Is this the way we treat someone who seeks refugee to us? Never use once's vulnerability against them. They are in a crisis and they seek refuge we need to ensure they are been provided safe and sound places possible. Think the UK think!
