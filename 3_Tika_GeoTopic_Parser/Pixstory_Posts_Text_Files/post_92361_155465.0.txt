Kim Kardashian has been all about the metallics lately. For an appearance on "The Late Late Show With James Corden" on Wednesday evening, the Skims mogul and mom of four stepped out in a silver strapless Rick Owens dress, in line with her futuristic fashion moments as of late. The lustrous ensemble caught our attention as she chatted about being single and no longer wanting to date fellow celebrities after her split from Pete Davidson.
The dress came with a plunging neckline split🥵🤌🏻 right down the middle and leading into a triangular cutout across the stomach. Offering a peek at her matching ankle-strap heels, the floor-length dress 👗also featured a slit down the side. Kardashian accessorized the look with charcoal-colored chunky rings💍 and thick cuffs, which she let host Corden try on for size.💗
Just a day prior, Kardashian shared photos promoting Tiffany & Co.'s new Lock collection, in which she's wearing a metallic silver lamé bodysuit and thigh-high boots. She piled on accessories from the line, including 18k white-gold bangles with encrusted diamonds and a massive emerald-cut diamond ring. For Beyoncé's '80s-inspired roller-disco birthday party last week, she attended wearing her signature Balenciaga catsuit in a red sequined tiger print. Khloé Kardashian and La La Anthony, who posed for snaps with the SKKN by Kim founder, also opted for sequined and metallic outfits. Khloé sported a shimmering Celia Kritharioti set, while Anthony rocked a metallic-gold asymmetrical catsuit.
