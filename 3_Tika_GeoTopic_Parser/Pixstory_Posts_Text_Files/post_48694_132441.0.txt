There is no question that student loan debt has been a major issue in the United States for many years now. It's become so widespread that it's essentially preventing millions of people from getting ahead in life.
In fact, according to a study by The Institute for College Access and Success, over 44 million Americans currently have student loan debt, and this number is only going to increase in the future if we don't take this necessary step. This is because more and more people are choosing to go to college and pursuing higher education, instead of finding jobs that would allow them to pay off their loans quickly.
This situation is obviously causing a lot of problems for the American economy as a whole. It's leading to an overall decrease in economic stability because too many people are struggling financially at the same time.
I think the loan should be forgiven. If this happens, then the American economy will finally start to recover from all of its damage caused bystudent loan debt.
