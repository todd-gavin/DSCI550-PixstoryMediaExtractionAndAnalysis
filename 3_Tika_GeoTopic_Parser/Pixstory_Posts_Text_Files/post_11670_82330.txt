Since retiring from work as the First Lady in Michelle Obama has not slowed down one bit In fact the attorney wife of Barack mom to Sasha and Malia And despite her jam packed schedule and high stress and high profile career the year old icon looks about two decades younger than she really is It s pretty clear she practices what she preaches in terms of eating a well balanced diet and staying active for breakfast Obama noshed on scrambled eggs turkey sausage and grapefruit It s not always all about the protein and produces though On special occasions Obama revealed to The New York Times that she enjoys grits and waffles for her morning meal for Lunch Another high protein pick a vegetable rich turkey chili is a favorite for lunch Obama told PEOPLE and chances are it s served with a salad or some sort of veggies on the side fo snack she shared her top MVP snacks Nuts Veggies and hummus Ezekiel toast with almond butter Juice for dinner Roast chicken and seafood are two dinner staples for Ms Obama often served with a baked sweet potato couscous or rice and steamed broccoli or peas And since pizza is hands down her favorite food which she usually cooks herself as a treat French fries I love them And I m not afraid to talk about it because it s important that we realize that healthy eating doesn t have to be an all or nothing approach
