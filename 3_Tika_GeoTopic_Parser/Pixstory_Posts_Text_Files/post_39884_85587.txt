For the last one week I have been preparing for an upcoming competion Lost Recipes Of Grandmothers The Great Indian Thali Challenge So theme was basically to make such dishes that was unique to my family my district state or region with use of different ingredients and vegetables Also it had to be vegetarian and healthy dishes use of ingredients such as milkmaid sugar refined oil etc all were banned I found it personally a difficult because firstly I am a Bengali and my grandmother hardly remembers such any lost or special recipes there s a lot of change in our history through British influence she was actually taught by an English nun at her missionary school The history for Bnegalis has changed a lot through different invasions of different rulers The Mughals were my roots my forefathers use to live in Dhaka Bangladesh There are two Bengali communities Ghoti and Bangal so me being a Bangal we are the muslim Bangladesh side our food is more traditional tangy and spicy as well as pungent because of the addition of mustard seeds paste or oil Also frequently use of poppy seeds Even through all the rules and regulations I did my research and put up a thali at last with five dishes were not particularly lost recipes but the method was unique to my family Had the competition include Non vegetarian items I would presented a much unique and exquisite meal since we are as a community hardcore Non Vegetarians Look at the support posts for recipes you can definitely find it interesting and easy to make at home P S the painting is done my only Cheers
