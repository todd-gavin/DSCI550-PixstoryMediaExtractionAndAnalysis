Shahid Kapoor is a busy bee these days and rightfully so. The actor, who was last seen in Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s 2019 release Kabir Singh, is now looking forward to the release of his much awaited sports drama Jersey.
 Ahead of the release, Shahid Kapoor is busy promoting Jersey along with co-star Mrunal Thakur. The duo was papped today in the city for the promotions of their sports drama and both Shahid and Mrunal were winning hearts with their style statements. The Batti Gul Meter Chalu actor was seen donning a comfy yet stylish look as he opted for all white outfit which was paired with a pair of grey sneakers. On the other hand, Mrunal Thakur looked stunning as she wore a teal and black coloured outfit and kept her tresses open. 🥺🤌🏻
