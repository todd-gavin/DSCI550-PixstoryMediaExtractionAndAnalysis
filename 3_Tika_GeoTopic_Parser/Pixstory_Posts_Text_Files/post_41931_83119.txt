The first in the relationship red flags according to therapists is to rush a new relationship too quickly Popularly referred to as love bombing this red flag isn t necessarily about the new partner who says I love you too soon or who wants to move in together after five dates Love bombing becomes worrying when one person is trying to manipulate the other into a situation of dependency SELF reports What counts as a red flag then A first date on a private jet with your date s ex wife child and bodyguards with a side of caviar The seemingly innocent but dangerously concerning need for control miss you less than hours of knowing each other Asking them to move in with you into a per month rented apartment in the span of five dates as a segue into throwing them into millions of dollars worth of debt The Netflix documentary Tinder Swindler documents the dating ponzi scheme crafted by Shimon Hayut aka Simon Leviev where he wooes women from dating apps as a mysterious diamond minting millionaire figure whose life is constantly in danger He traps these women into debt by convincing them that his life depends on their money The women plunge into a debt of million dollars in total while Leviev uses their money on other caviar filled dates The show echoes the cycles of control abuse and love bombing in how Leviev sucks his love interests in and makes it impossible for them to leave if they decide to abandon him what would happen to all their savings worth they lent And surely given the history of his lavish expenses he would pay them back Although Tinder Swindler is trending the documentary falls flat The overdramatized soundtracks and the over emphasis on chivalry and its family of gender stereotypes are beyond archaic and tired even in the cis het world no Dare to dissent by challenging this post And hold your horses if you re about to delete your dating apps Leviev has been banned from Tinder Now he is making his own dating show Would you watch it
