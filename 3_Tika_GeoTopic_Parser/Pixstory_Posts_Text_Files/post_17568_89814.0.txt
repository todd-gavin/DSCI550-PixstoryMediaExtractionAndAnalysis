After an intensive run of games, James missed the recent loss to the Philadelphia 76ers with knee soreness. Head coach Frank Vogel said the issue reappeared due to the number of minutes the forward recently clocked in.

“Just dealing with some soreness. Played three games in four nights. A lot of minutes. There’s enough soreness to keep him out tonight.”

James led the Lakers to wins over the Toronto Raptors and Cleveland Cavaliers between March 18-21. Unfortunately, L.A. also fell to the Washington Wizards during that time.
