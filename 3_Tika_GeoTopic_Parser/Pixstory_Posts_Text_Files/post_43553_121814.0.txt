On August 1st, minister Lee Jong Sup stated that "After consideration, the ministry of national defense has concluded the department can help them practice and perform for the national gains without violating the principles of fairness and equality." at the national assembly when asked about the special exemption for BTS.
It can be interpreted as the ministry will protect BTS to perform as much as possible without compromising the national duty while it is unlikely that the group will get a special exemption.
Currently, athletes who win a medal at the Olympics or the Gold medal at the Asian Games are exempt from the military. There has been an ongoing debate if a globally famous artist like BTS should also be exempted.

BTS members legally deferred military service until the age of 30 when the amendment to the Military Service Act

was promulgated in June of last year. However, Jin, the eldest member of BTS, must enlist by the end of this year under the current military service law unless the additional amendment passes.
