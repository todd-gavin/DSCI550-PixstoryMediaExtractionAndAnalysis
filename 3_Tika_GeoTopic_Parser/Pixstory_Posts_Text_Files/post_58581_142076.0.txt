After the maestro’s death in 2006, his son Nayyar Hussain carried forward Khan sahib’s legacy and played shehnai till his death in 2009. Khan Sahib’s two other sons Mehtab and Zamin Hussain died in 2013 and 2018 respectively. 

Late Nayyar Hussain’s son Nasir Abbas (45) plays shehnai. Asfaq Haider, son of Zamin Hussain accompanied Nasir Abbas on tabla in programmes before the Covid pandemic.

“Since the eruption of the coronavirus disease in 2019, it has become extremely difficult for us to sustain ourselves by conducting Shehnai events. Some family members want to sell the ancestral house and meet the daily expenses as economic conditions have worsened and there isn’t any hope of revival now,” said Nazim Hussain, the youngest son of Ustad Bismillah Khan.

He urged both the Uttar Pradesh government and the Centre to take over this house and renovate it as a monument of Khan sahib on the lines of late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri whose residence was converted into a memorial at Ramnagar in Varanasi.

That would be a perfect tribute to the maestro whose ‘Dil ka Khilona Hai Toot Gaya’ based on the popular song from hit Hindi movie Goonj Uthi Shehnai, and his famous bhajan ‘Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram, Patita Pavan Sitaram’ sung by Hari Om Sharan, continue to keep the music lovers enthralled even after his death.
