‌Branch of feminism that examines the relationship between women and nature.

‌Draws on the concept of gender to analyse the connection between humans and the natural world.

‌The term was coined by the French writer Françoise d'Eaubonne.

‌Demands an egalitarian, collaborative society in which there is no one dominant group.

‌In literature, its focus is on the analysis of the role attributed to women in fantasies of the natural environment by male authors as well as the study of specifically feminine conceptions of the environment in the neglected nature writings by female authors.

‌Parallels between the oppression of nature and the oppression of women.

 These parallels include but are not limited to seeing women and nature as property, seeing men as the curators of culture and women as the curators of nature, and how men dominate women and humans dominate nature.

‌Criticism faced by Ecofeminism includes less commitment towards intersectionality and focus on duality.

‌Movements like Chipko Movement and the Green Belt Movement are examples of Ecofeminism.

‌Theorists include: Vandana Shiva, Judi Bari, Greta Gaard among others.
