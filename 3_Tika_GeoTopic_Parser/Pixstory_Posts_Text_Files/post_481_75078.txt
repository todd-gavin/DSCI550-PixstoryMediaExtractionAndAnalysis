After surveillance of SARS CoV genomic surveillance INSACOG said Omicron variant is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in multiple metros where new cases have been rising exponentially The sequencing report dates Jan showed that a sub lineage of omicron is fast spreading and failing to get diagnosed in many tests like antigen tests hence the number of false negative cases are in rise BA lineage is a substantial fraction in India and S gene dropout based screening is thus likely to give high false negatives Tests suitable for PCR based screening applicable to all Omicron lineages have been approved for use the weekly report said While most Omicron cases so far have been asymptomatic or mild hospitalizations and ICU cases have been increasing in the current wave INSACOG says the threat level remains unchanged The recently reported B discovered in France with Cameroonian origin lineage is being monitored There is no evidence of rapid spread and while it has features of immune escape it is currently not a variant of concern So far no case detected in India The INSACOG reports genomic surveillance of SARS CoV across the country through sequencing of samples from Sentinel sites and also detailed State wise district analysis for some states under State MoUs Maharashtra Kerala and some other states
