For Arsenal fans, Cesc Fabregas' fantastic start to his Chelsea career has been particularly 
tough to watch. Many Arsenal fans remember Fabregas making his first-team debut against 
Rotherham United in the League Cup. Fabregas became the club's youngest player at the age 
of 16 years and 177 days.

However, he suddenly appears destined to create Chelsea history. The lesson is that things 
change quickly in football.

When Fabregas made his debut, who were his teammates and where are they now?

Graham Stack

Graham Stack, a former Ireland U-21 international, has spent his career as a journeyman with ten different clubs. He is now a player-coach for Conference Premier side Barnet at the age of 33.

Justin Hoyte

Justin Hoyte never quite made the grade at Arsenal, despite making over 30 first-team 
appearances, and was moved to Middlesbrough in August 2008. He then went on loan to Millwall for the 2013/14 season, which he has now made permanent.

Stathis Tavlaridis

Stathis Tavlaridis came to Lille from Arsenal after making seven league appearances for the 
Gunners. He had a good run in Ligue 1, playing for Lille and Saint-Etienne on a regular basis 
and earning two international caps in the process. Tavlaridis is presently playing for Atromitos Athens in his native Greece.

Pascal Cygan

In 2003/04, the much-maligned Pascal Cygan made 18 league appearances for the Invincibles, earning a Premier League medal in the process.

He joined Villarreal in the summer of 2006 and remained there until his retirement in 2009.

The Frenchman's decision on whether or not to pursue a coaching career is still up in the air.
