5/5
not exactly a review i suppose but more so me wanting to scream about how much i adored this book.
i had extremely high expectations going into reading this, but i can happily proclaim that it satisfied the hopeless romantic within me.
childhood best friends to lovers to second chance romance perfection! macy and elliot were so incredibly endearing and watching their love for each other grow and flourish once more through the past and present narrative was heart warming. lauren's writing is so simplistic yet lyrical and just all round beautiful, meaning i devoured this book in one sitting, leaving me yearning for a love like macy and elliot's,) this is exactly the read needed to encourage my july reading goals! did i mention how much LOVED IT AH
