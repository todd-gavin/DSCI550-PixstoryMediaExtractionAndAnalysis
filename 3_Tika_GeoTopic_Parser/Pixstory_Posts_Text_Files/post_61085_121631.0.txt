Most suited for family dinners and friends‚Äô hangout, this is a place where you can expect some lovely Chinese and North Indian food under the same roof. Though there are a number of restaurants serving the like cuisines, this is one of the best in taste and quality. I‚Äôm visiting this place since my childhood and I love love love this place. Each and every person who knows me knowing that how much i love sizzler. I always had chilly paneer sizzler and it‚Äôs super amazing üòç .

The quality they portrayed in the service and the food was superb. The seating area is distributed over two floors and the ground floor is more attractive and larger. Second floor has just six or eight tables which is not too much. 
They have many outlets but best outlets is Connaught Place. 
If you haven‚Äôt visited this place i will recommend you this place. Go with your friends/family and enjoy their food ‚ù§Ô∏è
