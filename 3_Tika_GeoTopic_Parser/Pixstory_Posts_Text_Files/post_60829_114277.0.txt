There's a park in Bengaluru that's sprawled over 300 acres of lush greenery. The reason Bengaluru is called the 'Garden City' is because it boasts such breathtaking green parks even though much of Urban Bengaluru has become a concrete jungle.

Cubbon Park which is also known as Chamarajendra Park is famous for it's natural thickets and walkways that the residents love.

It was made in 1870 under the supervision of Major General Richard Sankey, who was the British Chief Engineer of Mysore at that time. Initially, the park was only of 100 acres but it expanded to how it is now over the past century. 

The park boasts an impressive collection of flora and fauna and has many important buildings in its vicinity. It's the perfect place for weekend walks, fresh air and quiet readings. If you want to clear your mind, write or read, then you ought to check out cubbon park.

The park is also famous for hosting furry little friends (dogs). However the plan to ban pets at the park has received a huge backlash from residents and dog lovers. The decision to ban pets from the park has been put on hold and fresh rules will be released next week regarding the matter. 

I go to the park as often as possible, especially for the free dose of dopamine I get after petting fluffy little doggos. I love the park for how accepting it is and I honestly hope they don't ban pets from there.
