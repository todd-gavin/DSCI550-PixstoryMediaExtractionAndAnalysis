The one obtained by Charles Leclerc at the end of qualifying for the Azerbaijan GP was a spatial pole position. Even on the difficult track of Baku, the Monegasque proved to be very strong in Q, hitting his sixth pole start of the season, the fifteenth in his career. A result that forms an excellent basis for departure in view of tomorrow&#39;s race The pace will obviously be an unknown factor considering the few tests carried out by both the red and its rivals Red Bull I am excited for tomorrow explained Leclerc immediately after the checkered flag even if I think there will be crucial situations to manage like tire wear We were going well in Barcelona and Monte Carlo and we have certainly grown in terms of race pace since we brought the updates to the track It will be interesting especially if we can confirm ourselves here too Instagram photo scuderiaferrari
