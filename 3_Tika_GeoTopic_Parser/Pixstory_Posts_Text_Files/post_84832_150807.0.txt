On Sunday night in La Liga, the current champions of Spain and Europe, Real Madrid, play host to Osasuna.
The beginning of the season for Real Madrid has been flawless. The team led by Carlo Ancelotti has triumphed in every one of the nine games they have played so far this season in all competitions. Before the international break, Los Blancos played well against Atletico Madrid in the Madrid derby. They won 2-1 thanks to goals in the first half from Federico Valverde and Rodrygo.
Even though they haven't been as flawless as their hosts, Osasuna has won four straight games for just the 3rd time in club top-flight history. They have likewise had a good start to their season and are currently ranked fifth. They just suffered a 2-0 home loss to Getafe, and they'll try to rebound this match.

Real Madrid vs Osasuna: Prediction
Few clubs in Europe enter a match with Madrid as favorites because of their unwavering confidence in their play. But Los Blancos face a brutally organized team that is ready to fight for every loose ball. Osasuna has so far this season had the lowest open-play anticipated goals conceded figure of any team in Spain's premier division.
The European and Spanish champions are certain to win once more, but this tenacious Osasuna team won't give their hosts an easy ride to three points.
 
Prediction: Real Madrid 2-1 Osasuna
