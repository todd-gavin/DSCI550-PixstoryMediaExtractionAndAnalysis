Monica Cannon-Grant, the founder and CEO of Violence in Boston and a major Black Lives Matter (BLM) activist in Boston, is being probed by federal authorities for allegedly embezzling cash from her multimillion-dollar foundation. 

After the death of George Floyd in May 2020, Monica became a prominent figure in the Boston BLM movement. She supposedly built a close working relationship with Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu while they were both on the Boston City Council.

It was reported that Monica also campaigned for former Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who ran for Senate but lost in 2020.

She admitted in a speech that she has been under investigation since October. After he was accused of COVID-19 unemployment fraud and mortgage fraud, federal investigators detained and raided her spouse Clark Grant's home in October 2021. 

According to the lawsuit, Clark Grant is now accused of misrepresenting Violence in Boston's bank account as his own personal property when applying for a $402,573 mortgage in May 2021. 

Federal authorities are investigating whether any of Monica's organization's donations were used to pay for her personal expenses.

Authorities in California and Washington warned the national BLM group in February that it would face legal action if it failed to publish its 2020 financials. After a Washington Examiner investigation revealed that the BLM Global Network Foundation had no known head in charge of the tens of millions of dollars it raised in 2020 since May, the organisation voluntarily discontinued fundraising.
