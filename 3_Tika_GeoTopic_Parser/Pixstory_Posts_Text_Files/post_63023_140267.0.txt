Queen Elizabeth's sudden demise has people shocked throughout the world. Britain's longest reigning Monarch dies at the age of 96.
Charles, the eldest son of the queen, inherits a monarchy that must uphold long-standing customs while also evolving to reflect contemporary Britain. In his opening remarks, the 73-year-old king, who will rule as Charles III, said that the loss of the queen would be felt "by countless people all around the world."
It is yet to be seen what political changes does this bring to the English now.
