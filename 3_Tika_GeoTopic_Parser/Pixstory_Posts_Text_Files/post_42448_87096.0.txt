“Because we are different, they think we are perverts,” this one quote from the movie summed up the feeling of the whole LGBTQ community.

Last night I watched “Badhaai Do” directed by Harshvardhan Kulkarni on Netflix and I can say that this movie is the best movie that India made on the LGBTQ topic.

“Badhaai Do” is based in Uttarakhand where we met two-character Shardul and Suman (played by Rajkumar Rao and Bhumi Pednekar) one is working as a policeman and other one is a PT teacher.

But one day when Suman realized that a boy pretending as a girl on a dating app and starts blackmailing her, then she filed a complaint at the police station and there she met Shardul. They met as a stranger but after a few days, they get to know each other’s reality and decided to get married to make their families happy and after that, they start living as a roommates with their love interest. 

Will Shardul and Suman live freely after the wedding or will they face the backlash of the society after knowing their reality?

A movie without conflicts feels incomplete and in this movie, conflicts come with a lot of humor and also gave a strong message to society.

‘Badhaai Do’ succeeds to break the stereotypical mentality of society related to many sensitive topics.

The chemistry between Shardul, Suman, and her love interest Rimjhim (played by Chum Darang) is the highlight of the movie. The performance of all the supporting actors is too-notch and adds value to the movie.

There are so many things that Director tried to cover in the movie and because of that sometimes the movie felt stretched.

I don’t know why but nowadays movies have to do the brand work in the middle of the scene because it breaks the continuity of the movie.

If you are looking for a movie that brings something new and fresh to the table then ‘Badhaai Do’ is the movie for you. The runtime of the movie is 2 hours 27 minutes long.
