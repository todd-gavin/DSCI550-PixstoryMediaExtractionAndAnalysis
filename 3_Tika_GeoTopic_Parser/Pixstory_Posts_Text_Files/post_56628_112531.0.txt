Australia's Alexander Volkanovski has defeated Max Holloway for the third time in his career, defending his featherweight title by unanimous decision with a dominant striking performance at UFC 276 in Las Vegas.

Volkanovski (25-1) extended his winning streak to 22 fights with a commanding display against American Holloway (23-7), the former champion at 145 pounds.

The AustralianÂ executed a sharp boxing game plan against one of the UFC's best punchers, bloodying Holloway's face early on and steadily increasing the punishment into the final minutes.

The penultimate bout of UFC 276 concluded a memorable trilogy between Volkanovski and Holloway, likely the two greatest featherweights in UFC history outside of long-reigning champ Jose Aldo.

Volkanovski won two highly competitive fights by decision over Holloway in 2019 and 2020, but Holloway won his next two fights to reassert his claim to another shot at the belt he held for three years.

"Max Holloway is an absolute beast," Volkanovski said.

"That intensity that we both had, I needed it. I really needed it. I had to get in my own head."
