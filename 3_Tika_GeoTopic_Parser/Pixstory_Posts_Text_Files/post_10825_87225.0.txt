Luana didn’t get to play with girls till she was 13, but didn’t give it too much thought: "I was just there to play, to have the ball, to have fun. I was with my brother, so it was nice," she says.

Football empowered Luana to believe that women have the autonomy to self-determine their path, regardless of the gender-related biases that people might hold.

"I know there's a lot of prejudice still, in women's soccer, especially in Brazil,” Luana says. “I want to give the message to young girls that they can always follow their dreams and do what they want to do – doesn't matter what other people say."

Growing up, Luana was influenced by techniques demonstrated by Brazilian athletes on TV, and was particularly inspired by São Paulo FC Midfielder Formiga, who was born when it was illegal for women to play football in Brazil.

"I think the example that she set: always fighting, her style of playing, her personality – is very encouraging for me," Luana says.

Luana’s evolutions as an athlete led to her playing with Formiga with the national team. If she would travel back in time, the midfielder would tell her younger self: “I'm proud of you.”

While Luana describes herself as a private person, her perceived quietness is not to be stereotyped with indifference: she could easily top the list of athletes most committed to giving their all to the team.

"I like to work hard and to help the team, I like to do the work that nobody wants to do, and I think that's important in a team to do what you have to do, to always be there for your teammates," Luana says.

The midfielder appreciates the talent brought by each player to the team, and for the opportunity to learn about each other’s cultures from countries ranging from France to Czech, Germany, Poland, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Brazil, and Norway.

Ten years from now, Luana can see herself bringing her devotion to team spirit back home to Brazil, where she imagines continuing to work in football.
