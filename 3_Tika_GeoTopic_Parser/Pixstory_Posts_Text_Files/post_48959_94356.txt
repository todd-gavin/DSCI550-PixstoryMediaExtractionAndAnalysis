Earthling Ed once asked a question that forces you to introspect There s a lamb in a room and in this room with the lamb are Jesus and the Devil Which one kills the lamb That s right The Devil does Easter is a celebration of life Jesus Christ rose from the dead three days after his crucifixion He had sacrificed his life so that mankind could be forgiven of their sins an act that demonstrated tremendous compassion and stressed the need of selflessness This was how much in love with humanity he was Christians are encouraged to ask themselves WWJD or What Would Jesus Do whenever they re presented with a moral quandary So what would Jesus do if he was presented with an option to kill and roast a lamb and to not Especially when there are plenty of alternatives Would he take an innocent life when he has the option to not Hundreds of thousands of lambs are still denied the right to life and are taken away from their mothers too soon already scarred by their time in intensive farms while they still need their warmth and protection Babies as young as days are taken away to be violently and horribly slaughtered in slaughterhouses for a practice that is now entirely unjustifiable Slaughterhouses are sites of anguish torture and dread where these little ones face certain death amid heartbreaking bleating and suffering Lambs on the verge of death are gathered and kept for hours in cramped filthy spaces and in a state of hypothermia Their eyes are wide with fright they urinate frequently out of fear They are thrashed and pulled flung and kicked jerked grabbed by the neck and placed on top of each other Lambs hear the others gasping wailing and dying as they are butchered one by one Lambs that have been slaughtered are tossed on people who are still living as proof that their brief existence is worth the same as their death Their legs are even sliced to make room for a compression pistol which separates the skin from the muscles by blowing air If He was to see this WWJD
