Following the "humanitarian aid of the international community", another cash package of 40 million dollars has arrived in Kabul.

This Taliban-controlled bank has regularly received packages of tens of millions of dollars after the fall of the previous government. There are doubts about the source of these funds.

On the 16th July of last year, a cash package of 32 million US dollars in the name of international community aid arrived in Kabul and was delivered to one of the commercial banks.

After the Taliban came to power, no country has recognized the government of this group, and banking transactions with Afghanistan have also been cut off.

Central Bank officials in their new announcement have asked the international community to resume banking relations with Afghanistan.
