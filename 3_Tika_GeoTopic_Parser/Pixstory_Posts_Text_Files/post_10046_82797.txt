If masculinity is in beating a woman I am not a man at all When you can not look at a smile on your wife s side when you can not cut a couple of loving words when you can not cut a few minutes of your time when you can not listen to her words then why did you marry her Why did you waste a human life a woman is also a human being do you like someone to dream like this with your sister or daughter It is possible that there are qualities in the opposite sex that you do not like that you do not like Just as God created the mountain for the sake of peace He created man and woman for the sake of peace It is haram to beat a woman is haram If you say that it is mentioned in the Qur an that beating a woman is permissible if she does not listen to you I will say with full confidence that your interpretation of the Qur an was wrong If beating a woman is permissible in the Qur an then why did not any of our companions or our prophet beat his wife In the Qur an which says your perception is one hundred percent wrong this does not mean beating with a stick fist and kick as stated in the hadiths it is only to notice your spouse that is to hit someone with a toothbrush or handkerchief toothbrush to stick and fist It is very different And this was the perception of the companions your perception is wrong If you see masculinity in beating If you are not a man Not human
