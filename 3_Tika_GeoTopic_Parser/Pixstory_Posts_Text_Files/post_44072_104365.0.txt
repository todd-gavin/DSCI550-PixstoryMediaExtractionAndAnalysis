Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan: Prediction

Because Slovakia is the overwhelming favorite to win the group, none of these teams can afford to lose their first match. A draw may not be advantageous, particularly for Kazakhstan, but we believe a low-scoring stalemate is the most likely result on Friday.

Prediction: Kazakhstan 1-1 Azerbaijan
