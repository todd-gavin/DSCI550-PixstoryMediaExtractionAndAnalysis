New York Mayor made a statement at Met Gala This year against gun violence. The 61-year-old mayor arrived on the red carpet with his girlfriend, Tracey Collins, at Met Gala wearing a long black tuxedo coat that read "End Gun Violence." The tuxedo has iconic features of Newyork as well as a large handgun with a red slash through it. Adam's tux also had the symbol for the N train displayed in what was a clear reference to last month's mass shooting on a crowded subway train in Brooklyn in which 23 people were hurt. 

Adams, who is in his first term as mayor campaigned on the mandate of public safety and has been under pressure to prevent violence in the city. 

Yet, in the first three months of this year, there have been 291 shootings in the city, up from 252 over the same period last year, according to NYPD statistics.

In March alone, the city reported 115 shooting incidents – more than a 16% increase from March 2021. 

The outfit was designed by Brooklyn-based artist Laolu Senbanjo, according to Bloomberg. He aimed to end gun violence and save children according to a statement. Even though his intention was good it received a large amount of criticism as well. Swipe to read some tweets. Some said that Met Gala and designing outfits won't end gun violence and this statement was made for cheap publicity.
