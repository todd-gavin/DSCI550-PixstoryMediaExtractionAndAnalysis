'The Godfather’ was released in theatres this week in 1972 and the golden jubilee is prompting a re-evaluation of its legacy. With a cult following, it has aged rather well, finding new audiences in later generations. It has lifted the gangster genre to high art. It might as well be called the greatest American movie.

‘The Godfather’ happens to be ranked as the second greatest film in American history, behind Orson Welles’s ‘Citizen Kane’, in a list of 100 from the American Film Institute: https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/ In popular opinion, however, the crime capper may rate higher. 

Coppola’s achievement, above all, was bring out the psychological depths and pathos of characters otherwise seen only in terms of violence: file:///C:/Users/DELL%207480/Downloads/Rasmawati%20Hamidah.pdf

‘The Godfather’ has been a cultural landmark; its story, style and themes copied in countless movies around the world. Hindi films of Bollywood routinely turn to it for inspiration: https://screenrant.com/biggest-most-blatant-bollywood-copies-of-hollywood-movies-classics/

A high number of references to it crop up in other films – famously, for example, in ‘You’ve Got Mail’, in which Joe Fox tells Kathleen Kelly that it “is the sum of all wisdom”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB8xPnhpzAM

It also has the rare honor of being imitated by reality – as the real-world Mafiosi came to copy the manners and speech of Don Corleone: https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/An_Offer_We_Can_t_Refuse/2482tWkpfpQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA94&printsec=frontcover Also: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/movies/godfather-mafia.html

Critics are largely in agreement: It is a monumental work of art. Pauline Kael, the famed New Yorker writer, spoke for all of them when she wrote: “If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, ‘The Godfather’ is it”: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1972/03/18/alchemy-pauline-kael/amp

Some critics, though, may rank dozens of films above ‘The Godfather’. ‘Citizen Kane’, with its innovations of deep focus and flashbacks, advanced the whole art of cinema. ‘Casablanca’ might be the most appealing American film of all time.  Several of Steven Spielberg’s movies can claim high cinematic excellence, apart from being family entertainers or raising the voicing of conscience.

For some viewers, the movie remains, in final analysis, a well-made version of what is essentially a potboiler thriller novel, no more: https://paulcantor.medium.com/the-godfather-is-terrible-heres-why-that-s-okay-8fe34014f0a6
