Talking to CBS Sports, Thierry Henry had a lot of flattering things to say about English midfielder
James Ward Prowse, including the praise, ‘he can finish.’

The English midfielder has been linked to a summer transfer move to Tottenham, with Antonio
Conte impressed by the midfielder’s ability to play in either a two man or a three man midfield.

His exploits from the deadball are known to everyone in the league, scoring 10 goals and assisting 5 in the league. Ward Prowse remains a constant threat from any dead ball situation, providing great delivery and the ability to go for goal himself.

On being asked who they would choose to score a penalty to save their lives, here's what Micah
Richards and Thierry Henry said about Ward Prowse’s ability.

Kate Abdo: “You have one penalty to save your life, which player in the history of football do
you ask to take it,”

Micah Richards: “I would go with James Ward-Prowse. He is excellent.”

Thierry Henry: “Sorry?”

Micah Richards: “James Ward-Prowse.”

Thierry Henry: “Oh, okay. He can finish. James Ward-Prowse can finish.”

It would be interesting to see how Antonio Conte would play the midfielder at Tottenham, with
both Hojbjerg and Bentancur in fine forms towards the end of the season. However, Ward Prowse would bring creative passing to the table, something that neither of these two players
possess in abundance. It would be incredibly good signing for Tottenham.
