At Unwind with Your Wonderful Project and pixstory The event started with lukka chhupi A game where blindfolded people share things with each other anonymously Then in house psychologist introduced themselves and their availability throughout the event We were briefed about the pixstory app where meaningful conversations can be done Many music performers sang songs People also presented original poetry There was a lot of emotional expression through performing arts like music poetry etc There were nbsp Many stalls too where people bought tee shirts and nbsp posters Also there was a doodle corner I thoroughly enjoyed the event I being a psychology student am determined to remove the stigma around mental health If someone is feeling overwhelmed or having thought behavioral problems they should consider therapy as it helps a lot Stay happy and do what makes you feel good Peace
