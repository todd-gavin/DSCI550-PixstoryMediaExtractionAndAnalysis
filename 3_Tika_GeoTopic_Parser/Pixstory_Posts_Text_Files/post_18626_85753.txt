A few hours after the postponement of the Premier League against Everton, Tottenham coach Antonio Conte spoke. His team is not having a good moment given that in the last few league games they have lost and to make matters worse they have been eliminated from the FA Cup by Middlesbrough team that plays in the Championship When I arrived in London Conte said the management didn&#39;t ask me to lift a trophy within a certain period of time but only to accompany these guys in their growth path to then set goals A new situation for the Italian coach It was different with Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Two years ago the Nerazzurri came to me they asked me for the Scudetto within a couple of seasons and they gave me the chance to do what I wanted Maybe in Italy everything is easier because the teams are equipped for there aren&#39;t as many to make a league at the top as in England At the time there was only Juventus and with three games to go they are five points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United
