PM Morrison gave us a sneak view into one of his meals, which included bhindi sabzi and baingan sabzi prepared in the Srilankan style. He also had the traditional chicken korma. 

Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister of Australia, appears to be a foodie. As official reports say, We've seen him cook and eat samosas, chutney, khichdi, and other delectable Indian dishes on several times. That's not all, though. 

He brags about it all on social media, impressing a number of desi internet users. Every one of his postings about Indian food gets the front page and receives thousands of likes and comments. However, one of his recent Facebook posts did not go over well with the public.

â€œNice to have a night at home. So, curry it is. Sri Lankan Tamarind Eggplant and Okra Curry and a classic Chicken Korma," the post read. He added, "Strong Curry. Strong Economy. Stronger Future.", he wrote. 

While some were super impressed by Prime Minister's post, some questioned the texture of the chicken korma and stated that it seems raw and undercooked. 

Well, decide for yourself!
