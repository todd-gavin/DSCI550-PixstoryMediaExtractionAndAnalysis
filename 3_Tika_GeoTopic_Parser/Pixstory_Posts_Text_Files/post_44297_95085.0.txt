The Argentine legend won’t be available for the next game of Paris Saint Germain when they face the Angers at the Stade Raymond Kopa. 
PSG took a massive step towards regaining the Ligue 1 crown by beating Marseille 2-1 in Le Classique on Sunday, with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe grabbing the goals for the French side. 
Messi had two goals ruled out during the context and has now picked up an injury that will keep him on the sideline on PSG’s next outing at Stade Raymond Kopa- where they could clinch the trophy with five games to spare. 

What’s been said?
The Ligue 1 table leaders will be crowned champions if they beat Angers on Wednesday night and if Marseille loses at home against Nantes. Messi would be attending the game as a spectator, with a statement on PSG’s website confirming that he has suffered tendon damage. 
The statement read,” Messi is receiving treatment for inflammation in his left Achilles tendon and will be looked at again after 48 hours.”
Pochettino has also revealed that Marco Veratti and Kimpembe will be absent tomorrow due to injury, while Neymar will be serving a suspension.
“Some players like Lionel Messi, Marco Veratti and Presnel Kimpembe will be absent tomorrow because they are still having their treatment, Neymar Jr. will be suspended.” The Argentine said in the pre-match press conference. 
“This will be an opportunity for the players who do not play a lot to have playing time and this will allow young players to gain experience.” 

How long will be Messi out for?
The 34-year-old could yet take in even more time on the sideline if his midweek assessment doesn’t produce positive results, with PSG to host Lens on April 23. 
 Messi will no doubt be eager to join the squad so that he can try and add to his modest haul of three goals in 21 domestic outings.
