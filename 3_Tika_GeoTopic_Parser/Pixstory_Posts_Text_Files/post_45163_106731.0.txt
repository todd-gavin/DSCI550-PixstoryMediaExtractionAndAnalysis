Fleetwood Town is interested in signing goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk from Leicester City, a report from the Sun has claimed. 

Stolarczyk has yet to make his senior debut for Leicester but did spend the second half of the season on loan with Dunfermline Athletic, making a total of 13 appearances, as the club was relegated from the Scottish Championship. 

Now, it seems as though that is something that could earn the 21-year-old the chance to play at the senior level in England for the first time in his career the following season.  


According to this latest report, Fleetwood is keen on signing Stolarcyk, after the Cod Army recently appointed manager Scott Brown trained with the ‘keeper during his time at Dunfermline Athletic last season. 

This is thought that Leicester will let the 21-year-old go out on loan for experience once an experience has been made over the future of Daniel Iversen, with the former Preston loanee again attracting interest from Championship clubs. 


This has already been something of an eventful transfer window for Fleetwood, with the right-back Shaun Rooney and midfielder Josh Vela both joining the Cod Army. 

The Cod Army only avoided relegation from League One on the final day of the last season and could be in line for a squad overhaul this summer to try and avoid a similar next time around. 


This could be an important bid for business for Fleetwood to get this summer. With Kieran O’Hara having moved on at the end of the season following the expiry of his contract, the Cod Army could benefit from some cover and competition for Alex Cairns between the posts. 


Stolarczyk would provide that and given Brown has already seen at Dunfermline, there ought to be some confidence that he could do a useful job at Highbury, with the manager aware of what he would be getting.
