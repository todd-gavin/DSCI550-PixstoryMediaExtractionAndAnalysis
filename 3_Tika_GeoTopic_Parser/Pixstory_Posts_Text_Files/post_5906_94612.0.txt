Unable to run 100m at a stretch on the first day of 2017 to hold a course record of 100 miles (161km) at Jaisalmer in December 2019, running has transformed the life of Chandigarh-based wealth manager Gaurav Karjee.

Apart from losing over 20kgs, staying in shape, running is helping Karjee to control hypothyroid. 

“Running has totally changed my life. Over the years, running has become a way of life for me,” says Karjee, who is working as a vice-president with Edelweiss Financial Services Limited.  

“I was diagnosed with hypothyroid in 2010 and despite regular medication, my thyroid level never used to be in the range. Even without doing any physical workout, throughout the day I used to feel exhausted. But since I started doing regular running, I am able to control hypothyroid.” “For the last three years, with medication and daily running, my thyroid level has always been in the range,” adds the 42-year-old ultra runner.

Turning ultra runner 

In September, 2017, Karjee ran his first half-marathon (21km) and in 2018, he participated in his first ultra run (any run longer than the usual marathon distance of 42.195 km) 50km Shivalik Run, and finished fourth.

“After running my first ultra run, my next target was to achieve the 'Ultra Tuffman title'. In December 2019, during a Tuffman Jaisalmer 100 miles ultra run , I came first and created a new course record by completing the 161 km run in 22 hours,” recalls Karjee. 

In 2018, Karjee participated in the All India 100 Days run. He stood second, running 3350 km in a span of 100 days. 

“When we do a long run, we go through a lot of emotions. From giving up to winning over the mind, running has increased patience in me and made me learn never to quit in life,” adds Karjee, who is now associated with Tuffman as a coach. 

He motivates the budding runners to eye for ultra running. “We train runners on weekends and the initiative is free of cost,” says Karjee, who is part of the organizing team of the Tuffman Kasauli Hill Run to be held on April 24.
