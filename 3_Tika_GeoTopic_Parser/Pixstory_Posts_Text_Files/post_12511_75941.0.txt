Mental exhaustion can happen when you frequently engage in tasks that require a lot of cognitive and emotional effort — especially when you don’t build time for rest and self-care into your day.

Triggers and causes of mental exhaustion vary from person to person, but some common ones include:

▪️having a demanding or high-pressure job
▪️working long hours without taking time off to rest
▪️experiencing financial stress
▪️job dissatisfaction
▪️providing care for a loved one who’s ill or has special needs
▪️living with a chronic illness or mental health condition
▪️losing a loved one
▪️having a baby
▪️lack of work-life balance or emotional support
