The biggest moments of Star Wars that have always stuck out, even more than the iconic dialogues, the epic land and space battles or the brilliant emotional moments, are the lightsaber duels. 

After all, who does not want to see the brilliant glow or hear the sound of a lightsaber. Furthermore, who does not want to witness the sparks emitted as one clashes against the other. 

Well, while the Disney sequel trilogy may have basically made a mockery of this, lightsaber duels form an integral part of the space opera and were previously executed brilliantly from a both emotional and technical standpoint. 

Now that Obi Wan Kenobi’s finale is out, there is a slight disturbance in the old list of duels ranked from best to worst. (Disney sequel movies from episodes 7-9 do not count, because they suck from every single viewpoint)
 
Here are the top ten best Star Wars duels:
 
1.  Obi Wan Kenobi vs Anakin Skywalker (Revenge Of The Sith) 
 
2.  Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan vs Darth Maul (Phantom Menace)
 
3.  Obi Wan Kenobi vs Darth Vader rematch (Obi Wan Kenobi) 
 
4.  Luke vs Darth Vader rematch (Return Of The Jedi)
 
5.  Luke vs Darth Vader ( Empire Strikes Back)
 
6.   Obi Wan vs Anakin- flashback (Obi Wan Kenobi)
