Just social media things
In this day and age, social media has become a part and parcel of our lives. If used rightly, they can be of great value addition. While the clear advantages of social media including global connectivity, can't be denied, it's not all sunshine and roses. They can also adversely affect our mental health, depending on the amount and kind of content we consume everyday. This can set an unhealthy amount of unrealistic standards by exhibiting the seemingly "perfect lifestyle" of people. We must learn to consume them with a grain of salt and not be swayed by everything we see.
