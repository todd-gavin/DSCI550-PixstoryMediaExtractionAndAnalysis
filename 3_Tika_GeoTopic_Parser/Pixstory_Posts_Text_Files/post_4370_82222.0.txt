Although there are no specific diet plans that help or prevent depression. But, there still are certain foods and eating habits which can help you with your overall treatment. 


🍎1. Apple. They are high in antioxidants, which can help to prevent and repair oxidation damage on the cellular level

🍓🫐2. Berries. Bluberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are some of the highest antioxidant foods available to us. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition and Environment Medicine shows that two years of consuming berries, patients had significantly lower depression score

🥑3. Avocado. They are full of healthy fat that your brain needs in order to run and think smoothly.

🥜4. Walnuts. Studies have shown that omega-3 fatty
acids in walnuts can reduce depression symptoms.

🌰5. Beans. They are good for your mood because you'll digest them slowly, which stabilizes blood sugar levels.

🍿6. Seeds. Just like walnuts, they are rich in mood-
boosting omega-3 fatty acid

🍄7. Mushrooms. They are like a probiotic in that they
promote healthy gut bacteria.

🧅8. Onions. They contain high concentrations of anti-
inflammatory flavonoid antioxidants that contribute to their anticancer properties.

🍅09. Tomatoes. Many studies have shown an elevated incidence of folate deficiency in patients with depression. 

Hope this helps✨
