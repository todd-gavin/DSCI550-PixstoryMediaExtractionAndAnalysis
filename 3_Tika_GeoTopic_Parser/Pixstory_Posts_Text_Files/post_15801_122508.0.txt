Three months from now, when the world will enjoy the “beautiful game” in the showpiece event of football, the World Cup 2022 at Qatar, Indian football might find itself plunged into darkness for failing to tackle  its internal problems. In a rather worrying move, FIFA, the governing body of world football, has threatened to suspend the AIFF and strip off its right to host the women’s Under-17 World Cup in October due to a third party “influence”, a development which comes just days after the Supreme Court’s directive to hold elections of the national federation.
The Supreme Court on August 3 directed the executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to expeditiously hold elections as per the schedule proposed by the Committee of Administrators (CoA), which is currently running the affairs of the national federation. The elections were to be held on August 28.
FIFA, however are unhappy with the development. In a letter to AIFF general secretary Sunando Dhar, it has asked the AIFF to provide a copy of the Supreme Court order. “Upon receipt of the said documentation and following its in-depth analysis, should there exist serious deviations to the aforesaid roadmap, we would submit the matter to our relevant decision-making body for further considerations and possible decisions based on FIFA Statutes, including the suspension of the AIFF and the withdrawal of the hosting rights for the 2022 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup in India.”
In a letter, signed by FIFA and AFC General Secretary Fatma Samour and Datuk Windsor John respectively, the world body said the Supreme Court’s order “allegedly” resulted in deviations to the roadmap agreed upon earlier. “Kindly refer to our joint FIFA-AFC letter of 1 July 2022 which addressed the roadmap agreed upon by AIFF and further participants to the meetings organised during a joint mission held on 21-23 June 2022. FIFA and the AFC further reiterated our positions in our joint FIFA-AFC letter sent on 25 July 2022.”
