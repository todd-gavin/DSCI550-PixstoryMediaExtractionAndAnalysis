In the face of a water crisis whose severity is about to exceed what has ever been recorded since the beginning of the last century, we ask that a state of emergency be declared as soon as possible in the territories concerned, taking into account the serious prejudice to national interests. This is what the president of Coldiretti requests Ettore Prandini in the letter sent to Prime Minister Mario Draghi regarding the severe drought affecting the peninsula in requesting the intervention of the civil protection system to coordinate all the subjects involved Regions concerned Basin authorities and reclamation consortia and cooperate for unified management of the water balance Alongside immediate measures to guarantee the food supply of the population, for Prandini the urgency of launching a major national plan for the reservoirs that Coldiretti has been proposing for some time is evident. The President of Coldiretti collects complaints only from rainwater and we could thus avoiding crisis situations such as the one we are suffering again this year These are increasingly recurring emergencies with a cost in recent years that exceeds billions of euros and for this reason concludes Prandini Italy needs new reservoirs to serve the citizens and economic activities such as agriculture which, in the presence of water, could multiply production capacity
