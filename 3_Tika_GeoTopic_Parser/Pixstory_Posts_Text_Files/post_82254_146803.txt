Peace is a violet thing Kashmir The temple was once divine The rivers were pure The air was a breeze of promise And the souls free As gunpowder spread across the skies Blood breathed fire into the silent Gods Running down the Jhelum From veins incessantly into the souls Air was heavy and hard to breathe Which people breathe blood Gods asked Heavy boots defiled the temples Soldiers without warrants barge to arrest In the country without a post office Even the Gods are not allowed hearts And peace is a such a violet thing
