It is this big experiment that is coming to life. MVFW, which starts today i.e., 24 March on virtual real estate platform Decentraland, is the largest digital fashion event till date. It is open to anyone and the full schedule will appear online. With many successful fashion brands including Dolce & Gabbana, Tommy Hilfiger, Paco Rabanne, it's becoming a major crossover event for mainstream fashion. If we think of this event happening it already is enough to impress. It's a highly collective experiment for both participants and observers. 

Brands will be measuring their success in terms of the quality of execution rather than the sales or attendees. Although the appetite for digital fashion has increased over the years, it will be challenging for the luxury brands to take their stand. The Metaverse Fashion Week is like dehumanizing aspect in the Fashion industry. It's a risk for the brands to join in this digitalized event as it might be a game changer or it can be the reason for the downfall of a brand. The step of making the Fashion industry digital seems tricky as fashion has been physical since ages. Some early adopters like Gucci and Adidas host their own virtual events and are not slated to participate in MVFW. They don't want to share their limelight with others. On this, Decentraland mentioned that they are trying to be super decentralized and fair with everybody. There is a lot of friction among the fashion brands. None of the brands wish to come after any other rather they all wish to be in the limelight. 

Brands will be offering NFT's to their audience in different forms. Fashion itself speaks as identity and body language which is much less pronounced in Metaverse, it will be harder for the brands to communicate.
