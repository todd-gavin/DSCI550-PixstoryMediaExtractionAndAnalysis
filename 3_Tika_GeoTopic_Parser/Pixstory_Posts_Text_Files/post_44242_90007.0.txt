Arsenal may not be as big a spender as Chelsea, Manchester City, or Manchester United, but they've made plenty of huge buys over the years, bringing world-class players to the Premier League like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Mesut Ozil, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Unfortunately, the Gunners have had a slew of transfer mistakes to go along with their successes, spending perhaps not as much money as some of their rivals but certainly plunging the club into disrepute.


#5.  Igors Stepanovs

Arsenal have made a slew of terrible purchases throughout the years, but none has drawn as much scorn as the £1.35 million purchase of Latvian defender Igors Stepanovs in 2000. Stepanovs was purportedly brought in to step in for the injured Tony Adams, but after a string of poor performances, it became evident that he would never be able to fill the renowned captain's shoes.

Stepanovs had a promising start to his Arsenal career, scoring on his debut in an EFL Cup match against Ipswich Town, but things quickly went bad as he started at center-back in the Gunners' heart-breaking 6-1 loss to eventual Premier League champions Manchester United. That season, the Latvian would only appear in one more match.


#4.  Marouane Chamakh

Marouane Chamakh, a Moroccan target man, joined Arsenal on a free transfer from Bordeaux in the summer of 2010, and he did so with a lot of hoopla. Chamakh had scored 32 goals in the previous two seasons in France and had a physical resemblance to Cristiano Ronaldo – but sadly for Arsenal supporters, his on-pitch abilities were nowhere like those of the Portuguese legend.

The fact that he only appeared three times for the Hammers, scoring no goals, and then only scored seven goals in 60 Premier League appearances after going to Crystal Palace implies he was never quite up to the task.
