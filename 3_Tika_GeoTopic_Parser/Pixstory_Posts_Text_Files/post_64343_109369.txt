I can relate with this I am doing a course in Stock Market I have come across these things and have even applied it to trading and I have fetched good and useful returns Adding on to this I would also like to share something about the industry and company analysis We should always select that company which gives a positive report in it s financial statements For this we analyse a company s Cash Flow Position Balance Sheet Income Statement etc Selecting a company who s financial health is not so good will lead to poor results I hope this helps Thanks
