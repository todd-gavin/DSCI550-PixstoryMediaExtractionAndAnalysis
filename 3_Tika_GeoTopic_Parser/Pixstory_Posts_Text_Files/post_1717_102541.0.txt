May 25, 2022 happens to be the 123rd birth anniversary of Kazi Nazrul Islam, the rebel poet of Bengal, whose name is taken with the same awe and reverence as Tagore's. Even though Nazrul often challenged Tagore’s domination in the literary space through his articles in 'Kallol ', a Left-leaning magazine, both laureates shared a deep respect for each other and extended support where necessary.

At a time when the world is breaking into fragments, and India's secular sentiment is being questioned, it is crucial to hark back to the life of Bengali poet, journalist, composer and activist Kazi Nazrul Islam. He was a remarkable literary genius and a true rebel, who on his quest for self-expression and freedom of thought, preached unforgettable lessons on pluralism, secularism and the importance of an egalitarian society. He is also the national poet of Bangladesh.

Controversy’s favourite child, Nazrul set his first example of communal harmony through his marriage to Brahmo Samaj’s Pramila Sengupta on 25 April 1924, which irritated flag bearers of both faiths. A Muslim man binding himself in matrimony with a Hindu woman was rare at the time, but Nazrul’s love for Pramila surpassed religious hurdles. Nazrul’s secular spirit is evident in the choice of his children’s names – Kazi Sabyasachi, Krishna Mohammed and Kazi Aniruddha.

A proponent of both 'Shaktism' (a form of Hinduism centred around goddess Shakti) and Islamic principles, Nazrul once said, “Open your heart — within you dwell all the religions. All the prophets — your heart. Is the universal temple…. Why do you search for God in vain? Within the skeletons of dead scriptures. When he smilingly resides in your immortal heart?”

Influenced by Kabir, Nanak and Akbar’s Din-i-ilahi, Kazi Nazrul Islam preached and practised a form of religious pluralism and syncretism that is unheard of even today but is a particular need of the hour.
