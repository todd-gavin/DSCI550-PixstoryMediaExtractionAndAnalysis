The majority of people believe that essential products are those that mankind cannot live without. Water and food are included, but not period products.

There is a segment of the population who does not require any period products. Men outnumber women in the world, according to statistics. This does not account for women who do not menstruate for a variety of reasons, including biological deficiencies, physical trauma, and other body impediments.

Furthermore, the government is able to earn cash for a stable market by taxing these period products. A 6% tax on period products is a tiny amount to pay, especially in a country where poverty levels are higher than the international average and our national debt continues to rise. Including the tampon tax, the average woman spends roughly $9 per month on period products. Plus, there's a case for free birth control if there's a case for free period goods. When it comes to luxury taxes, where does the government draw the line?

If we go by your logic, everything should be free. Food, water, medicines, homes. They're all essentials. Then where's the government supposed to get tax for the development of the nation from? Are freeloaders what you want our future generations to become?
