These terms are just less direct ways of saying you do not care about the violations of women's rights that have happened over the centuries or more and would rather focus more on hypothetical situations created for cisgendered heterosexual males instead.

If you believe in equality, you're automatically a feminist. To be a feminist or to believe in equality, you need to see what's going on in the real world, you need to accept that our world is a messed up place that puts too much importance on the value of a man and is suffocatingly male dominant. To believe in equality, you need to step out of your fancy land of things-that-never-happen, you need to raise above the "what ifs", you need to see what's in front.

Calling yourself an equalist is an easy escape from that kind of responsibility. It is pretending that there's a levelled field for both men and women when there's clearly not. If you truly care about equality, you are a feminist. Everything else may just be a farce, an easy way out or even faking concern. You can't base realistic approaches on imaginary situations.
