Hundreds of passengers were stranded at various airports after many SpiceJet flights scheduled for Wednesday morning departure were disrupted due to an alleged ransomware attack on the airline.
A spokesperson confirmed the development, saying that a ransomware attack on Tuesday night had slowed flight departures this morning. However, the airline's IT team was able to contain and correct the situation, and flights are now operating normally.

Mr. Ajay Singh's Indian airline, Spacejet, has long faced criticism, and my own experience with the airline has been negative.
The company's services are not up to mark, its communication and operations are inefficient, and it takes too long to respond to passengers' queries and questions. Planes are also uncomfortable; most of them cause ear pain, and the seats are uncomfortable too.
