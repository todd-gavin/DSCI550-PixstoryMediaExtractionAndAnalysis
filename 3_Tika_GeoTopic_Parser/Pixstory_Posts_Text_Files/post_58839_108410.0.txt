An Islamic State-claimed attack on a gurdwara in Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Saturday killed at least two people and injured seven, officials said.

The local branch of Islamic State said on an affiliated Telegram channel that the attack was in response to insults directed at the Prophet Mohammed, an apparent reference to remarks made by an Indian government spokeswoman that have been condemned by many Muslim-majority countries.

Images aired by domestic broadcaster Tolo showed grey smoke billowing over the area. According to a Taliban interior spokesman, attackers loaded a car with explosives, but it exploded before reaching its target.

Gornam Singh, a gurdwara official, said there were about 30 people inside the building at the time.


One Sikh worshipper was killed in the attack, according to a spokesman for Kabul's commander, and one Taliban fighter was killed as his forces took control of the area.

The Taliban claim to have increased security in Afghanistan and removed militant threats since taking power in August, but international officials and analysts say the risk of a resurgence in militancy remains.

In recent months, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks.


Sikhs, like other religious minorities, have been repeatedly targeted by violence in Afghanistan. The Islamic State also claimed responsibility for a 2020 attack on another gurdwara in Kabul that killed 25 people.

The explosion on Saturday came after a previous day's blast at a mosque in the northern city of Kunduz, which killed one person and injured two, according to authorities.
