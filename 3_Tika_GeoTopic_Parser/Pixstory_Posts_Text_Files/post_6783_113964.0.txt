Several other news outlets – Dainik Jagran, News Nation, TV9 Hindi, Asianet News, Jansatta, Zee Madhya Pradesh – amplified the claim, along with the right-wing propaganda website Kreately. Shivam Dixit and Ritesh Kashyap of RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya, ABP News journalists Brajesh Rajput and Adarsh Jha, BJP Madhya Pradesh media in-charge Lokendra Parashar, right wing propaganda website Falana Dikhana, Santosh Chauhan of Sudarshan News, and Sujeet Swami of Newsroom Post were also among those who furthered the claim on social media.

The video is widespread on Facebook and Twitter with the accompanying claim.

Fact-check
We examined the viral video carefully and noticed that the slogans being chanted were ‘Wazid bhai won – Wazid bhai won’ (जीत गया भाई जीत गया – वाज़िद भाई जीत गया) and ‘Long live Wazid bhai’ (वाज़िद भाई ज़िंदाबाद). We also slowed down the video and could not hear any pro-Pakistan sloganeering. Below is the video at 0.80x speed.

Sheikh Saeed alias Wazid is the husband of Rahisha Begum, the candidate who won the sarpanch election from the Chaka Gram Panchayat in Madhya Pradesh’s Katni district. Women are often fielded as proxy candidates in India for seats that have women’s reservations or if the candidate’s husband is already occupying another position. Therefore, a female contender’s victory is often celebrated with cheers for her husband.

We reached out to Wazid who also said that there were no slogans raised in support of Pakistan.
