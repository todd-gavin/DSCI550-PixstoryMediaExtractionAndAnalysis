Yue He Jie Chen Abstract Aims Extracellular vesicle EV transferred microRNAs miRNAs are proved to be potentially therapeutic candidates Here we attempted to unveil the role of delivery of miR c p by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells hUCMSCs derived EVs in diabetic retinopathy DR Methods miR c p and PLCG expression in streptozotocin induced diabetes mellitus DM rats and high glucose HG treated human retinal endothelial cells HRECs was quantified followed by analysis on their interaction EVs were isolated from hUCMSCs and co cultured with HRECs Through gain and loss of function assays the role of hUCMSCs derived EV containing miR c p in DR involving PLCG and NF B pathway was analyzed in vitro and in vivo Results Elevated PLCG was found in DM rats and HG treated HRECs where miR c p was reduced while increased in hUCMSC derived EVs PLCG was pinpointed as a target gene of miR c p which consequently disrupted the PKC NF B pathway hUCMSC derived EVs decreased inflammation reaction by transferring miR c p in DM rats and HG treated HRECs Furthermore similar changing tendency was observed in HG treated HRECs induced by overexpressed miR c p through downregulation of PLCG in vivo Conclusion Overall our findings underlined delivery of miR c p by hUCMSC derived EVs as a novel suppressor in the inflammatory response following DR Sources
