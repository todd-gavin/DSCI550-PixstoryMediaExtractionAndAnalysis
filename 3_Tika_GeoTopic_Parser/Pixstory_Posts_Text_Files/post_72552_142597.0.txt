Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) has ordered all giant companies of telecom services to extended the recharge days from 28 to 30 days.
It is alleged that the current policy of 28 days recharging facility is the manipulative procedure of companies to earn more profit as the user needed to recharge 13 times a year according to this policy.
