Meditation is about connecting with the completeness of the here and now The way we teach it it s very grounded You sit straight and still observe let go come back and discover the rich fullness of the present moment Find a quiet place and settle on a comfortable chair bench or cushion You may want to decide how much time you d like to devote to sitting in the beginning Consistency is key Even a few minutes every day will get you off to a great start Take a moment to check in with your posture Try to find a position that allows you to keep your back straight Set aside your industrious conceptual mind Breathe Tune in to the feeling of being present Take stock of your physical presence as you breathe Note physical tensions and mental concerns Acknowledge them with kindness and invite them to relax and release Tune in to the process of breathing Feel the breath in your belly Don t concern yourself with analyzing or modifying your respiration just feel it and center your awareness on the ebb and flow Breathe in you re aware that you re breathing in Breathe out you re aware that you re breathing out When you notice that your mind has wandered gently but firmly bring it back to the breath This is mindfulness training in awareness acknowledging letting go and coming home to the breath and the present moment
