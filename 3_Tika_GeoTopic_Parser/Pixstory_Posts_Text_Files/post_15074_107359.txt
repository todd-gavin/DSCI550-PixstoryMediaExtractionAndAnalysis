The situation in the Po River basin, a field of made in Italy agri-food products, is becoming dramatic, but where, in the persistent absence of rains, drastic choices are now on the verge of making the river Po guarantee a sufficient flow rate for drinking water and to counteract the rise of the salt wedge which is altering the environmental balance in the delta by drying up the territories from the source to the mouth not only are the flows in the riverbed largely below what has been recorded in recent years but in Pontelagoscuro with cubic meters per second they have fallen abundantly below the previous historical minimum set at mc sec In the face of this emergency, we ask for the immediate activation of a control room that includes the main technical and political bodies to evaluate, in compliance with legal priorities, all possible solutions and consequent actions regarding water releases and withdrawals in the river bed, governing the inevitable problems that will follow declares Francesco Vincenzi President of the National Association of Consortia for the Management and Protection of the Territory and Irrigated Waters ANBI Around the table coordinated by the Civil Protection should sit in addition to ANBI the Regions concerned Piedmont Lombardy Emilia Romagna Veneto the Basin Authorities district of the Po river and the Eastern Alps the representatives of the electricity managers and the main stakeholders The next few weeks will be the most critical for the crops in the field and water stress would jeopardize their yield or could even cause the partial or total loss of production for this ANBI recalls the need not to limit the evaluations to simple hydro-meteorological considerations but also to analyze the overall water condition of the territories and above all the phenological state of the crops also considering the strategic objective of increasing the food self-sufficiency of the country. We hope Vincenzi concludes that the seriousness of the situation and the evidence of the emergency in progress urgently induces to start the necessary infrastructure of the territory starting from new basins to retain rainwater and counter the consequences of climate change by increasing the resilience of the communities
