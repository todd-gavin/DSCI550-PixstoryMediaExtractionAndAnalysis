I am from Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh. I've lived in this city for the past eighteen years. The city has given me with wonderful experiences and memories, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
One aspect of my city that I would like to improve is the availability and supply of electricity. During the monsoon season, the supply of electricity is frequently shut down, and people in many societies are forced to live without electricity for hours. It is inconvenient for them and disrupts their daily routine.
People require a reliable electricity supply, so I believe this is something I would like to change.
