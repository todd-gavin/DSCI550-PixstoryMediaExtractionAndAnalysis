Rhiannan Iffland of Australia has won the women's 2021 Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series for the fifth time in a row.

Iffland and French diver Gary Hunt, who won the men's title, won in style on Sunday afternoon with dives from the 21.5-metre platform in Polignano a Mare, Italy (local time).

Earlier in the week, the two athletes had won their championships at the diving tour's second-to-last stop in Puglia.

It was Hunt's ninth trophy win in 12 seasons, while Iffland is making a name for himself on the spectacular European circuit.

"I'm so proud of myself," Iffland, 30, said.

She made history earlier this year when she became the first person in the world to jump out of a moving hot air balloon.

"This year's competition was very, very strong, and I knew that before I even arrived at the start of the season," she explained.

"I had to keep pushing harder and harder." It feels good to be a trailblazer and the female leader."

After a 21-month hiatus, the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series returned in 2021.
