A true legend of the Premier League, a star in his own right, and one of the most renowned players of his time, Jermaine Defoe has decided to call time on his playing career. 

Defoe, who played for Tottenham Hotspurs, West Ham United, and Sunderland in the Premier League announced his decision to hang up his boots in a statement released on Twitter earlier on Wednesday. 

He will finish his career, having earned a legend’s status with 162 Premier League goals to his name, along with 20 strikes to show for his international duties with England, whom he represented 57 times. 

The 39-year-old had only recently joined Sunderland for the second time in January 2022, before finally deciding to retire for good. 

Taking to Twitter, Jermaine Defoe penned a heartfelt note, confirming his retirement. He wrote, ”After 22 years in the game, I have decided to retire from professional football. It's been a really tough decision, and one I have discussed with my family and those closest to me.”

The statement further read, “Football will always be in my blood, and it gives me great pride and satisfaction to look back on the blessed career that I've had. I now look forward to spending some quality time with my friends and family before moving forward on this next chapter in my career.”

“Lastly, I want to say thank you to my mum. You gave me a ball at two years old and you made me believe my dream could happen. All that I am is because of you, and I owe everything to you and God,” he concluded. 

In his much-celebrated career, Defoe also represented the likes of Portsmouth, AFC Bournemouth, MLS side Toronto FC, and most recently, Scottish club Rangers, before joining Sunderland again in the winter transfer window.
