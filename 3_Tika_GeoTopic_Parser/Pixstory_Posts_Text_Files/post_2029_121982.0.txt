Indiana Representative Jackie Walorski and her two staff members, Zachary Potts (27) and Emma Thomson (28), tragically perished in a car accident. Representatives from across all sides of the political spectrum offered their sympathies. Additionally, Nancy Pelosi ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in commemoration of Walorski.

Walroski, a Republican, was elected to Congress for the first time in 2012 and began serving in January of 2013; before to that, she served from 2005 to 2010 in the Indiana House of Representatives.

During her time in government, she introduced legislation to increase the death gratuity paid to the families of military personnel killed in active duty.  In addition, she voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and backed Republican policies like the prohibition on late-term abortions, border security, and tax cuts.

The outpouring of love for her demonstrates that despite our differing viewpoints, we are all humans who will live just one life on earth. We do not spit on the graves of the departed, but instead put aside our disagreements and recognize that the deceased was only a person with different views who nonetheless sought to do good.
