There are always questions on why feminism has 'fem' of female in it and stands for equality. 
May I counter with another question why does a female have 'male' in it and a woman has 'man' in it? 

Women were always considered secondary to men. Hence treated as an inferior to whom the freedom was 'granted' by men. This is similar for every oppressed caste, class or gender. Feminism, begun when women realised that they deserve a better life, a life that is similar to men. Later on, it got into the psyche of patriarchy, the power that gives control. 

I cannot understand why women and LGBTQ+ are not getting 'equal' representation in politics but a 'reservation'. When can we expect a world wherein women being anything isn't a surprise but is normal?
