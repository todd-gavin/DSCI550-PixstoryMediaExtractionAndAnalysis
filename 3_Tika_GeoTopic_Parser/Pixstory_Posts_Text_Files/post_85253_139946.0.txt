4 Xavi Hernandez  
Xavi Hernandez will be remembered as one of the greatest football passers of all time. Before making his professional debut in 1998, Xavi spent six seasons in the club's development system after joining at 10. Since then, he has won the World Cup, two European Championships, three European Cups, and seven La Liga championships. 
He finished third on the Ballon d'Or voting twice, but if it weren't for the merger of Messi Messi and Cristiano, he very definitely would have won at least once. As criminal partners, Xavi and Iniesta made a magnificent team that we might never see again. It is almost difficult to imagine another duo entering the game with such heft and power. These guys were titans on the pitch. They revolutionized the midfield position and gave Lionel Messi the space and support he needed to excel. We had the honor of seeing them.
5 Lionel Messi 
Nothing more needs to be said about the Argentine maestro, so here are some statistics from his illustrious stint at the Nou Camp. The teenage player from Newell's Old Boys came to Barcelona in 2000 when the club promised to cover the cost of his growth hormone therapy.
Messi made his debut in 2004 after 4 years at La Masia, and by 2009, most people thought he was the finest player in all of football. The 26-year-old has indeed claimed the Ballon d'Or four times. In addition to several domestic and European championships, he has also achieved more than 50 goals in a campaign three times, with a high point of 73 in 2011–12.
