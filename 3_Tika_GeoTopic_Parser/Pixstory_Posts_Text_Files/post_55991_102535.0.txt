The much-awaited verdict on party culture in Downing Street is out now. The 37-page report encompasses nine photographs and names a list of senior civil servants.

Gray details Gray's embarrassing detail of how each event unfolded, comprising a leaving party on 18 June 2020 at which “one individual was sick” and “there was a minor altercation between two other individuals”. The report says that whatever took place in the event it was not in accordance with covid guidance at that time.

In his first public response to Gray’s report, Johnson issued a qualified apology for the boozy culture that developed in Downing Street during the pandemic, saying he took “full responsibility”.

However, he insisted he regarded it as “one of the essential duties of leadership” to “briefly” attend leaving events and thank retiring staff, because “it was appropriate to recognise and to thank them for the work that they had done”.

Details of the gatherings include security logs indicating some staff carried on partying until 4 am after the leaving do for the director of communications, James Slack, cleaners giving proof of spilt wine over the walls, and messages notifying drunken staff to leave via the back entrance. There were nine photographs relate to two gatherings – the June 2020 birthday party

Officials in No 10 were given the chance to read printed copies of the report in a locked room before it was disclosed on Wednesday morning.

Gray revealed she had not properly investigated the gathering held in Johnson’s flat, where five special advisers attended and alcohol was provided.

Gray also said she was told about “multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff”, which she described as “unacceptable”. The prime minister attended eight of the events according to the report Gray. MPs should decide whether they have to vote for no confidence in Boris Johnson.
