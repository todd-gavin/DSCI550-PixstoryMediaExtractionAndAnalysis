This is the persisting mood that I think most people are in while living their daily lives😂🤦‍♀️
Yes, there are moments of confusion in your life when you question your existence and why you're doing anything😂
But this is more of an accepted confusion that yeah okay I'm doing this, I have to do this, don't really understand why, but I have to, so yeah I'm doing it😂
