The coaches after coming to train the kids once a week for some time,  decided that they should come to train the kids thrice a week. Once they started doing this they noticed that some of the children didn’t come up to the training regularly and were going here and there. The coaches sensed that the children lacked discipline and as the children didn’t have anything to gain they weren’t as eager to come thrice. To avoid this happening any further the coaches made a plan and decided to gather the kids up the next time they went to train them. They wanted to give a pep talk to the kids.

When they returned they gathered up the kids and told them about the things they could achieve through football. They told them about how they can first improve their living conditions and fulfill all their dreams by making it big in football.  After telling them all the benefits that they can get, the coaches told the kids that they’ll not come from tomorrow as the kids don’t seem interested in football. After hearing this, the children went to the coaches and told them that they’ll listen to them and come to training every day. The plan of the coaches to discipline the kids worked out well. At this moment the training was only for children of sex workers, when the news of football training got out, parents of children from other marginalized communities also came to send their children to train. This is how Darbur Sports Academy started.
