Karim Benzema of Real Madrid has been on a tear in the Champions League, and he recently 
set a new record. This season, the Frenchman has scored 12 goals in the competition, including seven in the knockout stages. He became only the fifth player in history to score at least seven times in the elimination rounds in a single season in the process.

He has a hat-trick against PSG, a hat-trick against Chelsea, and a goal against Chelsea on 
Tuesday. With such a strong run of form, Benzema has risen to second place in the Champions League Golden Boot race, trailing only Robert Lewandowski (13).

But, with Bayern Munich out in the quarter-finals and no other contenders in sight, the Real Madrid star has a clear path to the title.

Only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Sadio Mane, and Neymar have ever scored seven or more knockout stage goals in a single season. 
Ronaldo is the only player to have done it three times, and he is the only player to have done it 
more than once! He scored seven goals in the 2011-12 season's playoffs, eight more in 2013-14, and a whopping ten in 2016-17.

Messi's only other appearance in the knockout rounds came in the 2011-12 season, when he 
scored 12 goals, including five in a game against Bayer Leverkusen. In the 2014-15 season, Neymar scored seven Champions League knockout stage goals en route to Barcelona's fifth victory, and three years later, Mane achieved the same.

Benzema has been the driving force behind Real Madrid's Champions League push,scoring seven of their eight goals in the knockout stages. This season, he's been on fire, but he's also showed the ability to step up to the plate and deliver when it matters most.
