Abstract
Background
Inflammatory dysregulation may be linked with mental health disturbances in people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), however no previous studies have examined longitudinal associations between inflammatory stress responses and mental health outcomes in T2D.
Purpose
To better understand the biological mechanisms that might predispose people with T2D to poor mental health in the future.
Methods
At baseline, 140 participants with T2D participated in a laboratory stress testing study (mean age = 64 years). Participants underwent two mental stress tasks and blood was sampled before and up to 45 min post-stress to detect plasma interleukin (IL)-6. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale and the Short Form-36 Health Survey were completed at baseline and 7.5 years later. We tested associations between IL-6 stress responses and a) depression symptoms and b) mental health-related quality of life (QoL) at baseline and at follow-up using linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Results: Up to 66 participants provided follow-up data. In cross-sectional analyses, increased IL-6 stress responses immediately post-task were associated with lower mental health-related quality of life (B = −21.73, p = 0.005, 95% CI [-36.82, −6.63]) adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. In longitudinal analyses, increased IL-6 stress responses at 45 min post-task were associated with increased depressive symptoms (B = 10.31 p = 0.048, 95% CI [0.10, 20.51]) and decreased mental health-related QoL (B = −21.18 p = 0.031, 95% CI [-40.34, −2.02]) adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. The association between the 45-min IL-6 response and depressive symptoms at follow-up was diminished after further adjustment for physical health-related QoL and baseline depressive symptoms (B = 10.14, p = 0.055, 95% CI [-0.21,20.48]).
Conclusions
This study supports the link between inflammatory stress responsivity and future mental health outcomes in people with T2D. Further research involving a larger sample size is required.
