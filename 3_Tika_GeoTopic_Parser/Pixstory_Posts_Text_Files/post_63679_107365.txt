More you go into the Assassin s Creed franchise the less it seems to have anything to do with Assassin s Creed anymore instead now becoming another recycled rehashed pile of trash which just does not work anymore You think that Ubisoft would learn by now but instead of a joyride into the Animus playing as badass characters like Altair Ezio Connor Edward Haytham and Shay I feel more like I m caught in some second grade pseudo historical fantasy game which is pretending to be Assassin s Creed As if the base game of Assassin s Creed Vallaha was not a repetitive enough cheap Witcher trie hard pile of crap now Valhalla is going roguelite mode with their new Forgotten Saga Remember the time when Ezio and Altair discovered the Apple of Eden the great historical designs of those games new combat editions playing as a Templar in ASC and then in Rogue or sailing out to the seas as a pirate turned noble assassin in ASC Well forget all that The trailer looks more like an Elden Ring DLC and Ubisoft should retitle the game and say Forgot this was Assassin s Creed Forget the great atmosphere and historical accuracy of the earlier games this is Call Of Duty melee and parkour edition Pls Ubisoft retitle this in all seriousness Assassin s Creed The Elden Ring edition or something at least it d be accurate Another worthless cash grab please actually make an Assassin s Creed game or just stop I still remember my first kill with a hidden blade damn times have changed really fast
