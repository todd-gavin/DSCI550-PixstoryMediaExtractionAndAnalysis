More and more patients between the age of 20 and 30 years come with heart problems: the reason is diabetes which is a major risk factor in these patients. There are many patients who come with hypertension and the reason is exposure to excessive stress and strain in life. Being overweight and obese, having junk food, and not doing much exercise are other reasons which have increased the incidence of heart attacks. 

We have seen an exponential rise in the incidence of heart attacks in cigarette smokers. And even electronic cigarettes are not free of problems, they are a major risk factor. Your heart attacks are directly proportional to the number of cigarettes you smoke. Smoking one pack a day doubles your risk of heart attacks compared to nonsmokers. While we have a misconception that smoking or vaping does not cause much of a problem. The problem is that very little is known about these things and very few people know that even an electronic cigarette is a health hazard and leads to serious heart problems. 34% of the patients who smoke electronic cigarettes may have a heart attack as compared to non-smokers.
