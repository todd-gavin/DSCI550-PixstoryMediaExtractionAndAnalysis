Caoimhin Kelleher is content to play second fiddle to Alisson Becker at Liverpool as long as the Republic of Ireland retains his place That s the opinion of former Tottenham Hotspur and England captain Paul Robinson who spoke exclusively to Football Insider regarding the year future old s on Merseyside On Saturday Kelleher began for Ireland in a friendly against Belgium which ended in a draw Ireland manager Stephen Kenny praised the absolutely brilliant goalkeeper and said he would start against Lithuania according to the Liverpool Echo March Kelleher is behind Alisson at Anfield but Jurgen Klopp put his faith in him in the League Cup final When asked if Kelleher would likely stay on Merseyside if he continued to play in international games Robinson told Football Insider He has got a fair bit of game time this season The fact Klopp played him in the cup final says a lot His international career has not been hampered by the fact he s not the number one at Liverpool If he was missing three quarters of the season and not getting a chance at international level that would be an issue As long as he is playing a certain percentage of the games and is his country s number one I think he ll be happy to stay There will come a point where he will want to play every week though He is not going to be one of these guys who sits on the bench for his whole career How much patience does he have I suspect he is very happy at the moment but there will come a time
