The Maharashtra administration is in danger of falling because of the fierce fighting inside the Shiv Sena Eknath Shinde the head of the rebel camp has a number of alternatives for his next move in the middle of the crisis Due to their absence from the legislature party meeting on Wednesday rebels including Eknath Shinde have been asked to withdraw their candidacies by the Shiv Sena which is led by Uddhav Thackeray Mr Shinde will lose his position as a legislator and all of his efforts will be for naught if the disqualification is upheld Although it will be a drawn out procedure he will have the option of moving court According to Dr Anant Kalse a former principal secretary of the Maharashtra Assembly Mr Shinde s other choice is to write to the Governor and request a no trust vote However there is a problem The Shinde group will have to join forces with a party that has two thirds of the Sena s MLAs in order to comply with the anti defection law Their claims to the legacy of Sena founder Bal Thackeray will be undermined if they unite with the BJP putting their political future in jeopardy They might possibly try to unite with the Prahar Janshakti Party of independent MLA Bacchu Kudu two of the party s current MLAs have joined the Shinde camp The Shinde group will have to seek the Election Commission and seize possession of the party emblem if it hopes to unseat Mr Thackeray as leader of Sena Team Thackeray has emphasised that this is against the party constitution and that they still have the backing of grassroots leaders In order to end the dispute Mr Shinde can also try to come to an arrangement with Mr Thackeray This window appears to be disappearing quickly though as the two sides verbal battle escalates
