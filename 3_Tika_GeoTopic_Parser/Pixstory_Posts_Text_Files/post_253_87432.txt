I found my way across Parc du Champ de Mars a park named after Campus Martius Latin for the Field of Mars as a tribute to the Roman god of war a fitting name to describe the sparse cherry blossoms that were either healing from winter bites or withering despite a forthcoming spring This conflict of spring carries forward a legacy of significant moments from the French Revolution Parc du Champs has witnessed Bastille Day the Champ de Mars massacre and the guillotining of Jean Sylvain Bailly the first mayor of Paris I didn t know this at the time I got distracted by the Eiffel Tower whose criss cross design held its own stories of contradictions from preceding centuries here s an excerpt from a petition called Artists against the Eiffel Tower published by Le Temps on February We writers painters sculptors architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris protest with all our strength with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste against the erection of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower To bring our arguments home imagine for a moment a giddy ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame the Tour Saint Jacques the Louvre the Dome of les Invalides the Arc de Triomphe all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream And for twenty years we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal I m no artist but I d be lying if I didn t say that the bristle bareness of cherry blossoms and the sharpening brightness of the sun did make the eiffel tower look slightly plastic what does metal know about the changing seasons that mean life and death for the next bloom Why do we make photos of something that s already been memorialized Is it a way to memorialize ourselves Disclaimer The first photo isn t from this day but looked better than the others in my opinion Up Next Arc de Triomphe
