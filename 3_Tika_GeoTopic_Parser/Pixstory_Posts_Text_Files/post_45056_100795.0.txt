Prior to the start of the new season, the 25-year-old Ivorian has decided to make his stay in the
Black Country permanent.

Sporting Charleroi have signed forward Vakoun Issouf Bayo from Belgian Pro League rivals
KAA Gent on a permanent basis.

The 25-year-old Ivory Coast international joined Charleroi on loan from the Buffalos at the start
of the season, but the two teams have agreed to extend the term until June 2026.

"Sporting Charleroi is glad to announce that it has achieved an agreement with Vakoun [Bayo],"
the team said on their website. "Bayo is currently under contract with us until June 2026, after
the club's exercise of the purchase option."

"Bayo, who came over from the Buffalo Sabres this winter, immediately established himself as a
goal scorer, scoring eleven goals in 17 games and adding four assists."

"The staff, management, players, and the entire huge Sporting family are thrilled with the
prolongation of Bayo's stay under our colors," the statement read.

"After a loan term, the 25-year-old Ivorian attacker joins permanently in the Black Country,"
Gent's official website stated. In the summer of 2021, Bayo arrived from Toulouse.

He appeared
in our club colors seven times in all.

"He moved on loan to Sporting Charleroi in the winter, and the club now has the option to buy
him."

Bayo is an Ivorian professional footballer who joined Dunajska Streda in March 2018 after being
born on January 10, 1997. On March 18, 2018, he made his Slovak league debut against SK
Slovan Bratislava.

In January 2019, Bayo joined Celtic of the Scottish Premiership. As a result, he was left out of
the team for the remainder of the 2018-19 Uefa Europa League.

Bayo agreed to join French side Toulouse on a one-year loan with an option to purchase on
August 12, 2020, and Charleroi on a loan until the end of the season on December 22, 2021,
both with an option to buy.
