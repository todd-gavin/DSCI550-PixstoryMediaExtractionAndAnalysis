The transfers made by PSG this season were really good at an individualistic level but after seeing them play for some time, the gaping holes in the team were clear. If we look at the front three or Neymar,  Mbappe and Messi. No one of the three presses, or comes back quickly to help the defence out. They're seen strolling back, hence in a counter they're hit back very easily. This gets more worse when we see their two full back Nuno Mendes and Hakimi push higher up a lot. They're a very attacking minded team, in Ligue 1 this works, they outscore teams easily and even keep clean sheets but when the competition get tougher like in the Champions League, these little things haunt them. In their match against Real Madrid, two of Madrid's goals were on a counter and Madrid players had too much space, no one was closing down. 

Their structure just falls apart on a quick paced counter. Can this be blamed on the manager though? I think rather not because its clear that the upper hierarchy calls the shots on transfers at the club. Did Mauricio Pochettino want all these player? 

According to me, the problem with PSG is that they don't play like a team, the players don't compliment each others playing style. It's evident when they are backed against a corner the team just doesn't know how to respond, no matter how many big stars they have. The future looks very uncertain for the players as well as the manager at the club. Mbappe's running out his contract and as it's rumoured he might be going to Real Madrid at the end of the season. Neymar might be let go off as the rumours are going around along with Ramos. Messi might be looking at a return to Barcelona. Whatever happens only time will tell but PSG really need to pull themselves together as a unit if they want to win the coveted Champions League next season.
