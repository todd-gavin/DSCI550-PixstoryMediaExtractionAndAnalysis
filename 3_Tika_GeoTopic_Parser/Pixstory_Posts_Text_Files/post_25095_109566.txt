Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville is no stranger when it comes to voicing his opinions The year old has torn into the Glazers once again after it was confirmed that the Manchester United owners will squeeze out millions out of the club via dividends The Red Devils endured a nightmare season in the last campaign and there is plenty of work to be done in the summer transfer window Erik ten Hag has assumed the role of a permanent manager at Old Trafford replacing Interim manager Ralf Rangnick This means that there will be plenty of new signings coming in this summer and as such drawing funds out of the club makes no sense Frenkie de Jong Jurrien Timber are among a few names heavily linked to the club however no progress has been made yet Gary Neville believes that the priority of the owners should be getting the club back to the top rather than focusing on their own selfish needs Every penny has to go back into the club until it becomes attractive again The club has become a graveyard for players Culturally for owners to take cash out of a poorly performing business is demoralising said Neville as quoted by the Daily Star It is known that the Glazers will be taking home million pounds in dividends something which has not pleased Gary Neville He demands an announcement to stop this for the next three years given that the club cash position is not as strong as it should be The Glazer Family should NOT be taking m in dividends this Friday It isn t right with the investment needed in the team stadium and training ground The clubs cash position is low compared to previous years An announcement is needed to halt it for the next three years minimum said Neville
