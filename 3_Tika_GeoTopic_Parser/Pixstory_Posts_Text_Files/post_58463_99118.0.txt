When we talk about care, we don't talk about putting the rights of the person first: of the healthcare provider and the healthcare people. It doesn't come from a rights-perspective. It comes from a very patronizing perspective, placing the onus or blame on the person seeking healthcare. 

I'm a very privileged, car-driving, advocate, who has a full-time job. Now think about the trans people who don't have this access, who do not have documents.

I can't write my name on a healthcare form, or say, 'Please call me by my name.' 

I try to negotiate with my workplace, and they're very understanding, but the next workplace will not be understanding. I will have to go and counsel them.

Till when will trans people keep doing this, just to access basic care? I have skin issues but I don't think I can go to any dermatologist in Delhi as myself. This is what I fear when I transition. 

I can go to Bangkok, I can go to all the hospitals in Delhi and get surgery done, but post-op care is not just about post-op care. It's also about the kind of affirming healthcare we need, for those of us who medically transition. 

That is the anxiety that all of us are living with. And frankly, I have learned more about trans-affirming surgeries and hormones on Reddit, than on any Indian healthcare website.
