#1. United will only improve as the season progresses
While United’s players deserve massive praise for their recent rise in form in the league, it is clear that they are still adapting to Ten Hag’s tactics. It seems the foundation has been built by Ten Hag with the players showing high levels of work rate. Now United can build on this and begin to show further development.
Given the fact that the players seem to be onboard with their manager’s plans, they will surely improve as the season progresses. Glimpses have been seen so far of United adapting with the players responding well to Ten Hag’s instructions. This will be seen in the Europa League and by the time the crucial knockout fixtures come around, United will have significantly improved which means is a key factor why they can win the Europa League this season.
