Standout Performers

1. Mo Salah

As always, Mo Salah delivers when it matters. Finishing another fantastic season on top of the
goals and assists sheets with 23 goals scored and 13 assisted, the Egyptian winger was crucial
to Liverpool’s attacking prowess. As always, his dynamism and speed had defenders on the
backfoot all game, as teams were wary to push high against Liverpool with the speed of Salah
on the counterattack.

He scored his 100th goal for Liverpool this season and became the first
player to score in the opening game of five consecutive Premier League campaigns.

2. Alisson

A vital part of the way Liverpool play, Alisson had another amazing season in goal. Tied joint
most for clean sheets (20) with Ederson, the Brazilian goalkeeper’s one on one prowess is
unparalleled.

Alisson is great at coming down and narrowing the angle for attackers in one on
one situations, which enables Liverpool to play their high line to catch the opposition offside. In
the few instances where the opposition manages to beat the offside trap, Alisson is there to
sweep up and save the day.

Alisson’s distribution is vital to Liverpool’s quick counter attacking threat. His throwing and
kicking ability manages to put an attacker into threatening positions with loads of space ahead
of him. With 180 interceptions, he finds himself second in the league in coming out and claiming
crosses.

What’s Next For Liverpool?

Liverpool have the Champions League final with Real Madrid to look forward to. Beyond that,
the most important signing they could make in the summer would be to have Mo Salah sign an
extension. Salah has not signed an extension so far and his contract expires next summer.

Apart from that, signing quality backup at left back would ensure the team has serviceable
players in all positions to mount a Premier League title challenge again next season.
