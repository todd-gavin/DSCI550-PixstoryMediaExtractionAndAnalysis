Story by one of my school friends.(AFGHANISTAN)
The Taliban government came to power; The barriers, and the laws that are being declared against women every day, have made Afghan women suffer a lot, and depression and mental health are the main problems that women face today.

Here is my friend with the obstacles she faces. Copes with internal problems, mental health and depression and is believed to make a better life.

Yh, i suffered!
I have experienced and still itâ€™s going on everyday, we are living in this world not to relax not to be happy forever but to struggle with whatever is going on. 
Iâ€™m an Afghan girl, everyday I face new things which is not what we want and it really hurts. like ( Taliban, economy problem, thoughts of pple, family problem, personal problem, mental problem, physical problem, my own financial problem, depression, problem with society, security problem, bad news, my own feeling, pple behavior, education problem .....and so on) even sometimes i care for pple out of our country and other muslims ...welllll there are alot of thoughts that hurt me deeply so muchhhhh and itâ€™s hard to explainqqqqq. 
These were some of reasons that become the cuz of stress anxiety, 
BUT how Iâ€™m trying to fight with these problem!? How I fight with this depression!? How i come over with this bad feeling that i have every time!? 
I decided to give up many times, specially when the taliban come and attack to our country and everything has stopped! ( before that i was also not comfortable with that government) than the worst thing happened by coming of Taliban my life become more difficult, & hopeless ðŸ˜© just nothing..... itâ€™s hard to say itâ€™s really hard ðŸ˜” 
I told my self, that listen what you want!? Can you control all these things that make you feel sad!? Nooo canâ€™t. Whatever is in your destiny it will happen either you wannnt or not.
