AlJazeera reported that Republican primary elections on Tuesday in Nebraska and West Virginia yielded mixed results for politicians backed by former US President Donald Trump, who has endorsed more than 150 candidates as he tries to shape the Republican Party ahead of a possible 2024 presidential run.

In Nebraska, his choice for governor, Charles Herbster, lost to rival Jim Pillen, according to Edison Research, an exit polling firm, even though Trump had hosted a rally for Herbster a little more than a week earlier.

But in West Virginia, voters opted for Representative Alex Mooney, a candidate who has backed Trump’s false claims about fraud in the 2020 United States presidential election.

Tuesday’s elections were part of a series of intra-party nominating contests that will set the stage for national elections on November 8 in which Republicans are favoured to win control of at least one chamber of Congress. That would give them the power to bring Democratic President Joe Biden’s legislative agenda to a halt.
