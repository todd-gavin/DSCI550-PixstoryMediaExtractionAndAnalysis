Serie A is back two weeks later Among the key matches of the day c Fiorentina Lazio direct clash for Europe This afternoon Maurizio Sarri presented the match in a press conference A very difficult match awaits us The market is closed now enough talking and let&#39;s continue with the group we have The biancoceleste coach then went on to talk about the market Jovane Cabral I know him little but I have a very direct relationship with Lotito If I&#39;m unhappy with the transfer market I don&#39;t fall into the trap The transfer question was the one to hold court for most of the conference The winter window has just closed but in the biancoceleste squad the only arrival was that of the Sporting Lisbon winger In the past few days the Tuscan coach had remarked on his dissatisfaction but today he wanted to avoid further controversy The market closed needless to talk about it Any discussion can backfire on the team there is nothing to say We will have to do everything possible with the players available and we can certainly do better than what has been shown so far I must keep the team away from alibis stories and controversies In closing a comment on Fiorentina as hosts in tomorrow night&#39;s match It will be a game Fiorentina&#39;s performance is very difficult They approach the game aggressively and with conviction we will have to be attentive and concentrated from the first minute In ten home games they have created good goal chances we will have to measure our growth on a defensive level In the last few games we have only lost against Sassuolo and Inter we are not in a delicate moment Appointment see you tomorrow
