Margaret Atwood is a name that needs no introduction. For writers, she is an epitome of poise and exemplary writing style. She is among my favourites and I am always encouraging people around me to read atleast one of her books for a life changing experience.

One of the things I love most about Atwood is her unique feminist perspective. She once said to Judy Klemesrud in the New York Times “My women suffer because most of the women I talk to seemed to have suffered.” She writers women in a way that makes every woman feel represented. She looks beyond the physical attributes and brings to the surface the years of pain and exploitation faced by women in a patriarchal society. The most famous example of this is the 1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale – a dystopian futuristic vision where women are kept as slaves by men in order to breed.

In addition to this, I really like how she doesn’t stereotype women as can do no bad angels. Women, especially in her poetry have negative shades which humanises them. For instance, Helen of Troy Does Countertop Dancing depicts the reality of a woman who is considered as an object by men and has little options. It also looks at how women's objectification shapes men's roles in the same setting.

If you have read Atwood, which is your favourite work of hers?
