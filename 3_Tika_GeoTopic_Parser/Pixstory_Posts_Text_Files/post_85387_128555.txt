Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt Bearing the owner s name someway in the corners that we may see and remark and say Whose Or I guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the vegetation Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic And it means Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones Growing among black folks as among white Kanuck Tuckahoe Congressman Cuff I give them the same I receive them the same And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves Tenderly will I use you curling grass It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men It may be if I had known them I would have loved them It may be you are from old people or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers laps And here you are the mothers laps Walt Whitman
