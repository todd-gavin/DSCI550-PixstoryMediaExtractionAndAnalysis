According to reports, the AFL is about to agree to the most lucrative television contract in Australian sports history. 

Daily Mail reported that after deciding to push its chips all the way to the middle of the table with a $500 million annual offer, Nine is expected to announce a five-year contract worth north of $2.5 billion as early as this week. 

The broadcaster's titanic bid, according to the Herald Sun and the Sydney Morning Herald, might put pressure on rivals Fox Sports and Seven, who currently retain the AFL rights. 

On Monday night, the three parties presented their proposals in a silent auction. A formal announcement is anticipated before the weekend. 

According to the report, Seven and Fox Sports are collaborating to negotiate a new contract with the AFL but it is understood the former may have to lift its offer by approximately $200million.
