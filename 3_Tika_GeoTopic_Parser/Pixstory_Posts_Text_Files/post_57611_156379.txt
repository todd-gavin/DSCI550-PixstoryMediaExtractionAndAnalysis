Many people experience fear of heights and they get scared and anxious This reminds me of my friend who was highly intimidated by heights being unaware of her phobia I didn t know how scary it was for her to stay in such a situation But since I know I feel people should be aware of this kind of phobia The fear of heights is called acrophobia Acrophobia causes people to feel extremely fearful and anxious about situations that involve being far off the ground such as climbing a ladder or going to the top of a tall building Because of the intensity of this fear people with acrophobia often avoid any situation that involves heights It is normal to be somewhat apprehensive about heights mainly if those heights are unusual significant or unstable However acrophobia involves a much more critical or disruptive fear that can affect a person s ability to function in everyday life Here the difference arises where you need to understand whether it s your normal fear of unusual heights or it is something that has begun to disrupt your daily behaviour
