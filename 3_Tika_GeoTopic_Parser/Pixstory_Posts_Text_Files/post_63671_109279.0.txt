The duel between Obi Wan and Vader however, is by far the best part of the show. While it requires a separate more detailed description to fully convey just how awesome and well done it was, it was a treasure to see Obi Wan at peak powers once again fighting and besting Vader in the coolest possible way.

The best way to describe the final Obi Wan Kenobi duel is like it is a mixture of the emotional depth of the original trilogy with the panache, finesse, flashiness and martial arts choreography of the prequels. 

The choreography of this duel really showcases the emotions of the two fighters involved. It is like we can hear their blades and their body language talk to the audience, with every move, swirl and attack using the Force being a message and a detailed commentary on the match up.

But the biggest strength of this duel is however the fact, that it had the most emotional outcome of all the Star Wars duels, rivalling if not surpassing the emotions of even Revenge Of The Sith and Return Of The Jedi. 

Another key point of this duel is that it shows why Obi Wan considers Anakin a truly gone case and why he has no more hope for his former friend. When Luke tells Kenobi in ROTJ that he still feels Vader has good in him, Obi Wan is not just randomly refuting Luke, he has personal experience in the matter and that is why he encourages him to kill Vader, because Vader had confessed to killing Anakin in front of him. 

This is not him telling Luke the truth from a certain point of view, it is the full truth, just not in the way heâ€™d expect. This match up may not have been able to surpass the one in ROTS, but it is still damn fine, better than the entire sequel trilogy put together.

But for all its glory, this duel has one weakness. Where is the John Williams score? No Battle Of The Heroes or Anakin's Betrayal theme? Disney just do not quite understand the importance of themes in SW
