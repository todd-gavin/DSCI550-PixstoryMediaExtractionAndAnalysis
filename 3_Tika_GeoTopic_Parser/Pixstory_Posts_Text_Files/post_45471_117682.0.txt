Prior to its full release later this year, users may already pre-order FIFA 23 from EA Sports. On Wednesday, July 20, 2022, the official FIFA 23 reveal trailer, which featured EA's final FIFA-branded football game, was eventually made available to the public after weeks of anticipation. A 30-year association between EA and FIFA would be ending, with FIFA 23 serving as the last instalment in EA's FIFA video game franchise, it was announced earlier in the year.

After the teaser was released, EA declared that FIFA 23 pre-orders were now open, allowing users to buy the game before its scheduled release on September 30, 2022. The cover stars of FIFA 23 are Sam Kerr of Chelsea and Kylian Mbappe of Paris Saint-Germain, and both the Standard Edition and Ultimate Edition are up for pre-order.

For those who pre-order the Ultimate Edition of FIFA 23, a new feature will see the reintroduction of a FIFA World Cup mode, and they will also receive one untradable FIFA World Cup FUT Heroes player item to use in FIFA Ultimate Team. Pre-ordering the Ultimate Edition gives you a substantial advantage over other players in addition to granting you access to the game three days before its official release and providing you with 4,600 FIFA Points to spend in the FUT Store.

The global cover of the FIFA 23 Ultimate Edition will include Kylian Mbappe, a superstar for Paris Saint-Germain and Sam Kerr, a legend for Chelsea. A woman and a man playing the same video game side by side on the global cover is groundbreaking news from EA.

Since FIFA 16, women's international teams have been playable in FIFA games, which have featured women's football for a long time. But this is the first time that the game's sleeve has featured symbols from both the men's and women's competitions. The fact that FIFA 23 will be the last game in the EA franchise to use the FIFA moniker makes it a historic release in general.
