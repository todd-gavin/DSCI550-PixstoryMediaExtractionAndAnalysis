Prison abolition sounds like a great idea in theory but is it really practical There are some crimes and criminals that do not deserve forgiveness The world is a messed up place there are not always happy endings here Some people don t change no matter how much you want to reform them It is not to say there shouldn t be rehabilitation there should be but to abolish the entire system of keeping the evil in is in fact a more dangerous idea than many people think Prison abolition is a very idealistic idea which only works in a very idealistic world Because how do you think a rapist or a murderer should be roaming around free with so many vulnerable people around Prison abolition more often than not centers the conversation around the perpetrators instead of the victim Serial Killers exist Why should they roam around free It s like saying I don t care that children are being endangered just free the pedophile It just does not make sense I am all for prison reform Our prison system is messed up and needs a lot of reforming In fact our prison system is extremely corrupt But for that we need to change the justice system as a whole we need to decriminalize a lot of things but to abolish prisons completely is inviting chaos How safe would we feel walking with rapists and murderers free It will again come down to victim blaming where the potential victim would have to take the responsibility of keeping society safe staying indoors and whatnot I mean think about the victims of those who you want to free We encourage victims to gain confidence back but how must a rape victim feel safe when her rapist did not suffer the consequences of his actions because some optimist out there thinks they could change him Why should the family of a murder victim make peace with the fact that the murderer is not being punished We need a makeover of our entire system including the prison system We need to make a lot of changes in society but abolishing prison is not one of them
