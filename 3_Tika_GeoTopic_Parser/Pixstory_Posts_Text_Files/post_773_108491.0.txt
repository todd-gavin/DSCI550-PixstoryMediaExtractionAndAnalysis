R Raveendran, who clicked the iconic picture of Delhi University student Rajiv Goswami setting himself on fire during the Mandal Commission agitation that intensified the protests leading to VP Singh government's resignation, passed away here after a brief illness. 

He started his career as a tele printer operator in 1973 with AFP. 

Raveendran shot to limelight after he shot the picture of Goswami, a 20-year-student, who set himself on fire at the Deshbandhu College in south Delhi's Kalkaji on 19 September, 1990. Goswami breathed his last in 2004 due to health problems arising out that suicide attempt.
