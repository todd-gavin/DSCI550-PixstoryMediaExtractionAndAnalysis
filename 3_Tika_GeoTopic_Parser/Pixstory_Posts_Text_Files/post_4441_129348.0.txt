Wore this black top and a beige trouser from zara on my birthday , i wanted to wear some dress but being obsessed with crop tops i ended up wearing a crop top and a trouser this year. 🫶 🥶

I don’t understand the hype on birthdays honestly, i wanted to keep my birthday lowkey with few people around, good food , good place and that’s how i ended up spending my day. ☺️🍓
