The Africa Cup of Nations is the biggest sporting event in Africa. And hosts are always under tremendous pressure to make the tournament a success. This year is no different. But the Cup being held in Cameroon has been with its share of problemsâ€”Covid-19 infections in various squads, low vaccination rates in Cameroon and even a separatist rebel attack.

With the African Football Federation deciding to go ahead with the tournament, they also imposed a few rules for the contest in Cameroon to go ahead. Spectators coming to the stadium will be vaccinated or negative tests and stadiums will have their capacity capped at 80 percent for the host's matches. Matches featuring other teams cab be played in front of 60 percent. (https://www.africanews.com/2022/01/05/afcon-caf-limits-stadium-capacities-due-to-covid-19/)

In a country with well less than 10 percent of its population vaccinated, filling the stadiums has been a big challenge. The tournament kicked off a few days back, and the queues before the vaccination centres increased. And most of these have been of football fans. There was hope in the air that more Cameroonians will come forward to get jabbed. This was a far cry from the days when most of the 26 million Cameroonians had turned down the government's request to get vaccinated. 

The Cameroon government has also launched a vaccination campaign to get more and more people jabbed. T(https://www.africanews.com/2022/01/07/afcon-boosts-vaccination-campaign-in-cameroon//) Only 6 percent of the population was fully vaccinated till recently.

But are enough people turning out to get vaccinated? Not really, say officials. And largely empty stadiums are a proof of that. The initial enthusiasm has ebbed. According to the health ministry, around 4,000 people have vaccinated after the Africa Cup of Nations started. (https://allafrica.com/stories/202201170057.html)

That number is clearly low compared to the population and the number of soccer crazy fans. In a country where hesitancy is very high, even soccer fails to bring fans to stadiums.
