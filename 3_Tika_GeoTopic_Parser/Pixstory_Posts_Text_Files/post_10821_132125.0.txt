Paris Saint-Germain are pleased to announce the signing of Berglind Björg Thorvaldsdottir on a two-season deal. The striker will play for Les Rouge et Bleu through to 30 June 2024.

Born in Iceland on 18 January 1992, the Icelandic international began her professional career at the age of 15 with Breidablik Kopavogur. She then joined IB Vestmannaeyja for one season before moving to the University of Florida in 2012. During her four-year university career, Berglind Björg Thorvaldsdottir also played for Icelandic clubs Breidablik and Reykjavik.

After a spell at Hellas Verona FC, the striker spent another season at Breidablik Kopavogur and then two one-season loans, to PSV Eindhoven in 2019 and to AC Milan the following season. Between 2020 and 2022, the 30-year-old played for Le Havre AC, Hammarby IF (Sweden) and SK Brann (Norway).

In the Icelandic national team, the newly signed Parisienne played with the U17 and U19 teams before being called up to the senior team in 2010 to participate in the Algarve Cup. She played her first minutes in Iceland's first match in the competition on 24 February 2010 against the USA. She now has 66 caps and 12 goals.

The club is delighted to welcome Berglind to the squad and wishes her every success in Rouge et Bleu.
