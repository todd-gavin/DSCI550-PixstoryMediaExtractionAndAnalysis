Senior diplomat Ruchira Kamboj who took charge as India's new permanent representative to the United Nations on Tuesday presented her credentials to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. In a tweet, she said it was a privilege to be the first Indian woman to be given the honour to hold this position. She also slipped in a note for the girls: "To the girls out there, we all can make it!"

A 1987-batch Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, Kamboj had been serving as India's envoy to Bhutan. She succeeds T S Tirumurti as the Indian ambassador to the UN. She is also the country's first woman envoy to be serving at the world body's headquarters in New York.

Its a great day for political landscape, as India, a great friend to Australia seems to be making huge strides in the Women Empowerment.
