Will the demolition be safe . 
Read the below and than I will come to my argument . 

The Noida health department is preparing for any emergency situation that may arise in the aftermath of the demolition. 
Special dust machines are installed at the demolition site to monitor pollution levels. 
Six ambulances will be sent to the site with a medical team . 
Experts believe there can be health emergencies due to the lead and silica in the air. Pollution levels will be many 100s of  times more than the usual. 
The blast will be like an earth quake with 4.5 on Richter scale. 

Is it all worth it. 
I live in high rise not very far from the site. I am thinking whether to stay indoors because of pollution or get out of my house at that moment. What if the blast is not controlled the way it is supposed to be. 
Noida is anyways a high pollution zone because of the ongoing construction. Thankfully it has better green cover than many parts in the country and surely better than many parts in the NCR . So that is a saviour. 
But what will happen post demolition. Will the debris be disposed off properly or not. 
What about the asthmatics or those who have allergies . 
Micro dust is supposed to remain in the air for another three months . I am a native of kashmir, I know that everything changed post floods because the dust and debris that was thrown out by the river is still in the air made worst construction of railways. The drainage is blocked and no rain can wash it back to the river. Hence a dust ridden Kashmir. 
I would be happier  if the builders were made to pay in another manner . 
The land and the building would have been sealed and seized. Here you are giving the builders some consolation by returning the land back to them. 
We could have done better, I think.
