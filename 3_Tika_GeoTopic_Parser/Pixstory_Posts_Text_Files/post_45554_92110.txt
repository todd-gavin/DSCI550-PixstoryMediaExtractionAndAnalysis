The ACAB movement gained momentum during the Black Lives Matter Movement A good portion of activists advocated and still do for the abolishment of the institution of police thinking that this will help the Black Lives Matter movement However that is far from the truth We have to realise that the ACAB movement is not helping the BLM movement at all In fact it is How The whole motive of Black Lives Matter movement is to make people aware about how the system is inherently biased against black people and to bring about substantial change But when you say that ACAB it erases the existence of that bias and completely transfers the blame onto the police as a fundamental institution What we are arguing is that people maybe nice and justified towards white people but when it comes to black people a bias is present which automatically makes them behave in a monstrous manner like in the case of George Floyd When it comes to white people the law will take its course but for black people a different kind of police exists which automatically acts as the judge jury and the executioner But when you say that ACAB you are implying that that is just how cops are and we need to abolish the institution all together And that s the issue That s not how cops are that s how cops are when it comes to black people The aim should be to erase the racial bias not the institution infected with it If this is not done the virus of racism will present itself in another form and eventually the whole world will be called Bas d
