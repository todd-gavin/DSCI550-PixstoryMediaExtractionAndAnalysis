The dust storms in Kabul were becoming more and more frequent and Haji Mahmood was stuck in yet another one. He wrapped his patoo (shawl) around his head and placed it over his pakol, squinting.

At the end of the dirt street he was walking on, a man was chasing away the shrieking children that had come to take shelter from the dust storm in his shop.

Mahmood smiled.

He recalled the days when he too, had been a child, shrieking and seeking shelter from grumpy shop owners.

It seemed like nothing had changed in the past couple of decades.

But so much had changed.

His children had all fled to kharej (abroad) to start their new lives in hopes of peace and prosperity. He had only been able to meet his grandchildren through a small phone screen, a device he still wasn’t comfortable using.

His solitude and loneliness caught up with him in the middle of the dust storm, and he sighed.

Years of fighting against the invaders, years of resisting their oppressive regimes, and yet here he was in the middle of the streets of kabul, watching children play, while his own grandchildren were thousands of miles away from him.

“Khair basha (it’s okay)”, he mumbled to himself. “ This too shall pass.”

He continued to walk towards the naan shop, unbothered by the dust that was collecting in the creases of his clothes, lost in thought.
