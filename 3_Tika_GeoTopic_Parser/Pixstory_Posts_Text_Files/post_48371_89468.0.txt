‌Mr Durbin came as a saviour to Jackson calling your time expired a couple of times. (To Graham and Ted Cruz)

‌Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., quizzed Jackson about her public defender work representing Guantanamo Bay detainees and asked if she believes the U.S. would be better off if they were all released.

‌Overall Republicans did a good job in questioning Judge Jackson on every aspect but at times a very fierce role. Still, there were democrats with full support and appreciation to her on the third day. Yet, as a listener, I would recommend more clarity in the answers of Judge Jackson. For many questions, she didn't comment on them.
