Real Madrid have defeated Mallorca by an overwhelming margin of 4-1, thus extending their winning run in the on going La Liga season to 5 matches in a row. They remain at the top of the table with a perfect 15 points (2 points clear ahead of FC Barcelona) and although it thrills me
as a Madridista to see that we are getting positive results in every single matchday, the football enthusiast in me knows that there are some aspects of our team that need to be fixed immediately.
For starters, although the way in which we are coming back from behind in every match shows that we play well under pressure, the fact that we are conceding first in almost every match is concerning. Mallorca had way too many chances to score in the first half tonight and had they
been a bit more clinical, the scenario of this match could have been a lot different.
The cohesion or chemistry between our defenders - Alaba and Rudiger seemed to be lacking at certain points. The first goal, however, came from a mistake by Ferland Mendy who left his man unmarked. Things like this can happen to any player though and this is not that big an issue.
Eden Hazard started this match in the absence of Karim Benzema as we had expected and let’sbe honest, I do not see a future for him in our setup. I still think that we did a mistake by notsigning a backup striker and if Karim Benzema stays out for long, Eden Hazard just can not behis replacement. He was totally invisible in most of today’s match.
We created plenty of chances that should have been converted by Vinicius and Rodrygo but they both got one goal each ultimately so can’t complain.
Special shoutout to Fede Valverde for his incredible solo goal right before the half time mark.
All things aside, its three more points for Real Madrid as we steer clear of the competition. The defending champions have kicked off the season in style and are eyeing their second successive league title.
