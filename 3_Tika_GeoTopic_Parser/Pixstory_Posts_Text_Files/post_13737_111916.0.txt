Nuristan province is one of the eastern provinces of Afghanistan. "Most schools in Nooristan do not have buildings and because of this, students are facing many problems. Also on rainy days, students whose schools do not have buildings cannot go to school. The people's wish is to build a building for Nooristan schools to solve these problems."

Meanwhile, officials from the Taliban's education department in Nuristan admit that about 70 percent of the province's schools have no buildings or even shelter for students.

According to officials, students face problems on windy and rainy days.
 The head of Taliban education in Nuristan said that out of 214 active schools in the province, only 60 have buildings and the rest do not have the necessary facilities for students.
 The Ministry of Education has promised to cooperate in the shelter for students, and they hope that a suitable learning environment will be created for students.

According to Nuristan education officials, about 36,000 students are studying in 214 schools in the province, of which 16,000 are girls.
