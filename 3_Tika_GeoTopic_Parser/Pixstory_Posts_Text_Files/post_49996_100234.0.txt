As a reader, I would always choose an epistolary novel, because of the letters it embodies. An epistolary novel is a novel in which the story isn't directly told to the reader, but rather, gleaned through a series of documents mostly letters. These letters are so personal that we feel connected with the writer and the character. For example, instead of telling a love story in a conventional expository style, an epistolary novel would tell that same story through love letters. 

An epistolary novel is almost completely comprised of correspondence between the characters. Instead of having the plot and characters described to the reader in the third person, the reader understands the characters and plot by reading the characters' written interactions with each other.

The correspondence is an epistolary novel doesn't have to explicitly be between the two main characters. Various documents, such as diary entries and news clippings, can also be used to help tell the story in an epistolary novel.

This effect is acquainted with the way we read nonfiction and learn history. It's common to study the correspondence between leaders—as well as average citizens—to better understand historical events. One of the best-known examples of this is Anne Frank's "Diary of a Young Girl." Through the daily writings of this young girl, we get a detailed and factual sense of how Jewish people in Europe endured under Nazi rule. 

 The classic vampire tale "Dracula," by Bram Stoker, is an example of an epistolary novel. Stoker compiles newspaper clippings, letters, doctor's notes, and other written documents to tell the story of a vampire who moves into a British town and terrorizes residents.

The most celebrated colour purple is an epistolary novel. It is because of its style we get deeply connected to characters like Celie and Nettie and all of them whom they love! The beginning itself startles the reader.
