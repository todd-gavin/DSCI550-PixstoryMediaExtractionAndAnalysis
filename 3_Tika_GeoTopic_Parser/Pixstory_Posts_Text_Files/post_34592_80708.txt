Today for Christian Eriksen a day as important as perhaps unexpected A few days after the terrible afternoon of Euro in which he had a cardiac arrest during the match of his national team Denmark against Finland presents itself to the press with its new club Brentford which plays in the Premier League He returns to play in England after being forced to leave Inter with whom he terminated his contract last December He passed the medical and obtained the ok to return to the field in the Premier League he signed with Brentford So everything starts again from England but those terrible five minutes will never be forgotten by Eriksen I remember everything but five minutes I remember the throw-in the ball hit my knee then I don&#39;t know what happened he told a BBC interview I woke up with many people around one of them put pressure on my chest trying to make me breathe i tried to catch my breath and i woke up i didnt understand what was happening i started thinking if i broke my legs or my back and i tried to move every part of my body then in ambulance I heard someone say How long I was unconscious and another answered Five minutes was the moment I realized I was knocked unconscious
