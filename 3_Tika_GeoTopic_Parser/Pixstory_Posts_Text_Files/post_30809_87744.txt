Massimiliano Allegri tries to frame the heavy home kick received by Juventus against Villareal in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 The Juventus coach recalled how for three quarters of the match his team deserved more than their opponents The team however did well then they did they are placed behind the line of the ball they didn&#39;t even try counter-attacks anymore and they knew how to exploit the episodes We are disappointed but I have nothing to reproach the team For Juventus the fourth consecutive early elimination in the Champions League but Allegri does not want judgments as in the recent past when the team started with higher expectations on the European scene Talking about failure intellectual dishonest and I can&#39;t help it I know the value of the team I always keep my feet on the ground and above all I evaluate what I have in hand
