Ashok Aliseril Thamarakshan,a man from Kerala is travelling through Europe with his family on a home-built plane. 

It took Mr. Thamarakshan 18 months to built the four seater airplane. 

The four-seater aircraft model “Sling TSI” has been named “G-Diya”, with Diya being the name of his younger daughter.

Mr Thamarakshan has visited Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic so far in the four-seater with his family.

To build his own plane, the 38-year-old visited the factory of Johannesburg-based company Sling Aircraft upon learning that they were launching a new aircraft, Sling TSI, in 2018. After the factory visit, Mr Thamarakshan ordered a kit to build his own plane. 

With plenty of time at his hand due to the lockdown and the money saved during this period, he got the opportunity to work on the ambitious project. The total cost to build the aircraft is estimated to be ₹ 1.8 crore.
