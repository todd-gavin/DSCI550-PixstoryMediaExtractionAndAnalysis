Kristen Stewart is blazing another fashion trail: short shorts at the 2022 Oscars. 

The actor arrived at the 94th annual Academy Awards on Sunday night in a deconstructed bespoke Chanel tuxedo ensemble. 

Stewart put a black satin blazer over a nearly completely unbuttoned blouse, which she paired with some cropped formal shorts. She complemented the daring look with her tousled locks swept to one side, a pair of black stiletto heels and a chain necklace that stretched down her chest. 

Stewart is nominated for Best Actress for her bold performance in the unsettling Princess Diana biopic “Spencer.”
