Within moments of the House convening for the day, the Rajya Sabha was adjourned as the Opposition raised slogans over the suspension of MPs. 

The Chair also adjourned AAP MP Sanjay Singh for shouting slogans, tearing papers and throwing them toward the Chair on Tuesday. The Lok Sabha was also adjourned till 2 pm amid chaos by the Opposition.

Meanwhile, Opposition MPs staged a protest on Wednesday at the Gandhi statue within the Parliament premises against the suspension of 19 Rajya Sabha MPs till Friday. 

Additionally, four MPs were suspended for the entire session earlier this week. TMC MP Sushmita Dev, who has been suspended along with 18 other MPs, on Tuesday called the action “unfair”  and said that it was clear that the BJP-led government does not have an answer to inflation. “If Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is not well, Prime Minister Narendra Modi can answer the Opposition’s questions,” she said. Dev also criticized the imposition of GST on staple items, and the lack of discussions on it.
