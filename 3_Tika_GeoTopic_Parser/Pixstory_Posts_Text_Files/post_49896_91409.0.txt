‌The decision of Trump regarding restrictions for migrants on the border which many were sceptical about. Biden government too leaned on to this restriction for a while. Whatever was the political intention behind it indeed help in controlling Covid-19.
‌
‌Biden's government had made this decision considering the current health care conditions and improvement in the safety measures against Covid-19.
‌
‌Lifting the pandemic restrictions is anticipated to have instantaneous ramifications and would return to traditional immigration protocols that have been in place for decades.
‌
‌America's welcoming nature which I am proud of sometimes is an issue of concern. We have to ensure safe environments for migrants and citizens. We could also see an influx from Ukraine as America stands strong; keeping its word.
‌
‌Homeland security should be under full preparation; considering the safety. Covid- 19 vaccines have been given to most of the migrants. The country will ensure vaccination before letting migrants in. There is a risk factor in accepting migrants yet we cannot deny our homes to the newcomers as we were also once newcomers to this land.
