Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran of British music, Shaquille O'Neal of American basketball, and other celebrities will contribute personal items to a campaign that was launched on Saturday to support healthcare in Ukraine.
The WHO Foundation, an independent group that aims to generate money to assist the UN agency's work addressing global health issues, created the "Human Kind" e-store seven months into Russia's war, where fans may try to win products donated by their favourite celebrities.
According to the foundation, it aimed to raise $53.7 million. The money raised will support WHO initiatives in war-torn Ukraine and surrounding nations.
According to the WHO, the war has resulted in over 5,900 civilian deaths, over 8,600 injuries, and over 12 million Ukrainian refugees who are now living in Europe.
Over a third of Ukraine's population, or 17.7 million people, require humanitarian aid.
According to the WHO, it has so far assisted in the delivery of 1,300 metric tonnes of medical supplies to Ukraine, including oxygen, surgical equipment, ambulances, blood transfusion kits, and basic medications.
