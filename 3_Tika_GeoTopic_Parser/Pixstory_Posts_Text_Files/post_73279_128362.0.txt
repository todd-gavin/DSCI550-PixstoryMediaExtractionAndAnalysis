Actually I don't have really topic today to discuss with you so I thought that I don't understand about some of my thoughts.

Sometimes I think that it would be great if I would be alone in this world because there is so many things going around ourselves that we don't have any piece of mind or struggle with anything time to time,  so sometimes I sit alone listen to music or do something I want to do just thinking that it would be great if I would be alone because then there will be no tension or stress.
But then my mother told me that rather than sitting alone why don't I join my brother sister or relative in family gathering and gossips with each other that can also a good way to release stress and I really think that you should also give it a try if you also love to be alone like me .
