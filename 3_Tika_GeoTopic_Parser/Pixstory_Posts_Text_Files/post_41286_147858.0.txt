To honour the great history of hunting, fishing, and target shooting, sportspeople come together on National Hunting and Fishing Day (also known as NHF). The United States Congress established this day in 1971, and it has since been celebrated annually. The first proclamation establishing National Hunting and Fishing Day was made by US President Richard Nixon in 1972. In his remarks, he urged everyone to work together with athletes to use and manage the planet's natural resources wisely and effectively. Since then, Springfield, Missouri's Johnny Morris Wonders of Wildlife National Museum & Aquarium has taken on the role of host and designated location for the day.Every year, National Hunting and Fishing Day is held on a Saturday so that the majority of people can take the day off to enjoy their outdoor pursuits. And right now is the ideal time to begin the celebrations for National Hunting and Fishing Day!Source: DOY
