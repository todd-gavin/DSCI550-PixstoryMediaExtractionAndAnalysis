Q.9) So there wasn't any internalized homophobia around you while growing up?

Ans. No, there was no homophobia or sex-negativity because I was very comfortable with whatever I was, which is the one thing I am very grateful to my teachers particularly, especially from my fourth standard onwards. I had a lot of wonderful teachers who always taught me to be comfortable with what I am and who accepted me for what I am.

Q.10) There are unfortunately many people in our society who think that bisexuality is not a legitimate sexual orientation and these people are actually homosexuals who don’t want to be identified as such. So, how according to you is bisexuality different from homosexuality as a sexual orientation? Was it a choice for you or were you born that way?

Ans. I think I was born that way. It’s very obvious. You can feel it in your organs, how crude can I put it (laughs), you will feel it in your organs and your blood vessels. It varies from individual to individual among bisexuals, but it could be 20% of the people to whom you feel attracted, it could be 30, 50, or 60% being male. I am talking as a male, it might be other males whom you feel attracted to and the other 50 or 40 or 30 could be females or it could be more, you know. In my case, I would say 70% females and 30% males. And I could feel it, you know, I have fantasies about males and I know I am not making it up and it’s not males all the time as I am very attracted to females also. I feel both.
