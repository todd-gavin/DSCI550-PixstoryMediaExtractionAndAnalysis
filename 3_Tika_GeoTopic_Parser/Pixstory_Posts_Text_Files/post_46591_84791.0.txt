Former President Barack Obama's decision not to make such a historic nomination during his eight years in office sparked long-simmering anger among civil rights activists. President Joe Biden's campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court came against a backdrop of long-simmering anger among civil rights activists. 

Politico reported that Biden made his pledge during the Democratic presidential primary season in 2020. When three vacancies on the Supreme Court arose, he was by Obama's side as Vice President.

None of Obama's nominees were African-American, and there were few signs that the White House was working to appoint a liberal Black justice to the Supreme Court, according to some observers. 

Roland Martin, a notable Black broadcaster and political analyst with extensive contacts to numerous activists, remarked, "It was like the Black head coach was not going to really consider anyone who was Black." 

Obama's hesitancy to pick a Black Supreme Court justice is seen by some Black leaders as part of a greater worry about engaging in high-profile debates about race and representation. Obama had been stung when he became involved in policing matters in 2009, denouncing Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates' detention at his home, a move he subsequently said hurt his image with white people.

Now, Biden is set to take the step Obama never did, preparing within days — or perhaps hours — to put forward a history-making nomination of the first Black female justice.
