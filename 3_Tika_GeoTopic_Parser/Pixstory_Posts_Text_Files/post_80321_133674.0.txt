Arsenal 2-1 Fulham Match Review - Scrappy but deserved

Arsenal welcomed Fulham to the Emirates  for the first time since 18/19.

The Cottagers have started the season  well - with 2 draws & a win, including 3 points vs their London rivals Brentford & a point vs Liverpool.

They visit an Arsenal side who have been flawless, keeping 2 clean sheets & 9 points out of 9.

Arsenal started the game on the front foot, as they often do, but without a serious cutting edge. That was to Fulham’s credit, as they were incredibly well setup & managed to cut out the final third action on most occasions.

One big chance did fall to Bukayo Saka, who was denied by former Gunners shot stopper, Bernd Leno. 

Ultimately, a frustrating 45 minutes for the  Gunners, who controlled the game very well - sustaining pressure impressively & winning all duels - with Xhaka, Saliba, White & Gabriel integral to doing so - especially keeping the on form Mitrovic, quiet.

This didn’t last long however, as after an altercation with Arsenal fans winding up Mitrovic, the Serbian became alive.

Too many touches from Gabriel, and Mitrovic was onto him in a flash, diverting the ball past Ramsdale, with the Serb of course giving it back to the Arsenal fans. Very much against the run of play, early into the second half.

A system change was implemented with Tierney making way for Nketiah, who changed the game.

A complete handful to deal with, running the channels & dragging Fulham’s well defensive block around.

After 10 minutes of sustaining further & creating half chances, Arsenal equalised through an Ødegaard deflection, and after a sloppy start from the restart, capitalised on a rare Leno spill from a corner, which Gabriel finished.

A big 3 points for Arsenal, who created a lot, sustained for long periods, and made up for one moment of wrong doing. A hard fought victory. Deservedly so, but Fulham can be very happy with their efforts.
