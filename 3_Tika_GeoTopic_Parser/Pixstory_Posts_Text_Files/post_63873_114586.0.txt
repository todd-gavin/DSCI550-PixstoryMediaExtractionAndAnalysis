Ahoy laddies! After a long time of waiting Ubisoft has announced the release date for Skull and Bones. The game will be released on November 8 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Google Stadia, and PC via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Store. In ‘Skull and Bones’ players will captain their own pirate ships, accept contracts, gather resources, and sail the high seas while attacking merchant ships for loot.

A tactical action game featuring an open world environment, the game is played from a third person perspective. Players take control of a customizable pirate captain, and may choose to go solo and sail the dangers of the Indian Ocean in a single player campaign, or gather up to five other players to ally in a player vs player gameplay in Disputed Waters.

Centered around naval combat, the game is a blend of survival mechanics with naval combat, where players have to assemble their crew, keep them well fed, keep their morale high, all the while pirating around in the open seas. 

 Infamy is the main progression system. Pirates succeeding in their missions in the Indian Ocean will build infamy, which means other pirates will want to work with them. The game has a choice system, where actions will have consequences thus influencing a players’ journey while going up in the pirate ranks will open up new customization for your ships

While on the high seas, players can team up and work together to accumulate infamy and loot. This will let them tackle dangers better when it comes to battles with heavily-armoured fortresses and more. In addition, players will also have to contend with corporations (factions). 

Players will need to be prepared for any sort of situation before embarking on quests as pirate dens are present all over across the world. This will also give players a chance to meet and socialize with other players, craft new equipment, ships, buy cargo, and pick up contracts.
