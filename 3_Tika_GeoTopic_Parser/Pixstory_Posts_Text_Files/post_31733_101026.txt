The intracellular variations of pH or acidity are, among other things, indicative of the onset and progression of diseases such as cancer. Also for this reason, their study is as important as it is demanding since these alterations involve extremely complex mechanisms. A recent study coordinated by Loretta L del Mercato first researcher of the Nanotechnology Institute of the National Research Council Cnr Nanotec of Lecce conducted in collaboration with Cecilia Bucci and Adriano Barra professors of the University of Salento has led to the development of a new method to study the pH of cellular organelles effectively and accurately. research published in the journal ACS Applied Materials Interfaces Inside an animal cell the function of the organelles also depends on the establishment and maintenance of a certain pH in each of them A dynamic and finely regulated balance in the process of importing protons into the organelles at the base of the pH homeostasis in the cytoplasm and in other cellular compartments explains Cecilia Bucci The lysosomal endo system plays a central role in numerous cellular processes and in physiological conditions the pH decreases progressively along the endocytic pathway, i.e. from the endosomes to the lysosomes. This ensures that the organelles of the pathway function correctly The research team of Cnr Nanotec and the University of Salento has developed extremely stable and sensitive ratiometric optical sensors that can be used to measure with high spatial and temporal resolution the acidification movement of single intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes. defects in the acidification of endocytic organelles significantly contributes to the onset of lysosomal storage disorders hereditary metabolic disorders neurodegenerative diseases autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases as well as tumor formation and spread explains Loretta L del Mercato
