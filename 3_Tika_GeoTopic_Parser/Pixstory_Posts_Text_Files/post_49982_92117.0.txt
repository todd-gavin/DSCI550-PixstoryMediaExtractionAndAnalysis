This is a poem by e.e Cummings. He believed in the freedom and choices of poetry. This poem is a visual representation of a leaf falling in the form of words. When the text is put horizontally, it either reads as l(a leaf falls)oneliness or in other words, a leaf falls inserted between the first two letters of loneliness- or l(a le af fa ll s) one l iness. The poem is a symbol of loneliness. It visually creates separation through letters. The shape of the poem also represents one, standing alone. The poem is an intricately made piece of art and a reminder that letters can create wonders.
