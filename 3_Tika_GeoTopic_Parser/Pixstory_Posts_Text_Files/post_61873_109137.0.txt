Eminem will never know that Snoop Dogg made a sweet gesture to him on Instagram because Slim Shady doesn't follow anyone on the photo and video sharing app. No, this is not a joke, he briefly followed Logic to promote their song Homicide, but unfollowed him shortly after. 

Snoop surprised music lovers on Saturday when he shared a throwback picture of Eminem.

The rapper last year offended the Detroit native by saying that Eminem is not greatest of all time.

The "Lose Yourself" rapper reacted to him by calling Snoop's backstabbing behavior out on his track Zeus from the Album Music to be Murdered by: Side B

Their beef ended soon after some mutual friends intervened.

Eminem and Snoop Dogg performed together at Super Bowl Halftime show along with Dr Dre and some other rappers.

Snoop Dogg made the sweet gesture on his Instagram stories where he shared an Eminem photo from a popular Insta page, hiphop_rapgods.
