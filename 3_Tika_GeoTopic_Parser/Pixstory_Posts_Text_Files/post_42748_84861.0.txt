I'm sure how conflicting it becomes while wondering the whole aspect of ZNMD as a movie. Because come on, who are we fooling? It's too good to be true, right? 

It has its fair share of road trip clich√©s that we find a thing in every Indian friend group ever. (Trust me when I say that a goa trip of mine hasn't happened in my friend group yet, too.) 

However, if you see it, much like the movie 'Dil Chahta Hai,' the overall movie creates a picture in the head, which can not be found in many bollywood movies that are released today.  

As a fellow mid class family person, obviously, the idea of a trip to Spain just more or so sounds like Spain with the letter 'S' silent, haha. However, it brings out a side of life that's still out there yet to be discovered, maybe not now, but someday ahead. It opens up to the idea of a willingness to break barriers to what one can achieve in life despite their flaws and mistakes.

Much like friendships keep fading, and even a small fight can break apart a good friendship of years. This movie calls on for remembering that friends do matter in the end because what is success and reaching heights in life if your own friends aren't there to support and celebrate? 

And yes, friends do cancel, I myself do, it's life. Some things happen, and some don't, but that doesn't mean we can't dream big. 

Girl friends surely don't get permissions from home, hello, I am one of them! But, this movie gave me a way of wanting to be able to do that someday down the lane on my own terms! This is when I learned the importance of actually having fun! 

All-in-all maybe for some, this movie might be 'Zara bhi Nahi Dekhni Dobara' but for some (like me) it might come off as at least a thought process of if-they-can-do-it-i-can-too!
Well, someday, if I want to!
