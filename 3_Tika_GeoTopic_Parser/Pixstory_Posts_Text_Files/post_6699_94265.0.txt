A 30-second long video clip where All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) President Asaduddin Owaisi is being greeted by a swarm of supporters in Jaipur’s Rajasthan was reported by multiples media outlets as supporters of the party chanting pro-Pakistan slogans.

Zee News, Zee Rajasthan, First India News and Amar Ujala ran the video while carrying the disclaimer that it could not be independently verified.

Below is the report by Zee Rajasthan News.

Fact-check
We performed a keyword search on Facebook and came across the same video but of better quality. After carefully listening to the video, it was clear that the supporters were chanting “Owaisi Saab zindabad”. This can be heard at 11 seconds in the video below.

Alt News reached out to M Salim Khan, an AIMIM worker who was present at the scene. Khan said, “Owaisi Saab left the hotel around 8:30 pm to go pray at a nearby mosque. He went with his driver in a WagonR. Between 10:00 pm and 10:15 pm, when he was leaving the mosque, people surrounded him and started chanting slogans. We reached the spot within five minutes to escort him out. The people surrounding him were mostly young and they also chanted the Taqbeer. However, no objectionable chants were made.”

We checked the Facebook page of AIMIM Rajasthan and found a second video from the incident. This video was recorded when Owaisi already sat in his car and was leaving. In this video, it can be heard that the youth surrounding him chanted, “Nara e Taqbeer, Allahu Akbar” [God is great]. This was followed by, “Dekho dekho kaun aya? Sher aya sher” [Look who’s here? The tiger].
