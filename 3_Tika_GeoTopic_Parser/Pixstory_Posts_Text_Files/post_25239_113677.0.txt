Released on around 200 screens, it clocked advance sales of 50K tickets across India with gross of Rs 1.50 crore (approx $190,000 USD)
In my opinion it's probably because most people have already watched it on sites, imagine if it was released along with Japan. Therefore it is kindly requested to bring a timely release to future anime movies.
