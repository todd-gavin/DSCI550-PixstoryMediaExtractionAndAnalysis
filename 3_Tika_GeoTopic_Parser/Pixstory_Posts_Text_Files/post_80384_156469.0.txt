Speaking of the ceremony, Mbappe’s countryman Karim Benzema won the individual award for firing Real Madrid to the La Liga and Champions League titles last year.
I never asked for my departure in January: Kylian Mbappe
Jeers indicate that Mbappe’s own city fans aren’t happy with his recent controversy. There were reports that he wants to leave Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the January transfer window. On top of that, he is also reportedly considering terminating his own contract after feeling betrayed by the club.
However, the forward cleared the air after PSG’s encounter against Benfica. He said that he was shocked by the news as he never asked for an exit. The 23-year-old went on to say that he is not directly or indirectly involved and wants to stay in Paris as he is happy.
“I'm very happy. I never asked for my departure in January,” he told RMC Sport.
“The info that came out on the day of the match (against Benfica). I didn't understand. I was just as shocked as everyone else. There are people who may think I'm involved in this, but I'm not involved, I was taking a nap.
My entourage was at my little brother's game, all the people who take care of me weren't there so we were flabbergasted when we heard about it.” he concluded.
After a 1-0 win over Marseille, PSG will next lock horns with Ajaccio in Ligue 1 on Friday at the Stade Francois Coty Stadium.
