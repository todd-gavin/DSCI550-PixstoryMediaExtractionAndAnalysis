"Spider-man is a masked menace!". From the comics as well as from the movies we know J Jonah Jameson viewed spider-man as a vigilante. But was he actually one? 

As seen in the comics/ movies, when someone asks spider-man for help, he rarely turns them down. Even when he should know better, he often gives bad guys the benefit of doubt by trying to talk them out of whatever they're doing. A lot of his villains have also reformed.
He is compassionate and willing to do anything for the right cause. Even if it costs him his own life. This righteousness is what us readers love to see, even in his darkest moments he still strives to do good and in his brightest his constant puns help to lighten his mood and let him release his somewhat extroverted side compared to someone who usually keeps to himself. 
He will try over and over and over again until he succeeds and when he does, there is no stopping him. This is what I believe makes Spider-Man a true superhero.
