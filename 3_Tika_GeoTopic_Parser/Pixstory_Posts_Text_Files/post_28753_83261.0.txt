As 23rd of February is here, Man United biggest potential challenge faces them, their champions league fixture against Atheletico Madrid starts tonight with immense pressure of Ralf Ragnick’s men. Struggling with their form and not being able to showcase their talent has been the story of Mnachester united this season, they have failed to capitalize on several moments of cruciality and have paid the price for them.

It is evident that because of the mismanagement this season, the team’s moral is down, while every week a report about the dressing room environment being out of control comes into light and someone or the other players denies it, it does feel very real that the riff is between players and the players are not exactly, “United”. Against Atheletico, they have to put their 
A game on else things would go real sideways, they have the immense advantage of having Ronaldo in their team who is the greatest Champions league player ever, but even with a maestro like him, age catches up, Ronaldo is 37 years old now and sometimes the visible struggle on his face is evident. United not only need to find a way out of their over dependency on Ronaldo but also need their midfield to perform finally, Jadon Sancho has coming into his own the last few games and feels like Ronaldo will be in good company if an in form Sancho shows his powers.

All in all, United can really fancy their chances for a victory against Madrid if their attack plays upto its potential but most importantly if their defense does not make several mistakes just like they have been making for a while, United must give the respect Madrid deserves and keep in mind of their horror defensive shows against relegation teams like Norwich, Newcastle, and of course Leeds United against whom they lost their 2-0 lead to 2-2 within 24 seconds, mistakes like these and Atheletico Madrid will make them pay heavily. 

Even though they are coming off of a high from some win, it feels Madrid will clinch this battle today, or maybe United might just surprise us.
