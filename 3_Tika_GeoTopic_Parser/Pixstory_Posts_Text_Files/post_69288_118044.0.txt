Pholwaen Tooir, a day-long Art & Food Festival, was organised by the School of Education (SoE), Central University of Kashmir (CUK), on July 21 at Green Campus, Ganderbal. 

The main goal of the event was to "build entrepreneurial skills and acumen in the CUK student community." 

Professor Farooq Ahmad Shah, Vice Chancellor of CUK, stated in his Presidential Address that "events like this one are the right steps made in this direction." Universities have been mandated to ensure the overall development of their students. Entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity are currently ingrained in practically every academic discipline. The urgent concern of NEP-2020 is met by students' practical exposure to the real world.
