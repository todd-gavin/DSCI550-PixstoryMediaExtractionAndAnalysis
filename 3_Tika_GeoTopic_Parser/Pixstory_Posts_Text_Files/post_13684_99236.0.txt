The documentary about the life of a Bamyan boy won the award of the most important British film festival

The documentary "My Childhood, My Country", a joint work of two Afghan and British directors, won the BAFTA Award, the most important British film festival.

In this documentary, Shoaib Sharifi and Phil Garbsky have recorded and narrated Mir Hussain's life during his 20 years, from childhood to adulthood.

The creators of this documentary say that they met 8-year-old Mir Hussain in Bamyan, who lived with his family in one of the caves in Bamyan. They depict two decades of Mir Hussain's life, which is a story of poverty, destruction, aspirations and progress of him and his compatriots.

Mir Hussain's life changed after the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. He studied, got married and became the cameraman of the news department, who has now lost his job with the return of the Taliban.

"I have never felt happy in my life because of the war and the Taliban," Mir Hussain, now 28, was quoted as saying by the Hollywood Reporters. However, he hopes that "a better future awaits Afghanistan."

After receiving his award, Garbsky asked filmmakers not to forget Afghanistan and to show its stories on cinema and television. He criticized the filmmakers' indifference to Afghanistan.

Earlier, the short documentary "Three Songs for Unique" co-produced by an Afghan filmmaker and his American wife was nominated for an Academy Award. This documentary depicts the story of two Helmand lovers named Shayesteh and Benazir in one of the IDP camps in Afghanistan.
