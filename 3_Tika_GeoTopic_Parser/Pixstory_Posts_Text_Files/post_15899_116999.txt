Jiachen Luo Yidong Wei Abstract Background and Aims Stress hyperglycemia ratio SHR is associated with increased in hospital morbidity and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction AMI We aimed to investigate the impact of stress hyperglycemia on long term mortality after AMI in patients with and without diabetes mellitus DM Methods and Results We included patients with AMI between February and March SHR was measured with the fasting glucose divided by the estimated average glucose derived from glycosylated hemoglobin HbA c The primary endpoint was all cause death Of patients mean age were men analyzed had DM Over a median follow up of years and all cause deaths occurred in the diabetic and nondiabetic cohorts respectively Compared with participants with low SHR in DM in non DM the hazard ratios and confidence intervals for those with high SHR in DM in non DM for all cause mortality were and for cardiovascular mortality were and in DM and non DM subjects respectively The mortality prediction was improved in the diabetic individuals with the incorporation of SHR into the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events GRACE score showing an increase in a continuous net reclassification index of CI and an absolute integrated discrimination improvement of CI Conclusion The improvement in the prediction of long term mortality beyond the GRACE score indicates the potential of SHR as a biomarker for post MI risk stratification among patients with DM Sources
