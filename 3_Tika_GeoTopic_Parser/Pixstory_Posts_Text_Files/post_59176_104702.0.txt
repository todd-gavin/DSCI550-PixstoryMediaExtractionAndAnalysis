A 17-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped in the Jubilee Hills area of Hyderabad after she went to a party organized by her school classmates on May 28. 
The incident first came to light on May 31, when the victim's father registered a complaint of molestation. This, however, was modified to sections about a gang rape on Friday after the girl revealed to police counts that she was sexually assaulted by people in a vehicle.

It doesn't feel safe at all. Women are not doll guys that you can do anything with them. 

After all, the boys who were involved are well educated but yet don't know what's right or maybe they are in a mindset that whatever they do is right nothing would happen to them.

Government should punish them so anyone with the thought of it is also scared about it and pee in their pants.
