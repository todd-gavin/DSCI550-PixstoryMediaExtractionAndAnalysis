4. Scarlet Eyes – Hunter x Hunter

The Scarlet Eyes or Crimson Eyes are a trait exclusive to members of the Kurta Clan. Due to the Scarlet Eyes being considered one of the most gorgeous colors in the world, they are treated as a rare jewel by many and eventually, all of the Kurta Clan was massacred by the Phantom Troupe in order to obtain them, leaving Kurapika as the only survivor from the clan.

Kurapika’s eyes are a potent reminder of the torment his clan has endured over the past years. Though typically brown, the irises belonging to members of the Kurta Clan glow scarlet when they are emotionally agitated. The Scarlet Eyes do enhance Kurapika’s strength and focus once he becomes enraged, but he also loses control of his emotions after seeing someone treating his clan belongings as items.

3. Geass – Code Geass

The powers of Geass go beyond that of human imagination as after acquiring this infamous eye, a person’s fairly quiet life gets altered seriously just like it did happen with Lelouch. After coming in contact with C.C, he acquired these powerful eyes in anime. Geass grants Lelouch the ability to control people’s minds, but only once certain conditions are met.

Eventually, he ends up using this ability to subjugate his enemies and establish himself as a supreme leader. However, the powers of Geass vary between users as in Lelouch’s case his Geass allows him to make people do things as he commands. Other Geass abilities include telepathic hearing, memory control, forcing someone to love the user and precognition. But in order to use it, making eye contact with the opponent is a must.
