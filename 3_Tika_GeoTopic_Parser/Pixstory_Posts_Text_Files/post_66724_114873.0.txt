If you've ever seen a photo of people riding camels silhouetted against a fiery sunset on an Aussie Beach, you can bet it's Cable Beach. It's one of the most popular things to do along this 22-kilometer stretch of creamy white sand and turquoise sea.

Cable Beach skirts the coast of Broome in Western Australia. It was named for the communications cable laid between here and Java across the Indian Ocean in 1889.

You can drive 4WD vehicles along the shore, and stake out your own private patch of sand, but it's a good idea to bring shade protection if you're planning to visit during the heat of the day.
