The Phoenix Mercury host the Las Vegas Aces on Friday night to kick off the season. 

Brittney Griner, a player who will not be on the bench, will be on everyone's mind. 

US News reported that Griner is approaching the three-month milestone of her captivity in Russia, with no timeframe for her release while the Mercury and the rest of the WNBA prepare for the 2022 season. 

“We think about her every day,” Mercury guard Skylar Diggins-Smith said recently. “We love her and we’re going to continue to carry her legacy, her voice and play in her honor until she gets back here with us.”

Griner was arrested on Feb. 17 after authorities at the Moscow airport stated they discovered vape cartridges purportedly containing cannabis oil in her luggage, which may result in a 10-year prison sentence. Griner will have a hearing on May 19 after the Biden administration found she is being held illegally.

Griner is a six-time All-Star who earned WNBA Defensive Player of the Year in both 2014 and 2015. In 2021, she had one of her best seasons in the WNBA, leading the league in blocked shots while also ranking second in scoring and sixth in rebounding.
