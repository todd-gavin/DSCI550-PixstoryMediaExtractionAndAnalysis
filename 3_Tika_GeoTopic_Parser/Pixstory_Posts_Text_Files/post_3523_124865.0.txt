In the last decade or so, independent digital marketing agency White Rivers Media has created a remarkable space for itself in the very cluttered and hyper-competitive market.

Launched by Shrenik Gandhi and Mitesh Kothari in 2012, the agency today enjoys the trust and partnership of top brands such as Netflix, Amazon and Dharma Productions, among others.

BestMediaInfo.com caught up with Gandhi, the agency’s Co-Founder and CEO, to find out if the agency has achieved what it hoped to and what lies ahead.

Upon being asked how the 10-year-old milestone feels, Gandhi said he feels both heavy and light since there are not many 10-year-old agencies out there of their size.

“Digital itself as a line of business started some 12 years back. If we have managed what we have done in 10 years then I’m sure we will survive,” he said.

Speaking about his vision and approach for the future, he said they want to focus on creating more impactful work that makes a mark internationally.

“We have a lot of discussions about the anniversary themes. The one thing everyone agreed to in unison was that we are grateful for yesterday and geared up for tomorrow. The next few years are going to be very crucial, especially for the Indian ecosystem.”

 “As we speak, we are geared up to have much more international recognition for the agency and create impact-worthy work that makes waves globally. Awards are never a priority, we are not an agency that will create campaigns for the sake of awards. Having said that, everyone likes awards. Awards would be a cherry on the cake, but they can't be the cake. The cake would be to create impactful and trustworthy work,” he added.
