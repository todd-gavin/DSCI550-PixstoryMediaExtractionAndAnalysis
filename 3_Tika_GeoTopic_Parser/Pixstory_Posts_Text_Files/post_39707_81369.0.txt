Shackets

Brushed plaid “shackets”—a hybrid of shirt and jacket—are among the current fashion trends that can be worn anywhere, any time. Heavier than a flannel shirt but not quite as bulky as a full-on coat, they’re perfect if you need to run out. They also look great with most things you’re already wearing, from sweatpants to turtlenecks.
