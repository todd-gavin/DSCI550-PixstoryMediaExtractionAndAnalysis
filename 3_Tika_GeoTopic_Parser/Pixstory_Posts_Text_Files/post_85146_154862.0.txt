Two major footballing tournaments in the span of six months would thrill any football fan across the globe. After the World Cup in November, it is the time for UEFA Euro 2024 Qualifying fixtures. This qualifying tournament will start in March 2023 and will continue till the end of the year. Euro 2024 is set to happen in June 2024. Ahead of the multi-national tournament, here is our Group A analysis of the qualifying draw. 
In the Group A, the 2010 World Cup winners, Spain are combined with perennial underperformers in Europe, Scotland, Norway, Georgia and the minnows of European football, Cyprus. 
Considering the current form and crop of talent available, Spain should automatically qualify as the topper of the group. Even the second string Spain can close the qualification as the topper of the group. With two spots being available for automatic qualification, the second spot looks like a great race. 
Scotland have qualified for UEFA Euro in the past but have failed in the final tournament to perform. However, this time again, they have a chance to qualify for the next round automatically considering the remaining teams. However, Norway can be a thorn in Scotland’s ambition to qualify for the next round. 
Norway are looking to qualify for their first ever European major tournaments with a solid team. Erling Haaland is on prowl at the moment and the national team will hope to get the benefit of the same. They will be loggerheads with Scots for the second spot. 
Georgia and Cyprus are yet to reach the elite level of football and are highly doubtful of qualifying to the next round of the competition. Considering the form that the other three teams are in, we expect Georgia and Cyprus to finish fourth and fifth respectively. 
Predicted Group Stage finish: Group A 
#1) Spain
#2) Scotland
#3) Norway
#4) Georgia
#5) Cyprus
