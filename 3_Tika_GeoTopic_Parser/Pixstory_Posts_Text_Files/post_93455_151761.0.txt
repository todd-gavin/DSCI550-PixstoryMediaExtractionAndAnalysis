The ego is the false self that reigns on the throne of our minds and hearts, blinding us to everything else, making us think that it is the reality of our being that we are it. But it is a lie.This is a statement from the Bhagavad Gita, which focuses on how being egoistic causes us to feel that whatever we're doing is ideal or the best, neglecting other things around us and failing to perceive the value in others.It is a reason for concern since that individual will never be able to learn something new and will never accept the fact that she or he is flawed.A person should always be open to receiving and processing feedbackâœ¨
