BJP's Rajya Sabha MP from UP, Harnath Singh Yadav, has submitted a private member's bill with the Rajya Sabha secretariat aiming to repeal The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Repeal bill 2022 was submitted on June 25.

Yadav claims that the 1991 Act not only violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality and the right to life but also infringes on citizens' constitutionally ensured right to religious freedom.

"Judicial review is one of the basic features of our Constitution and this Act violates it," Yadav told ET. "The 1991 Act legitimises the invader's illegal encroachment on the places of worship and barbaric acts by imposing an unjustified bar on judicial review."
