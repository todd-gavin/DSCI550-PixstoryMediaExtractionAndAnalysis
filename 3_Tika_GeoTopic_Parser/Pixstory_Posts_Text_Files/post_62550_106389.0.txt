Cockroaches don't bleed much, even when they suffer significant injuries like losing a head. They have an open circulatory system, unlike humans, which relies on a closed network of arteries and veins to distribute blood throughout their bodies. Their blood does not pump under pressure like ours does, but instead sloshes around in the cockroach's tissues. Cockroaches, unlike humans, do not breathe through their noses or mouths. Instead, they breathe through spiracles, which are little holes in their body that do not require a brain to direct. You can breathe as much as you want without a head because there is no nose, mouth, or requirement for a brain to regulate your breathing. Cockroaches, unlike most animals, can survive decapitation because their brain is housed inside their body; and another in their head. Yup, it has two brains - the more primitive one residing in its abdomen. A Cockroach that has been decapitated will continue to tick, move around, and go about its business. It can live a fairly normal life, even without its head. Can't die from bleeding, can't die from suffocation, can't even die from injury. Suddenly makes you think that maybe not bats, but cockroaches make better draculas? Well, here's the secret. One thing the roach has lost is...its mouth. It can't eat, it can't drink. A cockroach without a head will die from starvation and dehydration. But will be able to live for as long as seven days!
