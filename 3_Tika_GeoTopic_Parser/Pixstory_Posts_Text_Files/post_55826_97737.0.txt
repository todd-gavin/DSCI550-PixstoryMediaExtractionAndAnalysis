The Fine Color of Rust by Paddy O'Reilly is both heartbreaking and slyly humorous. It addresses friendship, parenthood, love, and the necessity of battling for what matters in a little village on the outskirts of a struggling economy. 

As lithub points out, Loretta's sarcastic wit masks a profound affection for the dusty village where she finds herself. She had no idea she'd be stuck in Gunapan with two kids, that she'd have to campaign to rescue the primary school, or that her best friend would turn out to be the old garbage guy. 

With no money, power, or a completely functional car, she fights the government to keep the scruffy edge of the world she's come to call home. O'Reilley's prose is at times as mundane as the location, but it rises above the grit and misery with unexpected beauty and wit.
