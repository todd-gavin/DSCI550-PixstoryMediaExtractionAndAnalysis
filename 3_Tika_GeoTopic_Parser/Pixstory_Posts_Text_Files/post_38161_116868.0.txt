Barcelona midfielder Frenkie De Jong has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester United. However, the player's agents are now trying to get the likes of Chelsea and PSG involved for a possible transfer in this window. 

De Jong had become a central figure in the Barcelona lineup over the years. The Dutch midfielder made 140 appearances for the Blaugrana since joining the club from Ajax in 2019. However, the future looks bleak for the midfielder in Barca's colours! 

Barcelona are reportedly looking to offload the 25-year-old in order to maintain the player's salary limit. Manchester United have reportedly been interested in signing De Jong however the Dutch maestro does not want to move there.

Frenkie De Jong reportedly wants to actively play Champions League football. Hence his agent has reportedly offered the midfielder's services to PSG and Chelsea. 

Chelsea and PSG have previously shown interest in de Jong but have not followed up with it by submitting offers to sign him.

Jorginho and N’Golo Kante are on the wrong side of 30 for the Blues, both have also been struggling with fitness issues lately. As for PSG, Les Parisiens have signed Vitinha from FC Porto, but there is still some way to go before the midfield unit is no longer the Achilles heel in their first-team squad.

Hence signing Frenkie De Jong could go a long way in improving the midfield for both the European heavyweights in the coming season.
