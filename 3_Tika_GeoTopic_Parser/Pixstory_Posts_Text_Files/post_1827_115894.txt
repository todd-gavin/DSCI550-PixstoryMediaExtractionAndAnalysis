Saadat Hasan Manto the great Urdu short story writer who six months before he died composed an epitaph for his gravestone that his family thought was too radical to use It went Here lies Saadat Hasan Manto With him lie buried all the arts and mysteries of short story writing Under tons of earth he lies wondering if he is a greater short story writer than God In her book on Manto Ayesha Jalal his great niece writes The pity of Pakistan is that the epitaph does not appear on Manto s grave in the Miani Sahib cemetery in Lahore where he is buried His bereaved elder sister persuaded the rest of the family not to risk enraging those posturing as the face of religious orthodoxy in the self consciously Muslim nation state p Partition was traumatic for Manto and led to his impromptu decision to leave Bombay for Pakistan although he would describe his stay in Bombay to the start of as the happiest and most memorable time of my life Here in Bombay you can do what you like No one will lecture you on what the morally right course is Manto loathed the hypocrisy bound up with public displays and uses of religion and felt that the tragedy of partition was not so much that two countries emerged where there should have been one but that the bloody division transformed both Indians and Pakistanis into slaves of bigotry and slaves of religious passions Jalal p The legacy of partition he was convinced was as tragic as the horror of the events themselves
