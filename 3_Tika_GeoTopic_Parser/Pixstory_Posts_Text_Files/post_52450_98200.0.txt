This is something that I observed in my daily routine. When the morning goes well, the whole day feels like completeness. 

And even something negative happens I’m still positive through out that day.

This quote is inspired from “Ant bhala toh Sab bhala”. Which means “End is well so All is Well”.
This is just opposite of it “Start is Well then the End will be well.” 

Then Starting to End the whole will be well.

It doesn’t mean that If the starting is not well the whole day will be bad. So don’t get it wrong, believe in your process.

Hope I’m clear to you with my thoughts.

Thanks
Stay Khush!
