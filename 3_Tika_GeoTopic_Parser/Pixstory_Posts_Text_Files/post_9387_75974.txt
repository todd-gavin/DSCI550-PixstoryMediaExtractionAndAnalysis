A Strategy to Deter Terrorism continues Terror mentality cannot be countered by persuasion but by challenging the basic premises India can solve its terrorist problem by such a deterrent strategy but for that we have to learn the four lessons outlined above and have a Hindu mindset to take bold risky and hard decisions to defend the nation Terrorists target is Hindu society and its unity Hence arguments against terrorism cannot be by rebuttal but by counter examples If the Jews can be transformed from lambs walking meekly to the gas chambers to fiery lions in just ten years it is not difficult for Hindus in much better circumstances after all we have a country of our own to begin with and are today per cent of India to do so in five years Guru Gobind Singh has shown us the way already how just five fearless persons under spiritual guidance can transform society The Vijayanagaram empire was founded by two re converted from Islam persons Bukka and Hakka under the spititual guidance of Shankaracharya of Sringeri So did Krishnadevaraya Rana Pratap Shivaji Rani Jhansi Kattaboman and Netaji Subhash Bose inspire the nation to greatness But since and so far we Hindus have meekly followed the so called Nehru s secular principles and which has spiritually culturally and mentally castrated the nation of Hindustan But this mindset of never to capitulate to terrorists and to retaliate massively to retard the terrorists political goals requires effective communication in the form of what Harvard scholar T C Schelling called as Compellence Deterrence and Compellenceare two legs on which a nation s security will stand Ever since Schelling wrote his seminal book Arms and Influence in most authors have chosen to define compellence by different names including coercive diplomacy force without war strategic coercion military coercion coercive military strategy We need to distinguish compellence from other uses of military power Deterrence and compellence require use threats of force to influence the behaviour of a target To be continued This account is maintained by Har Anand Publication
