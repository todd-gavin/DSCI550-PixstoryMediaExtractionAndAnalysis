BTS kickstarted their Permission to Dance on stage concert in Seoul with a bang! The septet made ARMY groove, nailed some impeccable outfits and left us all stunned by their performance prowess yet again. But if you failed to notice Jimin's tattoo, then you probably haven't been anywhere around Twitter recently. The BTS singer needs no reason to trend, but his brand-new tattoos have been the talk of the town ever since their debut during the concert. While ARMY has been a big fan of Jimin's 'Nevermind' and 'Young Forever' tat, now we got two more to gush over. The first one is on the back of his neck, a crescent moon with shading inside. The second one is behind his ear and seems to be a writing of sorts that isn't readable yet. Hopefully, Jimin will himself take the time to clarify the meaning behind his lovely ink. Ever since we caught a glimpse of his new ink, fans have been going gaga, showering love on the new additions to his tattoo family. With this, Jimin and Jungkook still remain the only two tattoo enthusiasts of BTS.
Coming back to their concert, the boys seemed to have had a gala time making the 'clappers' move as they hosted a show sans any cheering, due to the pandemic. Nevertheless, the boys set the stage on fire with their impeccable setlist for the show.
Planning a countdown till D-Day, BTS themselves seemed to be pumped to have met their Korean ARMY after two long years. From RM's blonde hair to Jimin's new tattoos, fans sure were in for a treat, and this was just the first day of their Seoul concerts.
