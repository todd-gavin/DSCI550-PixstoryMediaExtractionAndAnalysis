Art in times of war is crucial as what it portrays and coveys gives a broader imagination and picture of the massacre that one will not imagine otherwise.

The recent war between Ukraine and Russia has made it a point to acknowledge how necessary it is for art to create an impact, but sadly the world of social media has waned the importance of art during wartime.

We are often left with some vicious images and messages proliferating online without a more profound picture of the crimes and whatever is going on.
The power Picasso's Guernica has would not lie in the images we see; people definitely empathise with the situation of war if photos of piled dead bodies are posted on social media. Still, what is better said by allegory is that it couldn't be done with videos or pictures.

Art has the power to invoke in us a sense of feeling to everything we see, and the link between imagination and form is deeper in understanding the calamities.
It gives us a picture of human suffering; the visual representation of agony will make people sympathise with time and make us understand history well.

Art can play a role in revitalising whatever is missing in our lives, which is not clearly or artistically portrayed through modern forms of evoking imagination in anyone.
