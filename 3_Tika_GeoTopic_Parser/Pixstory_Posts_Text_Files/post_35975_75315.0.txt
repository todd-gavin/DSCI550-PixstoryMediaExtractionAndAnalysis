Unvaccinated Green Bay Packers star Aaron Rodgers slammed President Joe Biden’s “fake White House” after the commander in chief joked last month about the quarterback not getting inoculated against COVID-19.

In a lengthy ESPN story about the outspoken NFL veteran published Friday, Rodgers fumed about Biden recently labeling COVID-19 the “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” 

“When the president of the United States says, ‘This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,’ it’s because him and his constituents, which, I don’t know how there are any if you watch any of his attempts at public speaking, but I guess he got 81 million votes,” Rodgers said Thursday, according to ESPN.

“But when you say stuff like that, and then you have the CDC, which — how do you even trust them? — but then they come out and talk about 75 percent of the COVID deaths have at least four comorbidities. And you still have this fake White House set saying that this is the pandemic of the unvaccinated, that’s not helping the conversation.”

A CDC study found that just 36 of a group of 1,228,664 people who were fully vaccinated between December 2020 and October 2021 died because of the virus, and most of them had pre-existing conditions.

Rodgers’ comments came after Biden in December quipped to man wearing a Packers winter hat, “Tell your quarterback he’s got to get the vaccine,” while touring tornado damage in Kentucky, according to a reporter. The joke came at the end of a conversation as they were saying goodbye, CBS White House reporter Ed O’Keefe tweeted at the time.

Despite claiming in August he was “immunized” against COVID-19, reports emerged in November that Rodgers was unvaccinated, when his positive test for the virus caused him to miss a game.

Rodgers reportedly decided to receive an alternative “homeopathic treatment” from his personal doctor to raise his antibody levels, in lieu of the safe and effective coronavirus vaccines.
