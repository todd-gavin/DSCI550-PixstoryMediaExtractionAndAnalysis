#3. Martin Odegaard
Martin Odegaard joined Arsenal on a permanent basis last summer after impressing in hisloan spell which began in January 2021. It is safe to say that Odegaard has impressed massively as he is the captain of the North London club. He plays a vital role in Mikel Arteta’s system and is the best chance-creator in the side. The 23-year-old is a technically gifted player and does a brilliant job for Arsenal in the number 10 role. He is tidy on the ball, rarely gives it away and possesses that special quality of creating chances for histeammates. He has played a big part in Arsenal’s transformation under Arteta and it is clearto see how high he is rated by the manager as he was given the captaincy.
#2. Leo Hjelde
Leo Hjelse is a Norwegian footballer and currently plays for Leeds United. Hjelde plays atcentre back and joined Leeds on a four-year deal in August 2021 from Celtic for an undisclosed fee.The 19-year-old played in Scotland for two years and that experience will help him deal with the physical demands of the Premier League. He is still very young but possesses good potential and it will be intriguing to see how he performs in the Premier League.
#1. Erling Haaland
Erling Haaland joined Manchester City this summer and is arguably the best striker in the Premier League. City paid his release clause of 60 million euros for the Norwegian and that is proving to be a bargain. Haaland was prolific in Germany for Borussia Dortmund and many expected he would be a success for City and so far that is exactly what he is proving to be. The striker has 11 goal contributions in six league games (10 goals and 1 assist). This is simply mind-blowing, and it will be no surprise if Haaland hits 40+ goals this season for City.
