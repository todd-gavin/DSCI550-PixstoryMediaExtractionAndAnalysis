On Friday, the west of Kabul once again witnessed a bloody and deadly attack; An attack that once again targeted the "Kaaj‚Äùeducational center. This educational center was the target of a similar attack once in 2017.The repetition of these crimes leaves no doubt that Hazara are officially the target of a genocide, genocide or racial cleansing; Because despite the change of political regimes, there is no change in this policy, and this means that powerful hands at the head of all the regimes dominating Afghanistan during the last decades are complicit in these crimes, and despite all the differences between them They have, at least in one field, a consensus, and that is the complete exclusion of the Shia Hazaras.It is based on this assessment that the recognition of the Hazara genocide has now become a global demand; Because the killing of Hazara is the main goal for the perpetrators of these crimes, regardless of the range of those who are targeted and victimized, and in the meantime, it does not matter if it is innocent students of an educational center in the most remote part of the capital, or worshipers, ordinary passengers of passenger cars, or even workers. Mining and civilian travelers on long-distance routes.In this way, instead of "condemning", the world should recognize these organized and systematic killings as a clear example of genocide and fulfill its responsibilities to stop it and punish the agents behind the scenes and on the stage of such crimes.Another demand is directed at the Taliban; A group that was directly accused of being involved in such killings and had committed similar crimes in the targeted massacre of Shia Hazaras in Bamyan, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kabul and other areas in the first period of its rule.
