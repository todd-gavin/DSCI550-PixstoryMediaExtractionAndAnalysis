My mother's favorite exercise is Sukhasana. She further explains
SUKHASANA: Complete your exercise after performing the recommended movements through meditation. In one of the yoga sessions, stand with your spine straight and your head in line with your spine and close your eyes. You can do any meditation you want. The simplest practice exercise is to think of a simple, short, and positive sentence that fits your current situation. For example: "I am calm" You can even choose a word like "calm". Then begin to become aware of your natural breathing and focus on your natural outbursts and exhalations. Repeat the word or phrase you have chosen with each tail. If annoying thoughts come to you, just watch them calmly and calmly and slowly return your attention and focus to the word or sentence of your choice. You will soon see that you have regained control of your mind and there is no news of these annoying thoughts! Keep doing this for 5 to 10 minutes.
