Scout Report - Young U19 Players taking the World by Storm
Musiala has made most of his touches in the attacking third and in the penalty box with the 98 and 99 percentile respectively. He made 30.96 and 6.88 touches per 90.
From the heatmap, we can see that he had a high amount of touches in the attacking third and in the penalty box. He is an intelligent player, as he recognizes which foot he should use to make his passes to his teammates.
Goal Scoring
Jamal with his assists also scored 5 goals. He had a goal-scoring frequency of 291 minutes. He scored 0.3 goals per 90. He ranks 92 percentile in scoring goals. All 5 goals were scored inside the box. 4 were scored with his right foot and the other with his head. 
Verdict
Musiala’s meteoric rise in the Bundesliga camp has been immense. The boy from Chelsea academy has made it to the starting line-up of the German giants. With popularity, there come rumors, and as per the rumor, Manchester City and Chelsea are after him. You can expect Bayern to keep their star boy for 2-3 years before selling him for a huge amount.
Musiala traded 3 lions for wearing the German national color. England and Southgate received a huge blow because having him in their ranks would be a huge blessing.
Considering he is only 19 years old he can be the main threat to other teams if he is nurtured properly. He could be a player to watch out for in a couple of seasons.
Florian Wirtz
Till now I've mentioned Eduardo Camavinga, Ansu Fati, Pedri, Gavi, and Jamal Musiala. Now we have saved the best for the last. 
Came from the Koln academy, having progressed through it and being named as the ‘best midfielder to come out of the club in 30 years ‘. Despite Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Liverpool circling him, Bayer Leverkusen won the race and got him for 200,000. His name is Florian Wirtz.
