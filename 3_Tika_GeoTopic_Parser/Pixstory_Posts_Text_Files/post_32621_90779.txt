It will be the paternity with the arrival of the eldest daughter Giulietta it will be that the weight of almost three decades of MotoGP begins to fade on the shoulders of the champion from Tavullia but Valentino Rossi who emerges from a long interview granted to Il Giornale is a mature man without envy with still many goals in life and with fewer controversial aftermaths above all with his former bitter rivals But if the friendly declarations towards former rivals Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo are not surprising, it is sensational to hear him speak like never before about Max Biaggi his nemesis practically always With Casey there was a great rapprochement explained Valentino He often sends me messages from Australia he asks me about the baby and we also met And also with Jorge now a friend who came to the km of the Ranch and in the evening we danced together Persin with Max there was a rapprochement At the time I was nobody and he was number one in Italy and one of the strongest in the world and I started annoying him I was a bastard he smiles But now it&#39;s all over we&#39;ve gotten closer again it was a beautiful sporting rivalry
