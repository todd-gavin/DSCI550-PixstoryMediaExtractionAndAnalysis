On August Barcelona fans witnessed perhaps one of the saddest days in the Catalan club s history The team s legendary striker Lionel Messi left Camp Nou due to the La Liga giant s financial challenges to join Paris Saint Germain PSG as a free agent After several weeks of negotiations Barcelona finally notified their finest player that they could not extend his contract At a farewell press conference three days later Messi acknowledged that he was surprised Ironically exactly a year after Messi s heart breaking departure the La Liga giants presented the former Bayern Munich legend before the start of the campaign on Friday Even though Lewandowski has played only in three preseason games thousands of supporters came to Camp Nou to see him introduced as a Barcelona player The fact that he entered the field wearing the recognisable number nine shirt may be the most intriguing aspect Lewandowski wore number during the preseason matches as Memphis Depay wore the number next season It appears that the two must have resolved for Lewandowski to take his number While that may be the most important information gleaned from Lewandowski s presentation the excitement stirred up was probably the most astonishing aspect Lewandowski mimicked club legend Ronaldinho while juggling the ball and playing to the crowd by balancing it on his lips Star power certainly seems to be back at Camp Nou
