Week in, week out, Manchester United's defense is getting slandered by stronger and weaker teams. Earlier the argument was that it was due to Harry Maguire that the team was losing. But it was proved wrong when Man United was finished off soundly by Arsenal without Maguire. 


The current boss Ralf Rangnick has sounded the alarm that the whole defense needs to be upgraded. Though the whole team needs to be upgraded from striker to goalkeeper, for now, we will focus on the defense.  


Man United, as always, have been linked with a plethora of players. From Kounde to Schlotterbeck, the Red Devils are linked with every player on earth. However, the two players for whom United seem to have held definitive talks are Pau Torres and Jurrien Timber. 


For now, we will dive into Pau Torres. The left-footed CB is a Spanish national who plays for Villarreal and Spain national team. He is a left center-back, who partners Raul Albiol in the starting lineup. 

Passing


Looking at his passing stats, the Spaniard has made a total of 3364 passes out of which he had made 1562 complete passes. He is decent in long passes as he has made 333 passes long successful passes. He has made an eye-raising amount of progressive passes - 150. It puts him top 2 in the number of progressive passes made behind Daniel Parejo with 191.  He ranks 90 percentile, having 4.28 per 90.

Pau has made a total of 155 passes into the final third of the pitch. Again he’s the second-highest passer into the final third behind Daniel Parejo. The Spaniard is not afraid of playing from the back, bringing his other teammates onto the play. 

Torres has made a total of 2038 touches out of which he had a maximum in the Defensive third and middle third with 1053 and 1089 touches respectively. Pau ranks behind the midfielder who has 2086 touches to his name. Torres has made 36.70 per 90 touches in the defensive third and 33.19 touches in the middle third.
