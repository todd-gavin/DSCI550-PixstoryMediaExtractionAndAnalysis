The Apex body of Indian Football AIFF was banned by FIFA for undue influence by third parties.

India is a growing business market for any sport. Indians are not only fans of the sports, they are fanatics, they worship the sports person and love the sports more than life itself.

The rise of cricket in India and BCCI in Cricketing Bodies has been legendary. Cricket is treated as a separate religion and has been exceptional. Football could have the same fate in India, so it is really sad to see that the apex Indian body has been banned by FIFA.

FIFA should reconsider bringing India in after making sure that it complies with the protocols so that Indian Football and the whole Football community can prosper freely.
