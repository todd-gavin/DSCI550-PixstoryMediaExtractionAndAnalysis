Our republic, which turns 70 today, has many founders. Some are national icons — Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru, BR Ambedkar, and Maulana Azad. They were vitally involved in the debates and decisions of the Constituent Assembly. Govind Ballabh Pant, Alladi Krishnaswamy and KM Munshi are also well known for their role in framing the Constitution. Beyond this inner circle, however, there are hundreds of unsung men and women who made important contributions to the republic’s creation.
