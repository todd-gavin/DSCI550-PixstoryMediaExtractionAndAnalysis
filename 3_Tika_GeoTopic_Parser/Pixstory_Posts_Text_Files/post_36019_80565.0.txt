Joe Biden has reaffirmed the United States’ “commitment to support” Saudi Arabia against attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, the White House said, as the US president spoke by phone with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.

Wednesday’s call came as the Houthis have intensified drone and missile attacks against Saudi Arabia and have begun directly targeting the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Riyadh’s key ally in the region.

The president underscored the US commitment to support Saudi Arabia in the defense of its people and territory from these attacks and full support for UN-led efforts to end the war in Yemen,” the White House said in a statement describing the talks.

A Saudi-led and US-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to push back the Yemeni rebels, who had taken over most of the country, including the capital, Sanaa, and to restore the Gulf-backed government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

The war has brought Yemen to the verge of famine, sparking what the United Nations has said is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

The coalition accuses the rebels of being proxies of Iran – a charge that both the Houthis and Tehran reject. On Wednesday, the White House described the Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia as “Iranian-enabled”.

The Houthis also launched a drone-and-missile attack that killed three people in Abu Dhabi on January 17, as well as several similar attacks that subsequently targeted the Gulf country.
