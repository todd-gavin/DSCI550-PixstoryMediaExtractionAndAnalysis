Many of the dead who committed sins or did not believe in God will have the chance to discover the truth and change their old ways of living and deeds after they are raised from the dead. Their past deeds won't be held against them, which is consistent with the Bible's teaching that death is the price of sin and that when someone dies, they have atoned for their sins. (Read Romans 6:7, 23.)
