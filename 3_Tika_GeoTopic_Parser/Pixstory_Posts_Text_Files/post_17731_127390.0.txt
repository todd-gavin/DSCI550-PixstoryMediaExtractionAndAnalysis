One of Saturday Night Live's favourite comics is finally receiving the credit he deserves.

Kenan Thompson, a comedian and actor, was recognised with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week during a ceremony Thursday night in Los Angeles, Calif.

The 44-year-old arrived for his big moment in style, dressed in an all-navy suit and joined by his two kids for the career-making night.

Leslie Jones, Kenan's former SNL co-star, psyched him up as she anxiously videotaped the star's presentation, getting a close-up look of Thompson's sparkling new accomplishment and later gave a speech in his honour.
On the historic landmark, the comedian is in excellent company, as he recently shared his star with another comedy classic.

During his statement at the ceremony, the comic revealed that his star was placed next to that of SNL creator Lorne Michaels.
"It's an honour and a joy to go in with the GOAT Lorne Michaels," Thompson added.
