While when it comes to Pardeep Narwal he has struggled with injuries in recent times which meant that agility has taken a hit It was evident in the last season when he was criticised by his coach for his slow movements on the mat But if Pardeep Narwal is fully fit it would be really difficult for oppositions to stop him It would be interesting to see how he is used by Yoddhas this season Surinder Gill did the bulk of the raiding in season and he found tremendous success Yoddhas therefore will have a couple of good options to choose from when it comes to raiding with yet another option of using Nitin Tomar available to them If Pardeep is used as he was used by Ram Mehar Singh in Patna Pirates the race to the top spot for highest raid points could be very tight between him and Pawan Kumar Sherawat Current form is with Pawan but he has a new team to adjust into which might take games so Pardeep will have an advantage there But knowing Pawan and his hunger to succeed it would still be difficult to displace him from the top spot in the raiding department Anyway he mentioned after the auction on Star Sports he doesn t wish to hand over the green arm band just yet Image Credit Pradeep Narwal
