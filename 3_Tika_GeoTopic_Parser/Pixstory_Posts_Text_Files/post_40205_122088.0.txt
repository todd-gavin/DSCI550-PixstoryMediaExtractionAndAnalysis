The Parenthood and Friday Night Lights creator has reunited with the company behind both shows and has signed a multiple-project deal with Imagine Television. Yes, I am as excited as you for this! 

Hollywood Reporter said that under the pact, the showrunner is said to already be hard at work on three projects (details of which remain under wraps). 

“Jason Katims is behind some of the best television series of our time. His ability to tap into the American zeitgeist and create characters that touch our hearts and souls is unparalleled.” said Kristen Zolner, head of Imagine Television. “We are beyond thrilled to be partnering with Jason and excited for what’s to come.”

The deal comes on the heels of the prolific showrunner’s TV pact with Apple, for whom he has drama Dear Edward in the works. Katims had been based at Apple since he left his longtime home at FNL and Parenthood studio Universal Television in 2019.

“I am thrilled to reunite with Imagine, who have been my partners on two of the best creative experiences of my career,” said Katims.
