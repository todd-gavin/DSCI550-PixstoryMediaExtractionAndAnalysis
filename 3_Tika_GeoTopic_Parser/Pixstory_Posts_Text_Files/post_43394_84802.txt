Am I the only one who is wondering if Downey Jr will be back as our loved Iron Man in the Marvel movies again Am I the only one who is a bit heart broken because deep inside we know that he won t be back as Iron Man Though we know that he ll be charming us with new roles in other movies Apart from knowing him as a good actor do you know how much he struggled even though he was the son of a famous film maker and actor Robert Downey Sr Downey Sr being a drug addict exposed his son to drugs at a very young age Downey Jr at the age of started using drugs till the age of and then he was testified in court for abuse of a number of drugs such as cocaine heroine and therafter imprisoned His problem escalated from to and then he went to rehab time to time Eventually he emerged as clean and sober in and he rebuild his career His life story clearly justifies his quotations Remember that just because you hit bottom doesn t mean you have to stay there He is my real life Iron Man
