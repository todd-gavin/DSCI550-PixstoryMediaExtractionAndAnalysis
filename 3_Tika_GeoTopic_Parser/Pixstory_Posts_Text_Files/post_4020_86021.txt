I realise that while I look back many of my ideologies perspectives have changed over time I feel that I have started voicing out my opinions more when compared to the conditioned me I wouldn t say I have totally unlearned many stereotypes but I m trying to break it down and overcome those Why do we still have limitations when we actually can enjoy our time in our own ways I m happy that I have started prioritising my happiness while trying to overcome the limitations imposed I think embracing our identity and contemplating on what we have achieved helps us to develop our self confidence as well So think about what you have achieved than getting pulled back on thoughts on what you couldn t And when you were not able to do something I m sure you have learned something new and definitely CAN Improve on that ability
