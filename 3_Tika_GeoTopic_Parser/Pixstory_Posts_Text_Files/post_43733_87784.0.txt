The Gunners will travel to Aston Villa for their third game in six days.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the Premier League has treated his team unfairly by assigning them a crowded schedule.
After losing 2-0 to Liverpool on Wednesday, Arsenal will play their third game in six days when they face Aston Villa.
The north London club will face Chelsea and Manchester United three days apart next month in another tense run.
What exactly has been said?
The coach was dissatisfied with the schedule and sarcastically thanked the Premier League for assigning them such a demanding schedule.
“Thank you so much to the Premier League for doing that," Arteta told reporters after the defeat to Liverpool.
"And they’ve done it again when we have to play Chelsea and Manchester United. So if they want to give them any advantage, I say to them today: ‘Thank you so much for doing that’.”
He added: “No [the Premier League wouldn't change the schedule]. It is always it’s BT, it’s Sky, it is this, it’s that. But the one that is affected is Arsenal and the only thing that I care [about] and we care [about] is Arsenal. And for Arsenal it is not fair.”
Despite the hectic schedule, Arteta claims his squad will be ready to face Villa.
“Yes, 100 per cent. Don’t worry the players on Saturday they will be there, with energy," he said.
"They will eat, sleep well, but thank you so much to the Premier League for putting the fixtures like this. Very, very helpful.”
Arsenal is still in fourth place, a point clear of Manchester United, although Arteta's side has two games in hand.
Following the match against Aston Villa at the weekend, Arsenal will face Crystal Palace on April 4.
