Paris Saint-Germain is proud to announce the signing of Lieke Martens for the next three seasons. The Dutch striker has committed to the Rouge et Bleu until 30 June 2025.

Lieke Martens started her professional career at the age of 17 with SC Heerenveen. After her first season, she moved to VVV Vento before joining Standard Liege in 2011.

The striker then moved on to German club Duisburg and then to Swedish sides Kopparbergs GÃ¶teborg FC and FC Rosengard. For the past five seasons, she has played for Barcelona, with whom she won her first Champions League and nine national titles.

Lieke Martens was selected for the Dutch national team for the first time in 2011. After participating in Euro 2013 and the 2015 World Cup, she won the European Championship title in 2017 with the 'Oranje' in front of their home crowd. The 29-year-old was named best player of the tournament and, a few months later, player of the year by both UEFA and FIFA. The Dutchwoman now has 133 caps and 54 goals for the Netherlands.

The Club welcomes Lieke to the Rouge et Bleu family.
