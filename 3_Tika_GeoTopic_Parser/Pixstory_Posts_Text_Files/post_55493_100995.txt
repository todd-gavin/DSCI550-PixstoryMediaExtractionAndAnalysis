B nh mi has always been my favourite sandwich Crusty bread and South east Asian spices and sours perfection We can easily get it in the vibrant Vietnamese neighbourhoods in Hackney and around Soho it s crazy how pricey it is though I ve eaten very good B nh mi in Vietnam and California for a very local price which makes me think how capitalised this hot and cold sandwich has become and why it was originally created The price of tells of the time when Southern Vietnam was French colony and locals weren t allowed to eat French food and vice versa Culinary xenophobia was a thing They believed that rice and meat kept the Vietnamese weak whilst bread and meat made them strong Bread meats and beers were reserved for those who had to sustain a European diet As WWI kicked off these European goods flooded the local market for the first time at affordable prices They tasted and slowly the ingredients were incorporated into the Vietnamese diet and B nh m was created so the locals could enjoy a delicious and nutritious meal of carbs protein and fire European inspired Though ingredients were altered to suit their economy weather and taste The bread recipe was improved so it could withstand the Saigon heat Expensive materials like p t and meats were adapted for locally made cold meats Vietnamese style pickled salad was featured and topped with chillies or coriander Combining a few tasty ingredients together in a small baguette and that s how the initial Banh mi came to be an official Vietnamese sandwich in the s that everyone and anyone could eat North and south featured different fillings but it was made to be inexpensive and delicious for everyone and anyone to enjoy We can now enjoy it easily but this simple sandwich encapsulates decades of history and change it tells of the struggles and how the Vietnamese adapted For us enjoying it now we get a taste of East and West in one bite Source Instagram
