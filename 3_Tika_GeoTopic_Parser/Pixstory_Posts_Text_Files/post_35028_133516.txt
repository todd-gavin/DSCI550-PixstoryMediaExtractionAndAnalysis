Federico Bernardeschi now Canadian by adoption He said he feels at home and Toronto has already settled in completely with his new team and is already having its say on the pitch too, having scored goals and provided an assist The former Fiorentina and Juventus player told some background stories to La Gazzetta dello Sport After a month in Toronto I feel as if I have been living here for years I was impressed by everything From the city to the human and professional way of life I was introduced as a star and I immediately perceived an extraordinary enthusiasm The European Championship gave me and Insigne a worldwide popularity and the reception proves it The difference between the Italian and American leagues is great but according to Bernardeschi a gap that will narrow over the years Many players see an opportunity in MLS and have realized how much football is growing here Many players from A called me to find out I was pleased because curiosity is synonymous with intelligence Here I found a crazy intensity like in international matches But in terms of technique and tactics we are behind European football I predict a rapid evolution in the coming years
