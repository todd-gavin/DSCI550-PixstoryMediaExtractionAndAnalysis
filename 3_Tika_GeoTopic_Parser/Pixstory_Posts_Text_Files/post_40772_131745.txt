The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile Through the swung half door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him And brought water and fill d a tub for his sweated body and bruis d feet And gave him a room that enter d from my own and gave him some coarse clean clothes And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass d north I had him sit next me at table my fire lock lean d in the corner Walt Whitman
