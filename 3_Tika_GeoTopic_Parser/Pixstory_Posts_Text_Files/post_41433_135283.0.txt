In her first round of competition at the U.S. Open since her retirement, Venus Williams was defeated. 

Williams fell to Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium 6-1, 7-6 (5) in Arthur Ashe Stadium, where Serena, her younger sister, had triumphed the previous evening. 

US News reported that Venus Williams, 42, received a wild card to the match she first participated in in 1997 and finished second in. Due to an injury, she missed the competition that she won in 2000 and 2001 last year. 

Williams' singles record for this year is at 0-4 now. Since 1994, she has triumphed in at least one match per year.

It is a bummer since I was looking forward to watch her play!
