Big day for India’s fight against COVID-19! 
5 crore youngsters between age 15-18 are vaccinated. 

On the official twitter handle Health ministry of India 
Posted a picture in which PM of India announcing happily that we have completed 5 crore vaccination with a caption - 

“युवा शक्ति का वंदन अभिनंदन

5 करोड़ से अधिक 15-18 आयुवर्ग के युवाओं को लगी वैक्सीन की पहली डोज। 

Young India is fighting the pandemic with full vigour. Great going, my young friends!”

The vaccination for youngsters age 15-18 years has started on 3rd January 2022 , been a month and we have already completed 5 crore vaccination for children.

Since Delhi Government Announced that school with re-open for children from 7th February 2022, it was very much needed to provide vaccination to children, so that their studies no longer could suffer. 

Its been almost 2 years since schools and colleges are shut across country because of the Covid19 surge, i believe government should start re-opening the education Institutes so that students can get back to normal life because thankfully most of the population is vaccinated and now the children too.
