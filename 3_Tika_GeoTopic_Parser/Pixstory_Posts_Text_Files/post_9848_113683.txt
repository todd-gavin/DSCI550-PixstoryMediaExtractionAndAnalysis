Be strong We are not here to play to dream to drift We have hard work to do and loads to lift Shun not the struggle face it Tis God s gift Be strong Say not the days are evil Who s to blame And fold not the hands and acquiesce O shame Stand up speak out and bravely in God s name Be strong It matters not how deep entrenched the wrong How hard the battle goes the day how long Faint not fight on To morrow comes the song
