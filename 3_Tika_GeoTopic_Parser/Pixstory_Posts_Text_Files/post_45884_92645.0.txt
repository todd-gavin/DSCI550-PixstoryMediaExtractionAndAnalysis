Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood is a fictional tale set in a dystopian world. Yes, it has feminist themes but it is not a feminist manifesto and neither it claims to be.

“It also states that feminist concepts alone don’t offer protection from male domination.” Yes, and this is true. Concepts never offer protection unless they are applied practically. Existence of feminism is a proof of struggle against patriarchy but it’s existence does not guarantee erasure of patriarchy. 
 
The “feminists” in the novel are characters that future the story and like I said, are not part of a feminist manifesto. 
Moreover, feminism is not a static but a dynamic concept so every take on it, including Atwood’s on good and bad feminists is valid. 

“Handmaid's Tale even though dealing with the oppression of women does not offer a solution. She portrays that in one way or another women will remain oppressed in this dystopian world.”: It is not the job a fictional novel to offer solutions on how to dismantle patriarchy. Additionally, the very meaning of dystopia is an imagined state or society where there is great suffering or injustice. So it is futile to look for a feminist revolution there. 

Atwood’s ‘The Handmaid’s Tale” is a novel with both feminist and social realist themes. To do a singular reading of the novel is setting yourself up for disappointment.
