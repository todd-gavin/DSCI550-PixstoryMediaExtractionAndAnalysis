The Los Angeles Lakers are gaining momentum in the lead up to the Play In Tournament picking up two important wins over the last week Since last Friday L A has beaten the Toronto Raptors and the Cleveland Cavaliers while also taking two losses against the Washington Wizards and the Philadelphia ers But even when they were defeated the Purple and Gold showed signs of improvement in their game particularly on the offensive side of the ball The Lakers boasted the third best offense over the last week behind the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics Their scoring made up for defensive vulnerabilities L A s defense ranked in the bottom during the same stretch as the Purple and Gold outscored their opponents by points per possessions recording a positive net rating among other teams in the NBA Well I think our last couple of games our offensive energy has been great says Dwight Howard who scored a team high points against the ers The defensive end doing a little bit better job There s still some areas that we need to clean up but the fact on the offensive end that we re actually playing with pace and finishing around the paint and getting to the free throw line and stuff like that we ve got to continue to do that Defensively they put us in some pretty good situations We just had to really use our intelligence to try and stop them They did a good job on the offensive end Howard admits that it took quite a long time for the Lakers to figure things out But he adds the Purple and Gold have been trying to play off of each other and be as effective on the court as they can be and the year old center thinks it s been working to our favor as of late Regardless of how late in the season the Lakers form started to surge Howard believes they still have something to play for this year
