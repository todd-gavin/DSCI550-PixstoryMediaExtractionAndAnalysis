Identifying the presence of the phobia isn t that easy but there are some ways in which people may experience the fear of failure Believing that you don t have the skills or knowledge to achieve something This happens when you start questioning yourself for everything you do The persistent questions can lead to believing you will fail if you try to do any activity The constant feeling that you won t be able to achieve your goals Procrastinating to the point that it affects your performance or ability to finish on time But on the other hand avoiding doing something repeatedly can severely affect daily activities and your life Sometimes telling people that you will probably fail so that expectations remain low Underestimating your abilities to avoid feeling let down Worrying that imperfections or short comings will make other people think less of you Worrying that you will disappoint others if you fail This worrying and confusion are increased to the degree that the person eventually tries to give up
