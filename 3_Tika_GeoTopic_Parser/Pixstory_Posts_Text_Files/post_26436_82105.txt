The common thread among the collections presented these days during New York Fashion Week seems to be modularity, i.e. garments made up of distinct units that can be used individually as well as as a whole At Peter Do sleeveless overcoats are also scarves in fact they are sections of coats such as the collar and the front part equipped with laces to be closed behind to wear them like a low-cut top or simply knotted to protect the neck from the cold. At Dion Lee, on the other hand, a completely modular vest becomes a sweater or a jacket by connecting it with maxi gloves shoulder length reminiscent of those of butchers Fashion becomes practical and intelligent assembly
