Abortion is already restricted in Texas, Tennessee, and Idaho, but the laws that will go into effect on Thursday will either outlaw the procedure completely or impose harsher penalties on doctors who perform an abortion, causing a fundamental change in who has access to the procedure in their home states.
Most abortions are prohibited in at least 11 additional states. The courts have temporarily overturned similar laws in five additional states. Millions more people may soon be unable to access abortions; overall, 36% of American women between the ages of 15 and 44 would be mostly unable to get an elective abortion in the state where they reside.
Medical professionals who support abortion rights are concerned that the most recent trigger laws, which in Texas could result in a life sentence for those who perform an abortion, will make it harder to assist those who need an abortion due to life-threatening complications or even those who are trying to travel to another state for one. As restrictions have been blocked and unblocked by judges, access to abortion has altered day by day in some states.
It is unfortunate that so many people in need of medical assistant due to complicated pregnancies, or for that matter who can't afford or want children, are facing life threatening sentences for it. While there's not much we can do, we need to keep fighting for reproductive rights of people. My body is not for the state to rule.
