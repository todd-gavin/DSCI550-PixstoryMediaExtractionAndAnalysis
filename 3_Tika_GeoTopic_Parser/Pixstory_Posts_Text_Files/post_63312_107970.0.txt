If you're feeling stuck and want to see
more progress, start with these four habits

All of which are fairly low effort, and have disproportional upside (relative to the time and energy required to implement them:

1) Planning your meals in advance
Imagine entering every month without a budget, or any real idea of when and how you'll be spending your money and expecting to thrive financially. Sounds silly, right?

Then why are you winging the vast majority of your meals and expecting to make good choices?
You can turn this around in as little as 2-5 minutes per night. All you need to do is pull out your phone, plug in the next day's meals, and see if you need to make any adjustments.

2) Walking 6,000-8,000+ steps per day
I realize lots of people don't think they have time for this, and this would be true if 6,000-8,000+ steps required hours of your time. But it doesn't. 15-20 minutes of
movement before and after work (and ideally during a lunch break) will put a huge dent in this goal.

3) Drinking ~50% of your bodyweight in ounces A gallon of water per day is a nice, simple recommendation -but it's a ton of water for some people. About 50% of your bodyweight in ounces is generally a better goal, and one that'll leave you feeling great throughout the day.

4) Unplugging 20-30+ minutes before bed Staying glued to a screen until you fall asleep reduces your sleep quality, delays your bedtime, leads to poor decision- making, and even heightens stress and anxiety in some
people.
Setting a hard cut-off time for electronics is a no-brainer, and doesn't require much effort.
