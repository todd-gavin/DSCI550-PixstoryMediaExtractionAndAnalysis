In order to better work with hundreds of Native American tribes as they deal with calamities brought on by climate change the Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a new strategy VOA reported that FEMA will consult with the federally recognised tribal nations with potential climate change threats in the future Grants totaling million have been set aside for tribes looking for methods to lessen the hardships brought on by harsh weather More training will be provided to tribal governments on the FEMA funding application process According to the new strategy tribal liaisons must report to FEMA officials annually on how well prepared their respective tribes are We are seeing communities across the country that are facing increased threats as a result of climate change FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a conference call with media What we want to do in this strategy is make sure that we can reach out to tribal nations and help them understand what the potential future threats are going to be Irrespective of whether this strategy works or not I am glad that efforts are being taken to include native Americans in the climate change reversal movement
