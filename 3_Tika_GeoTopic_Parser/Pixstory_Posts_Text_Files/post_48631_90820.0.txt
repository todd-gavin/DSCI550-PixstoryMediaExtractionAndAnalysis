“The big thing is we’re playing all these young guys and they’re getting valuable experience,’’ Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “And you’re never eliminated until you’re eliminated. I don’t want a quitting spirit on our team. I want to keep playing. Until we’re eliminated we’re going to keep playing. 

“We have guys who are growing. I don’t believe in that other stuff [tanking]. We had a heavy road schedule and this team is responding. It’s a good solid won for us.’’

It was easy to suspend disbelief and imagine what the Knicks could be for one night at Madison Square Garden. RJ Barrett, who scored 28 points and helped the Knicks extend their advantage in the third quarter, continued to demand the ball and display a fearlessness that will only grow as he does.

"That guy is balling!" Mitch Robinson exclaimed with a broad grin.

There was Obi Toppin, who scored 17 points in 20 minutes off the bench and brought the kind of raw athleticism that has been sorely lacking from previous Knicks squads. Thibodeau even extended Toppin's fourth-quarter minutes instead of bringing back Randle until there were only a few minutes left.
