Soooo … Ranbir Kapoor returned to the big screens after 4-long years. As we all know that Shamshera was given a tag of flop despite of having good story content, plot, Cast and even a mega director of all the timesss karan johar ….. Of course, no one could predict that especially not the fact that the directorial will not even be able to recover its budget….✔️✔️
But moving on and talking about A big project BRAHMASTRA ….. Brahmastra is a fantasy film directed by Ayan Mukerji and stars Ranbir along with Alia Bhatt, Amitabh Bachchan, Mouni Roy, and Nagarjuna in pivotal roles…. The very first song of movie got a lot of critisism and apart from this Loveee tooo …🎬🎬🎬

Brahmastra has been eyed by the fans across India. The over three-minute trailer clip released on YouTube was packed with impressive VFX shots. They were also an indication of the film's grand scale. Brahmastra has been in the making since 2018, and got delayed several times during the pandemic. ✔️👌🏻👌🏻
