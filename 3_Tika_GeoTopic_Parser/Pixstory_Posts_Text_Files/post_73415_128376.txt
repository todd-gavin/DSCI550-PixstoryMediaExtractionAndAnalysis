Have you ever felt that when men venture into cooking they are being widely applauded but when a woman does the same it s considered as a very normal thing isn t it In most of the societies cooking is still being regarded as a gender role and all women are expected to be good at it Attention is given only when a woman underperforms such tasks Well in case of men they re literally being praised when they just make a very slight move to get the gist of cooking I believe that skills like cooking doing your own laundry shopping groceries etc are life skills which are to be developed by each and every indivual rather than waiting for someone else to do it Society should stop considering all such chores as gender roles What s your take on this Do comment Thanks for reading Wishing you all good health happiness and prosperity
