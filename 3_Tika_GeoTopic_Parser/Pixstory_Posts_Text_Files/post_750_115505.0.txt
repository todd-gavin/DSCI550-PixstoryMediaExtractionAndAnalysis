Well at times, age is just a number. And it holds no real bar.  Literally. 

An 82-year-old former MLA and CPM veteran from Kerala has clinched two bronze medals for India in the World Masters Athletics Championship (WMAC) 2022, which concluded in Finland on Sunday (July 10).

 MJ Jacob won medals in the 200-metre and 80-metre hurdles competitions in the men's M80 category (aged between 80-84). 

The athlete from Piravom now plans to work more on his fitness, improve his performance and win a gold at the Masters in 2023. According to the local media, Jacob had bagged three gold medals for 80m hurdles, 200m hurdles, and a long-jump in the Kerala state masters athletic meet last year. In addition, he had won medals in Asia Masters Athletics as well.
