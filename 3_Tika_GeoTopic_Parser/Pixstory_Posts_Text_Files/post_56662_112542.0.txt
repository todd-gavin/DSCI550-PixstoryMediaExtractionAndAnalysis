Lindsay Lohan is married!

The former child star has wed her fiance Bader Shammas in an intimate ceremony — just hours before celebrating her 36th birthday, Page Six can confirm.

A rep told the New York Post: “I can confirm Lindsay Lohan is married.”

Lohan sparked rumours that she had tied the knot on Friday night after posting a photo of her and Shammas, 35, on Instagram, writing: “I am the luckiest woman in the world. He found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time. I am stunned that this is my husband. My life and my everything. Every woman should feel like this everyday.”..

Friends rushed to congratulate the star, who celebrated her birthday on Saturday, including Paris Hilton and Melissa Gorga.

Lohan met the Kuwait-born financier while living in Dubai. He popped the question back in November — proposing with a massive Harry Winston sparkler.

The Parent Trap star shared the news with her 9.7 million followers and posted a trio of loved-up snaps.

The smitten actress paid tribute to Bader, and wrote alongside her photos: “My love. My life. My family. My future. bader.shammas #love.”

Her dad, Michael Lohan, told the New York Post of Shammas: “He’s not a Hollywood type, you don’t see any pictures of them in the press. That was one of Lindsay’s problems — the paps encroaching on her and coming up with stories. It was tough. But she’s with a guy who doesn’t like the limelight.

“She’s relaunching her career and you want a good person in your life when you hit that restart button,” he added.

“Everyone’s happy. Lindsay got her life back when she met him, she’s been living a really happy and healthy life.”

Although he had liked some of his daughter’s past loves, like That ‘70s Show star Wilmer Valderrama, Michael said he was pleased she’s away from the “Aaron Carters of the world”, a reference to her singer boyfriend from nearly 20 years ago.
