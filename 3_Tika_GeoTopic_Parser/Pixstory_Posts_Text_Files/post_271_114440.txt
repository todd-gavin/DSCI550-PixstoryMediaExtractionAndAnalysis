Once again mainstream media is using the facade of bias to justify transphobia on July rd the New York Times featured an opinion piece titled The Far Right and Far Left Agree on One Thing Women Don t Count by their columnist Pamela Paul The piece misconstructs the ideology that overturned Roe v Wade to apply it to transgender people who are simply attempting to be who they are so that they can exist Today a number of academics uber progressives transgender activists civil liberties organizations and medical organizations are working toward an opposite end to deny women their humanity reducing them to a mix of body parts and gender stereotypes Paul writes This is classic mainstreamed hypocrisy in a piece that gatekeeps womanhood on the basis of body parts to justify transmisogyny In a world of chosen gender identities women as a biological category don t exist Some might even call this kind of thing erasure Paul continues As part of the relatively tiny number of transgender men and people identifying as nonbinary I must say that the imposed patriarchal femininities by some cisterhoods is an unchosen erasure that too many of us don t survive The piece is so threatened by our power to live and our power to carve out a home within ourselves despite the structures built to erase is that it can t get over the fact that few spaces are attempting to let trans people Maybe we won t be such a tiny number if we weren t repeatedly force fed with the cisnormative baby formula of internalized transphobia garnished with the guilt of automatically being misogynistic for not being a woman
