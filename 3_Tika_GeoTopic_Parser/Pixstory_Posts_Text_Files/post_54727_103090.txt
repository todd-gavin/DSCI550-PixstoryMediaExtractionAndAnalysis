Imagine inhaling just a few drops of liquid or mist to get protected from COVID That is the idea behind nasal COVID vaccines and they have been getting a lot of attention recently as a spray or liquid These nasal vaccines would be based on the same technology as normal vaccines given by injection But as Mayuresh Abhyankar a University of Virginia researcher who studies infectious diseases and works on nasal vaccines explains vaccinating someone right where the coronavirus is likely to start its attack comes with many immunological benefits What are nasal vaccines Nasal vaccines are administered as the name suggests through the nose More accurately called intranasal vaccines these vaccines are liquids that can be given as a spray or through a dropper or syringe The most common nasal vaccine is FluMist a nasal spray that uses inactivated flu virus to protect against influenza An intranasal vaccine could be a weakened live virus similar to FluMist a nucleic acid vaccine like mRNA coronavirus vaccines or a protein vaccine like Hepatitis B vaccines or the CorbeVax coronavirus vaccine Intranasal vaccines are best suited to protect against pathogens that enter through the nose like the flu or the coronavirus By mimicking the first step of natural exposure to an airborne pathogen these vaccines help train a person s immune system at the potential place of infection Scientists have shown that the first immune response in the respiratory tract after a person is exposed to an airborne virus can influence how sick a person gets So in theory intranasal vaccines could provide better protection than vaccines given through a shot in the arm How does the coronavirus infect people A cross section of a human highlighting the respiratory system of the nose throat and lungs Nasal vaccines differ from intramuscular vaccines because they mimic the mechanism of infection and trigger a stronger immune response in the throat and nose specifically Read more
