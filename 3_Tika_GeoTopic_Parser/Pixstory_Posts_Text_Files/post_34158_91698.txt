Empoli coach Aurelio Andreazzoli&#39;s analysis to DAZN after the defeat against Fiorentina demonstrate sensitivity The referee forgot this component today the team was penalized and then you don&#39;t allow five seconds to take a late lineout I don&#39;t judge the other episodes which were different you need to have sensitivity which was not there The performances are there but what I have to ask differently to raise the performance and to smooth out the defects but there are also many advantages such as the fact of never giving up We have very little chance of achieving a result if we don&#39;t play to the max if we perform well the result will come I&#39;m not annoyed so much for me but for the players we work for performance They give it to me and I can&#39;t ask for more They struggle on the pitch and during the week they are always available for anything We have to move towards performance
