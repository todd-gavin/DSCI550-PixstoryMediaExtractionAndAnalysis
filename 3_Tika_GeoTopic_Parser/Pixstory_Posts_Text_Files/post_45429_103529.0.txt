According to the Football.London, Liverpool were considering bidding for Son-Hueng Min had
Tottenham failed to qualify for the Champions League this season. Jurgen Klopp in search of a
replacement for Sadio Mane, who is set to leave the club in the next season with Bayern Munich
his destination.

Tottenham’s resolve would have surely been tested, with Liverpool deciding to make a big offer
for the South Korean forward this season.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is a big admirer of
the South Korean international and would have been delighted to bring to Anfield in the summer.

However, given that Son had recently signed a contract extension with Tottenham, up until 2025
- it would have been unlikely that he would have moved.

Last season, Son scored both at home and away against Liverpool. Having forged a close bond
with Italian manager Antonio Conte, Son and Conte will look to keep Tottenham in the
Champions League next season and perhaps start to bother Manchester City and Liverpool a
little more.

Liverpool will look to replace their wingers quickly, with Mane set to depart this season and only
one year left on Mo Salah’s contract at Liverpool. Liverpool will need to undergo a
reconstruction of their aging attack in order to keep up with titans Manchester City.

Tottenham are set to undergo preseason at South Korea in July, playing Team K League - South
Korea’s all star team and then Sevilla.
