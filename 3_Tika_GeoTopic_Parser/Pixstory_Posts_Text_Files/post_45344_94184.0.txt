Manchester United's starting lineup against Norwich City saw multiple new faces come into 
the lineup. The likes of Diogo Dalot, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Elanga started the game. Yet, it was none other than Cristiano Ronaldo who made the difference as United 
tiptoed into 5th position â€” hoping Arsenal at St. Mary's.

United's previous defeat against Everton brought both Ronaldo and the club in the news for all the wrong reasons. Ragnick's team had to repair that, and Ronaldo had to give it his best if that was possible. 

The Portuguese struck twice in the first half, slotting Anthony Elanga's pass into an empty net and heading Alex Telles' corner masterfully.

The away side got a goal back before half time, and scored another in the 53rd minute.

Teems Pukki's contributions in both goals were invaluable for the Canaries, who are rooted 
at the bottom of the table almost awaiting impending relegation. Ronaldo turned the tide 
once again with a 76th minute free kick that glided into Tim Krul's far post. These are three 
crucial points for United as they come simultaneously with both Spurs and Arsenal losing their games. They have none other than CR7 to thank for.

Their master marksman got them past a gritty Norwich team, breaking one or two personal 
records along the way. Not that he'll care to realise anyway. His first goal put him on 13 
league goals, and 19 goals overall. The brace, only equalled his record for having scored 20 
times in each of his last 16 campaigns.

The third was the best of the lot and got him to the 15 goal mark, one he's reached season after season since his second campaign at United. He sets the benchmark for generations to come, and he breaks some of his own records along the way as well. Cristiano Ronaldo ladies and gentlemen.
