Cricket Australia officials are "astonished" and "very upset" by the Seven Network's decision to take the governing body to Federal Court in order to end its media rights arrangement. 

The Sporting News reported that although tensions between Seven and CA have been building since 2020, when the network indicated its dissatisfaction with the lack of Australian international talent for the BBL, there are still two years left in their five-year broadcast agreement. 

Seven released a statement to The Daily Telegraph claiming that CA had failed to meet expectations for quality and standards over the previous two Covid-affected summers. Seven is requesting damages as well as the termination of the rights contract. CA responded with its own statement, calling Seven's claims "unwarranted" and insisting that they had delivered two quality summers.

Seven and Fox Sports have been joint rights holders in Australia since 2018, when CA struck a record $1.2 billion deal with the two broadcasters, with Seven paying $450 million for the free-to-air rights for home Tests, the BBL and the WBBL, ending Nine’s historical stranglehold on the FTA broadcasting of cricket in Australia and Ten’s more recent association with the BBL.

But the relationship between Seven West’s CEO James Warburton and CA executives has been an uneasy one and it now threatens to escalate in the Federal Court.
