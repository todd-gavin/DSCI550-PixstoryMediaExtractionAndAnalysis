 In America civilians own about million firearms and over of the households in the country have at least one gun The U S has the highest estimated number of guns per capita in the world at guns for every people Laws includes the right to bear arms found in the Second Amendment to the U S Constitution None of this history could justify the savagery the law encourages Incidents like the Newtown Shooting Washington Navy Yard shooting are shreds of evidence that firearms could create havoc and is a threat to public safety In any country it is the responsibility of the government to safeguard its citizens from violence If citizens have to safeguard themselves then what is the use of a government It is sheer negligence to leave serious shooting weapons into the hands of civilians Even keeping strict restrictions on weapons would enhance public security and reduce crime rates and mass shooting incidents Even the polls have favoured Gun control According to Huffington Post in of Americans said gun laws should be made more rigid while said they should be made less strict and said there should be no change The opinion on restricting gun laws have only been increased after every shooting incident in the country Gun control is very necessary for America taking into account all the events until today Is it a sad truth that a developed country like America would let the citizens flaunt weapons and cause public distress History might be one but change is inevitable Clinging on to history and sentiments would only pull you backwards
