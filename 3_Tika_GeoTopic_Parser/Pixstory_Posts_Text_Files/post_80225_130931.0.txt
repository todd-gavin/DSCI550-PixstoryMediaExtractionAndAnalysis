Heart medication is a necessity, but storing it properly is very important. It would be best if you held them in a cool, dry, dark place away from children and pets. Keeping your medication in a locked cabinet or drawer is also a good idea. 

You can use a safety pin to close the drawer if you don't have a lock. If you are going to be away from your heart medication for an extended period, it is a good idea to put it in a refrigerator.
