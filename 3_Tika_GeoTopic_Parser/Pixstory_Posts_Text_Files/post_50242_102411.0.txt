This was also experienced during my tenure when acting on a secret information of his presence in a Flat in Delhi, a raid was carried out on accurate information, but Vasudeo was not found. Later it was revealed that he had hid himself in the water storage tank of the Flat. As the plan began for the cutting of illegally planted Sugarcane by the labourers under the shadow of the police, the message was quite clear.

 The police meant business and the long time economy of the dacoits was now in the fear of extinction. At the start of the unique operation called ‘Ganna Katai’ in the local parlance, many challenges were faced. Local labourers were not ready to participate in the operation because they feared for their lives in even touching the sugarcane planted by the dacoits. The fields of the dacoits had the best crop and were distinct from the weaker fields surrounding them. 

The dacoits extracted free labour from the villagers to cut the cane and to send it to the mill for payment on fake names. But the same labourers who used to work free for the dacoits were not willing to support the police despite their poverty and despite being promised the minimum wages as per government rules. It must be remarked that the fixed minimum wage of the government was much higher than what they earned actually while working on a daily basis for private farmers. 

To start with, the labourers were transported from a different area of the district who were away from the local dacoit’s influence, and were made to stay in a secured camp. They cut the cane during daytime, watched Ramayana on VCD Player specially made available so that they did not lose their interest, during the night and feasted on the provisions provided by the police.  Gradually the local labourers also joined seeing the advantages of the exercise and challenged by the difference it made to their poverty.
