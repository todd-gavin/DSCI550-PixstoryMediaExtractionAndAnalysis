I am a big D fan myself but I think you re not giving BTS enough credit Especially considering they didn t start with songs that could be globally understood yet they managed to have such crazy global following The streamers that you said Of all the kpop groups I have seen BTS has the most diverse and excellent discography which accounts for their record breaking album sales They are truly experimental musicians which is much more than can be stated for the majority of other groups and their music and concepts encompass so many diverse genres Hip hop and rap listeners will enjoy their songs Their lyrics especially In my opinion their lyrics are far better than D They put some real efforts in their lyrics Not to day One Direction didn t but I think BTS just takes the cake here Other than that the rap choreography and stage presence too
