Thierry Henry is largely regarded as one of the finest players to have ever graced the Premier 
League, not only Arsenal. With 228 goals in 377 appearances for Arsenal, the Frenchman is the 
club's all-time leading striker. One hundred and seventy-five of the 228 goals were scored in the 
Premier League.

Arsenal purchased Henry from Juventus for around £11 million on August 3, 1999. Four days later, the forward made his Premier League debut as a substitute in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Leicester City.

When Henry made his debut, who were his teammates and where are they now?
