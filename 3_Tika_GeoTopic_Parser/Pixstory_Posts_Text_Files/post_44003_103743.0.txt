Few would have anticipated that at the age of 30, Jack Wilshere, who burst into the scene 14
years ago in such spectacular way, he would be seriously considering putting up his boots. But
that is the scenario that the former Arsenal midfielder is currently pondering after his loan term
with Danish side AGF Aarhus came to an end.

Wilshere has returned to England and spent last week in familiar surroundings at the Emirates
Stadium, where he took part in an event organised by Arsenal and STATSports in which young
players from across the world were given the opportunity to impress at a training session.

The teenagers had been invited to north London after displaying remarkable performance data
on the Arsenal edition of STATSports' industry-leading performance tracking technology, with
the club's youth staff and Wilshere eager to assess their potential.

“Because of that injury at 19 and maybe overplaying due to not having access to those
numbers, I’m probably a player that would have benefitted from them (the access to stats)
massively,” Wilshere said.

“I think what the kids have today, I would have loved it, put it that way.”

As he stood there watching the practise unfold, it was evident that Wilshere is still at his happiest on the football field. But, having reached a big career crossroads, the 30-year-old
admits he now has a lot to think about.

Wilshere has yet to decide if he will play again; the offers he receives in the coming months will
determine his decision. Even though AGF failed to win for 14 games when he was with them, he
still feels compelled to continue, as his time in Denmark taught him.

But the allure of coaching grows greater by the day, and if an opportunity to focus on that side of
the game arrives in the coming months, the former England international concedes he will have
to make a huge decision.
