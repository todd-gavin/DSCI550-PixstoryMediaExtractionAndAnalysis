Australian intelligence agencies are keeping a close eye on any potential Chinese meddling in the federal election. 

The West Australian reported that Karen Andrew, Australia's Home Affairs Minister, said last week that the timing of Beijing's security agreement with the Solomon Islands was noteworthy, and that Beijing was "obviously aware" that Australia was in the midst of a federal election. 

We talk about political interference and that has many forms so I think we need to be very much aware of what Beijing is doing," she said.

Jim Chalmers, a Labor campaign spokesperson, said the minister's statements were "remarkably desperate and remarkably deranged." 

On Sunday, Finance Minister Simon Birmingham informed Sky News that the remarks were true.
“We have known that foreign interference is a real risk in the Australian electorate landscape and in Australian politics generally," he said.

"It's why we as a government put in place foreign interference laws as part of a range of different protections we have applied to Australia in response to the more aggressive and assertive stance of China and indeed other risks over recent years.”

He said about interference that, "That will be a matter for our intelligence analysts and others who would be no doubt monitoring these matters very closely."
