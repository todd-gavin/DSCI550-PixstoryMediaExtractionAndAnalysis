An attack by the stray dogs resulted in a dog bite and a fractured wrist, and the trauma of the pain was unbearable for me. My daughter, without formal training, gave me positive energy to ease my pain, and I felt good enough to endure the treatment. This incident may not have scientific backing, but it is healing. One cannot ignore the existence of spiritual experiences. Prayers, faith, concern, and trust can move mountains, and it is possible to heal oneself and help others through myriad forms to improve the fabric of life.

Since pain is a complex phenomenon relating the physical to the psychological, physicians in some places have started including spiritual histories in patients' charts and some medical schools have added spirituality in the students' curriculum and studies are being conducted to establish the link. Across the world, traditional healing practices cured people in ancient times. With the advancement of science and medical research, their numbers may have gone down but relevance stays and now there is an effort to connect the two. If we can combine the two, it will be an integrated holistic approach for our overall well-being.

To manage my pain in the broken bone due to my allergy to painkillers, I typed traditional healers near me on Google, and viola there was a long list showing the popularity of these alternate methods. Thanks to the Internet revolution spirituality is no longer in the realms of yogis or you do not have to go into the deep forests of the Amazon to gain knowledge. We have realised its importance in our well-being and syncing mind, body, and spirit. There is a lower risk of anxiety, depression, and a sense of high self-esteem in deeply spiritual people. Mindful meditation did reduce my pain and helped me cope with the injury and deal with the discomfort thereby reducing my stress levels.
