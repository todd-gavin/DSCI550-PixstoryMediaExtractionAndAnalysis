Along with the accomplishments on the field, football has empowered Barbora with confidence in different dimensions of life, further replenishing her energy to bring her best to every training and every game.

"I'm living my dream and doing my best and I'm trying to be the best in what I do. I'm pretty content with myself doing that, and it makes me happy. It gives me confidence on and off the pitch. I'm doing what I love every day," she says.

Barbora has a clear goal: to build and be part of a really strong team – one of the best in Europe. The goalkeeper hopes that her team continues achieving the biggest successes they can, including winning the Champions League and the Coupe de France.

Consistent with the clarity of setting these benchmarks, Barbora uses visualization to derive strength before a big game: “I'm just trying to visualize what could happen and I'm visualizing me being strong in the game and performing my best and just trying to be focused for the game,” she says.

Barbora’s favorite ways to celebrate wins include going out with her teammates so that they can release, share, and exchange the overflowing emotions that build up by a big game.

"We basically are sitting together and talking about what happened in the game and sharing the emotions, and the best experience from the game,” she says. “Then sometimes, I can dance on the table to put my energy out."
