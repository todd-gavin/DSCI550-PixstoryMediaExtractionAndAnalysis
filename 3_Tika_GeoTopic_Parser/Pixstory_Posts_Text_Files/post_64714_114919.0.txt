The film takes place on Earth after the nuclear holocaust that we all know turned it into a barren desert wasteland. Our protagonist is Madison Maxwell, or Mad Max for short. Max likes to sit around, eat organic food, and monologue to himself, but these skinheads put a stop to that. They bring him back to their boss, a fat guy named Joe. Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's trusted lackeys, goes truckin' off to the gas station. But soon Joe realises she took all his s*x puppets and sends his army of war puppets to chase her down. One such soldier is Nux, who brings along Max as his lucky hood ornament. Furiosa drives into a sandstorm to escape Joe's army, and Nux is the only one psychotic enough to follow suit. But being psychotic also has its downsides, specifically an upside-downside. When Max comes to, he conveniently finds Furiosa and the wives making repairs on their truck like fifty feet away. Which I guess means she was only able to drive for one second after losing her tail. Tough break. Max tries to steal the truck, but Furiosa baby-proofed it, so Max reluctantly agrees to let her steal her own truck with him. Joe and his goons
catch up, and just like the proverbial "another one," the pregnant wife bites the dust. Furiosa tells Max they are going to the Green Place, her alma mater. Nux stows away on the truck, but only to find somewhere to cry about his daddy issues. The redhead wife makes googly eyes at him because let's face it, there aren't a ton of fish in the sea when the sea's all dried up. Later that night, the truck becomes a real stick in the mud, but then they push it, push it real good. They keep driving until they reach a tribe of biker grannies, who reveal that the swamp they passed is all that's left of the Green Place. This bad news is more than Furiosa can handle. You know, like hand. Cuz she ain't got none!
