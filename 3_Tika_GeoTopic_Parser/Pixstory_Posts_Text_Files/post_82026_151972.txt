 The feeling is different when you enter your college after two long covid years I was very anxious and nervous too for the first day of my college but then i met these crazies and went super comfortable with them Can t figure out where did all the nervousness went Ekanki Harshita Kalash Priyanshi and Sharique are like a family to me Can t believe it s just been two weeks since i met them Yesterday we went on a movie date too Somehow it became an unplanned red and green theme Enjoyed a lot there We are a small happy college family now Let s see where does this new chapter of my life takes me Cheers to more good and exciting college days ahead
