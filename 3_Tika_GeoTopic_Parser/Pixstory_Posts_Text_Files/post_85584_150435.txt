I went to parlour for the first time in order to cut my long hair But the girl who was working there almost denied it But my mother who stood strong to cut my hair she thought that I was not gaining weight since my hair eats all the food I eat p asked her to proceed With pity face she had cut it After months it reached my thighs again I was super happy My moms test failed Again the compliments started everywhere I go I used to hear lots of back talking in super markets hospitals bus etc I always asked for hair tips and I love to tell when they ask me with a such curious face It makes me to feel that how I am blessed
