On the eve of the school year in Afghanistan and preparations for the reopening of schools, the World Food Program (WFP) has a plan to feed children in schools.

The World Food Program wants to distribute food to students, and the European Union has allocated â‚¬ 11 million to fund the project.

"School nutrition contributes to children's health, learning and better functioning," says the World Food Program website. "It also motivates families to send their children to school."

"The EU is committed to supporting families who send their children to school," said Andreas von Brandt, the EU Special Representative for Afghanistan.

The World Food Program has already implemented the project successfully in schools in the tropical provinces of Nangarhar and Kandahar. The organization has distributed biscuits and cooking oil to 350,000 students and their families in 783 schools.

After Nowruz, this program is to be extended to more than a thousand other schools.
