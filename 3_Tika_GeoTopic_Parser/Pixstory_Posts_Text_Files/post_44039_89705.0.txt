After an injury-plagued club season, the winger provided a timely reminder of his abilities by scoring a crucial goal for his team.

Gareth Bale of Wales and Real Madrid put his country ahead with a superb free-kick on Thursday as the Dragons attempted to advance to the final stage of World Cup qualification at the cost of Austria.

Bale has had an injury-plagued season in Spain, making only five appearances overall and just two since the beginning of September.

But his quality is still there, as he showed by giving Wales a crucial 1-0 lead in the first half of Wednesday's match.

Bale hasn't played a single minute of football since August, leading many to believe he's been on the golf course.
 They'd be mistaken. He's been working on his free-kicks, knowing that an opportunity like the one with 25 minutes on the clock will come up. He was all set to give birth. I am more than prepared. The ball was sent rocketing straight into the top corner with one stroke of his left boot, shaving the bar on the way through for added drama. It was a moment that those who were present in the stadium would do well to forget. The speed, the force, the trajectory - and the joy.

It was a goal that you could see over and over again and never grow tired of. Bale's joyous outburst, no doubt tinged with disappointment over how things ended in Madrid, demonstrates that his legs still have plenty of life in them.

There was yet a lot more to come. The crucial second goal was a half-chance, but Bale's shot into the top corner made it appear like a gilt-edged opportunity. A finish based entirely on instinct.

In the build-up to this game, he declined to discuss where he'll be playing football next season because the situation is still unknown. After this performance, there will undoubtedly be numerous offers from some of Europe's most prestigious teams.
