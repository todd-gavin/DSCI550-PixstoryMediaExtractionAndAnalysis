The Universal laws of gem therapy remain the same and a thorough mastery of these give essential skill sets to the individuals to be a better student of Astro Gemology and to the common individuals desirous of exploring Gemstone Therapy as a part of their life optimization, the correct rules and laws for a rewarding Gem therapy.

The subject of Gem Therapy and Gemstones is very vast and every passing day a new secret is revealed to the dedicated seeker.

I know for sure that there never will be a text on this subject that will be 100% complete. I have tried to be comprehensive and I hope this book serves as a primer that shall create miracles in lives of people who need it the most.

As far as possible I have also tried to include latest market trends and information available on various gemstones so that the reader can be aware of many permutations and combinations for an effective and rewarding gemstone therapy.

I have also excluded misguiding information like “if one puts a pure red coral

in a bowl of milk 100 times it’s weight the milk starts radiating red color” and similar such information. For some it is pure rubbish and for others it is a part of an ancient romantic gem lore that adds to the mystique of gemstones and healing. I have excluded that information that does not carry universal sanction in the sacred texts, or is impractical or is of no consequence whatsoever.

The use of the 9 sacred gemstones also referred to as the Navaratna is very popular in Asia where they have been accorded a divine and a sacred status. In countries like India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, these gemstones have been used extensively to harness the powers of the planets and for attaining good luck, regardless of religious and cultural differences.
