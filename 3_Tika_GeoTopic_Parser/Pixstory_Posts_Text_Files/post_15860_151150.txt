Abstract Aims We conducted a meta analysis to investigate whether diabetes induced by a high fat diet HFD has the potential to alter the process of autophagy in the murine liver Methods A systematic literature search was performed with electronic databases PubMed EMBASE Web of Science Study design population intervention outcome and risk of bias were analyzed Given the availability of studies a quantitative meta analysis including studies was performed Key findings The search found articles with matching the eligibility criteria comprising of animals The meta analysis showed that diabetic murines fed with HFD presented an absence of p degradation SMD CI to p I higher expression of p mTOR mTOR SMD CI to p I and a decreased p AMPK AMPK ratio SMD CI to p I when compared to nondiabetic murines When associated with streptozotocin the animals presented decreased ATG and LC II The meta regression results showed a decrease in autophagy responses due to increased glycemic levels fat content and long term exposure to HFD and advanced animal age The common and species specific protein responses were also consistent with the inhibition of autophagy Significance The normal process of autophagy mechanisms in the liver is less competent after HFD consumption The destabilization of auto phagolysosomes contributes to the perpetuation of diabetes metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease and cell death Sources nbsp
