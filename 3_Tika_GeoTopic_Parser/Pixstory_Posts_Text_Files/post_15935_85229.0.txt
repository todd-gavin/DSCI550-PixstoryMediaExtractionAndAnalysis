Abstract 

Background 

Current guidelines state that screening for diabetes should be done at 30 years of age in India. 

Methods 

Investigators from multiple sites in India were involved in providing data regarding patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) aged 30 years or less. Other relevant studies were also reviewed. 

Results 

Overview of published and unpublished data show increasing prevalence of T2D in individuals 30 years and less. About 3/4th of them had overweight/obesity. 

Conclusion 

Screening for diabetes in India should start at 25 years in non-pregnant adults instead of 30 years as currently stipulated.
