The Russian soccer association filed a fast-track judicial appeal on Tuesday to get FIFA and UEFA bans on its teams frozen and eventually overturned. 

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the country's national and club teams were barred from international events on February 28 "until further notice." FIFA and UEFA did not provide any legal justifications. 

U.S News reported that the Court of Arbitration for Sport stated that it aimed to issue urgent interim rulings on the appeals in the coming days. 

On March 24, Russia's men's national team was set to meet Poland in a World Cup qualifying playoff. Poland has declined to play Russia in the match that was scheduled to take place in Moscow.

The winner of that match would have faced the winner of Sweden's encounter against the Czech Republic on March 29, with a spot in the World Cup in Qatar on the line. Both of these federations have also declined to play against Russia. 

According to the CAS, the Russian petitions against FIFA and UEFA include the Polish, Swedish, and Czech soccer federations, as well as several other European national federations. 

On UEFA's side of the lawsuit, the soccer federation of Belarus, Russia's political and military ally, is included as a party. 

The Russian legal approach of submitting separate appeals against soccer's world and European governing bodies may force the cases to be reviewed by two separate panels of three CAS judges, despite the fact that the cases are basically identical.
