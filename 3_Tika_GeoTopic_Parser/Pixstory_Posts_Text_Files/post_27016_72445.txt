 Naveen Kumar is a former college lecturer and founder of Atchayam Trust an initiative aimed at making India beggar free Looking after the people whom we have rehabilitated at our shelter home in Erode is not easy There are occasions when some of them escape the eyes of our volunteers and go back to the streets Many regret doing such things later when we find them again and want us to take them back Once I met a man on the street whom our team members and I rehabilitated with great efforts Then suddenly one day he disappeared from our home A year later I saw him again wandering the streets in tattered clothes He had also got infected with some disease There were large festering wounds on his arms and legs which made it difficult for him to even walk properly The moment he saw me he started literally pleading with me to take him back He didn t want to die on the streets with no one to look after him He was like within a few months I am going to die and I don t want to die on the road like a dog The satisfaction you get when you help people in distress is immense It s greater than any award or monetary reward The first time I got that feeling was when I helped a year old man named Rajasekhar When I found him he was begging in Salem Tamil Nadu I decided to follow him and strike up a conversation with him Initially he showed no interest in me Finally after days of effort I managed to talk to him He told me his wife had died in an accident and his kids had abandoned him He had also lost all his identity cards so he was unable to find any work Through my networks I managed to get him a job as a watchman at a children s home That was my starting point In conversation with Sangeeth Sebastian founder Vvox a sextech platform The series is a part of an AKADialog initiative to capture the lives of newsmakers
