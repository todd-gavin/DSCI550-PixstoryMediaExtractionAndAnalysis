According to recent Rutgers study a hormone that affects puberty and fertility in humans might be used to treat non alcoholic fatty liver disease The study published in JCI shows that a modified form of the naturally occurring hormone kisspeptin can cure non alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD NAFLD is the most prevalent chronic liver condition in children and adults worldwide connected to obesity and Type diabetes NAFLD is a silent illness since it has little or no symptoms at first It starts with a buildup of fat in the liver causing fatty liver Inflammation of the liver causes non alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH Then comes fibrosis and cirrhosis when the liver is permanently scarred Some NASH patients with cirrhosis develop liver cancer Currently no authorised therapies exist for NASH Moshmi Bhattacharya assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has been investigating kisspeptin for over years The KISS gene encodes Kisspeptin called after the famous Hershey chocolate kisses Kisspeptin has been connected to hunger sexual desire and pubertal development The researchers gave obese mice a high fat high sugar Western diet The study found that giving these animals kisspeptin prevented fatty liver NASH and fibrosis Kisspeptin binds to its receptor KISS R The study also found that mice fed a Western diet acquire fatty livers when KISS R is removed from liver cells These studies show a strong link between kisspeptin and reduced liver fat and fibrosis In the study Kisspeptin helps decrease liver fat and reverse illness We now know how kisspeptin works in the liver The levels of kisspeptin in the blood of NAFLD patients and a mouse model Dr Vinod K Rustgi director of hepatology and Distinguished Professor of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School co authored the study It accomplishes so by preventing liver fat accumulation and decreasing inflammation and fibrosis As a result it may improve the health and lives of millions of patients worldwide
