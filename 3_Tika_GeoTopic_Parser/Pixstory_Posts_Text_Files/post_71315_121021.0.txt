DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC? MAYBE! MAYBE NOT! BUT I DO AND HERE's A SMALL ACCOUNT, WHY? 

I was always fond of capturing the beauty of nature in a frame, wanting to keep all the scenic sights with me, forever. This one time, I went out to get the clicks of my verandah after rain, I fell in love with how fresh and lively everything around looked. From the smell of soil to half drenched dogs playing in water, it almost seemed like, suddenly, all the living creatures got back their purpose of life. It instilled a pause in this world of rush and crowd, which even made me wonder, "Escape, and find who you truly are". Maybe, still the girl who loves to make paper boats and release them in water, curious about  how far it might travel and embracing the happiness it feels within. The girl who didn't judge herself through other's lenses of perfection and letting things go the way she wanted. This  all reminded me  why exactly I did start clicking pictues. Perhaps, there I had my answer. And before  I knew, I became obsessed with this weather, the wind, the clouds, the sky and,as usual, began my insane attempts of trying to photograph everything I could. Because amidst all this, it felt like these few droplets of water were much more than another phase of season change.  Definitely, there's something magical about rains, afterall when everything became standstill for moments, I found the serenity, I had been chasing since so long.
