Down the Memory Lane continues After my transfer out of Khammam District I was posted as Officer on Special Duty to Police Transport Organisation PTO an organisation wherein no IPS officer was posted before For accommodating me the rank of Head of Police Transport was downgraded from IG to SP Initially I was not very happy with the posting to a unit which in a way performed only a support function to the police department I protested to DG and asked for a posting in the mainline policing which was not acceded to The function of the PTO was to maintain the motor fleet of police departments acorss the state as well as to procure new vehicles In the beginning having no technical knowledge of the maintenance of motor vehicles I was at sea and could not find my moorings I found the staff highly indisciplined and I could sense the corruption in the organization During my inspection I also found that a number of private vehicles in the workshop were also being repaired in the workshop Upon enquiry with the staff I was very reluctantly informed that these belonged to senior officers of the state I intimated them to take away their vehicles or else I will be forced to get to these crane lifted and put them in the Municipality Junkyard Some of them had never expected this reaction from a junior officer and one or two tried to browbeat me But I was determined and got one most of the vehicles were removed The owners took others away My action sent a message to my subordinates that I meant business To be continued
