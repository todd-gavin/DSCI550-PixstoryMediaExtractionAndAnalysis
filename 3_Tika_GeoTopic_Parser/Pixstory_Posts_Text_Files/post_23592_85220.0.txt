Every ticket for BTS's four day concert "BTS PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE- LAS VEGAS" which will be held in Las Vegas at Allegiant Stadium has been sold out. Recently Ticketmaster tweeted: 
"All shows are now sold out. There will not be a General Verified Fan Presale or General Public Onsale."

For the general public this means that all the tickets for these four planned concerts in Las Vegas have been bought by the fans who belong to Global Official Fanclun Army. The general public won't be able to buy the tickets from the traditional outlets like Ticketmaster anymore so they will have to buy tickets from second party sellers. 

The fact that the tickets have already been sold out shows how excited the fans are to finally meet BTS in person. It has been such a long time since they held a concert anywhere. Even though BTS did hold a four-day concert in Sofi Stadium in LA, the excitement and energy this time is entirely different. 

Have YOU bought the tickets yet?
