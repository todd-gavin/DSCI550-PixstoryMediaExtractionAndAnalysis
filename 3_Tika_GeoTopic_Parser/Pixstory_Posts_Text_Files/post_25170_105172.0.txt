Given made history as the first-ever BL anime to air on NoitaminA, Fuji TV's anime programming block.
An anime about a guy named Mafuyu who wants to learn a guitar he got from his friend.
He bugs Uenoyama, an exceptional guitar player in a band. And they end up having fold feelings for each other, Mafuyu already identified himself as gay but watching Uenoyama having gay panic was the funniest thing ever.
And irrespective of the genre of the anime, its handling of grief makes it one of the best anime stories detailing the subject regardless of genre
