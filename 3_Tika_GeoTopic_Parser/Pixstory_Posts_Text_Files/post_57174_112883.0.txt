Language is a medium we communicate; the number of words one knows gives one the liberty to express their ideas more freely.
What would it be like if this liberty and choice to express according to your needs is hindered by limiting the words and making language a trap?

That's what George Orwell portrayed in his novel 1984; the dystopian world he created was tormented by the rules and laws of Big Brother ( the authoritarian character in the novel). So he chose every way to confine and limit the resources that would give even a little freedom to the people of his country.

And the main focus was to make boundaries for everyone and keep them inside cages where they could not use their ability to think.
Newspeak ( the official means of communication in Orwell's 1984) aims to reduce the number of words in circulation, and it wanted to limit the ability and power of self-expression. Even the dictionaries were made thinner.

So every possible way in which one can use their intellectual ability to think was annihilated.
The words that would oppose or conflict with his( BigBrother) ideas and ways were supposed to be put to an end.

Orwell's dystopian world very well explained how limiting the tool used to express and comprehend can impose the atrocities of authorisation rule on someone.
The will to express and communicate ends if we are robbed of words and the liberty to speak freely.
The idea of limiting the language validates the quote and paradox on which the novel is set "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."
