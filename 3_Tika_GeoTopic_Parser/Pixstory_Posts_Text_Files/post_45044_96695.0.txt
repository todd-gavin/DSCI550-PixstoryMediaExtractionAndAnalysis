Arsenal might make Serge Gnabry their dream signing in the summer transfer season if they
make him a major promise. After failing to reach an agreement on a new contract, the German
international looks poised to leave Bayern Munich at the conclusion of the season.

According to Sport1, Gnabry's desire to leave Bayern is motivated by more than just money.

The player wishes to play in a more centre position rather than on the wing in order to feel like
he has a significant part in the team.

Arsenal appears to have made the right decision, as they will need to sign a forward in the
summer transfer window. Gnabry started his career with Arsenal before transferring to the
Bundesliga with Werder Bremen and then Bayern Munich, and a return to north London appears
to be a distinct possibility.

Arsenal will be desperate for two new strikers in the summer transfer window, with Alexandre
Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah's days dwindling.

The contracts of both players are set to expire at
the conclusion of the season, and they have been linked with a move away from the club.

Nketiah is expected to join Crystal Palace on a free transfer this summer. If he, like Lacazette,
leaves the club, Folarin Balogun will be the club's lone striker, which means two striker signings
may be required to offset the need for more squad depth if Arsenal is to return to the Champions
League.

According to Bild, Gnabry and his representatives are wanting Â£12.5 million per year in wages in
order to sign a new contract.

However, Bayern has yet to agree to these stipulations, putting the
talks on hold.

Gnabry left Arsenal in 2016 to join Werder Bremen after failing to reach an agreement on a new
deal during Arsene Wenger's tenure as manager. With Bayern Munich, he has won the
Champions League and many German league titles since his departure from the Premier
League.
