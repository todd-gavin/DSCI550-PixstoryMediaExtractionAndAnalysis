Natasha Tretheway Housekeeping We mourn the broken things chair legs wrenched from their seats chipped plates the threadbare clothes We work the magic of glue drive the nails mend the holes We save what we can melt small pieces of soap gather fallen pecans keep neck bones for soup Beating rugs against the house we watch dust lit like stars spreading across the yard Late afternoon we draw the blinds to cool the rooms drive the bugs out My mother irons singing lost in reverie I mark the pages of a mail order catalog listen for passing cars All day we watch for the mail some news from a distant place From the poet laureate Natasha Tretheway comes Housekeeping a remarkable masterpiece of the visceral imager An author of five poetry collections Tretheway finds inspiration in her upbringing and personal hardships The result of her inner reflection and memory often evokes feelings of raw honesty and newfound clarity especially with this piece The poem through its subtle words shows a normal family and the amendments which symbolise their lifestyle Nothing is thrown away in a middle class family as they value everything All the repairing machines are their helping hands magic for them as they solve the problems The tranquillity they find amidst the simple low key life is more important than anything
