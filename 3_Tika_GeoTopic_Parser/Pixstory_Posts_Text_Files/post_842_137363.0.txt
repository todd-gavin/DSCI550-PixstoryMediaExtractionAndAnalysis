Virat Kohli scored 60 off 44 balls and anchored the Indian innings past the 180-run mark against Paksistan in Asia cup. 
Will this be enough for India to beat it's arch rival? Let's wait for a couple of hours. 
Then first things first. 
Pakistan were on point in their fielding throughout the match two consecutive misfields off the last two balls helped India go past the 180-run mark. 
Earlier, they had managed to pull things back after India came out all guns blazing. The Indians kept their run rate near 10 for much of the first 12 overs but they also lost wickets at regular intervals. Virat Kohli stayed in the middle, however, and scored his 32nd half century in just 36 balls. He, however, could not make the most of the last over, in which he faced three balls for no runs before being run out. However, India have put up a competitive total and will be looking to get a second win of the tournament against it's neighbour
