Round home victory for Udinese by Gabriele Cioffi coach of the Friulians who commented on Empoli in the press conference Today the challenge was to reconfirm themselves in terms of will In the first half we weren&#39;t there we were good at dirtying their passing lines to make their possession sterile but we were too hasty in the proposal phase In the locker room we told each other to do what we prepared and we demonstrated our value The results don&#39;t fall from the sky they are the result of work and sacrifice There are no games left at the end that mean points I&#39;m happy here I have I have traveled half the world always with so many expectations but I have no more expectations. I think day by day what I can guarantee working head down every day
