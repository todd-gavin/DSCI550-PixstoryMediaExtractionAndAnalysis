The La Liga heavyweights have endured much-publicised struggles off the field in recent times, with mismanagement leaving some big holes in it. 

Barcelona is having to rebuild on and off the field at present with financial struggles away from the pitch impacting results as a side working currently under the guidance of Xavi seeking to rekindle former glories. 

Much-publicized monetary difficulties have been doing that cause few favours, with the La Liga heavyweights having to part with seven-time Balon d’Or winner Lionel Messi in the summer of 2021 as they were unable to hand him a new contract. 

Ronald Koeman then went to pay the price for the inconsistency at home and abroad with his job as the club manager, with the Blaugrana looking to restore the foundation on which future success can be built. 

How much debt does Barcelona have?
Barcelona president Joan Laporta revealed in August 2021 shortly after Messi’s emotional departure to PSG, that the club’s debt has risen to $1.42 bn. 


Tying the Argentine icon to another lucrative contract would have put the Spanish side above a salary cap that La Liga is prepared to deem acceptable, with serious cost-cutting methods deemed to be acceptable. 

Barca's debts included almost $412 million in player salaries, more than $708 million owed to banks while the global Coronavirus cost them around $96 million. 

The club had losses of around $518 million last year, leaving them with a negative net worth of $477 million, with revenue down by 26%. 

Laporta has worked to reduce the salaries of personnel by about $211 million with Messi departing Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets have agreed to a reduction in their respective wage package. 

Still, moves can be made as Laporta continues to recognise things behind the scene as a part of the five-year plan.
