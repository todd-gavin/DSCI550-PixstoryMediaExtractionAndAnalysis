Abstract
One of the biggest challenges facing Western society is the human and economic costs associated with the rise in diabetes cases, particularly over the last two decades. The astronomical increase in diabetes has been called a tsunami. The twin drivers of obesity and an aging demographic in most Western countries have underpinned the changes seen. The underlying reasons for the massive rise in obesity cases are multifactorial, however, it is clear this demographic shift has driven the enormous recent rise in diabetes incidence. This increase in incidence requires access to providers who possess the appropriate expertise both in primary and specialist care.
