Warner Bros. has a massive year planned out for DCEU content, which is already underway to overwhelming success. Before Dwayne Johnson and Jason Momoa join the fray with Black Adam and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Robert Pattinson gets the first crack at the big-screen spotlight. That comes with the long-awaited release of The Batman, which is now officially in theaters across the world.
Following nearly a full year of delays, The Batman is becoming quite the hit for Warner Bros. as the company extends its superhero content beyond the DCEU.

"Love seeing The Batman do this kind of spectacular box office business. Excellent uptick trend for our movie industry, our WB/DC partners and most importantly, A BIG HAPPY AUDIENCE 
Congrats to the cast + crew! I know how hard youâ€™ve all worked"
