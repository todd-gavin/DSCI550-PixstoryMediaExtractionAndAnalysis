“'I wanted to achieve rights for the women of my country. But now I have lost the right to life.' “
Zareen (real name changed) received her MPhil in Political Science from Bangladesh in July and returned to Afghanistan with the ambition of becoming a politician and fighting for women's equality. Her hopes were dashed, however, when the Taliban ousted the Afghan government in August of last year, banning women's education and political activism. 
Her tragic tale isn't over yet. The Taliban forced her father to marry one of their veteran 'fighters,' who had made enormous'sacrifices' to defeat the Americans and re-establish the Islamic government in Afghanistan. 
Her father, who was terrified, chose not to refuse the demand in order to protect his family from the worst possible repercussions, and assured the commander that the family would think about it.
