An image of a soldier is being shared with the claim that she is “the wife of the Vice President of Ukraine” fighting against the Russian invasion.

Twitter user IAmAarav8 posted this image. It has been retweeted over 1,000 times.

Several Facebook and Twitter accounts have shared this image. The six posts added in the slideshow below have gained over 20,000 likes cumulatively. 

Fact-check
Alt News performed a reverse image search and found that the viral image was uploaded on Alamy, a stock image website, last year. The caption states the image shows a soldier from the rehearsal of the Independence Day parade at Kyiv’s Khreshchatyk street. Last year, Ukraine was celebrating three decades of independence.

The stock image doesn’t mention the name of the woman. However, as per a Ukraine government website that lists its head of state structure, the country doesn’t have a vice-president. In fact, a keyword search on Google using the phrase “Vice President of Ukraine” and restricting the results to the domain of the Ukraine government [gov.ua] establishes the same.

To sum it up, an image of a Ukrainian soldier was shared with a false claim. Facebook page 香港地 and Veteran Up also posted different images and made the same claim.
