The UK’s longest-serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, passed away last week. In the backdrop of this, a clip of Jawaharlal Nehru at a public event is being shared on social media with a claim that Nehru “took the citizenship of London in 1956″ as a hallmark of his loyalty to the Queen.
In the video we hear a man felicitating Nehru saying,”It is my privilege as Chamberlain of this city to offer you both the right hand of fellowship and greet you, Mr Nehru, as a citizen of London.”
Twitter user @TheRudra1008 shared this clip along with the claim. The video gained over 40,000 views. (Archived link)
