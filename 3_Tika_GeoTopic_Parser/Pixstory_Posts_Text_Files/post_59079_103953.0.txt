To all the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Happy Pride Month. You deserve all the love ❤️🌈
Love who you want to love. Be who you want to be.🏳️‍🌈

Pride Month is an entire month dedicated to the uplifting of LGBTQ, celebrating LGBTQ Culture, and Supporting their Rights. 

LGBTQ is celebrated each year in June to honor the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in Manhattan. 

The Stonewall Uprising was a tipping point for the Gay Liberation Movement in the United States.
