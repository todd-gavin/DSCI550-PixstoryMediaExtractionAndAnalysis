Eight cheetahs - five of which are female- were brought from Namibia to India and on September 17, they were released into the Kuno National park in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.
The introduction of Cheetah in India is regarded as the first act when a large carnivore species like cheetah has been moved across continents for establishing a new population.
It will take months before the ordinary citizens would be able to have a visit to Kuno as cheetahs will take time to adapt to their new surroundings.
