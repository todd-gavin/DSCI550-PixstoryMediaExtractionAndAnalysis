Music knows no bounds, no language, no bordersâ€”they say. But this statement got a whole different meaning when an astronaut recorded an album in space!
Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut, released his first album in 2015, which was fully recorded while he was in orbit. He's a skilled musician who went viral with a cover of David Bowie's "Space Oddity." He's also the first Canadian to walk in space. Hadfield spent 144 days on the International Space Station, recording 11 original songs for his CD Space Sessions: Songs for a Tin Can, which is suitably titled.
"The serenity and grace I felt while orbiting our Earth, weightless by the window, gave a whole new place to write and perform music," Hadfield, who retired as an astronaut in July 2013, said in a statement. "I'm delighted to be able to share these completed works as a new way to help tell the stories of early space exploration."
Hadfield spent five months aboard the International Space Station in 2013 and spent his evenings recording and playing acoustic guitar. When he returned to Earth, he handed the recordings over to producer Robbie Lackritz and solicited the help of unknown special guests to add additional accompaniment.
"Bit by bit, squeezed into all of the work that was going on up there, I recorded those songs," said Hadfield as part of a behind-the-music interview posted on his website. "They were changed by the place. A couple of them I wrote from scratch, inspired by being up there."
"By the end, I had successfully commanded a spaceship and done all the work, but also came home with a dozen or 15 songs recorded like music has never been recorded before," he said.
Mind-blowing, isn't it? Musicians truly don't know where to stop, and their love for music knows no bounds after all.
