Perfectionism is a defense mechanism and when we engage in it we are trying to avoid the discomfort, the pain of being wrong, or feeling like a failure. We are scared of doing it wrong and scared of being rejected.

But when we learn to overcome our avoidance, we get to live the life we want. So, I hope you realize that you are lovable, mistakes and all. No one is perfect & you are doing your best. 
It's also okay to ask for support. Give yourself some time and space so you don't exhaust yourself :)
