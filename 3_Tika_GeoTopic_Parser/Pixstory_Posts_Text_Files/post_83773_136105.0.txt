When the world first learned about the outbreak of a deadly new virus COVID-19 in late 2019, many of us probably wondered how our lives would be affected. Would we be at risk of becoming infected? How would we stay safe? Would it change anything about the way we live?
This pandemic has had a great impact on my life and how I see the world.  As with all things, there are positive and negative aspects to being part of this pandemic. While it is often scary, difficult and challenging, it has also been one of the most educational experiences of my life so far. Here’s how my life has changed since the pandemic.
Im far more cautious about what i eat as the virus made me cautious about  the germs and how should we consume things. I have also learned to  value my loved one's as first we used to take everything for granted. Once restrictions were imposed for travel i understood how easy it was to meet our loved one's and how such a situation can put us in a position to lose them.
I also understand why it's important to travel safe and take care of your health and also never put anyone else in danger because of you. As everyone's immunity differs.
In short, the pandemic taught me to be appreciative of everything i have and never take them for granted.
