Melania Trump has unveiled her latest NFT collection on MelaniaTrump.com, a Parler-powered platform, in honour of Women's History Month. The new set of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) collection, produced by artist Marc-Antoine Coulon once again to mark Women's History Month, features 3,000 versions across three portraits. 

The Solana blockchain technology is used to create the Women's History Month NFT Collection. These NFTs allow customers to get their hands on the original digital art file. 

Furthermore, at $150 apiece, 1,500 versions of the portrait "Strong," 500 editions of "Confident," and 1,000 editions of "Inspirational" are included in the collection.

However, each purchase is made at random. "Collectors will enjoy a sense of surprise because the artwork will not be disclosed until after the purchase," said Parler. 

The NFT Collection for Women's History Month will honour three qualities that women should strive for: strong, confident, and influential. 

Melania Trump tweeted in support of Ukrainian women on March 8, 2022, using the terms "strong," "confident," and "inspiring."

Coingape tells us that this past year, the former First Lady made a splash in the NFT industry by establishing several of her own. Melania's Eyes, a watercolour painting of Trump's eyes, was the first piece in Trump's inaugural NFT collection, which debuted in December 2021. Melania Trump auctioned her third NFT collection, 'Head of State,' inspired by her stay in the White House, in January 2022. A wide-brimmed white hat worn by the former first lady was featured in the collection, along with a painting of her wearing it.
