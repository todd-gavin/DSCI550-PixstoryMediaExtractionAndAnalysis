For a game quickly shaping up to be one of the biggest games of the year with tons of hype around it, we know surprisingly little information at hand. This deliberate lack of information was most done in order to keep the events of the game as secretive as possible before launch.

However, Sony has recently released the first full-length plot synopsis for God of War Ragnarok, giving fans a little bit more information on what to expect in the long-awaited sequel. Revealed on PlayStation Store, the new synopsis replaces the vague, rough around the edges version we saw previously. It confirms that game will not just take place during Ragnarök - the grand final battle of Norse mythology that traditionally sees Odin, Loki and other gods die - but also during the events immediately preceding it, a Norse saga known as Fimbulwinter.


The official synopsis reads: “Embark on a mythic journey for answers and allies as Kratos and Atreus prepare for Ragnarök.
"From Santa Monica Studio comes the sequel to the critically acclaimed God of War (2018). Fimbulwinter is well underway. Kratos and Atreus must journey to each of the Nine Realms in search of answers as Asgardian forces prepare for a prophesied battle that will end the world. Along the way they will explore stunning, mythical landscapes, and face fearsome enemies in the form of Norse gods and monsters. The threat of Ragnarök grows ever closer. Kratos and Atreus must choose between their own safety and the safety of the realms.”
