If you think B.sc Degrees are limited to 'Physics' 'Chemistry' or to the most 'Statistics', you are mistaken.

The majors i will talk about today have been the hype for quite some time and there were and still are many diploma courses and training camps offered by private academies, but only recently did Pune University start full time 3- year Degree Courses for the same.

Now without much delay and a little bias let me begin with my own Degree:

#B.sc Animation and VFX
When i tell people I'm pursuing B.sc their reactions are pretty basic but when i mention 'B.sc in ANIMATION ' they're intrigued and wonder how creative and fun it must be and IT IS. With bare minimum theory and a ton lot of activities like shooting short films , designing cartoon characters to recreating realistic environments CGI , college is never boring.

And if you're wondering about the scope of this field, Your favourite DC/MARVEL movie, your mom's go to serial, every advertisement you watch uses atleast some element of Animation. Animation is as challenging and money making as any engineering Degree, just a lot more interesting.

#B.sc Cyber Security
You must've all watched some movies or some content involving hacking , so fascinating isn't it , when your coding genius hero successfully hacks into the villain's system and defeats their wrong motives.

This is one degree with most intriguing and interesting assignments in the entire campus, while one team gets to hack the security frequency the other has to counter hack them , how thrilling would that be.

Cyber security is such a necessity in this world that revolves around internet, and there are various ethical hacking training camps but imagine getting a degree for the same, oh dear all private and government organisations knocking your door. 

Do you know about any such degrees?
