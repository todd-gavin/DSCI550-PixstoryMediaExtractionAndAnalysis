After a second postponement, the launch of NASA's new Artemis I Moon rocket faces a possibly significant delay. 

BBC reported that on Saturday, controllers attempted to launch the Space Launch System (SLS) spacecraft once more without success. Then a fuel leak stopped them. 

Now that the rocket is being examined by engineers, any repairs might have to be made in the workshop rather than on the launch pad. 

There will undoubtedly be a several-week delay as a result of the entire process. It implies that a third launch attempt might not happen until at least mid-October. 

The SLS is the most potent rocket the US space agency has ever created, and it is intended to return astronauts and their gear to the Moon after a 50-year absence. 
A large portion of the huge force is generated by four large engines on the underside of the vehicle, which burn about three million litres of extremely cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen. 

However, an alert went out, signalling there was a leak, when controllers transmitted the command early on Saturday morning to fill the rocket's hydrogen tank. 

The link where the hydrogen was fed into the car was the source of the issue!
