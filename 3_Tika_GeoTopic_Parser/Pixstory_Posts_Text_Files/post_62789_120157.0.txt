"The author will tell you there's a garden, you'll plant your own orchids in it. That's the power of fiction."

What a beautiful way to put it! I think reading fiction can really make you more empathetic, and creative. People think fiction is useless but as humans, we need creative thinking skills in our day to day life and it's kind of sad an artform if that looked down upon.

Once you start reading fiction, I don't think there's a way out. It's just really great you know? You're opened to an entirely different world of different characters. You'll find those like you, some different than you. You'll feel love, you'll feel hate. Anger, sadness, happiness, even annoyance. How can something that can bring so many emotions out be pointless?

Fiction gives you idols to look up to. Real people â€“ especially those you don't know personally, are not as perfect as you think they are. Idolizing real people is putting the burden of over-achieving on them. Not to mention, more often than not, your idols are not who you think they are. So in the end, you do in fact only idolize a fictionalized version of that person.
