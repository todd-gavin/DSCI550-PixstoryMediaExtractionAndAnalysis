People try to find reasons behind their dreams and often connect them with myths unrelated to understanding dreams.
Well, what can be comprehended are the factors that can influence one's dreams.
It could be your health conditions, the food you eat, and the lifestyle you lead—it all matters and influences the dreaming process.

Speaking of health conditions, it is one of the biggest influences on dreams. 
Being sleep-deprived for a night or two (or more) can make parts of your brain much more active when you finally do slip into REM sleep. For example, you’re likely to have more vivid dreams if you’ve had some restless nights. You’re also more likely to recall those dreams, too.
Mental health disorders like depression or anxieties could be one of the reasons for negative dreams and nightmares.

Now, what you eat also affects the way you dream. Foods help in remembering your dreams. High-carb foods, for example, can give you quick energy. But after a while, they can leave you feeling down.

A small study trusted Source found that one good way to sleep more soundly is to exercise in the morning. A good run or another cardio workout before noon helps set your clock so that you’re more inclined to fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep than if you didn’t exercise or if you exercise late at night.

The more effectively you can de-stress during the day, the less likely you’ll be to bring stress and anxiety to bed. That should help cut down on nightmares and interrupted sleep each night.
