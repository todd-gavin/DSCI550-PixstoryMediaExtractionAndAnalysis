Anne Hathaway has been cast as the lead for The Idea of You, the film adaptation of the popular fan fiction novel that was inspired by Harry Styles.
We adore the concept behind this casting call.
The Idea of You is a well-liked fan-fiction book about a divorced mother who has a passionate love affair with a pop artist at a music festival. Anne Hathaway will play the lead role in the planned movie adaptation of this book. Many people think Harry Styles was the inspiration for this book.
Based on Robinne Lee's 2017 book of the same name, Michael Showalter will direct and co-produce the movie. The 39-year-old Devil Wears Prada actress will portray Sophie, a "40-year-old divorced mother." Dan, Sophie's husband, remarried to a younger woman and has now cancelled their 15-year-old daughter's Coachella trip. Sophie gets herself up and braves the traffic and heat of the desert.
Fans think Harry was the inspiration for the romance book because Hayes, a young British musician who leads his band, is similar to the former member of One Direction. Hayes, the singer of "Watermelon Sugar," is also seeing Olivia Wilde, who is ten years his senior. This shows that Harry and Hayes have similar tastes in women.
The author explicitly stated that she wants readers to concentrate more on the narrative of a woman finding herself after a broken marriage rather than only its relationship with a well-known pop musician.
In a Dec. 2020 interview with Vogue, Robinne stated, "This was never supposed to be a book about Harry Styles. It was intended to be a tale about a woman reaching the age of 40 who discovers her sexuality and rediscovers herself, just at the time when society traditionally writes off women as being desirable, viable, and entire.
