It was all eyes on Martin Odegaard as he returned to Norway for his first game in club football since leaving Stromgodset for Real Madrid back in Still only Martin was just when he made his first team debut in a friendly and he played a league game against Bodo Glimt when he was Now the captain of his country and one of Europe s foremost No s he comes back to Norway as Arsenal skipper too playing what he believes is the best football of his career Before our UEL game Martin faced the media I think the biggest mistake we can make is to talk too much about the pitch the weather or whatever The most important thing is just to come here and win the game that s all that matters We are not going to focus too much on the pitch obviously it s different and we have to adjust a little bit but it s still football it s still the same rules and we are going to go out to win the game I think it s just us becoming better as a team We all understand what Mikel wants from us even more We work hard every day to improve and everyone understands the system and the style We are working hard to improve on the pitch and of course we have brought some new players in who have got a lot of qualities I think the main thing is the work we do every day at the training pitch how we improve and how we work Yeah I remember it well I was a kid I feel young today but that was about eight ten years ago so I was a kid It was a good time obviously I was playing football having fun enjoying life doing what I love It was a great time everything went really quick but I enjoyed it
