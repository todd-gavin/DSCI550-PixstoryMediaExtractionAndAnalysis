The Delhi administration made the decision on Sunday to extend the current liquor shop licences till August 31 in order to avoid unrest brought on by a lack of alcohol in the city.
The 468 private liquor stores in Delhi were set to close their doors starting on Monday after their licences expired on July 31.

However, the booze stores won't operate until the excise agency issues an order after receiving approval from the Lieutenant Governor.

"The administration has sent the Lt. Governor the Cabinet's decision to extend the current liquor vending licences for one more month, till August 31. After LG gives its approval, orders allowing the booze establishments to stay open through July 31 will be issued."

After realising that the Excise Policy 2021-22 was unable to achieve the desired objectives of bringing in greater revenues and that its implementation is being scrutinised for alleged rule violations and procedural lapses, officials said, the Delhi government decided to return to the old excise regime and run liquor stores through its agencies.

From September 1, the government liquor stores will be open for business for a period of six months, during which time the private vendors will continue to be in business.
