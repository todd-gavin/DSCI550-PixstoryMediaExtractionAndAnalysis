The ongoing debate on choice vs life prevails as the recent news of overturning abortion laws has come to light.
There are two sides of people divided by different opinions, one supporting the abortion while other denouncing it and calling it murder. On the other side, people against aborting a fetus believe that the fetus needs protection and cannot be killed. These people call it unjust to annihilate an unborn.

But the question arises whether it shouldn't be a choice or a right of a woman to decide what she wants to carry in her womb?
Of course, it's a right to privacy, and bodily privacy is the fundamental choice. And it was always a part of democracy.
In every country that has adopted English common law, there lingers a right to privacy for everyone where no government interference is required. 
To adhere to moral values, a woman cannot choose to forsake her body to keep another life alive.

According to an American philosopher, Judith Jarvis Thomson, " even if a fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body and life-supporting functions".
This argument answered all the questions hovering against the right to abortion.
There's no right to force someone to carry a fetus without one's will.

Besides all, a woman is still fettered and confined unless she can't choose to be a mother or not. Therefore, and reaching this acme of the debate, it should favour abortion as it is a right of a body and privacy of a woman.
