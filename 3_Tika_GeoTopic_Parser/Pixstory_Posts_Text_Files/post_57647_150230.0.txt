The earlier teens start using social media, the more significant the platforms' impact on mental health. As it has become easier to seek these platforms the problem is increasing.
This is especially true for females. While teen males tend to express aggression physically, females do so relationally by excluding others and sharing hurtful comments. 
Social media can  increase the opportunity for such harmful interactions.
"In addition to providing young people with a window through which they can view missed experiences, social media puts a distorted lens on appearances and reality. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat increase the likelihood of seeing unrealistic, filtered photos when teen bodies change."
In the past, teens read magazines that contained altered photos of models. Now, these images are one thumb-scroll away at any given time. Apps that provide the user with airbrushing, teeth whitening, and more filters are easy to find and easier to use. It’s not only celebrities who look perfect—it’s everyone.
When there’s a filter applied to the digital world, it can be challenging for teens to tell what’s real and what isn’t, which comes at a difficult time for them physically and emotionally.
