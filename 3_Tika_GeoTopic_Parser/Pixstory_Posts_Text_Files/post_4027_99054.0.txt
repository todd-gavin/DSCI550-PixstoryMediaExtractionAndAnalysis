No mothers food can be replaced by anything. And how much ever we try to recreate them by following the exact same measures and process it wouldn't reach to the taste of her preparation. 

Even if it is a small portion of coconut chutney, the taste has her signature upon it. And if I have to say what my favourite among her preparation then I would have to say all ! 

Each preparation of hers have her touch to it be it the sambar and dosa, the crispness of dosa just makes us want more of dosas in the puddle of sambar. 

When it comes to lunch a mixed vegetable curry mostly called as Avial where the consistency and proportion of all the veggies comes right with her preparation with some sauted dry prawns fry is enough to just fill in our tummy with the best meal. 

Snacks she have her own preparation of banana fritters. 

Her special days preparations just gives you that feeling of tummy is full with sumptuous foods. 

As she now have an assistant of YouTube she also explore new dishes and experiment them. In her every tries she check for new scope of improvement and when she finally gets that authentic taste her face of happiness and excitement just gets transferred to us to try them super fast. 

I would like to thank all the mothers out here that you have done everything for us and we would like to thank you for doing everything for us.  

Wishing all the mommies out there an amazing Mother's Day ❤️.
