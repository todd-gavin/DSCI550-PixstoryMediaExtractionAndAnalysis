With Australia's federal election in 2022 just days away, attention is turning to independent candidates running in various constituencies across the country who might play a major role in forming a future government, especially if the vote is close. 

AlJazeera reported that as more than 17 million Australians prepare to vote on May 21, opinion polls show the margin between Scott Morrison's incumbent Liberal National coalition and its Labor opponents led by Anthony Albanese is shrinking. 

Morrison is defending a one-seat majority, and waning trust in institutions, increasing demands of government officials, and generational shifts have made Australians less politically devoted than ever.

“People are less rusted onto the major political parties,” said Ian McAllister, an expert in Australian politics from the Australian National University (ANU), because of “declining party identification and party loyalty” and “declining trust in politicians [and] declining satisfaction with democracy”.
