A move that can certainly be seen through the twin lens of easing travel norms and waning effect of the omicron variant of coronavirus, Canada has relaxed the COVID-19 testing norms for those travelling from India.

In a new official readout, Canada said people travelling on direct flights or one-stop flight from India will no longer need to show negative RT PCR COVID test done within 18 hours ahead of the departure. 


As per the latest guidelines issued by the Canadian government for India, no passengers will now need to show mandatory negative RT PCR COVID test report obtained from approved labratory at Delhi airport before boarding the international flight.

“Effective January 28, 2022, we’re removing the modified pre-departure Covid-19 test requirements for travellers on direct flights to Canada from India and Morocco, and the requirement for third country testing for travellers on indirect routes to Canada from these countries,” Transport Canada Tweeted on Friday.

However, an RT PCR COVID test report from Indian Council Of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved labratory is still required for those travelling from India to Canada.

Earlier, the Canadian government had made it mandatory for flyers to carry negative COVID-19 test report not more than 18 hours before departure from the approved laboratory at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. However, this rule has now been cancelled by the Canadian government

"Travellers planning to fly to Canada do not need to carry a negative COVID-19 test report within 18 hours from the approved laboratory at the New Delhi International Airport. Moreover, as per the guidelines, the fully vaccinated passengers will have to upload the relevant information into the ArriveCAN mobile app or website." read the statement from the Canadian government.
