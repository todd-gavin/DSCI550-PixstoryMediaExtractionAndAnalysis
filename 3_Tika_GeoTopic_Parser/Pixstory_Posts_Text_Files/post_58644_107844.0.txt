Famous British novelist Joseph Rudyard Kipling had centuries back said the popular proverb , " The east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet together" . 
But in the modern century, the divine power of Ganges and its mystique beauty has removed the gap between east and west followed by a wonderful new union of peace and spirituality. The continous inflow of foreign tourists across the world is a glaring example to this fact, sidelining the maxim of Rudyard Kipling
