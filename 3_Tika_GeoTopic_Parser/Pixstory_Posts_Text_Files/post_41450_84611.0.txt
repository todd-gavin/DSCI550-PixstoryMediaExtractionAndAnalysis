A source verified to The Athletic that US Soccer is ready to announce an English-language television rights deal with Turner Sports and HBO. Grant Wahl, a journalist, broke the storey first on Monday. A U.S. official was contacted early on Monday. A spokeswoman for soccer declined to comment. 

The Athletic reported that U.S. ESPN and Fox Sports have previously signed an agreement with soccer. That contract, which runs until the end of 2022, was part of a package negotiated by Soccer United Marketing in conjunction with Major League Soccer's media rights. In May, US Soccer announced the conclusion of its agreement with SUM and the acquisition of its media and marketing rights in-house.

The men's and women's World Cups are not included in these media rights. Fox Sports has the World Cup rights for the 2022 men's, 2023 women's, and 2026 men's World Cups. Turner would own the rights to U.S. Soccer properties such as national team friendlies, the SheBelieves Cup, and U.S. men's and women's national team World Cup qualifiers. Notably, as the host country, the United States is not scheduled to participate in any World Cup qualifiers before to 2026. However, FIFA has not yet confirmed that the United States, together with Mexico and Canada, will automatically qualify as one of the three host nations. 

Men's qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup may also be held, depending on the length of the agreement.
