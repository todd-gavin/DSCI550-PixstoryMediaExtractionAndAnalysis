Today is the day when Real Madrid will face Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League semifinal s second leg and whoever wins the match will book their ticket to Paris as they will become the finalists of the Champions League Last week the first leg between both teams ended up on a scoreline of where Manchester City wins the match and the only positive for Real Madrid in that match was that they scored three goals and remain alive for the second leg The second leg will be played at Real Madrid s home stadium Santiago Bernabeu where we all know the crowd plays a big role and with the help of home support Real Madrid can do a miracle again and reach the finals of the Champions League On the other hand Manchester City s team will play the match based on the talent and tactics of Pep Guardiola but conceding three goals against Real Madrid proved that Manchester City is not a perfect team and on their bad day they can lose too For Real Madrid David Alaba is highly likely to miss the game Casemiro is back in the squad On the other hand Manchester City Kyle Walker will get some minutes in the match Cancelo will play the second leg after serving the suspension How much I know football I think whoever will score the first goal today will have the advantage momentum on their side and that team will go through to the finals of the Champions League As a Real Madrid fan I want my team to win but I can t ignore the players of Manchester City and because of that I feel a little bit of nervousness inside me May the best team win today s match
