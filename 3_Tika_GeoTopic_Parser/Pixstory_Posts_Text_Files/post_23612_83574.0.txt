The iconic duo Phillipe and David Blond closed the New York fashion week with their Hot Vampires.

The corsets are the signature looks of The blonds. 
The model Vamps walked in thigh high heeled boots and gold platforms. 

One of the model wore tiny spike undies. 

Phillipe opened the show in little silver head horns, a cape looking like a worthy Morden bloodsucker and a catsuit studded with adornment to match the look.
