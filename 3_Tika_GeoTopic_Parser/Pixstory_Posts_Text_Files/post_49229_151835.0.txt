Talking about the most recent song title revealed, from her 10th Studio Album - Midnights, Taylor posted on Instagram, divulging that Track 3 : Anti - Hero, is one of her favourite songs she's ever written. 
Talking about the song, Swift says, "I struggle a lot with the idea that my life has become unmanageably sized and I struggle with the idea of not feeling like a person,” before adding “Don’t feel bad for me.” 
She continues to talk about the song and how many of us would relate to it, by saying, “This song really is a real guided tour throughout all of the things I tend to hate about myself. We all hate things about ourselves. It’s all of those aspects of the things we dislike and like about ourselves that we have to come to terms with if we’re going to be this person. I think it’s really honest.”
