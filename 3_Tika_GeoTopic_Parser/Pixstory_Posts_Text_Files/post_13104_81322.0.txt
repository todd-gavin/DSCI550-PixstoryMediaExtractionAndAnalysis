The Taliban cabinet announced today that Valentine's Day is a day celebrated by infidels, not Muslims.
Zabihullah Mujahid;
If we see every girl and boy outside on Valentine's Day, I will get married. No one is allowed.
If you see a couple together outside. Do you see their marriage certificate?

When are we now, where are we? This is not a simple question, it is not just a scientific, philosophical, and historical issue. That's everything. Before we believe in a school and before I do anything, we must first determine where on earth we are and in what period of time.
