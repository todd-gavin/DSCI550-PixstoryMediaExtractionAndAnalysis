Every bit of this writing makes my throat sick, since childhood, youth, even now, only this sentence has been used in the language of Afghans. We Want peace ! I think,Peace that will never come, peace, peace, peaceToday, we are in a state of war with extremism, and this tiring war takes victims from us every day and causes blood to flow in every corner, and the government of Afghanistan should provide a correct definition of terrorism and confront them. stand in the war to pave the way for peace, which means that the policy of suppressing armed insurgency while leaving the means of negotiation with internal enemies will cause them to suffer from the repression of the government and be forced to soften the door. hit the government and this is where we succeed in preventing the continuation of the war.But in foreign policy, one should be more cautious and define a strong diplomacy, how to establish relations with rival and even enemy countries in order to keep everyone satisfied.Formulated and carried out regular plans for negotiations with countries that we have problems with.How to receive economic and security cooperation from foreigners should be carefully designed and implemented.And in the internal dimension, the policy of keeping the citizens satisfied, creating job opportunities, real fight against all kinds of corruption, expansion and more attention in the education sector, the growth and strengthening of the civil society, the media and the freedom of thought and expression was favorable.This message is from one Afghan Refugee in India, Who didn’t want to be identified.
