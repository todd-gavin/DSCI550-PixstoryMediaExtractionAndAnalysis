How is supporting the police any more responsible than you claim wanting to defund the police is? Read up on what happened when we tried that? Sir, read up on what is happening right now!
People are getting murdered by the hands of our sweet little cops everyday. And bad eggs? So you mean there was not even one good egg when children in Uvalde were getting shot at mercilessly? Or there was no good egg when a black man was being killed for nothing criminal? Oh, yes, there was a good egg in fact. The LA officer who died earlier this year during his "training" because he was investigating his fellow officers and was about to reveal information against four other officers he was investigating in connection with a gang rape. 
Rapes, murders, hate crimes. That's the legacy of our police. It's not some bad eggs, it's an institutionalized evil. When you need them, they're not there. They are under no obligation to help you but you eating a burger is a reason enough to shoot at you. Systemic violence does not end with mere reforming, especially when the said system hides in a corner when it's supposed to do its "duty".
