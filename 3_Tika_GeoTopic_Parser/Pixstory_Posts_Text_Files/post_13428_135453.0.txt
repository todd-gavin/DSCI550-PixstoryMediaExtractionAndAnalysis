The Taliban celebrated the 9th of Sambla, the day of the complete withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, by holding a special ceremony and a military parade at Bagram Airfield. Mohammad Hassan Akhund, the prime minister of the Taliban, said in this ceremony that the international pressure and sanctions against the Taliban will not yield results. He demanded the understanding of the international community with the Taliban.
In this ceremony, Mohammad Hassan Akhund congratulated the "victory" of the Taliban to those who "sacrificed their bodies and parts of their bodies in the way of God". The Taliban used to fight against the previous regime and foreign forces by launching suicide attacks.
The United States of America ended its 20-year mission in Afghanistan last year on the 9th of Sabla, corresponding to August 31, with the departure of its last soldier from Kabul Airport.
In the last two decades, Bagram Airfield was the main center of international forces led by the US, and thousands of foreign soldiers were stationed in this military base.
