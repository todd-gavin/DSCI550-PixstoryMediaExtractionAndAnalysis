Fox had been the world's best whitewater paddler for years, but an Olympic gold medal had proven her to be a unicorn.

A silver in London, a bronze in Rio... there was a lot of expectation and pressure in Tokyo, but Fox powered to Olympic gold in the C1 with her father Richard on commentary.

She not only won the C1 event, but she blew it out by more than three seconds.

She also won bronze in the K1, making her the only athlete to finish on the podium in both canoeing and kayaking in Tokyo.
