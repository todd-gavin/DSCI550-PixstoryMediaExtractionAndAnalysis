They also make sure that at least one player between the wing and full-back maintains the width
on one side so they can connect with changes of play and diagonal passes across.

Callum
Wilson is known for his energetic channel running ability. To help in such endeavours, Nick Pope
only adds one extra sound distributor, but that distributor is more than capable of outperforming
Dubravka's performance from the previous season.

Pope's allegedly "poor" distribution has been greatly exaggerated in all of the international
goalkeeping debates. He demonstrated that he was more than capable of helping the build-up
in 2021–2022 by completing 100% of his short passes and 96% of his medium-length passes.

The Burnley player completed a substantially higher proportion of passes into the final third in
2021–22, i.e., pulling off significantly riskier, cutting-edge passes. It is true that Dubravka ranks
either equal to Pope or higher in all three categories from short to long.

Pope's remarkable
distance and distribution will be crucial for the Magpies this season even if it is improbable that
he will attempt the longest passes in the league two seasons in a row.

Nick Pope has consistently been one of the Premier League's top goalkeepers and has long
been deserving of a transfer to a bigger organisation. A significant transfer to one of the top sixclubs became impossible at the age of 30. However, the Magpies were astute and quickly
secured his signing, getting the goalkeeper for merely 10 million pounds.

Pope will complement
Dubravka's quality, command, and shot-stopping skills right away and will better fit Eddie
Howe's preferred playing style. The best part is that Pope will continue to excel at the greatest
level in the Premier League for at least another year.
