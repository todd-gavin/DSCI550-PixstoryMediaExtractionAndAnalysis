The England National Football Team is managed by Gareth Southgate and after an impressive showing at the last Euros, they'll be looking to take this form into the World Cup and try to "Bring it Home."Â  Gareth Southgate is very defensive with his style of play and this England squad usually sits deep and waits to counter attack.
The GK will most likely be Southgate's trusted player, Jordan Pickford but Nick Pope is also looking to be in the starting line up with his recent form. Usually Southgate employs a 5 at the back. Kyle Walker will be the right back, Coady, Maguire and Stones will be the centre backs, finally Chilwell will play as the left back. In the centre of the park usually Henderson and Kalvin Phillips will play and sometimes Ward Prowse can get the chance to play instead of Henderson. 
The front three will most likely feature Sterling on the left, Harry Kane in the middle and probably either Sancho or Saka from the right.
All in all it looks like a very good team that can easily reach the Semis and if the teams clicks even go all the way. They have a very strong bench as well. The Three Lions have a good chance at this World Cup to prove their worth.
