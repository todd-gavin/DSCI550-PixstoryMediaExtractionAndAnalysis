When the Russia Ukraine war broke out on February th Anubhav was at the airport on his way to decompress from a stressful couple of months with a five day break to Goa when he got a call from his mother about bombs in Kyiv My first reaction was it s probably a fake story who s going to bomb a city Like it s the capital that doesn t happen in a modern world Anubhav says But as Anubhav sifted through more news articles the reality of the situation slowly started settling in and he messaged Anna not wanting to startle her with a phone call She slept the night before peacefully not thinking about war we were still planning our travels and how to bring the dog that s the last discussion we had before that morning Anubhav says There s a wholesome story behind Bao too Anna was more of a cat lover till Anubhav s four year old Shih Tzu prompted her to adopt in Kyiv They ve been together throughout because she s been working from home so that dog is almost like her baby he s the most spoilt dog I ve seen but he s the cutest dog Anubhav says The couple had planned to do a court wedding in March to get through the bureaucracy so that Bao could be brought back to India followed by a celebration with family and friends in November But those plans went for a toss Right before Anubhav boarded Anna responded with a call I just heard some bombs I think something happened The war has started she said By the time Anubhav s flight landed Anna had kept hearing bombs she wasn t in immediate danger but could see the smoke and hear the missilies It was really scary I don t know how to explain this Anubhav says We were in disbelief both of us at that point Up Next Anna Leaves For Poland
