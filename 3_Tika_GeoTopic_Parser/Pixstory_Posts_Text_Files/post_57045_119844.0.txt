-Doris Lessing (1919 - 2013) 

-Toni Morrison (born 1931) 
"Beloved. It’s odd reading a book at which you are simultaneously repulsed at how you feel and yet you understand exactly why you feel that way. She’s a terrific writer." –getebi

-Ursula K Le Guin (born 1929) 
"As an adult, I find the Earthsea books by Ursula K Le Guin have greater moral depth than Tolkien and are better written and more focused than George RR Martin’s." –QuesoManchego

-Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) 
"Pretty much all of Woolf, whom I read voraciously during the late 90s and still dip into now and then for a quick dose of writerly inspiration. Hard to pick any one favourite, fiction or non-fiction. But A Room of One’s Own changed my life."
–Jenny Bhatt

-Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (born 1977)
