Cristiano Ronaldo "didn't realize" what he was getting himself into when he joined Manchester United, expecting the team to compete with Liverpool and Manchester City.

Noel Whelan, an ex-Premier League striker, expressed his thoughts on the 37-year- old exclusively to Football Insider. When Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford in August, he signed a two-year contract. United's top brass expect the striker to leave this summer, according to a source close to the club, who spoke to Football Insider on March 31.

On his current contract, the Portugal international is thought to earn roughly £25 million each year. When asked for his assessment of Ronaldo’s future, Whelan told Football Insider‘s Russell Edge: “We have seen the look on his face after games.

“You can see a frustration in Ronaldo that we have not see at other clubs. We didn’t see it at Real Madrid and Juventus. He is a serial winner and that is not the case at Man United.

“I don’t think he realised how far behind Liverpool and Man City they are. It’s been a real mixed bag this season. They’ve looked all over the place at times. There’s been no structure in their play. There’s been turmoil from top to bottom.

“He didn’t realised what he was walking into. That has been the problem. It has shocked him as well as a lot of other people.

“If Ronaldo goes it will be damning for their marketing campaign. He is their main man. He is the biggest name at that club. What does it say if you’re selling your best player, your top scorer?
