Cherries are reportedly among clubs showing interest in former Manchester City defender Cameron Humphreys.

Rangers, Sheffield United, and Stoke City are also on the trail of the 23-year-old centre-back who is a free agent after following his contract to run down at Belgian side Zulte Waregem. 

Humphreys is a former England U-19 international who graduated through Manchester City’s youth system and grabbed headlines when he appeared for City as a 16-year-old to play against Real Madrid in a pre-season game in 2015. 

Having played in the same England youth squads as Trent-Alexander Arnold and Aaron Ramsdale, defender Humphreys made two senior appearances for City, coming in the FA Cup against Aston Villa and Chelsea. 

The 23-year-old will be a free agent this summer after running down his contract at Belgian side Zude Waregem, with a move back to the UK seemingly on the cards. Humphreys has been in Belgium since 2019 when he left Manchester City in pursuit of first-team football. 

Since then, he has only made 55 appearances in three seasons for Zulte Waregem and played three games at Excelsior during the 2019-20 season. 

Despite, having less game time than he might have hoped, a number of high profile clubs are joining Stoke in the race for his signature. 

He joined Zulte Waregem in 2019 and has capped 58 appearances for the Belgian outfit. 

Cherries on Saturday announced centre-back Gary Cahill would leave the club following the expiration of his contract this summer. 

It could be a busy summer for Stoke with a number of players already linked.
