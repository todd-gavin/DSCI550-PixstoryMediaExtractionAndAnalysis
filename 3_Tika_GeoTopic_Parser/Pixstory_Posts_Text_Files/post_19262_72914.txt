Manchester United is a club which is stacked with players who have become surplus to requirement The likes of Eric Bailly Phil Jones Jesse Lingard Anthony Martial and more are at the club without being used and those who cannot be sold or loaned out due to the heavy wages they are on currently A club which is a prime example of how it should not be run is Manchester United It is actually a very sad state for such a massive football club when you give a thought to it Eric Bailly the central defender is the point of focus today He signed a contract extension until very recently only for him to watch the club buy a defender in Raphael Varane after having himself Lindelof Maguire and Jones at disposal Any player would feel unwanted and look for a move away for proper game time and Bailly isn t any different to this case It can be seen that like many of his teammates he is considerably frustrated due to the current situation Clubs from abroad have been linked with a move for him but again his current club and wages do come in his way before taking a call AC Milan from Serie A in the recent window and his former club in Villarreal had shown interest in the defender from Ivory Coast If not during the winter window where moves seem to be difficult to go through Eric will definitely try to his fullest to secure a move away if things do not change which does seem very unlikely
