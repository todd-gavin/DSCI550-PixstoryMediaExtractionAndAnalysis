Xuechang Wang Suming Ding Abstract Diabetes and cancer incidence have risen tremendously over the years Additionally both cancer and diabetes share numerous risks such as overweight inactive lifestyles older age and smoking Numerous methods have been suggested to connect obesity and diabetes to cancer advancements such as increasing insulin Insulin like growth factor I IGF signaling lipid and glucose uptake and metabolism shifts in the cytokine chemokine and adipokine profile also variations in the adipose tissue immediately adjacent to cancer spots Diabetes has been found to have a complicated cancer causing mechanism involving excessive reactive oxygen species ROS production loss of critical macromolecules chronic inflammation and delayed repair all of which contribute to carcinogenesis Diabetes associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition and endothelial to mesenchymal transition lead to the formation of cancer associated fibroblasts in tumors by enabling tumor cells to extravasate via the endothelium and epithelium This study aims to describe the correlation between diabetes and cancer as well as summarize the molecular connections and shared pathways such as sex hormones hyperglycemia inflammation insulin axis metabolic symbiosis and endoplasmic reticulum ER stress that exist between them Sources
