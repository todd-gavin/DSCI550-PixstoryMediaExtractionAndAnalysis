Anyone can father a child but being a dad takes a lifetime Fathers play a role in every child s life that cannot be filled by others This role can have a large impact on a child and help shape him or her into the person they become Fathers and Emotional Development Fathers like mothers are pillars in the development of a child s emotional well being Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules and enforce them They also look to their fathers to provide a feeling of security both physical and emotional Children want to make their fathers proud and an involved father promotes inner growth and strength Studies have shown that when fathers are affectionate and supportive it greatly affects a child s cognitive and social development It also instills an overall sense of well being and self confidence Fathers Set the Bar for Relationships with Others Fathers not only influence who we are inside but how we have relationships with people as we grow The way a father treats his child will influence what he or she looks for in other people Friends lovers and spouses will all be chosen based on how the child perceived the meaning of the relationship with his or her father The patterns a father sets in the relationships with his children will dictate how his children relate with other people My Dad was my first love my role model my idol I was so bleseed to have him To all great fathers out there you are so important
