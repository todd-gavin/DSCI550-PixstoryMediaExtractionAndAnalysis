Last week I had the pleasure to travel to Denver Colorado and do some hiking and outdoor adventures Here are some of the outdoor excursions I did Mon st Garden of The Gods and The Incline Trail Tue nd The Royal Arch Wed rd Chief Mountain Thu th Dream Lake Rocky Mountain National Park Fri th The Red Rocks Amphitheater A lot of fun despite the freezing weather occasional snow and bone chilling winds It wasn t uncommon for the temperature to get down to single digits or even zero on most nights Definitely planning on going back when the weather is less intense Lot s of great hikes worth doing
