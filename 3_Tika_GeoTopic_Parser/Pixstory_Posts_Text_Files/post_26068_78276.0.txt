Here’s a picture of Pluto, that one creature who changed my outlook on life.

Have humans started thinking like they own the planet, when in reality they share it!
Not just dogs, but there are so many stray animals plodding the busy roads of Delhi-NCR. Cows nesting on the road dividers under electricity poles, sometimes feeding on the open garbage lying near the drains.
Dogs have a short life, agreed, but we humans make it shorter by being so indifferent towards our companions. I lost Pluto in a road accident, and there would be many more Plutos’ lost and gone just because we drive like we don’t see, we don’t see small puppies, we don’t see life in front of us?
We as the dwellers of the crowded colonies and societies should take an initiative to make these street dogs wear Reflective collars. But to those who don’t consider animals as equal beings will not even see these sparkling reflections. You hit a human today on the road, and the next day you are behind the bars but what about these innocent animals?
Probably just crossing the road to fetch that little piece of bone being thrown by that Chinese food van, because they don’t have enough to eat.
I’m sure all it takes is a little responsibility to be a little more accountable for those who share this planet with us.
Drive carefully, feed an animal whenever you can!
