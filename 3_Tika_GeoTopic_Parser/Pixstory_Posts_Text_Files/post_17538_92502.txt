The Los Angeles Lakers project failed miserably as L A will finish the season after just games having failed to qualify for the Play In Tournament The Purple and Gold brought in Russell Westbrook Carmelo Anthony and Kendrick Nunn among others to support the LeBron James Anthony Davis duo and return to the race for the NBA championship But after an injury ridden campaign the Lakers will finish the campaign with the worst record since James arrival in Davis has openly lamented L A s bad luck on the injury front wondering what the Purple and Gold could have become if they stayed healthy But when asked whether the Lakers could try to give the project a go next year hopefully with better health the year old forward points out they might not be able to keep some of the players because of the way the roster was constructed A lot of our guys I think maybe besides four or five are on one year deals Davis says So that s a personal choice for those guys But Davis maintains that if this year s Lakers had been healthier they could have competed for the title Like I said when we put this team together we had championship aspirations and once again injuries got in the way of that he says I think we would love to see I think the world would love to see if we were healthy for the full Now if that repeats next year and we have the same team who knows Like I said we got to recap this season what worked and what didn t work and go from there But I truly think that we could ve done something special but Bron and myself mainly me weren t healthy for the entire season Source
