Munnar , a town in the Western Ghats mountain range in India and is a well - known hill station among tourists. 
Most of us have fondly read about Shajahan and Mumtaz   .  Shajahan's zeal and feelings for Mumtaz made him dedicate a monument for his beloved wife - Taj Mahal .🤍
For which Taj Mahal is also known as the ' monument of love ' . ♡
But how many of y'all know that one such 'monument of love' exists in the southern part of India (in the state of Kerala) ?
Well the '  Tomb of Eleanor  ' is one such memorial which reflects the love of Henry Mansfield for his beloved wife Eleanor Isabel May .

Now let's take a look at their immortal love story...🙈💜
Henry Mansfield Knight was the manager of the British tea plantation in Munnar .
Henry and Eleanor fell in love back when they were in England and they got married in the 1800s . And later  when he got his job posting in Munnar , Eleanor accompanied him.
Every evening they used to walk through the lush greens of Munnar , admiring the serene beauty of Munnar. 
One day they both went to visit the Old Munnar Hill. 
Out of ecstasy Eleanor made a wish to Henry. It was to burry her on the top of the Old Munnar Hill after her death. 
Unfortunately , within a short span of time ,  Eleanor fell ill and died due to Cholera. 
Inspite of Eleanor's family's request to send her body to England for cremation purposes  , Henry insisted on burrying her body at the top of the  Old Munnar Hill ,  inorder to make his late wife's final wish come true.
Bereaved by her  loss  , Henry constructed the Tomb of Eleanor and further the Old CSI Church of Munnar .
Till date ,  the Old CSI Church and the Tomb of Eleanor attract  a huge flow of tourists.
