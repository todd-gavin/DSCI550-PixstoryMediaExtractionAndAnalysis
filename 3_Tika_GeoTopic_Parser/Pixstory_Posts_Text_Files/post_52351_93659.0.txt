Pavlova, a meringue-based dessert named for Russian dancer Anna Pavlova, is a meringue-based dish. It features a crunchy crust and a delicate, light inside, and it is typically topped with fruit and whipped cream. The name is pronounced /paevlov/, which is similar to the name of the dancer, which is pronounced /pvlv/.
The dessert is thought to have been made in honour of the ballerina during or after one of her 1920s visits to Australia and New Zealand.
For many years, the nationality of its inventor has been a cause of contention between the two countries.
'The pav' is a popular dish and an integral element of both Australia's and New Zealand's national cuisines, and its simple recipe is regularly served during celebratory and holiday feasts.
It is a summer dessert that is commonly consumed throughout that season, notably around Christmas; nevertheless, it is also enjoyed all year round in many Australian and New Zealand homes.
