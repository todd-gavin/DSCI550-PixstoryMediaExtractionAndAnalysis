A skin tag is a small piece of soft, hanging skin that may have a peduncle or stalk. They can appear anywhere on the body, especially when skin rubs against other skin or clothing. Skin tags are benign tumours of the skin. They commonly occur in creases or folds of the skin.

They are not dangerous but can be removed for aesthetic and cosmetic reasons.
Skin tag removal methods include over-the-counter (OTC) therapies, excision, and cryotherapy.

Most adults have had a skin tag at one time or another, and they’re typically nothing to worry about. “Skin tags are small, benign growths of skin,” says Dr Susan Massick, a board-certified dermatologist with the Ohio State University department of dermatology in Columbus. These soft growths can vary in size and range from about 2 or 3 millimetres to about a half-an-inch.

They often go unnoticed unless they are in a prominent place or are repeatedly rubbed or scratched, for example, by clothing, jewellery, or when shaving. Some people may have skin tags and never notice them. In some cases, they rub off or fall off painlessly. Huge skin tags may burst under pressure.

Skin tags start small, flattened like a pinhead bump. Some stay small, and some grow bigger. They can range in diameter from 2 millimetres (mm) to 1 centimetre (cm), and some may reach 5cm.
