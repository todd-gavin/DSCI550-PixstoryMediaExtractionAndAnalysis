“Photography to me is catching a moment which is passing, and which is true.”

I was eating snacks just opposite to CSTM building ... when I saw this view. It was cloudy after 3 months of Exhausting monsoon. 
It looked aesthetic, pretty and cool in the clouds.

How could I not capture this pretty place ? 😍
