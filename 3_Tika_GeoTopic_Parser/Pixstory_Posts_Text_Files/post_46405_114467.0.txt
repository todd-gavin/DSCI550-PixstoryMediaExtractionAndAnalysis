Wine is bottled poetry 🥂❤️
People have been drinking wine for thousands of years , and the benefits of doing so have been well documented ! There are many blogs and articles online that give you a long list of health benefits of wine . And while I can’t attest to everything that the internet has to say , I can definitely say these  things about wine ; ❤️🥂

1 Wines are fat free . The average glass of wine technically doesn’t contain any fat or cholesterol , according to the USDA .
2 Wines are gluten free . Naturally , wines are gluten free . The only time there might be a minuscule amount of gluten in wine is when some winemaking practices use a wheat paste to seal the oak barrels , which can add a tiny trace of gluten to the wine .
3 Lastly , wines are low in sodium , and also contain some amount of potassium , iron , magnesium and phosphorus .
4 Rich in antioxidants . 
5 Lowers bad cholesterol .

8 Reduces the risk of cancer .
9 Helps treat common cold .
10Keeps memory sharp .
11 Keeps you slim .

With that being said , it’s also important to note that if you want to know more health benefits related to wine , it’s always best to consult your doctor for the same . ✅🥂

But as long as you drink responsibly , you’re all good ! 😍🥂
