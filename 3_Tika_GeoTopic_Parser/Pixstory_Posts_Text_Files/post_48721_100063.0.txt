Western media has not truly been an example of honest journalism in the past. It has twisted facts and narratives to suit the white supremacy, misogyny, and all other issues in between while not only sidelining but erasing the marginalized groups.

However, it is unsurprisingly ironic to see them addressing the very same issues differently just because of the country they've taken place in. These two headlines from The Guardian have been doing rounds. How is it fair to report two similar incidents with so much contrast?

We've already seen how differently the world sees something happening in a European country and a non-european country with how people reacted to the Ukraine situation and the Palestine situation.

How long are people from third world countries going to be subjected to this mistreatment and insensitivity? People of Palestine need our support against not only the Israeli occupation but also Israel's daily merciless attacks on the natives. It was reported not many hours ago that heavily armed forces were beating up Palestinians carrying Shireen Abu Akleh’s coffin and threw sound bombs inside hospital grounds. They were refusing to let them leave the hospital and wanted Shireen’s coffin to be inside a hearse.

This barbarity needs to be put to end, and the first step to that is for Western media to have a spine while doing their work! Media is there to show us the truth, not conceal it.
