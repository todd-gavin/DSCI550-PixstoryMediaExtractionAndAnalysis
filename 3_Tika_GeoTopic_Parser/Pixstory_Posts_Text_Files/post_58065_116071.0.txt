Most of the shoujo manga heroines are carbon copies of each other . They have similar traits , they are naive , innocent , kind girls with a holier than thou personality , they will go to any lengths to help someone even at cost of themselves.

They do not show any assertive or dominant behaviour in a romantic relationship and are meant to be shy .

But then we have Princess Yona from the series Akatsuki No Yona (Yona of the dawn)
written by Mizuho Kusansgi.

It follows the story of Princess a spoiled shelterd princess who has no knowledge of politics or wars . She will only concerns herself with clothes and beauty. But when her cousin So won (also her crush) starts a rebellion and kills her father . She is forced to flee and experience hard life outside the palace.

Now Yona starts out like a typical shoujo heroine but her character development is what makes her different.
As she gets to know more about her kingdom and it's problems she becomes stronger.

She learns weapons , learns the truth about the founding legend of dragons ,she retains herself in the process .
She changed while being true yo herself and her cheerful personality.

She is brave but not reckless,strong but kind ,brutal with reason and cheerful even in the most grim times.

She proves a very important point being nice and kind does not mean being weak , having compassion when you have authority is what makes a good character.

Plus having a character grow as a person is what makes the story interesting.
