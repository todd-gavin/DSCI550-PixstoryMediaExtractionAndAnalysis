Afghans welcome Ramadan with spirit of charity Afghan Muslims are looking forward to the traditions of Ramadan special foods and communal Iftars in addition to the religious obligations of the holy month. During Ramadan, the culture of helping the poor and destitute families becomes more visible than at any other time of year.
Rich people, including merchants, will provide more food and financial help to the poor. Another form of worshipping Godis for the wealthier people to pay alms and charitable donations to the poor, so that they [the benefactors] can reap more blessings this month. Afghan women prepare for Ramadan by cleaning the house and going to the market in search of ingredients for sweets and special foods for the iftar table. Unlike other months, during Ramadan, Afghan spreads become more colourful with more varieties of foods, Both rich and poor alike try their best to prepare varied meals.
Bazaars and markets become busier than in all other months, More families will go to markets to buy food and fresh fruit, since they want to decorate their spreads with colourful fruit and foods.
But since the Taliban took over last year, prices have skyrocketed, and most people struggle to buy even simple food items.
Afghanistan is facing a major shortage of food this year, and going into the fasting month many families are worried.
More than half a million people have lost their jobs since the Taliban came to power, and millions rely on aid to survive.
Even though the markets are fully stocked, not many people can afford to buy food for their families.
