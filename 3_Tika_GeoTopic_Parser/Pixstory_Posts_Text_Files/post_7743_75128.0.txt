So appropriately the series has been named "The Rings of Power."
In the teaser or the title reveal se hear a woman saying, “Three rings for the Elven kings under the sky. Seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone. Nine for mortal men, doomed to die.

The Showrunners J.D. Payne & Patrick McKay, said the following  during the reveal, "This is a title that we imagine could live on the spine of a book next to J.R.R. Tolkien’s other classics...The Rings of Power unites all the major stories of Middle-earth’s Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor, and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men... Until now, audiences have only seen on-screen the story of the One Ring – but before there was one, there were many… and we’re excited to share the epic story of them all.” 

This series is going to be as grand as the movies and will be one that shouldn't be miss. Another epic tale is about to be forged in Tolkien's Legendarium.
