Gabriele Cioffi has come a long way before becoming the coach of Udinese The same coach who grew up supporting Batistuta and Rui Costa&#39;s Fiorentina told about it during an interview with Corriere dello Sport Stadio The taste for adventure comes from slamming doors in your face When they exempt you and the phone doesn&#39;t ring for five or six months I ran away to save my future In Australia to work with young people in Abu Dhabi to be an assistant at Al Jazira In the meantime I had discovered England thanks to Gianfranco Zola and his Birmingham Knowing your limits prevented Cioffi from overdoing it I immediately realized that the Premier League and the Championship were not within my reach then In the fourth series with Crawley Town I lived a dream In the cups we beat Norwich and Stoke City No club in our category had never surpassed a Premier Traveling around the world but with Italy always in my heart Before leaving I reflected on the problems of our country It seemed to me that giving up everything was the only solution While I was living abroad instead I realized how much respect Italy deserves With all its defects and all its difficulties The far from trivial source of inspiration is the Iberian conqueror Hern n Cort s who at the beginning of the sixteenth century conquered Mexico and destroyed the ancient empire of the Aztecs He set sail with his ships and perhaps he would return after years I felt like this Ready away and I was out for eight or nine months then another eight or nine elsewhere There is also room for a thank you to the person who allowed him to do all this None of this would have been possible if my wife Fabiana hadn&#39;t agreed to take care of our children and bear my absences Not a pillar of my life the only pillar
