Torino grappling with two injuries, no small feat A difficult season finale is expected for the grenades who probably lose two of their most important players Belotti and Pobega in fact do not seem ready to return to the field soon The Rooster Belotti has remedied a problem with his flexor right the hope for the medical staff of Turin that it is an elongation or at most a first-degree injury If, however, the injury were confirmed Belotti would play at most the last few games but if the problem were to be more serious then his championship would be already finished Pobega, on the other hand, suffered a spraining trauma to his ankle He too, like his partner, will be evaluated with instrumental tests in the next few hours
