3 Cesc Fabregas
The captaincy curse has been the most severe; every player who has ever been named captain has suffered greatly. And Fabregas has been through the same thing; despite being the youngest Arsenal player in history, the player was ruled out for four months after suffering a knee injury.
Despite missing out on any silverware, his injury did not overshadow his performance, as he was the most consistent player for the Gunners. In 2011, he re-signed for Barcelona after years of speculation.
2 Mikel Arteta
When Arteta was appointed captain, he was no longer a regular starter for the club, as he was nearing the end of his career. Nonetheless, the player had a substantial impact on the dressing room as Arsenal won two FA Cups under his captaincy, and it was clear that Arteta was a great leader, as he subsequently took over as manager in 2019 and has established an outstanding team.
 
 
 
1 Tony Adams
One of the most productive captains in Arsenal history, as well as the club's longest-serving captain. Tony Adams took over as captain in 1988 and remained so until 2002. He was an inspirational leader who could encourage people with his talk. The club won two First Division titles, two Premier League titles, three FA Cups, two League Cups, and one European Cup Winners' Cup during his captaincy. During his era, he led the club from the front and exemplified great captaincy qualities.
