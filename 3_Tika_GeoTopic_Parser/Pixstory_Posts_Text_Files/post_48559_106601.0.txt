Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
–Matthew 5-7:27, King James Version

But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!
–Galatians 5:22, New Living Translation

Jesus, many times, said that we should be kind to one another and love one another as Christ loved us. He told the first disciples that the world would know they were Christians by the way the loved other people. Jesus fed the poor, healed the sick, and ministered to the people who were considered society’s outcasts. Kindness is one of the greatest commands for a Christian.

While I can't talk about other religions, Christianity is founded on the basis of kindness. Unfortunately, people use religion to create chaos and fear but I firmly believe, religion is not responsible for that, people are. Many Christians are persecuted each year in different parts of the world, yet they don't leave their kindness behind.
