Mother's Day festivities have been cancelled in Sydney schools because they are simply not inclusive in 2022. Several educational and childcare facilities have proposed renaming the event to make it more inclusive. 

Perth Now reported that, this week, a Montessori school in Sydney elected to hold a "parents and caregivers' morning tea" instead of the customary matriarchal day. 

Another East Coast preschool followed in similar footsteps, naming its annual celebration "family day brunch." 

It comes after Early Childhood Australia sent educators a Rainbow Families leaflet explaining how to integrate diverse families on Mother's Day and Father's Day.

“We know Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are important days to celebrate, but they can be tricky for children from diverse families,” the notice read.
It went on to say the days could “present some challenges” for families that did not have a mother or a father.

“Schools can be supportive of all families by honouring how individual families choose to celebrate the day,” it said. It also advised them to allow kids to make a gift for a “special adult” — and not necessarily for a mother or father.

“Avoid gender stereotypes in children’s crafts. Steer away from cards with flowers for mum or ties for dad,” it said.
