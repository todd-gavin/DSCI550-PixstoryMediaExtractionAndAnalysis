18th January, 2022. A giant asteroid passed through the earth. The asteroid called 
7482 (1994 PC1) measured a kilometre in width ( approximately 3, 450 feet)- making it larger than any building on earth. Scientists have known about this asteroid since 1994.  It was classified as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid due to its size and relatively close flybys of our planet. An asteroid of this size strikes Earth approximately every 600,000 years.  Closest approach  of this asteroid to Earth occurred on January 18, 2022, at 4:51 p.m. EST (21:51 UTC). This approach was the closest for this asteroid for at least the next 200 years for which astronomers have calculated its orbit. The speeding asteroid passed 1.2 million miles (1.93 million km) from Earth, or about 5.15 times the Earth-moon distance. Thatâ€™s a very safe distance!
