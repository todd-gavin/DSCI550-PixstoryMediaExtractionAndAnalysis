“The country’s telecom industry is giving an amazing gift to 130 crore Indians in the form of 5G,” said PM Narendra Modi in his inaugural speech at the India Mobile Congress launching 5G services in India. The 130 crore Indian population is known for its diversity but after speaking to some distinct individuals, I understood that there is unity in this diversity for receiving this gift and welcoming 5G networks to the country. It appears that the Indian common man is eagerly ready for the revolution and awaits the future, however there is a need for more clarity on the functionality of 5G as people are mostly curious but unaware of how things will unfold with the upcoming 5G technology. Undoubtedly, in this age of inflation 5G rates and the cost of buying new 5G smartphones would burn a whole in the pockets of indian households, but it is interesting to see that people, especially belonging to the lower income groups are ready to bear the extra cost for experiencing the 5g Technology. Some people are only appreciating 5G under the Modi influence, some on the other hand understand the severity of the situation that how it has taken years for India to introduce 5G networks and how far behind is the country lagging if compared to other developing and developed economies. All in all, Indians are welcoming the new technology to the country with open arms and open minds and hope that the fast internet speed of 5g will help them be even more effective and efficient.
