I used to avoid wearing baggy jeans as I am too skinny and I didn t find them that pleasing on my body but once you start wearing them there is no going back I once tried to pair it up with a white shirt and it really turned out to be a great fit Baggy jeans are way too comfortable that I can wear them anyday over anything else
