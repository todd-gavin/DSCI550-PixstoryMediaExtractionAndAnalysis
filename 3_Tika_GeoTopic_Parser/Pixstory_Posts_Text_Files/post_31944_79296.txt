Aaron Ramsey left Juventus in the January transfer window to join Rangers on loan until the end of the season However Fabrizio Romano has revealed that the year old could still return to Turin in the summer Speaking on his personal Twitter account on the th of February Romano revealed that Rangers don t have an option to buy the former Arsenal man Instead they will have the first option on any permanent deal but it is possible that Ramsey could start next season back at Juventus This would be a nightmare situation for the Old Lady and Ramsey and a clean break is needed for both parties Ramsey s move to Juve hasn t worked and he has a chance at Rangers to prove why he is still a top class player You would think that if he can perform to a high level Ramsey might earn himself a permanent move away from Turin However the possibility remains that Ramsey could end up back at Juve it all depends on the player If he stays fit and helps the Gers achieve all of their targets this season then Ramsey s time at Juve should be over However if he suffers an injury or doesn t find his form I do worry about him and it is possible that no club would take him on So these next few months are going to be crucial for both Ramsey and Juventus who you would think will be praying that the Welshman gets back to his best so that he can finally leave Italy permanently Ramsey has the talent we all know that and it is now up to him to show his skill and earn that permanent move away from Juventus
