It might be on many people’s bucket list, but attending a World Cup isn’t a cheap vacation at the best of times. No matter where it is held, high demand pushes up prices to levels that would put off many potential visitors.
But with limited accommodation and a lack of alternatives to flying into Doha, plenty of fans will be priced out of attending the Qatar World Cup.
The current economic climate only adds to those difficulties. The Qatari riyal is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which is good for Americans, but not so great for everyone else.
Polish financial services firm Conotoxia says that not only are the ticket prices the most expensive ever, but travel and accommodation are also sky-high.
The cost of matchday tickets is the least of fans worries. Locals can get discount tickets, but for everyone else, group stage tickets cost between $70 and $220, and knockout matches between $600 and $1,600. Tickets are currently sold-out for most matches apart from a couple of group games.
Far fewer tickets are available for Qatar 2022 than will be available for United 2026. That’s because Qatar’s stadiums are close to the smallest allowed by FIFA’s criteria, with all but two stadiums having capacities of 45,000 or below. The stadiums in the USA are mainly huge American football stadiums with capacities of generally around 70,000, although some smaller stadiums are being used in Canada and Mexico.
That said, even with these smaller stadiums, the World Cup is going to push Qatar’s accommodation to the limit, with cruise ships being brought in to house visitors.
Conotoxia estimates that the cheapest a two-person 10-day trip for the group stages would cost is around $6,000. That’s based on flights from New York costing $1,600 each, $600 spent on tickets, around $1,000 spent on accommodation, $600 on car rental and $600 on food and drink.
