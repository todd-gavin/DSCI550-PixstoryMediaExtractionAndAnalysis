The reign of Elizabeth II has ended, and the pictures of the longest-ruling monarch are left behind.
On Thursday, at Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, Elizabeth II died at 96.
Elizabeth's life was the concoction of both privilege and sacrifice; many criticised the earlier but respected the latter.
She was never born to be a queen, but her destiny was planned in another way.
Born on April 22, 1926, 17 Bruton Street, the London home of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore, her maternal grandparentsâ€”she was third in line to the throne."
The precedence went to her uncle Edward, the Prince of Wales.
She had little prospect of acceding to the throne, but her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated his crown and Elizabeth's father, George VI, became the king giving the path to her to become the next heir.
After the coronation of her father, little Elizabeth wrote to his father, saying, "To Mummy and Papa In Memory of Their Coronation From Lilibet by Herself. I thought it all wonderful, and I expect the Abbey did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort of haze of wonder as Papa was crowned, at least I thought so."
Since Elizabeth had no brother, she took the throne and became the queen after her father's death in the year 1952.
Embarking on a new journey, the queen didn't know she would be the longest ruling monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria's record of 64 years.
