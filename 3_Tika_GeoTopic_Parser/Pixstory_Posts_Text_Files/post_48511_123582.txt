Mashiach or Messiah in English is a Hebrew term that means the same thing So while the Bible uses it both ways Christ is more of a title than a name The Bible for example frequently refers to Jesus as Jesus Christ just as we do in modern language see Matthew Mark John Acts Romans etc However it also refers to Jesus as the Christ which means anointed one or Messiah When Jesus asked His disciples who they believed He was Who do you think I am Peter said You are the Christ the Son of the living God Matthew And He Jesus rebuking them forbade them from speaking for they realised He was the Christ Luke As a result Jesus Christ unites His name Jesus with His title Christ resulting in Jesus Christ the Anointed One or Jesus Christ the Chosen One As the chosen anointed Son of God Jesus is His personal name as told to Mary by the angel Gabriel Luke and Christ is His title
