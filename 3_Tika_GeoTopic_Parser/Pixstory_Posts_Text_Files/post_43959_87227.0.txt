The talented full-back has been out since mid-January due to a serious health scare, but he is making good progress in his recovery.
Alphonso Davies is back in training for Bayern Munich after missing two months due to a heart condition, and manager Julian Nagelsmann has set a date for the Canada international's return.
Davies has yet to play a competitive minute for Bayern in 2022, thanks to a positive Covid-19 test in early January, which was followed by an even more concerning health issue.
The 21-year-old was diagnosed with mild myocarditis, and the club has been closely monitoring his recovery since.
Davies was once again ruled out of Bayern's match against Hoffenheim on Saturday, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
The following day, however, the club released a video of the Canada international in training, with the caption: "Guess who's back, back again, PHONZY'S BACK, in training."
Davies has only resumed light training for the time being, but his heart inflammation has subsided enough for him to consider a return to action in the near future.
Nagelsmann provides a cheerful update
Bayern's medical staff re-examined Davies before he returned to training, and Nagelsmann says his outlook has improved significantly.
"The fluid from the pericardium is gone. We are happy about that and hope that he will come back soon," the German told reporters.
Pressed on when he could be available for selection again, Nagelsmann replied: "Still missing for two, three to around four weeks."
While Davies could return to the field in April, Bayern could also benefit from the return of Leon Goretzka, who has been out for a long time due to a knee injury.
"Leon is feeling strong again, he will be partially integrated into team training again on Tuesday," Nagelsmann added on the midfielder.
