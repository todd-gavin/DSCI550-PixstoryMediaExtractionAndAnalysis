According to a new study, giving what was formerly thought to be little more than a psychedelic "party drug" to persons suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder can drastically improve the effectiveness of therapy. The claim was made Tuesday at a virtual symposium by researchers from the University of California. The patients were given 120 mg of MDMA, Molly or Ecstasy before undergoing an eight hour PTSD therapy session for the study. Over the period of two months, this was done three times. 

MDMA first gained popularity as a staple at dance parties, with users saying that it causes exhilaration and greater socialisation. Scientists are now optimistic that it will help PTSD patients recover more quickly. "MDMA is really interesting because it's an empathogen, " Jennifer Mitchell, a neurology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and the study's primary investigator, announced this at the American Chemical Society's spring meeting. 

Two months after their last therapy, a whopping two-thirds of participants no longer met the definition for PTSD, according to the findings of their medical trial. The researchers hypothesized that the medicine would allow patients to communicate more openly with their therapists, allowing treatment to be more effective. More study is still needed, particularly in terms of tracking patients over time to establish their sustained health and well-being. 

Does it mean that Ecstasy could soon be prescribed by doctors to treat a range of anxiety disorders including PTSD?
