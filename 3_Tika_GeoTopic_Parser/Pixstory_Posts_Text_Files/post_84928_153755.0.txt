Ligue 1 2022/23: On Sunday October 9 Clermont is set to take on Auxerre in Ligue 1 at the Stade Gabriel Montpied. This is a mid table encounter as Clermont Foot is placed 9th with 13 points and Auxerre is placed 14th with 8 points. 
Clermont had a successful last weekend with a 3-1 victory over Ajaccio and registered their fourth win of the season with two of their three goals coming after the 89th minute. 
Pascal Gastien is hopeful about having a better league campaign this year, with his side currently ninth in the table with 13 points, after having a steady start to their second season in Ligue 1.
Auxerre are having a bad time now as they registered their last win in late August against Strasbourg by 1-0. Last weekend they drew against Brest which broke their four match losing streak. 
It was a tough game for Jean-Marc Furlan's side, as it became difficult for them when Julian Jeanvier was dismissed in the 52nd minute, before Islam Slimani gave the opposition the lead, but M'Baye Niang equalised the score for his side with a late successful penalty.

Match prediction:- Clermont 2-0 Auxerre
With respect to the current form of both the teams it's pretty well clear that Clermont have the edge. Auxerre have a weak defence which might be their biggest reason to concede more than one goal. Clermont will also be having their home advantage. These makes it tough to see Auxerre win this weekend.
