There are only days until the release of the movie I m of course talking about the Barbie movie Earlier this summer we were blessed with paparazzi pictures showing us a sneak peek of what to expect from the movie Buuuut now we re finding out those pictures were absolutely humiliating for Margot Which like what It literally brought so much hype press to the movie Don t kill the vibe Margot went on the Tonight Show and revealed what she actually thought of them I can t tell you how mortified we were she said We look like we re laughing and having fun but we re dying on the inside I was like This is the most humiliating moment of my life I knew that we had some exteriors to shoot in LA I knew once you re doing exteriors you re gonna get papped There s probably going to be a little crowd of people who are going to take notice because you know we stand out a little in those outfits But we hope she knows just how excited those outfits made everyone feel Because ultimately what is a Barbie movie without Barbie outfits Can t wait for July
