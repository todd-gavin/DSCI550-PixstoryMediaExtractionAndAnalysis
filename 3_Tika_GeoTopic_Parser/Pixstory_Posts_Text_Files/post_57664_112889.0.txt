The prophecy made by Orwell seems to have become a truth today.
The idea is relevant today as the government of America and the world constantly dominate people in the name of democracy. But unfortunately, the idea of freedom is so corrupt and sometimes manipulated that the current society reflects the same values of the dystopian world that 1984 created.

Whatever is happening around couldn't be ignored, although "ignorance is strength", of course, as the novel shows.
When we begin to enumerate and compare the happenings and incidents of the present time with the one that Orwell prophesied, it would not seem to contradict each other at any point.

To speak of women's rights or the constant fuss of gun violence in America, all pictures would resemble the exact images Orwell concocted in '1984'. 
The way people in power have created their dominance to support ideas that don't even validate the principles of democracy.

Orwell wrote that "who controls the present will control the past." He meant that history would be rewritten or altered to validate and support the views of the one controlling the world today.
The truth, what is being done is so similar. The government in power does everything to maintain its influence over the country's people, even if it is to make false statements like Trump.
He once claimed that more people than that Obama's attended his inaugural address; this he did to exert more influence on people and make himself powerful.

Even the language is manipulated and created to make things work for the government. It seems bizarre how well the current time manifests the dystopian world of 1984.
