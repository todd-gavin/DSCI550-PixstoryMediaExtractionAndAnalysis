We humans have always professed to love these animals. Unfortunately, our love lasts only till the animal is able to work for us. As soon as he gets sick or old or injured, our love for it ends. Because mankind is a selfish race. And only loves somebody till he is hale, hearty, and useful. No sooner does a utility of an animal end than he is disposed to either off be killed by the butcher or to fend for itself on the roads or in the Wilderness. On its part animals have never been unkind to humans, examples of Alidrocles and the lion, Chetak, and Rana Pratap are some of the shining instances that have proved that animals are not beasts that they are portrayed to be.
