USA and Brazil took on each other in Matchday of the ongoing U Women s World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium It was one of the most anticipated matches of the tournament as two favourites were facing each other and it did not disappoint the fans The encounter ended in a draw with both the teams sharing a point each but the scoreline itself does not do justice to the intensity of this match It was an end to end match with both teams having almost equal chances of scoring goals but if we do have to pick a side it was the United States of America who got the better of Brazil After winning the first match against India by a massive margin the confidence level of USA players was at an all time high and it could be seen clearly in this match All of their attacks were extremely deadly Brazil were lucky not to concede goals Unfortunately USA s attackers were not clinical enough in the final third Nicollette Kiorpes gave USA the lead in the rd minute following an assist from their right winger O P Gamero Gamero was undoubtedly the best performer in tonight s match She was all over the pitch and totally dominated the Brazilian defenders She was however not lucky enough to score a goal Brazil however were quick enough to get the equaliser as they did so just minutes after conceding Chaves Firmino s long ranger attempt was ill judged by USA s goalkeeper Safradin and she was beaten at the first bar She should have done better with that shot USA got a couple of chances in the second half but as mentioned earlier they could not convert them As it now stands USA are on the top of Group A table but they have the same points as Brazil
