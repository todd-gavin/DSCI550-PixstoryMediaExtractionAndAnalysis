DOES GYM IS GOOD FOR FOOTBALLERS With lower body fat and greater muscle mass you ll be stronger and faster on the football field A strong lower body is good for shooting jumping and turning Upper body strength is necessary for shielding the ball and also contributes to your overall strength and energy Does footballers lift heavy Overall footballers lift weights throughout the season but usually not with the intention of bulking up For some players this is important and they often build muscle in their own time in the off season So lastly the conclusion is every football player can do gym but not for the intension of bluking because if they bulked up they have less flexibility and their game will be affected Tell me your opinion in notes Thankyou
