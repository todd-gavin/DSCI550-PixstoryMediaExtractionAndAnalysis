Mikel Arteta's side are in desperate need of a striker in the summer. Owing to this, they are looking at Armando Broja as a potential option at the club. 

Armando Broja joined Southampton on loan in the summer. Since then, the striker has scored 8 goals in 24 games for the Saints. He recently played a crucial part as his team beat Tottenham Hotspur in a 2-3 win away from home. 

The 20-year old Albanian is a part of Chelsea Football Club. The striker has been a part of the club since his youth days and has represented the U18, U19, and U23 sides of the Blues. 

Broja was sent out to the Dutch club Vitesse for the 2020/21 season. In his loan move, the Albanian scored 11 goals from 34 appearances for the Eredivisie club. The striker has also made a substitute appearance for Chelsea in the 2019/20 season. 

As per reports, Southampton are attempting to sign Armando Broja on a permanent deal before the end of the season. But Chelsea may not be willing to sell the striker as per Thomas Tuchel. 


What did Thomas Tuchel say about Broja? 


The Chelsea manager was asked about Armando Broja's form at Southampton and Tuchel gave a very positive response. He said "Armando is getting better and better. He is a very unique player with very unique strengths: speed, strong, robust and a goal scorer"

Thomas Tuchel also added "He is our player, he is doing good. But at the same time, it is only halfway through the season, so he needs to continue to improve and make his statement at Southampton."

Arsenal are also looking to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Alexander Isak in the summer window as they look to bolster their squad. Hence, it has to be seen what changes take place at the North London side when the transfer window reopens.
