Many pregnant women have no symptoms other than a missed period, which could be confused with perimenopause. If you’re in perimenopause and are having irregular periods, pregnancy should be considered.
Pregnancy tests on women up to age 52 or even 60 if menopause has not been confirmed and no form of contraception has been used. This is especially important for patients with abdominal symptoms, which could be a sign of a life-threatening tubal pregnancy.
Denying or ignoring possible pregnancy can delay medical care, which could be risky. 
Both the risk of miscarriage and having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality increase with age. Pregnancy can be so far out of patients’ minds that they seek care further along than you’d normally see
