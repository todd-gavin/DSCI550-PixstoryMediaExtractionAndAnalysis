If I start by introducing myself as the meaning of my name then it will go like , "Hey, I'm a flower ". As just as the name suggests, I'm a delicate person who cares a lot about every little thing that means something to me. I have a reticent nature which sometimes creates problems for me but nevertheless, that is how I like to be. 

If someone asks me about that one thing that would always make me happy and something I'll always be up for would be to be around animals. I have a penchant for adopting animals. The fact that they can't speak makes me sad because if that would have been the case then I bet I would have had more dog as friends than humans (which is still kind of true). As of now also, I do my little bit to make their life better like feeding them daily, fostering them when needed, medicating them but it's my dream to have a shelter of my own so that I can help them on a larger scale .

I'm an avid cook. Cooking is just therapeutic for me. I'd love to have a restaurant of my own where I'd serve classic vegan food .
Also, I'm a voracious reader. Recently only I discovered my love for reading and I've been a lot better person since then.
