China has managed to defeat one of the favourites in their first match of the U-17 Women's World Cup this year. China throughout the game played with a low block and waited to counter attack. Mexico dominated on the ball but they just couldn't find the finish. They had 70% possesion throughout the game but just couldn't finish their chances. The first big one came at the 35th minute when they were awarded a penalty after a VAR review by the referee. Maribel Flores managed to hit the crossbar from the spot. Then came chance upon chance which was wasted. The first half went goalless but the right 4 minutes after the start of the second half, China were awarded a penalty which was converted by Qiao Ruiqi. Yu Xingyue gave China the second goal at the 90th minute.Â  Katherin Guijarro finally scored a consolation goal for Mexico at 90+3 minutes. The runners up of the 2018 U-17 Women's World Cup were left in a shock by the defeat and the players of China were thrilled to secure this win.
