After being longlisted for the Commonwealth Short Story Prize in 2018, my regret about writing fiction sporadically deepened. A craft is like a sword, its brilliance lost unless scrupulously honed. In 2020, my debut crime novella 'Murders in Kolkata 26' was published by Juggernaut Books and well received. In 2021, I wrote very little, focusing more on polishing old work that I had never shown or submitted for publication. It was a hopelessly meagre lot. 2022 opened with two back-to-back international acceptances: from #Kansas State University's #Touchstone Literary Magazine and the Singapore-based #Kitaab. 
While I am working with the Touchstone team towards publication, Kitaab's editor just let me know that my short story 'Rafin' will be available to read for free for the coming week as the Editor's Pick of the Week.
Honoured. Humbled. 
No, it's not easy to publish literary fiction internationally just because one's a journalist. And yes, persistence pays, there's no writing if one doesn't write enough and rewrite and agonise over it and write more. For a writer, there can be no writing less. 
Do have a read.
