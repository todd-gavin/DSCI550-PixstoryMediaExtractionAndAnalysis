* Keane Lewis-Potter

After scoring 12 goals and assisting 3 times  with Hull city in the Championship, a lot of premier league teams including West Ham and Everton were circling around to bring them to the premier league, and he did move to the premier league team in the form of Brentford. You should be really excited to see him this season since he was dubbed as the next Jarrod Bowen, and we have seen what Bowen is capable of.

* Anthony Gordon

After a Breakthrough season in the premier league, all doors are open for young Anthony to make his mark with Everton. He was arguably Everton’s best player in their underwhelming last season, scoring 4 times and assisting another 2 goals. He was confident with the ball, great at crossing and set pieces, also pressuring the ball well. With Richarlison’s exit, Gordon would be able to play in his natural LW position with Lampard’s new attacking tactics.

* Nathan Patterson

Anthony Gordon’s team mate Nathan is also one to look out for. He made the record breaking move from Rangers to Everton in January but only played 45 Minutes last season before getting injured for the rest of the season. Lampard chose to not play him since it was difficult to integrate him to the squad by replacing Captain Seamus Coleman. He was very impressive on international duties with Scotland. He will be getting his chance this season since Coleman is out injured and Nathan has recovered completely and been training really well in America.

* James Garner

The highly rated Manchester United midfielder has to be one of the most exciting young players this season, He was consistent and impressive throughout his loan with Nottingham Forest last season helping them secure promotion while scoring 4 and assisting 8 respectively. He would show his potential this season provided that the dutch manager Erik Ten Hag gives him the game time.
