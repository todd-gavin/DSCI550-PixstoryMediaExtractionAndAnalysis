The FIFA World Cup is not just an event, but it is more a spectacle and a festival. Hence, football fans wait for four years to get absorbed in this month-long tournament. 

But the 2022 edition of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar might not be the best one! Why not? Because there has been a lot of controversies that have surrounded the event. 

What has gone wrong? 

1) Corruption

As per multiple reports, FIFA awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar on a corrupt deal. Sepp Blatter, the former FIFA president was the one who awarded the World Cup to Qatar. But just a few months later, Blatter was removed from his position on the accounts of corruption!


2) Slavery Allegations

Corruption is one thing, but outright ignorance of human rights is probably the worst thing. Qatar has had to build new stadiums and infrastructure for the FIFA World Cup. For this, they hired a lot of migrant workers from South East Asia. 

But as per reports, these workers have been working in torrid conditions. Living arrangements have more than 30 workers in a single room and the worker colonies are also not up to the mark!

To add to this, there have been rumours circulation that has indicated that the workers are not being paid properly, which accounts for slavery. 


3) Death of the Workers! 

Hundreds of workers have reportedly died during the construction of stadiums and other infrastructure leading to the World Cup. The causes of death have been improper working conditions and working for an extended amount of time in quite a few cases. 

Hence, these reasons are enough to show why the 2022 World Cup should be boycotted because, at the end of the day, humanity would always triumph over football or any other sport!
