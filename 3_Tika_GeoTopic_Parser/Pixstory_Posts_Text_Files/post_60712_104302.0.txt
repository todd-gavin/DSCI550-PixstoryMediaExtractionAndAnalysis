People tell me stop watching cartoons, but they have no idea what they are missing.
First of all it's not cartoon, the story plot is better than majority of movies. The animations now a days are really smooth and fun to watch.

Anime in general is exciting to watch, but if we add sports to it then the excitement just reach another level.

Some of my favorite sports anime are: 
1. Haikyuu!!
2. Ace of Diamond
3. Kuroko's Basketball
4. Hajime no Ippo

I also enjoy watching free! and other sports anime, but those 4 above are my go to sports anime.
The development of character in sports anime in general is well paced and feels real.
I know the story is same, trying to win at High school level. But the journey is what matters
Don't take my word for it give it a try.
