According to a new national NBC News poll done after the leak of a draft opinion that would strike down the constitutional right to abortion; nearly two-thirds of Americans reject the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. 
‌
‌NBC has also reported that Abortion now remains on the topmost priority list in America. With the political concerns, Americans are not even satisfied with Joe Biden and his administration. Still, Democrats are tied with Republicans in the poll’s question of which party should control Congress.  
‌
‌According to the poll, a combined 60 per cent of Americans say abortion should be either always legal (37 per cent) or legal most of the time (23 per cent) — the highest share believing it should be legal on this question, which dates back to 2003. 
‌
‌The NBC News poll also finds 39 per cent of Americans approving of President Biden’s job as president, versus 56 per cent who say they disapprove.
‌
‌We have cost of living is another major issue in America followed by jobs and the economy; voting rights and election integrity; immigration and the border; and climate change. 
‌
‌The poll has also found that the percentage of Americans supporting same-sex marriage has leapt to a new all-time high in the survey, with 65 per cent favouring it (up from 60 per cent in 2017); 33 per cent say American society has gone too far in accepting transgender people; 35 per cent say society hasn’t gone far enough, and 25 per cent say it’s reached a reasonable balance; and the net positive/negative rating for attitudes about the U.S. Supreme Court (36 positives, 35 per cent negative) is at its lowest point in the poll since 1992.
