As the seven-phased assembly elections across five states came to an end on Monday, the exit polls predicted a clear win for the BJP and its allied parties in Uttar Pradesh but with a reduced majority.
According to most of the agencies conducting exit polls this time, the AAP is expected to unseat Congress in Punjab while there will be a tight race between the Congress and BJP in Uttarakhand and Goa. In Manipur, the saffron party, along with its allies — the NPP, NPF and JD(U) — will have an edge over the Congress, showed the exit polls.
