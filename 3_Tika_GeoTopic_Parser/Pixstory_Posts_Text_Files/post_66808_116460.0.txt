Dhanusha, is a prominent actor from India, who has starred in a number of movies, and if that wasn't enough, he also has a huge hit song, that teens love called "Why this kolaveri di"

Dhanush is a phenomenal actor who has displayed his acting chops in many great movies. I happened to come across one of his movies, suggested by my Indian friend, called "Meri taqat, Mera faisla". And he was just brilliant in it, I loved it from start to finish. 

It will be great to watch Dhanus flex his acting chops in front of people's favorite Chris Evans
