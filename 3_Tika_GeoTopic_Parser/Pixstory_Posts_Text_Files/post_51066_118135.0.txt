1 1/2 tsp Soy sauce, dark 
2 tbsp Corn starch
1/4 tsp Pepper, ground
1 Sesame seeds
1 tbsp Sugar
2 tbsp Rice vinegar
1 tbsp Sesame oil
2 servings Ramen noodle cakes, dry instant
1 cup Water

I cook the noodles in a pot with water until they’re half-cooked and still very chewy.

I drain out the water to keep the noodles chewy and so they don’t overcook.

The sauce is really simple and so easy to adjust according to your preference in terms of taste! Room temperature water or vegetable broth
Soy sauce adjust according to desired taste
Dark soy sauce , optional for colour
Corn starch
Maple syrup , sugar, or other liquid sweetener, adjust according to desired sweetness
Rice vinegar or lemon juice, adjust according to desired sourness
Ground pepper
Chili garlic sauce or other hot sauce, optional for spice (see homemade chili garlic sauce recipe here)
Sesame oil

I simply heated a large non-stick pan and sautéed the tofu and mushrooms in some oil. I simply heated a large non-stick pan and sautéed the tofu and mushrooms in some oil.

I then poured in the sauce and left it to simmer over medium heat. Then mix the noodles and Mixed it all together to evenly coat in the sauce.

I topped my noodles with some chopped scallions and sesame seeds.
