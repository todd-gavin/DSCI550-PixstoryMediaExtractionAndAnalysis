Starting on July 16, 2022, at 17:00 UTC, FC Köln and Milan will square off at the RheinEnergieStadion stadium in Cologne, Germany.The contest is a Telekom Cup event.

AC Milan finally won the Italian championship last season after nearly a decade of battling, and they are adamant on regaining their former glory at all costs. They have made some excellent additions during the current transfer window, and they are keen to get things going well.

They now have a long unbeaten run going and have been scoring a ton of goals as well.

Koln, meanwhile, could only manage a seventh-place finish in the somewhat less fierce German first tier. Keep in mind that they only managed to win 14 games overall during the season, and that they consistently allowed a lot of goals to be scored.
