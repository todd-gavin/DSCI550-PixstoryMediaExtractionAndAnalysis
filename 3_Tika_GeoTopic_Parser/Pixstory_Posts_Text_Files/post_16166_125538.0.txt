Sridevi is eternally missed each day. Today is the late actress birth anniversary and on this day, everyone is immensely remembering the first lady superstar of Bollywood. While her family especially her daughters Janhvi and Khushi Kapoor are missing her little too extra. Till the actress was alive she was the shield for her kids and no matter what they achieve the void will always be there🫶🏻🫶🏻❣️

Sridevi never wanted her daughters to become actresses like her. In fact, in her recent conversation Janhvi Kapoor had said that how her mom wanted her to become doctor and not actress. But the day she learnt that a Janhvi is interested in acting she stood by her.❤️❤️‍🔥

Sridevi was the perfect mother to her daughters
Sridevi kept her daughters from the media glare and didn't much the paparazzi much exposure. In fact, there was a time when Janhvi on a fashion event insisted her mom that she would like to pose but the actress refused to do so, and she abide by it. ❤️
