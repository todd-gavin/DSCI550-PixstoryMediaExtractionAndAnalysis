As human beings we are indeed born with far more good senses to understand and feel emotions this also makes us entitled to feel others emotions and feelings Before feeling empathy towards someone it is necessary to understand what actually empathy is and why we need it So empathy is the capacity to understand or feel others emotions It is an ability to feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference that is the capacity to place oneself in another s position Although people look at empathy differently there are these three ways to classify its level and type There is affective empathy an ability to share the emotions of others here the feelings and reactions are deep rooted and visceral While on the other hand cognitive empathy is an ability to understand the emotions of others but that shouldn t be necessarily visceral like a psychologist who understands the clients emotions rationally Lastly there is emotional regulation an ability to understand empathy but to regulate one s emotions Empathy basically makes us aware of our emotions and instead it is essential because it helps us understand how others are feeling so we can respond appropriately to the situation It is typically associated with social behaviour and much research shows that greater empathy leads to more helping behaviour
