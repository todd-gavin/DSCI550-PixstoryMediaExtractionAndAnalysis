I have always been told that I am very impulsive and I react quickly to any situation, which is true. I always wanted things to be done as soon as possible because my agile being cant wait at all. But then I 
am not the only one like this, isn't it? 
I have read innumerable times that good things happen to those who wait and I am someone who can't wait. So does that mean there's nothing good in store for me, or all the achievements, all the 
happiness in my life is just a scam? Well scam or not, I do know that patience is a very strong feeling and not everyone's cup of tea. But then I also wonder, it's just the way we are; humans are born like this, they have this inbuilt propensity towards knowing everything, they hate to wait and maybe that's the reason that we want everything to be under our hands. So how can we try to be patient enough?
Over these years, what I have come to know is that patience is the little gap between your dreams and their manifestations. And with patience you need to put in your efforts so that you get what you want. Patience is all about your awareness, acceptance and allowing. When you are aware of what you want in life, when you accept the ups and downs of the process and when you allow it some time, that's when you will really get what you have wanted for a long time. Obviously being patient is not an overnight task to do, it takes time and again patience, huh but inching 
towards that goal slowly and steadily and reminding yourself daily that you only have two options to 
choose from; either anguish yourself with all the waiting or just keep on doing your work and wait for the 
good things to unravel, is what I do. When a mulberry leaf can become a silk gown, with just time, then we humans can also get whatever we want.
