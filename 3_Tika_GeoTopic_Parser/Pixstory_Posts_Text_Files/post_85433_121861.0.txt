Nothing quite compares to a warm chocolate chip cookie and a cold glass of milk. A great American treat that has made its way all around the world, this cookie is the center of attention for National Chocolate Chip Cookie Day!

Chocolate chip cookies recipes have continued to develop as an American tradition and have spread all over the world. Different variations of the recipe have grown, like making them with oatmeal to provide some additional nutrients, adding M&Ms to make “monster cookies”, or changing to white chocolate and cranberries for a unique holiday variety.

By the 1980s, the idea of eating unbaked chocolate chip cookie dough had developed. While there is some question about the health of this practice due to the raw eggs (depending on the recipe) cookie dough began appearing in other places–specifically ice cream.
