The Allman Brothers Band is widely regarded as one of the founding bands of Southern rock, despite the fact that the band has distanced themselves from the label. Dickey Betts, a guitarist, was the most outspoken about his dissatisfaction with this classification: "I believe it is restricting. I'd rather be known as a South-based progressive rock band. I'm very proud of who I am and where I came from, but the label "Southern rock" makes me cringe. I believe that labelling us as such pigeonholed us and encouraged people to expect particular forms of music from us, which I believe is unjust." Gregg Allman thought the term "Southern rock" was redundant, comparing it to saying "rock rock" because rock and roll originated in the South. 

In the early 1970s, the band was at the vanguard of the genre's appeal; their birthplace of Macon was flooded with "Southern rock" bands after the success of At Fillmore East. Regardless, the group has maintained to avoid using the phrase. "My issue is that many people identify it with rednecks, rebel flags, and a retrograde mindset. That has never been an Allman Brothers Band characteristic "Warren Haynes, a guitarist, expressed his thoughts on the subject. 

The group's music featured a lot of blues, jazz, and country influences. During the early days of the band, they all eagerly shared their record collections with one another. Betts, for example, was a fan of country music and Chuck Berry's guitar skills, but Trucks was a fan of rock and roll. The brothers were also heavily influenced by guitarist Taj Mahal and his 1968 eponymous debut album. It was this influence that led both to their discovery of their now famous slide guitar style.
