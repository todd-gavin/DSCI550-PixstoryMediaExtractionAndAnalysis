Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House of Representatives criticised Kevin McCarthy leader of Republicans in Congress for his inconsistencies on lawmakers safety These statements were made after an audio recording in McCarthy s voice was released He said that his fellow house republicans might foment further violence in the wake of the Capitol s Jan attack It was interesting to me that the leader talked about the concern that he had about his members causing danger here and at the same time complaining that we had magnetometers to keep guns off the floor of the House Pelosi said Recalling an earlier incident where Rep Madison Cawthorn was stopped at the airport a loaded gun was detected in his bag It seemed inconsistent to me especially now that one of his members was seen taking a gun into an airport I thought you were arrested for trying to take a gun on a plane I guess his member was treated differently
