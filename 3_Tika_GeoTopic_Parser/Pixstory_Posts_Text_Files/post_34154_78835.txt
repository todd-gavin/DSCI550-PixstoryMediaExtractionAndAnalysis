Marco Serra returned to public speaking for the first time after the Milan Spezia match last January won by the Ligurians at San Siro A bitter defeat for the Rossoneri who saw a regular goal disallowed due to too many whistles part of the match director who did not apply the advantage rule The understanding of his mistake was immediate, so much so that the initial protests of the Milan players were followed by words of comfort from the protagonists themselves it was a beautiful gesture but I only realized it the day afterwards because at the moment I was dazed commented Serra To the microphones of Sky Sport the race director tried to explain the episode In my head there is a priority error I concentrate on Rebic and Bastoni ready to intervene from behind and I think if he touches him do it Focusing on that I lose sight of the complete scenario and I don&#39;t notice that Messias is about to shoot So much so that as the ball arrives I remember saying to myself let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t throw it in A naive mistake but made involuntarily almost instinctively For this reason the reactions of the players from Milan were only remotely aggressive and more consoling Rebic approached me I think with the idea of strangling me Then as a man on the pitch he understood that my mistake was like his missed goal into an empty net In the locker room Florenzi was as heartbroken as I was and I Calabria embraced Theo Hernandez Brahim Diaz everyone told me to react Finally Ibra approached me Show that you are strong and react A gesture greatly appreciated by Serra himself one of the first match officials to open up to dialogue publicly not to seek justifications but to give clarifications His hope is to get back on the field as soon as possible after the words of Alfredo Trentalange the president of the AIA I found an injured person who couldn&#39;t wait to get back to refereeing
