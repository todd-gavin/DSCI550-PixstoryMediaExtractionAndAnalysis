Norwegian footballer Celin Bizet Ildhusøy’s journey with Paris Saint-Germain Féminine started in the summer of 2021. The 19-year-old forward has played four seasons with Valerenga, where she won the league, cup double, and her first call-up to the national team. As the young athlete continues to sport jersey #17 for Les Rouge et Bleu this season, follow her biography below:

Celin’s story with football began quite naturally as a child of former Pors striker Kjell Gunnar Ildhusøy: "My dad played football and just all my friends played football, and it was just like a really normal thing to do -- I was seven years old, and everyone did it," Celin says.

Born in Norway’s Frogner village with a population of about 1,200 in Sørum, the young forward’s top career highlights so far are: the signing with PSG, her move to making a home in Paris, and the anticipation for the upcoming Euro championship in the summer.

After growing up in the unforgiving cold of Frogner, where the temperature can dip to -7°C in the winter, Celin has a newfound appreciation for the sun, and hopes to be with it in the endeavours to come: "Wherever it's sunny – it's doesn't matter where."

The forward’s ideal way to celebrate a big win would be a backflip – though she is still strategizing the best way to do it. Till the right moment comes, Celin will continue to hug her teammates.
