The Umbrella Academy season has been officially renewed as the final season for the series but Netflix s plan for the show is a cause for concern Although it may be bittersweet for some The Umbrella Academy ending may be a great sign as the show can leave on a high note Netflix has not announced an episode count but there are reports that the final season will be shorter than previous seasons which could be one of the few downsides The season renewal announcement came alongside news that Umbrella Academy s showrunner Steve Blackman will partner with Netflix on several future projects Under the banner of Irish Cowboy Productions Blackman will work on shows such as an original series called Orbital and an adaptation of the popular Playstation title Horizon Zero Dawn The shorter episode length for The Umbrella Academy season can be problematic given the previous show structure that worked for seasons The show took its time interweaving separate plots revolving around its central characters culminating in a joint effort to prevent the apocalypse With a shorter season there is a risk that certain plots may be rushed With all the main cast set to return it is likely that some of the individual stories will likely either be combined or lessened Season s final episode ended leaving many questions so it ll be interesting how they are answered in a shorter season and whether some are left with a brief or ultimately lacking answer as a result The choice to end The Umbrella Academy after season might be the correct choice but they can t afford to use the same storyline tactics In previous seasons the characters would be split up for large portions of the season If season is to work they will likely need to have more joint storylines The characters have already been established individually so the focus should shift to how their relationships with each other will evolve after having survived another apocalypse The Umbrella Academy season ending saw the Umbrellas split into smaller groups and go their separate ways signaling that the plot lines in the final season will likely revolve around the separate splinter groups
