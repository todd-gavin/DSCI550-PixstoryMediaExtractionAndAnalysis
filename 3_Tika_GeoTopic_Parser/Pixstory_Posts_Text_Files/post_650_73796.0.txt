Early morning I saw a # a right to choice campaign on social media. The theme was hijab, Muslim ladies were urging others to post pictures in Hijab, insisting on the right to make a choice of “whether to or not to cover their heads”. 
U can say I live under the stone, but I seriously didn’t know what was happening in Udupi college. I consciously don’t want to watch tv news more so when locked inside the house during pandemic.
And I was worried more about the vile and graphically humiliating debate about Muslim women in some clubhouse chat room. 
Till this hit me. 
Is this decision taken by the college without any diktat from the government just another way of making the Muslim community sound like the other?
What is the logic? The college is saying they don’t want the academic centre to be a religious hub. So are they stopping their teachers from wearing Sindor, mangalsutra or any other symbol which is religious? Is no one allowed to wear a bindi or have Sikh Students been also asked not to wear the turban. 
Why are Muslims and particularly independent educated Muslim women being targeted. Some claim sleeping with a Muslim woman is equal to making seven temples others are selling them off as deals on small time apps. And educational institutions are not allowing them the freedom of choice. 
History has shown fascist want to control women. May be of the “other” first and than their own. What is it that they want to control, wombs ? What a shame for a civilised society to let it happen and watch . 
Women are thinking human beings who don’t want patronising all the time. They can take care of themselves, they can protect themselves, stand for their rights and respect. 
I wore a hijab from class 8 till my first few years in journalism. Multiple factors led to my deciding not to continue. But the choice was mine. If it is my choice not to cover my head, it has to be my choice to cover it as well.
