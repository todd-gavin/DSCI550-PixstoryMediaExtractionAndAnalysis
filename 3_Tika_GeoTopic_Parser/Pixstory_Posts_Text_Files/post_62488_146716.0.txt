There are a number of spiders that can produce venom, and depending on the species, some of them can be quite deadly. Here are the five most venomous and deadliest spiders in the world:
1. The Brazilian Wandering Spider (Phoneutria nigriventer) is one of the world's most venomous spiders. It can deliver a potent dose of neurotoxin that can kill a human within minutes.
2. The Brown Recluse (Loxosceles reclusa) is another very dangerous spider with venom that can cause serious injury or even death. Its bite can be fatal in rare cases if not treated quickly and appropriately. 
3. The North American Black Widow (Latrodectus geometricus) also has potent venom that is capable of causing severe harm to humans if they're bitten by it. In fact, in extreme cases, a black widow bites can result in seizure and even death! 
4. The Chilean Recluse (Loxosceles chilena) is yet another spider that is known to have deadly venom – though it's not as commonly encountered as some of the others on this list. 
5. The Brown Widow is another highly venomous spider that is dangerous to humans drop by drop. However, it's not that high in amount in one bite. It might not feature prominently on many people's lists, but its venom is considered to be among the most dangerous in the world due to its high potential for causing some serious symptoms, even though they aren't fatal.
