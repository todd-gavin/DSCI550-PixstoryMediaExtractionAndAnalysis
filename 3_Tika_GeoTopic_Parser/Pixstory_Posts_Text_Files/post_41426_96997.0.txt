During a press conference on Tuesday, two All England Club officials justified the "very difficult and agonising decision" to exclude players from Russia and Belarus from Wimbledon this year due to the invasion of Ukraine. 

Citing the club’s “responsibility to play our part in limiting the possibility of Wimbledon being used to justify the harm being done to others by the Russian regime,” Chief Executive Sally Bolton said, “we believe that this decision is the only viable option for Wimbledon.”

US News reported that as much as Bolton and All England Chairman Ian Hewitt praised Wimbledon's return to "normal" this year — a phrase they used several times during the media briefing, mostly in relation to COVID-19 — the questions and answers about the historic Russia policy dominated Tuesday's session with the press.

Among the prominent players affected by the ban announced last week are reigning U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who recently reached No. 1 in the rankings and is currently No. 2; No. 8 Andrey Rublev; No. 4 Aryna Sabalenka, a Wimbledon semifinalist last year; Victoria Azarenka, a former No. 1 who has won the Australian Open twice; and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the French Open runner-up last year.
