You will fine yourself , 
Lose it again , 
And then fine Something new . 😉❤️

Maybe you are supposed to travel ,🚟 😍 make conversations with strangers , and eat a meal for two without sharing your fries 🍟with anyone . Maybe , right now you are supposed to be in a relationship with no one but YOURSELF ! Enjoy new music with friends , bake for your siblings , and get on a long call with you parents . 😍❤️

Stop feeling bad for putting yourself before others . Searching for someone will slow you down ! But if it comes at your door knocking , don't reason - zone them !Being alone and being lonely is not the same thing . If you are comfortable spending time with yourself , you are prepared ! ❤️😍

You can be single with alot of romance in your Life , Which is Self love ! ❤️😍

Being Single is Ohky , if you are Ohky with it ! ❤️😍
