Chelsea clinched a comeback win against West Ham United in dramatic fashion as Kai Havertz scored an th minute winner with a late equaliser from Maxwel Cornet ruled out by VAR Cornet smashed home after a mix up at the back for Chelsea but the goal was chalked off after Jarrod Bowen was deemed to have fouled keeper Edouard Mendy in the build up The decision meant Thomas Tuchel s side secured a crucial victory after their indifferent start to the season but West Ham boss David Moyes was furious with the disallowed goal It is a scandalous decision absolutely rotten from one of the supposedly elite referees Moyes told the BBC I support a lot of the VAR stuff I actually think the goalkeeper dives he is faking an injury because he cannot get to the next one he did the same on the first goal as well The referee somehow gets that so wrong it is incredible Tuchel said Chelsea got lucky with the decision but added that it was the correct one saying that he wanted his side to build on the win We take it now step by step we will try to use this momentum Tuchel said Things are clear now we can demand full commitment to everything We are in the middle of creating this and it is not finished
