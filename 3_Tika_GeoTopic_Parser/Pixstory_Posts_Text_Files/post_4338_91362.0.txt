Life is a Rollercoaster ride filled with blind spots that are filled with curveballs which contain the unknown.  One of the keys of getting through it is staying ready and expecting the unpredictable.  Last night I had the opportunity to play 30 minutes and fought with my team for a win.  Although we came up short, I was proud of all my guys for fighting and grateful for the time on the court to showcase all the hard work and preparation I put in.  Let's get this next game. 👊🏽🙏🏽🙌🏽
