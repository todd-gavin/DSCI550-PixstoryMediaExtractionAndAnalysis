Titian and the image of women in sixteenth-century Venice the exhibition promoted by the Municipality of Milan in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna opens the calendar of artistic events in Milan The exhibition is open from February to June and is curated by Sylvia Ferino former director of the Kunsthistorisches Pinacoteca and presents over a hundred works, including paintings by Titian, many of which are on loan from Vienna, to which are added sculptures and objects such as jewels. The famous contemporaries of Titian, such as Giorgione Lotto, also narrate the image of women at that time with their works. Palma Il Vecchio and Tintoretto For Titian, women are the most important creation in the world, commented the curator, the beauty of painting means the beauty of women For me, Titian celebrates women, he admires her, he always makes her strong, individual, beautiful, and sometimes divine, I believe that women today&#39;s women should study women well as he painted them to always make themselves strong beautiful and important Titian it can be said that he was an ante litteram feminist The women portrayed are ladies of the Venetian bourgeoisie or royal figures then there are the beautiful Venetians real or presumed women portrayed half-length and highly idealized With often low-cut dresses their showing of the breast is not a symbol of ruthlessness but signifies the opening of the heart an attitude of truth and sincerity Then there are the female heroines such as Lucrezia Giuditta or Susanna who represent honor chastity, courage and sacrifice or Mary Magdalene in her phase of penance Finally, mythological figures such as Venus who is born from the sea like Venice and personifies the city admire it In the exhibition you can admire, among other works, the portrait of Eleonora Gonzaga della Rovere the Madonna with child Isabella d Este in black the Young woman with a feathered hat that comes from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg Venus Mars and Cupid
