 Of course twitter is gonna claim that he was filed because he was too opportunistic The easiest strategy in a case like this is to make sure that you put a question mark on the accuser s integrity Twitter will do anything to make sure that they get out of this unscathed They already have the world turning against them due to the Elon Musk case and this is the last thing that they might want as a budding social media platform If people lose their faith over twitter it will be catastrophic for the company as the people will turn away from the platform and seek shelter somewhere else Twitter should put out a reasonable explanation for what they are accused of doing rather than going after the whistleblower
