Where I come from in Islamic belief system mothers are important One Hadith says prophet of Islam was asked who should be most important and revered in a human beings life thrice he said mother and after that came fathers name We have been told that paradise is under mothers feet Culturally also whether we belong to any religion mothers are important and more celebrated The need to celebrate mother is more in societies like ours where women have been subjugated for centuries we celebrate mothers more as we feel they haven t gotten their due So we want to make all the right noises for mothers and very rightly so But fathers are equally important Although I am firm believer in the fact than celebrating love for your loved ones doesn t require a day but I believe we need a Father s Day we need to let our father know what they mean to us We need to thank them for their selflessness their unflinching love The provider the protectors that they are We need to recognise the pure feelings called fathers love Fathers also love their children equally but their love remains unsung While your mothers cry and laugh every time their children do so so do fathers may be they don t show it as often They love you in their silent prayers in the hidden tears in the joyous smiles in their proud looks When they celebrate your successes and have your back in your failures Fathers not only love they take it upon themselves to be our protectors our source of strength Whether it s helping their children to take that first step to being there for every firsts Your first movie first bicycle ride first football match first joy ride My husband once spend hours trying to introduce my son to sea Not give up till he enjoyed the waves My father means a world for me and vice versa and am sure your means the same to you Join the conversation and tell us about your bond with your dads Share your moments of love
