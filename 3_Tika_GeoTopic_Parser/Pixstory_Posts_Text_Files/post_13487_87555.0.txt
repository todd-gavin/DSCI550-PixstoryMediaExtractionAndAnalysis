UNAMA Deputy Director for Afghanistan warns that food insecurity and malnutrition in Afghanistan threaten "the fate of a whole generation of Afghans".

The number of people facing acute hunger has increased from 14 million in July 2021 to 23 million in March 2022.

UNAMA Deputy Director General issued a statement adding that 95% of Afghans do not have adequate access to food, a figure that stands at 100% in female-headed households.

 Poverty and hunger have forced families to "resort to disappointing measures such as skipping meals or taking on unprecedented debts."

 Hospitals are full of children suffering from malnutrition. The weight of a one-year-old baby in Afghanistan is equal to the weight of a six-month-old baby in a developed country. "Some children are unable to move due to low intensity."

Acute malnutrition rates are higher in 28 of the 34 provinces, and more than 3.5 million children are in need of nutritional support.

"Food insecurity and malnutrition remain at an all-time high and require immediate and sustained large-scale humanitarian response to prevent further deaths," UNAMA said in a statement.

On March 31, the United Nations, Britain, Germany and Qatar are scheduled to host an international conference on humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.
