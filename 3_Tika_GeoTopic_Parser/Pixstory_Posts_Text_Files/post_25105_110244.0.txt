Arsenal fans will finally breathe a sigh of relief, as the London club have signed Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City for a sum of 45 million pounds. This comes after the Brazilian striker spent six seasons at Manchester City, and was looking for a change after Erling Haalandâ€™s arrival. Jesus has signed a five-year contract with Arsenal, which runs until the summer of 2027.

Mikel Arteta could really benefit from the flexibility that Gabriel Jesus offers as an attacking forward. Pep Guardiola has shown that Jesus could be much more than an out and out striker, after deploying him on the wings on a few occasions. Mikel Arteta has generally preferred a 4-2-3-1 formation, and we may see Gabriel Jesus leading the lines for the North London club next season.

The Brazilian striker is an absolute beast when it comes to taking his chances inside the box, which makes him much of a threat as a striker. However, Arteta places deep trust in his younger players, and could deploy Eddie Nketiah as the number three. In this case, Gabriel Jesus could be used in the wide positions in the attacking trio behind the striker.

Gabriel Jesus has the pace to drift past the defenders, and has also delivered a few assists for his former club, starting from the left wing. Again, Mikel Arteta will be left with a headache, as Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe are among the players in contention for a spot out on the wings.

Nevertheless, it is a good headache to have as a manager, as the Arsenal squad depth seems to be increasing with two quick summer signings. The Gunners recently signed Porto midfielder, Fabio Vieira who has sound technical abilities with the ball at his best.
