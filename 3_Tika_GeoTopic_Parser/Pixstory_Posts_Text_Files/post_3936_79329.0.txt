Cancer have become a fear factor for many. But now a days the disease have become more common among the public. 

Throughout the process right from the beginning of diagnosing the disease we all hope that the tests become negative and results are just fine. But when suddenly things change and everything goes upside down after the news is broken that our most loved one is down with cancer. It is definitely hard for them as well as their loved ones to first process the information. The further day's are days of silence and numbness, none of us know what to say, how to deal with the situation when the news is in our mind. But eventually things get sorted and some rays of hope comes up within some days. 

This time period during the days between when we get to know the news and till when we accept it, it is really hard and difficult to face that phase, we don't know how days and time passes by at that moment. 

With an advancement of the medical and technological fields things have been much more better now. 

And anyone CAN and will be able to overcome this phase of life. 
Give yourself sometime to love your dear ones with the time you have, never take things for granted.
