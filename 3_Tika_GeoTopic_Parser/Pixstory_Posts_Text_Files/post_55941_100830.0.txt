On Jan 6 2021, a senior Trump appointee at the U.S. State Department met with two activists who had been crucial to spreading the false story that the presidential election had been stolen.

The meeting took place as trump allies were claiming that the elections machines were hacked by a foreign power and they were targeting trump to use national security establishments or even to rerun the elections.

Robert A. Destro, a law professor at the Catholic University of America then serving as an assistant secretary of state, verified to The Washington Post he met with the two men — Colorado podcaster Joe Oltmann and Michigan lawyer Matthew DePerno on Jan 6 midst the rushing wave of Trump supporters in the Capitol. 

The two men have formerly claimed to have huddled on Jan. 6 with State Department leaders, who Oltmann has said were thoughtful to the claims that a “coup” was on the way to steal the presidency from Trump even though not exposed the names.
 
 Destro’s acknowledgement is the first independent confirmation that they successfully earned the high-level audience. It is unclear whether the meeting led to any action as Destro refused to reveal it.

Destro confirmed in an email that he met with Oltmann and DePerno, now the Republican nominee for attorney general in Michigan. But Destro declined to answer other questions, including what was discussed that day, whether other officials took part and whether anyone took activity as a result.

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack has expressed interest in the origin and weaponization of false claims that elections machines were hacked. As the new revelations came this tightens the case and issues. After all, we aren't surprised at this political game.
