After another record-breaking night, Cristiano Ronaldo was seen conversing with Tom Brady on the Old Trafford pitch.
While the retired NFL quarterback watched from the stands, the Portuguese forward put his skills on show in Manchester United's 3-2 triumph over Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday.
Brady had travelled across the Atlantic to attend Manchester United's critical match against Tottenham Hotspur. And the former New England Patriots quarterback was rewarded to a spectacular performance by Ronaldo, who was at his best.
After missing last week's Manchester derby due to injury, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner scored a magnificent hat-trick to give United a 3-2 victory over Spurs. The win gives the Reds a major boost as they try to secure fourth place this season.
Ronaldo's hat-trick gave him a hat-trick for the 37-year-old on yet another record-breaking night. The Portuguese superstar equalled and then passed the record with his 805th, 806th, and 807th goals of his career, becoming the all-time leading goal scorer.
Brady, for one, will have appreciated witnessing another master of his trade in action. The seven-time Super Bowl champion tweeted ahead of the game:
"Here we go! Cristiano vs. HKane. I might fist pump if you score Harry but I’m riding with ManUtd today."

And towards the end of the game, the two got to meet and chat with one other on the Old Trafford ground, with Brady no doubt congratulating Ronaldo on the latest achievement in his glittering career.
"Tremendously happy with my first hat-trick since I came back to Old Trafford!" the soccer star wrote. "Nothing beats the feeling of being back on the pitch and help the team with goals and effort. We've proven once again that we can beat any team in any given day, as long as we work hard and stand together as one."
He added, "United! No matter what! Let's go, Devils! 🙏🏽💪🏽."
