You don't have to go to an expensive salon to have pretty feet. With a little time and effort—and a few supplies you can find at your local drugstore—you can give yourself a fabulous foot makeover at home.

What You Will Need

Non-acetone polish remover
Aromatherapy oil
Emollient moisturizer
Toenail scrub brush
Pumice stone, callus file, or emery board
Stainless steel nail nipper
A cuticle pusher or orange stick
Four pounds of food-grade paraffin wax
Double boiler or portable paraffin wax bath
Reliable candy thermometer
Pair of socks
Box of plastic cling wrap
Towels

Step 1: Remove Your Toenail Polish
Stripping nail polish allows you to inspect your toenails and look for any problems .It's best to use a non-acetone polish remover. 

Step 2: Soak Your Feet
A relaxing foot soak for 15 to 20 minutes will do wonders for your feet, whether or not they're aching. You can add aromatherapy oils to the tub of water if you choose, but it's not necessary. Use a toenail brush to gently scrub your toenails at the end of the soak.

Step 3: Trim Your Calluses and Corns
After the soak, use a pumice stone, emery board, or callus file to gently reduce corns and calluses. It may take a few trimmings before you can remove all of the hardened skin. Remember that your goal is to remove dead skin cells, not healthy tissue.

Step 4: Trim Your Toenails
Use a stainless steel nail nipper to trim your toenails. To prevent over-trimming, cut the toenails straight across. Then gently round the corners with an emery board.

Step 5: Give Yourself a Wax Treatment
A paraffin wax treatment will make your feet feel incredibly soft. Once the wax bath has begun to cool, wrap your feet in a towel to retain the therapeutic heat for a while longer.

Step 6: Moisturize and Massage Your Feet
To finish your foot spa treatment, apply an emollient moisturizer to your feet. Gently massage your feet as you apply the lotion, stretching tendons in the toe joints and the arch of your feet.
