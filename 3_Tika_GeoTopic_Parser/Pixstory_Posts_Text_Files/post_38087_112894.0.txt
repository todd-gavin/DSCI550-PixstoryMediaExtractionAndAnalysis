Chelsea are in need of a centre-back heading into the 2022/23 season. For this, the Blues have reportedly identified Juventus star Matthijs De Ligt as their prime target in this summer window.

The Blues have lost out on Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen to Real Madrid and Barcelona on free transfers respectively. Owing to this, Thomas Tuchel's side is in dire need of defensive powerhouses before the next season! 

The Todd Boehly-led ownership has reportedly Matthijs De Ligt as the possible answer to their problems. Hence Chelsea have made an official bid of £69m for the Juventus star. But this is nowhere close to the £103m release clause that the Serie A giants have placed on De Ligt. 

It is expected that Juventus would reject Chelsea's opening bid of £69m. However, a player + cash deal could be on the cards for Matthijs De Ligt. Juventus are reportedly interested in Chelsea's Christian Pulisic. Hence the American could be moving the other way in order to get De Ligt at North London. 

Juventus' CEO Maurizio Arrivabene earlier clarified that, "It is impossible to keep players when they want to leave the club" when asked about Matthijs De Ligt's situation. Hence it is very likely that the defender would be leaving the Serie A giants in the summer.
