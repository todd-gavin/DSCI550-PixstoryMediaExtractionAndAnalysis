Arsenal have enjoyed a terrific start to their Premier League campaign with four victories. The Gunners look a much more balanced side since last season and possess real quality in their side which has been clear to see in the opening fixtures. Last season the Gunners were extremely close to finishing in the top four but choked at the end, which was extremely disappointing for fans.
Arsenal have been criticised for possessing a ‘soft underbelly’ by the media and this has been evident in the last few years. When opponents exert immense pressure on them, Arsenal have tend to find it difficult to overcome and see out the tough phases in games. This seems to be an area of the game which Mikel Arteta has worked on and an improvement has been there to see this season.
The game which highlighted this best was Arsenal’s opening encounter against Crystal Palace where they successfully overcame the pressure Palace exerted on them in the second half and managed a clean sheet away from home. This would have added massive confidence to what is quite a young side. 
We will look at 3 of Arsenal’s top performers in August.
#3. Oleksandr Zinchenko
Oleksandr Zinchenko joined Arsenal this summer for a reported fee of £30 million. The player’s previous relationship with Mikel Arteta at Manchester City is said to have played a role in the player joining the North-London club. The Ukrainian has operated as a left-wing back in Arteta’s system and has made a solid start.
We have seen glimpses of what Pep Guardiola does at City with the attacking full-backs taking up positions in midfield when the team are in possession. Zinchenko has provided this option to Arsenal and has helped the team when in possession to create chances. This is extremely effective as it means the side will retain the ball better and be able to dominate possession. The 25-year-old has contributed 1 assist so far and this will only increase as the season progresses.
