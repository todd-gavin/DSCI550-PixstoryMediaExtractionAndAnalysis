Pakistani actor Saba Qamar, who worked with the late Irrfan Khan in the 2017 film Hindi Medium, says she regrets not being in touch with him after the actor's health deteriorated. Acoording to reports  Saba said, "I have that regret. After the film when his health deteriorated, I kept thinking that I will call him but I was busy with shooting and travelling so I couldn’t. Then one day I heard about him and I was devastated and shattered. That day I realised that one should avail the time they have, because that time never comes back. If you want to apologise to someone, or express your love then just do it, as that moment won’t come back. So I have that regret that I wish I had called him, spoken to him, and would have been in contact."
