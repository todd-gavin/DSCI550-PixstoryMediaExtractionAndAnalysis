Hi Everybody.....I am Isabel, an avid reader and an enthusiast of classics. I long digging deep into books and being mesmerized by stories. My favorite food is appam, a traditional Kerala styled flat bread. I rarely get to eat it though cause it's very tedious to prepare and rarely turns out perfect in my case. I crave adventure and am keen on exploring more and more of the world.
