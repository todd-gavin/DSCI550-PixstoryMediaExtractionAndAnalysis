The supporters gave a rendition of God Save the Queen at St. Mary’s after taking an
early lead. Southampton supporters teased their Liverpool counterparts by singing the
national anthem during their Premier League clash on Tuesday.

A section of fans was heard singing God Save the Queen just after days Liverpool fans
booed the song at the Finale of the FA Cup.

In addition, the club played the Sex Pistols’ version of the song at half-time as a further
joke towards their opponents.

Reds fans sparked fury after the boss echoed around Wembley Stadium while Prince
William- the president of the FA was introduced to Chelsea and Liverpool payers ahead
of their cup final clash on Saturday.

Why did Southampton fans sing God Save the Queen?

Saints fans sang the song as Liverpool find themselves in a bit of controversy stemming from the FA Cup finale. Liverpool fans were heard booing Prince William as well as the National Anthem, with Reds fans having done so numerous times over the past
decades.

Jurgen Klopp replies on this incident, “Of course, I have thoughts. The question is why
does this happen? They wouldn’t do it without a reason. The majority of our supporters
are wonderful people. Smart, go through lows and highs. They wouldn’t do it without a
reason.”

Minutes after Jurgen Klopp, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson
replied with ‘no’ when asked whether Klopp was right to say Liverpool had a reason to
boo the national anthem.

The tradition of booing the National Anthem by Liverpool is not new and is thought to
date back to the 1980s when the fans protested Thatcher’s Conservative Government
and what they perceived as a ‘managed decline’ of the city.
