Brahmastra, produced by Karan Johar and directed by Ayan Mukerji, has taken a far better than expected start at the box office, with as many as 25,000 tickets already been sold at the three national multiplex chains and the film yet to open at certain pockets across the country. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Given the advance booking numbers which are burgeoning by the hour as we type this, Brahmastra box office collection day 1 looks poised for a grand opening in the range of â‚¹22-25 crore nett, which would easily place it head and shoulders ahead of every other Bollywood movie this year while also giving a much-needed shot in the arm to the industry after the horror period it has faced of late. ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸŽ¥
