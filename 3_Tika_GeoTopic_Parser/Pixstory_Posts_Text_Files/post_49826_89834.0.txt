‌What does body bags have to do in National Mall? An incredible protest with more than 1,100 body bags -- each one representing 150 people -- was spotted on the National Mall Thursday to mark the more than 170,000 people who have died from gun violence in the U.S since the Parkland High School shooting; according to the ABC News. The bags had "Thoughts And Prayers" mocking the phrase used commonly on tragedies.
‌
‌Why isn't America hearing this cry of the country? People live in the fear of one or many more incidents in the state; as not on the country but the world suffers from weapons.
‌
‌‌The protest was under the leadership of an NGO, 'March For Our Lives that cropped up after thousands came to Washington, D.C., to mandate action in the gun violence epidemic in the wake of the Parkland shooting, which left 14 students and three staff members dead. 
‌
‌This is what a founding member of the organisation Brian Smith had to say to the 'Mashable': "We're bringing that exposure, that violence we see every day on the streets, that we see in our schools, our churches, and our malls. We are bringing it to politicians who have the luxury to ignore it," Smith said. "To get our politicians to hear us, we have to come to their streets. They won’t come to our spaces and listen to what we have to say."
‌
‌The organisation demands the Congress to create a White House senior staff position devoted to gun violence, pass universal background checks, provide a comprehensive plan on how to combat gun violence and invest in research and community-based violence intervention as per ABC News.
‌
‌March For Our Lives activists urge younger voters to analyse their representatives records on gun reform as they cast their vote considering the midterms.
