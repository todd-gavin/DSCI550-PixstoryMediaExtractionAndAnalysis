Unpaid internships are unethical College is not an easy part of life It s exhausting and keeps you busy You spend endless sleepless nights working on endless assignments And you work internships Sometimes it s the requirement of the course other times you need experience to get a job And that s when you re many times forced to do unpaid labor in the name of internships The question is how ethical is that And the answer is it is not Unpaid internship is a capitalist scheme that squeezes the vulnerable to get profit out of them College and Universities are expensive Other than student debt there are many more expenses a student has to pay And if you re working a job you re supposed to get paid for it A firm should compensate the intern for their time but unfortunately it treats interns like workers in order to reduce employee costs Companies are known to hire one intern after another perhaps in an effort to avoid paying for work that is required of them Taking advantage of the fact that a student is not experienced enough and is in desperation of getting a degree is just as unethical as paying workers less just because they re in a desperate need of money Internships should have a base payment A minimum wage that compensates kids for their work
