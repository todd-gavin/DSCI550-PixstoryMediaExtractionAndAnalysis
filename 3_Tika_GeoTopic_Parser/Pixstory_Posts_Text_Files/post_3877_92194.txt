I have often wondered why the self proclaimed progressive woman in the urban Indian setting thinks that donning the mangalsutra ornament worn by Hindu women to signify marital status is a regressive practice but the big rock on the ring finger is not only acceptable but highly coveted Be it the practice of name changing or wearing an ornament I have found merit and solace in rejecting the symbols of marital status especially as a woman However the other day as I writhed in discomfort in a public space upon being stared at continuously I wondered what I could do In the absence of a verifiable or tangible act of harassment there are few means of resistance That s when I thought of how the wedding ring could at least in some scenarios be used as a weak weapon of resistance whether or not one is actually married In no way am I suggesting that this is the answer to the myriad ways in which our privacy and sense of being is repeatedly violated both at home and in public spaces It is as helpless a stance as segregating the all women s coach in the metro Nonetheless the thought crossed my mind and was summarily dismissed
