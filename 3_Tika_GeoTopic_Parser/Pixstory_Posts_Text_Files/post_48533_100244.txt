It depends on why you re getting a tattoo It is certainly not appropriate if it is in defiance of parents Ephesians While artistic self expression is acceptable our first motivation should be to honour God in everything we do Corinthians This is attempting to honour him and draw attention to him rather than ourselves Our body is God s temple not our own Corinthians The Bible holds the body in high regard as God s masterpiece that must not be deformed Some people have permanently altered their bodies to resemble animals or aliens rather than humans who are the only ones created in his image We must question ourselves how much we can change our bodies to suit our wishes while yet maintaining the beauty of the human form as God intended Getting a tattoo as a testimony may be okay but it is important to remember that this is not the primary or most successful approach to evangelise It is in no way a replacement for sharing the gospel orally Simply because you have a Bible verse tattoo on your body does not mean you are performing the Great Commission
