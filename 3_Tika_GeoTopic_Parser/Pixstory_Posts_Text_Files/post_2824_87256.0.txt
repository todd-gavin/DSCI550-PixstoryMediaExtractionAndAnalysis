A day after the head of the International Monetary Fund said that Russia could default on its debts, Vladimir Putin's government has said just that. It could default for the first time in more than a hundred years of Russia's existence.

On Sunday, IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations were having a "severe" impact on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession.

While Russia has hoped that China could help it economically by striking deals with it on various fronts even as the West is closing its doors, China's response has been muted. Russia has admitted that after the sanctions, it hasn't been able access $300bn of its $640bn in gold and foreign exchange reserves. 

While Russia's finance minister Anton Siluanov has said that his country was willing to pay the debtors in rubles, it has not cut much ice. The ruble is down more than 45 per cent after the sanctions were announced and the Russia economy is in deep trouble. The debtors expect Russia to pay in US dollars or Euros. Not doing that would be considered a debt default. Russia in the recent past, has said that its repayment of debt depends on unfreezing of its assets abroad.

For a country that has witnessed an exodus of industry and investments after the invasion of Ukraine, it could make life even tougher. International ratings agencies are keeping a close watch on a situation that is already bad. 

For instance, one of the top rating agencies, Fitch downgraded Russia's debt for the second time in a week, noting that "a sovereign default is imminent." So, the writing is on the wall. Russia has a sovereign debt of around $500 billion, and it has to service the debt also repay portions of it. ( https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-debt-default-fitch-credit-rating-wall-street/ )

Experts say that the default could happen this week as Russia is scheduled to pay $117 million in interest payments. ( https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/14/investing/russia-economy-default/index.html )
