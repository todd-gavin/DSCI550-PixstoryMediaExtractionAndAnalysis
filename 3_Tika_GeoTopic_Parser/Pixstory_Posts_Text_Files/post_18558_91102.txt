Gian Piero Ventura returns to talk about the missed World Cup four years ago He did it first in an interview with Corriere dello Sport and then on television with Le Iene, always reiterating the same concept More than changing coaches and changing the system More than talking about the exclusion of the at the hands of Sweden something now outdated he was keen to highlight how things have not changed over the years for more than four years that I carry a pain inside And this pain Thursday with Italy&#39;s defeat against Macedonia returned as intense as four years ago In all this time I have thought a lot and spoken little I have always acknowledged my guilt for that exclusion but there have also been other responsibilities Not a team defeat but a system problem I think it is the same system as four years ago that the victory at the European Championship he only disguised It is always said that we need to start again They say from the World Cup following the one of the triumph the last one that gave joy to the Azzurri fans For the rest two missed qualifications and two eliminations in the group stage Little stuff very little The problem for Ventura is the system A delayed system without vision that led us to go out in the first round at the World Cup of and of And that requires us to think about these defeats that seem to arrive undeservedly suddenly but which have deeper roots Four years ago for everyone it was only my fault and I stepped aside Today, on the other hand, it is clear to everyone that the system is to blame And as an Italian and a fan of Italy, I am happy that Mancini is staying But now let&#39;s change the system
