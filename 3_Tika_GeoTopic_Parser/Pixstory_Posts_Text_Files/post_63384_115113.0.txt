Are you dealing with chronic acne or having random breakouts? Whatever is going on inside of your body will reflect on the outside.

If you have any sort of digestive issues or leaky gut, your skin will breakout. It is crucial to be supporting your gut with whole foods and limit processed or inflammatory foods.

Toxic products can also cause skin breakouts. Look at your cleaning products, makeup, shampoo/conditioner, body washes, and lotions / personal care products. It is crucial to
be using nontoxic products for not only acne, but also for our health in general! 

Toxic products make it hard for the liver to do its job. We need a functioning liver to detox
excess toxins and hormones out of our body.
It's also important to look for specific pore-clogging ingredients in those natural skin care products, such as coconut oil or shea butter. 

Although these ingredients are clean, they could be causing you more breakouts!
Stress. I always always say manage stress because it will impact so many health markers. 

It's also important to note that hormonal acne is a thing. I know when I see acne around my chin; my hormones are not balanced and I make sure to support that through
stress management. Breaking out before your period is common, but it's actually not normal and means there are some underlying imbalances. 

Food sensitivities can also cause ache, but it also means you need to heal your gut. Make sure you are getting 7-8 hours of sleep each night! This is crucial for not only our skin, but also for our bodies to reset.
