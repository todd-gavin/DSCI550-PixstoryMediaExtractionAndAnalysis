Spain and Bayer Leverkusen youth centre forward Iker Bravo has reportedly given Real Madrid the green light snubbing their rivals Atletico Madrid. 

Leverkusen CEO Fernando Carro said on Radio MARCA that Bravo wants to return to his home country and develop there:

"The player wants to return to Spain, but I think he is wrong and that the best thing for him would be to stay at Leverkusen and train every day with the first team and play with the under 19, we will sell him to the one who give us the best conditions"

The race between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid was open until Wednesday morning when several reliable Spanish journalists and media outlets reported that the player has chosen Los Blancos over their cross-city rivals.

Real is expected to close in on the move in the next few days which has become a one-sided race. The Spanish born and Barcelona youth product will join the Castilla and play the UEFA Youth League. 

The 17-year-old forward shows immense potential starring in 19 appearances with Bayer Leverkusen and netting 10 goals and registering 3 assists across all competition from last season.
