Could I revive within me Her symphony and song To such a deep delight twould win me That with music loud and long I would build that dome in air That sunny dome those caves of ice And all who heard should see them there And all should cry Beware Beware His flashing eyes his floating hair Weave a circle round him thrice And close your eyes with holy dread For he on honey dew hath fed And drunk the milk of Paradise Samuel Taylor Coleridge
