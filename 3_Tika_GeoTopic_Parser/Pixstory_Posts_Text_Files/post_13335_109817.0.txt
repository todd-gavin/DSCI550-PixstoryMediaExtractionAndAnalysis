China has said it will send 50 million yuan ($ 7.5 million) worth of emergency aid to earthquake victims in Paktika and Khost provinces.

The Chinese ambassador to Kabul tweeted today, quoting the Chinese Foreign Ministry, that the aid was urgent and included tents, blankets, beds and other urgently needed supplies.

He said the first batch of aid was scheduled to arrive in Afghanistan on June 27 on charter flights.
 His country will work closely with the Taliban in the next few days to expedite aid deliveries.

A number of other countries have also sent aid to earthquake victims in Afghanistan.

The Taliban say the quake killed at least 1,000 people and injured more than 1,500.
According to local sources, 1,500 houses were destroyed in 14 villages in Paktika and Khost provinces. The survivors are now homeless.

The Taliban-led government has appealed to international agencies for help.
