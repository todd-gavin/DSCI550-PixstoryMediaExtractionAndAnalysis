In many kdramas like Hye bye mama , 49 days , Black , Come back again etc . There is always a time period of 49 days after a person ' s death during  which their soul can exist in this world before going for rebirth or afterlife . Usually this period is for them to settle their grievances with mortal world and leave peacefully for the next life . 
But why specifically 49 days ? 

Korean culture is heavily influenced by Confucius and Buddhist practices . It is believed by many buddhists that  49 days is the longest time a soul can last before going into another state (rebirth)  . It is a time period between death and rebirth. Many people offer prayers during this time so the deceased can have a positive rebirth.
