Here's how you can tell if your best friend is really your best friend. And it works like this: a true friend will not make your problems go away. But they won't go away when your problems don't, which is another way of saying that a fake friend is like a shadow. Someone who follows you in the light and then vanishes in the dark. A true friend is someone who will stick around even when you're no longer fun to be around. This is also why friendship is such an important component of love in a loving and healthy relationship. Remember, Nietzsche said that what destroys most relationships is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship.Because what is friendship if not the willingness to be present when things aren't going well? That you are the person who can be relied on to stay after everyone else has left. So a true friend isn't someone who makes your problems disappear, but someone who doesn't disappear when your problems don't.
