Santa Croce Lake is a natural lake located in Belluno, Italy.

In winter 2019, Cristiano noticed the water was unusually high and the willow plants were partially submerged, creating a play of light and reflections.

Waiting for colder conditions, he captured the scene in icy stillness.

After taking the image, he was reminded of a dear friend, who had loved this place and is now no longer here, "I want to think he made me feel this feeling that I'll never forget. For this reason, this photograph is dedicated to him".

Equipmemt used: Canon EOS 6D + 100-400mm f4.5-5.6 IS USM II lens; 1/8 sec at f8; ISO 200; Lee polariser; remote control; Feisol tripod.
