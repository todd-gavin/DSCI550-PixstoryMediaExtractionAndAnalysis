2 AM is the new norm. Do you sleep 5+ hours a day? Well, you are lazy and don't have a place in the modern world.
Not my words, the people's words. Sleeping late at night and sleeping less than 5 hrs a day has become the new norm of the fast-paced urban lifestyle. And the worst part: People consider it correct.
Mates, don't let the people fool you. Prioritise your sleep. It increases your overall productivity and keeps you safe from hypertension and other physical and mental disorders. 
Remember: 1 hr of sleep equals 1 more hr of productivity in a day.
Now good night ðŸŒƒ
