Real Madrid and FC Barcelona took on each other at Santiago Bernabeu in the much anticipated El Clasico today Both teams went into the match with equal points FC Barcelona has been able to build a strong team after a long time and thus the excitement for this much was very high Things did not go in the favour of the Catalans however as they ended up losing the match For the first goal Real Madrid just tore through Barca s faulty defense on the left flank Sergio Roberto left Vinicius Jr unmarked and eyeing the opportunity Toni Kroos played the ball the to Brazilian who jolted down to Barca s box His shot was saved by Ter Stegen but Karim Benzema scored off the rebound FC Barcelona s dismantled structure in this goal tells the entire story of this match The Catalans had a wonderful opportunity to score the equalize just moments after conceding but Robert Lewandowski missed one of the easiest sitters in his career The last few days have not been the best for FC Barcelona and that has seemingly taken a toll on Robert Lewandowski The Los Blancos punished Barcelona for their missed opportunity just a few minutes later though An FC Barcelona miss pass led to a Real Madrid attack and Fede Valverde scored from a long ranger effort at the end of it The home side thus had a massive lead at halftime and the pressure was on Xavi and his men They were off to a horrible start in the second half as well Karim Benzema scored in the st minute but luckily for Barca it was offside It was after this that Xavi made some changes and we saw a spark in their gameplay Super sub Ferran Torres raised the hopes of Barca fans with his goal in the nd minute Lewandowski s assist and Ansu Fati s run for this goal were particularly praiseworthy When it just started to look like Barca might pull the second one back Eric Garcia conceded a corner in the added time which was converted and won by Rodrygo Goes nbsp This was their first loss in La Liga this season
