The 29-year-old Pharaoh refuses to discuss his contract situation at the club insisting they are focused to return to Europe next season.

Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny has maintained their main focus now is to return 
the club to Champions League action next season.

He has stepped in well since the injury suffered by Ghana International Thoma Partey during Arsenal’s 3-0 defeat at Selhurst Park on April 4.

Though he missed two subsequent defeats against Brighton & Hove Albion and Southampton since Artera preferred Albert Sambi Lokonga, he was drafted into the starting XI in the game against Chelsea where he partnered Granit Xhaka as they won 4-2 at Stamford Bridge.

Since then, Elneny has started in the 3-1 victory against Manchester United, 2-1 win against West Ham United and was also dispatched Leeds United 2-1 in their most recent fixture at the Emirates on Sunday.

“Everyone is focused on the club’s objectives to qualify for the Champions League.”

With his contract running down at the end of the season, Elneny was asked about his future in the club. “The club will speak with theplayers for contract renewals in due course.” The Egyptian replied.

So far in this season Elneny has around 11 appearances overall and played 530 minutes.

He has been selected in the starting XI in five of these appearances across their 35 fixtures and has been used as a substitute on six occasions.

In total, he has recorded two league assists this term. Last season he played 23 top-flight games and scored one goal.

Elneny returned to Arsenal in August after a loan spell at Besiktas, for whom he made 27 appearances in total, scoring one goal and providing three assists.
