On Tuesday, Australia qualified for the 2022 World Cup after defeating Peru on penalties after a hard-fought battle. In the forthcoming competition in November, they will compete in Group D against France, Denmark, and Tunisia. 

Needless to say, the outcome elicited a lot of excitement, and on-air hosts were no exception. 
The best  response was from Tony Armstrong, an ABC News Breakfast sports presenter who was present as the Socceroos clenched it. 
Truly magnificent. He jumped in glee and his happiness was apparent. There was no shame and formality.

To put things in perspective, despite playing in the 2018 World Cup, this is only Australia's sixth time qualifying in total, and qualifying for any World Cup is always competitive â€” so it's a huge moment for a big reaction.
