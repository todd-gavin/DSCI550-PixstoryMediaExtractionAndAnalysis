•Right now, two billion people live without access to basic sanitation; that’s just over a quarter of the world. Another 800 million people lack basic access to safe water.

•For women and girls, these challenges are disproportionately difficult, making it a significant hurdle for women in the world today. Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene go hand in hand, and one cannot be fully realized without the other. Together, the three are referred to as “WASH.” 

📍Why Sanitation for Women Matters❓

•The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are 17 initiatives to drastically improve the livelihood of people and the planet by 2030.Goal number 6 reads, “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.”

•According to the United Nations, “In 2016, one third of all primary schools lacked basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, affecting the education of millions of schoolchildren,but particularly girls managing menstruation, and one in four health-care facilities worldwide lacked basic water services, affecting more than 2 billion people.”

• “For women delivering a child in these health facilities, a lack of safe water can be fatal for mother and child.”

•According to FIGO, the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetrics, “An estimated eight percent of maternal deaths (and up to 15 percent in [low- and middle-income countries]) can be directly linked to unhygienic conditions during labour and birth and poor postnatal hygiene.”

•Safe water and hygiene for women can reduce the risk of infections and death for infants and mothers by up to 25 percent.Sanitation for women, safe water access, and improved hygiene saves their lives and the lives of their infants,reducing maternal and infant deaths drastically.

•Other challenges,such as absenteeism during menstruation and the spread of disease in classrooms, are also critical problems mitigated by access to basic sanitation.

“Women all over the world without access to basic sanitation and safe water struggle to keep themselves clean, especially during menstruation,” Lizzy MacRae Garvin,Life water International’s WASH Program Officer to Uganda,said.

•For girls,menstruation can mean an end to their education simply because their schools lack basic female hygiene and sanitation resources.
