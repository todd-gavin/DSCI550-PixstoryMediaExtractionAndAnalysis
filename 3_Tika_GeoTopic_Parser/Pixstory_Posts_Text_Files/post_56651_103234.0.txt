Have you turned your wildest sexual fantasy into reality?

More people than ever are playing out their saucy thoughts with threesomes, outdoor nookie and use of sex toys the most common dreams.

New research by sex toy brand sinful.co.uk found that Brits from Liverpool and Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northern England are the most likely to fulfil their bedroom desires.

But your fantasies can reveal a lot about your life.

Sexpert Kate Taylor breaks down the eight most common and explains what they mean.

You want to dominate

This is one of the most common sexual fantasies for both men and women.

If your mind often wanders into scenarios where you are bossing the bedroom, it could signal that you feel taken for granted in your relationship, or not in control of your life.

Perhaps your partner makes all the decisions at home.

You don’t feel your voice is being heard, so this fantasy lets you create a world where YOU are in charge and can give pleasure – or pain – as you wish.

You want to be dominated

Nearly 65 per cent of women fantasise about being dominated in bed, according to the Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Dreaming of being spanked or even taken “against your will” is a sign that you feel overwhelmed by responsibilities in everyday life.

You’re someone who has a lot of influence over other people, maybe more than you want, and a sexy BDSM fantasy is a chance to let go of the reins.

You might even find real sex leaves you feeling guilty or ashamed.

Having a threesome

A social psychologist discovered that the more supporting characters in your sexual fantasy, the more you have a need to be seen and recognised by the world.

Justin Lehmiller studied sexual desires for his book, Tell Me What You Want, and says if yours involve having sex with a couple, you are looking for adventure, not commitment.

If there are a lot of people, you crave admiration.

If you imagine giving pleasure, you feel you haven’t fulfilled your potential.
