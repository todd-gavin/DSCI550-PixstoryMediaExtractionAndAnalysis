According to sources who spoke to Football Insider, Burnley and Anderlecht have reached an
agreement for Josh Cullen, an ex-West Ham player. After a Monday medical, the midfielder and
the Clarets have come to an agreement on a four-year contract.

Vincent Kompany, who worked with Cullen, 26, at Anderlecht last season and is a great fan, will
be reunited with him at Burnley. As part of the sell-on clause they put in the sale to the Belgian
company in October 2020, Cullen's first club, West Ham, will earn 20% of the sum.

Cullen's price is approximately £2.5 million, which is a six-figure payment for the Londoners.

The Republic of Ireland international had a successful stay in Belgium, but his contract with
Anderlecht only has one year left.

Over the course of his two seasons at the club, he made 80 appearances, making one goal, one
assist, and even several times wore the captain's armband. Cullen, a Southend native,
progressed through West Ham's ranks but only saw action as a substitute a few times for the
Irons in the Premier League.

Before joining Anderlecht, he spent time on loan at Bradford, Bolton, and Charlton, where he
gained experience. Burnley is going through a bit of a rebuilding process after being relegated
last season.

Those funds will help Kompany as he attempts to return the Clarets to the top flight having lost
key men Wout Weghorst, Ben Mee, and James Tarkowski already this summer. The Lancashire
side have already completed five swoops this summer.

Cullen said after joining the Clarets: “The season will come around fast now. I can’t wait to get
the shirt on in some of the friendlies, and then the main event kicks off in a few weeks’ time.”
