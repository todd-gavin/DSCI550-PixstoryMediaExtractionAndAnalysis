Barcelona are reportedly set to take legal action against El Mundo. The Spanish news agency recently revealed a few details about Lionel Messi's contract with his former club. These details have made the Barça board very unhappy. 
As per El Mundo, Lionel Messi is said to have stipulated that he wanted his release clause dropped to a symbolic €10,000. To add to this, the Argentine wanted for his family and that of Luis Suarez's to be given private boxes and guarantees over the payment of deferred wages. Messi also wanted his brother Rodrigo to be paid backdated commission for his work as an agent.
The Barcelona board are not happy that these details have been made public. The club took to social media to express their displeasure. It is now expected that the club could even sue El Mundo. 
On their official webstie Barcelona stated, "In relation to the information published in El Mundo under the title 'Barca Leaks, the club's secret files', Barcelona express indignation at the intentional leaking of information that is part of a legal process. The club regrets that the media in question boasts of having 'access to a huge number of documents and emails that are part of the Barcagate investigation' when this information is yet to be shared."
“In any case, the article in question makes public documents that have nothing to do with the ongoing case and their use is an affront to the reputation and confidentiality of the club. For that reason, and with the aim of protecting Barcelona's rights, the club's legal department are studying the legal measures that need to be taken.”
It has to be seen what the court decides to do in case Barcelona go to court against El Mundo.
