Abstract Background Inflammatory dysregulation may be linked with mental health disturbances in people with Type Diabetes T D however no previous studies have examined longitudinal associations between inflammatory stress responses and mental health outcomes in T D Purpose To better understand the biological mechanisms that might predispose people with T D to poor mental health in the future Methods At baseline participants with T D participated in a laboratory stress testing study mean age years Participants underwent two mental stress tasks and blood was sampled before and up to min post stress to detect plasma interleukin IL The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and the Short Form Health Survey were completed at baseline and years later We tested associations between IL stress responses and a depression symptoms and b mental health related quality of life QoL at baseline and at follow up using linear regression analyses adjusting for age sex and body mass index BMI Results Up to participants provided follow up data In cross sectional analyses increased IL stress responses immediately post task were associated with lower mental health related quality of life B p CI adjusting for age sex and BMI In longitudinal analyses increased IL stress responses at min post task were associated with increased depressive symptoms B p CI and decreased mental health related QoL B p CI adjusting for age sex and BMI The association between the min IL response and depressive symptoms at follow up was diminished after further adjustment for physical health related QoL and baseline depressive symptoms B p CI Conclusions This study supports the link between inflammatory stress responsivity and future mental health outcomes in people with T D Further research involving a larger sample size is required Sources
