Let's talk food guilt and ways to reduce it.🍫🥯🍩🙇
When it comes to indulging in food, many of us often feel what we refer to as "food guilt," a feeling of shame that we have done something wrong.😥
Food guilt comes from a perception that certain foods are unhealthier than others- or a belief that they're off limits.🥧
These foods are often high in sugar (chocolate, ice cream, chips, etc.); Other times we have food guilt simply because we overeat.🍟🥨🥯
So what you can do with these thoughts?
How do you allow yourself to indulge while still respecting your habits.
You must instead transform your relationship with food and your body by incorporating positively.🤗
You can have a healthful relationship with food if you choose to frame certain behaviours or reactions in a positive way.🥗
In fact, an infamous study of willpower involving chocolate and radishes found that those who perceived their behavioral control as Lower (feeling guilty) were less successful at maintaining their weight.🍫
It is better to look at chocolate cake as a celebration versus eating it with a fork full of regret.🍩🧁
Here are a few tips for reframing food guilt:
1. Make foods that you like fit in to your routine. 
2. Don't weight yourself every moment of every day.
3. Plan ahead - knowing you have a solid plan to eat better automatically takes stress out of eating
4. Celebrate the little victories- with non food rewards 
5. Ask yourself 'why' - then find a solution.
6. Be aware of negative thoughts.
Remember that being kind to our bodies and minds and loving ourselves is the greatest gift that we can give.💖
Having a black and white attitude towards food doesn't work; it can actually be harmful.🍦
Each person is different, each person's diet is different, and how foods impact each person's body and mind is different.👫
Beleive in your body's ability to eat and live intuitively.❤️✨
