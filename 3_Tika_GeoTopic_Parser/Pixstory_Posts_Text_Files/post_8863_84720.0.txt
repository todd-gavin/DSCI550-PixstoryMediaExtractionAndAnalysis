Pak's Invasion of Kashmir continues......

On the morning of 25th October. there was considerable panic in the city. Batches of officials and citizens started coming to my place in a panicky condition. I told them that they need not worry as we would be able to save the town by driving out the raiders. Those who wanted to get away from Srinagar in their own cars would be provided with military patrol. I told the Governor to requisition as much transport as possible and evacuate those from the town who wanted to get away. The Chief Justice of the High Court came to see me to enquire when the High Court would shift from Srinagar to Jammu. He knew nothing about the raid. I told him of what had happened and suggested that if he so desired he could leave Srinagar. A considerable number of persons thus left the town. I held the view that in view of the situation that had arisen, people should be evacuated from Srinagar. The civilians would rather hinder than help whatever the army may decide to do for the defense of Srinagar.

The members of the National Conference wanted everybody to stay in Srinagar and condemned those who left as cowards. Batches of National Conference volunteers started stopping people from going away. Some of them deflated the tyres of the cars of the people who were going towards Banihal, others stopped the tonga drivers from taking away people from the town and adopted various other tactics for preventing people from getting away. We allowed people to leave the town as best as possible. Sheikh Abdulla also left Srinagar for Delhi on 25th October by plane. Of course we had enough troops in Srinagar for maintaining law and order in the city in any emergency.
