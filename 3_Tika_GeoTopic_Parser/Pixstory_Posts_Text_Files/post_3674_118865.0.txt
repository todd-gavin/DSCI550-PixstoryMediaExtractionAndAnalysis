Lifestyle brands and e-commerce platforms are going to deploy as much as 30% of their total advertising budget as they expect a robust growth of over 100% in terms of their sales on a year-on-year basis during the upcoming festive season.

“In terms of growth, we are going to be very aggressive this year as we are targeting 100% higher growth vis-à-vis last year during the festive season. We are currently working towards expanding our portfolio by introducing new brands and products across categories such as fashion, accessories, Indian luxury, and designer wear,” said Mohua Das Gupta, Head-Brand Marketing, Tata CLiQ Luxury.

However, Das Gupta also pointed out that Tata CLiQ Luxury will be focussing on highlighting some of their strategic categories like fashion, watches, and fine jewellery in the days ahead.

In an interaction with BestMediaInfo, Myntra’s spokesperson said, “Festive season is one of the most-awaited periods of the year, and this season in particular will be special. After muted celebrations in the past two years, everyone is excited and looking forward to a period to be happy about and to celebrate with full fanfare.”

Speaking on behalf of Myntra, the spokesperson also went on to add that the e-commerce platform is currently looking forward to not only a seasonal uptick for ethnic wear, festive wear and gifting categories, but also expects an increased sales for beauty and personal care, kids wear, footwear and home accessories with a high demand across metros, tier 1, 2 cities and even in smaller regions.

According to Shankar Prasad, Founder and CEO, Plum Goodness, “We are looking at an exponential increase in our festive sales, a glimpse of which was seen in our recent eighth birthday sale in July where we witnessed an approximately 2.5x growth. We do expect to maintain a 2.5x growth multiplier on a year-on-year basis during this festive season.”
