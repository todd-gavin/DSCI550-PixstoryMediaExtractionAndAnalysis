In a district which saw two of the Police Stations of Rajpur and Baghela located deep in the plains of Rohtas and away from the naxal stronghold of the Kaimur Hills, being attacked on the same day of 1st July 2007. Several policemen had been killed and the arms had been looted in an action of the CPI(Maoist) , which was the most planned after the Jehanabad Jail break of November 2005 in Bihar. Earlier in 2006, Sh. Akhileshwar Prasad, the SDPO of Bikramganj was killed during an encounter with the Maoists very near to the town of Bikramganj.

For a serving IPS officer to write about the success of the work carried out in a district under his policing charge is generally not expected or often done. But being the planner and a regular follower of the events as they have unfolded in the Rohtas district, I would be failing in my duty as a participative observer and worker if I do not compile what has happened in due course.  I have the account of an insider who has been watching the developments as they have unfolded. 

People associated with it or having a deep knowledge of it can have different interpretations of what happened, but as the initiator of several of the activities, I am in a position to write about what has transpired in the Rohtas Story. What has given results in Rohtas may be of not much use in other places, but the testimony of time in Rohtas has proved its vitality in dealing with the Maoist Problem. Policing with a deep understanding of the historical context and involvement of the community can create wonders. I have seen it happening in Bagaha on the Indo Nepal border and the Rohtas Story has started unfolding in its true colours.
