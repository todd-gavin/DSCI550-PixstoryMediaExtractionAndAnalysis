Most of us want to travel, but travelling with a dog is not the easiest thing to do. And we don't wanna go without them because, well, we don't leave family behind. On top of that, you just never know what kind of attitude people of certain places will have towards your puppy. But here's a few places you can take them to without worrying about that! Portland, United States Forest Park, on the outskirts of town, has approximately 110 kilometres of lush green trails where you may run, walk, or throw sticks. Amsterdam, Netherlands Many locals ride Bakfiets, a longer style bike with a front tub that fits your dog well. And by default, your pet will be able to accompany you as you travel about town. Paris, France Dogs are as welcome in Parisian boutiques and brasseries just as any other human shopper. Now that's my kinda place! Tel Aviv, Israel Walking down any street in Tel Aviv demonstrates why it is undoubtedly one of the most dog-friendly cities in the world. Every Friday, in front of the prominent Gan Meir park, an adoption fair takes place. Not bad! Geneva, Switzerland Geneva is a pretty great place to live or visit with your dog. It is located on the southern tip of Lake Geneva and is bordered by the gorgeous Alps and Jura mountains. And on top of that, the entire city is off the leash.
