The Northern Ireland protocol is the trade deal that governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and were conceded by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019.
‌
‌Northern Ireland Secretary has said that the new legislation to change post-Brexit trade arrangements will not break international law. Brandon Lewis said he was optimistic the modifications would be lawful.
‌
‌The UK government is due to publish legislation on Monday that would allow ministers to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods.
‌
‌It prevents a difficult border with the Republic of Ireland but implies inspections on some goods arriving from other parts of the UK.

Critics including the Irish government, have said any unilateral action could breach international law.

However, Mr Lewis said that when people see the law "they'll see it's focused on fixing the problems with the implementation of the protocol".

"Doing so is not only within international law but works for people across the United Kingdom and respects the EU single market," he told BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme.

Earlier, Mr Lewis told the Sunday Morning programme the UK government would also set out its legal position when introducing the legislation.

He said the legal position would "make sure people see it is within international law". Is this a hope or just meaningless words do the people and businesses?
