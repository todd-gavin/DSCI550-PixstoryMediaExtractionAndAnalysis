Pak invasion of Kashmir continues…

This, he said, had created panic and most of the men of the power house had fled from the place. He was there all alone and could see no raider: I asked the electrical engineer at Srinagar to leave immediately for Mahoora with some staff to set the power house working. He left for Mahoora at about midnight. After the dinner, as I was about to leave for my residence, the captain who had come away from the scene of fight reached the palace. 

He told us that the State forces under the command of the Dogra Chief of Staff had met the raiders near Garhi. There had been some fighting in which he was wounded and had been sent to Srinagar Military Hospital for medical attention. He gave a very optimistic account of the first clash of the State forces with the raiders and told us that they were being driven back. In the early hours of the morning I received a telephone from the electrical engineer at Mahoora as well as from the Dogra Chief of Staff. 

The Chief told me of his decision to retreat for taking up a position on the Srinagar side of Uri town, as it had not been possible to destroy the bridge situated on the Garhi side of Uri. He was confident of stopping the raiders. The electrical engineer told me that some raiders had entered the power house and it was not safe for him or his staff to remain there. 

I asked him to return to Srinagar. The power Douse was badly damaged by the raiders. On the morning of 25th October. there was considerable panic in the city. Batches of officials and citizens started coming to my. place in a panicky condition. I told them that they need not worry as we would be able to save the town by driving out the raiders.
