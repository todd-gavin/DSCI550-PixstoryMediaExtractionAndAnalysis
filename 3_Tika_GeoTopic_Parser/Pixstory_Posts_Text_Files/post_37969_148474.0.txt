Dani Alves and Cristiano Ronaldo will go down in the history books of Spanish football owing to the wonderful time that they spent at Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively. The two shared a competitive rivalry on the field, but as per the Barca defender, the duo reportedly had a scuffle at a Ballon D'Or ceremony. 
Former Barcelona defender Dani Alves recently opened up about his actual opinion of Cristiano Ronaldo. Though the Brazilian showered praises on the 5-time Ballon d'Or winner, Alves also claimed about an unnoticed scuffle between the duo. 
As per Managing Madrid, Dani Alves said, "There came a time because of the rivalry that I went up to greet him and he didn’t greet me. There was a controversy that never came out, but in the Ballon d’Or dressing room we had a ‘scuffle’, I greeted everyone and he didn’t greet me because of what Barça-Madrid was generating outside."
Dani Alves did not open about which ceremony the incident happened at, However, the Brazilian defender did indicate that everything is in the past. The wingback stated that he related more to Ronaldo than to Lionel Messi. Alves also added that he loves Cristiano Ronaldo and can now freely talk about his opinion on the Portuguese superstar now that the duo don't play for the Spanish giants. 
With both their careers winding down, their rivalry in LaLiga would surely go down in the golden chapters of the league's history!
