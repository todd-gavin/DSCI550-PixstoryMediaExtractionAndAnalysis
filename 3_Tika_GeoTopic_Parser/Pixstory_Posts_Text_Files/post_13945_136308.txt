Suicide jokes are not have never been and will never be funny If you say you want to take your own life I will take it seriously and I will help you find resources to help you because that is not something to be taken lightly If you have a minor inconvenience or are frustrated by something try saying that made me want to cry or that made me want to scream But do not go to the extreme of saying you want to take your life unless you mean it and are needing help It is not something that is funny and it is triggering for a lot of people to hear someone say that If you are struggling and need help please reach out I would love to help you find resources to help you so you don t feel like that anymore I m asking that people stop taking this topic lightly and stop making jokes about it If you make a joke about it I will ask you if you are serious and will help you find resources to get better so you don t have to feel like that anymore If you are not serious I ll ask you to change your wording and be a little more sensitive and not make jokes about such a serious topic This topic should be taken seriously and I m really upset that most people do not take it seriously and constantly make jokes about it It is never okay to make a joke about this it is never okay to tell someone to do this it is not a subject that should be taken lightly
