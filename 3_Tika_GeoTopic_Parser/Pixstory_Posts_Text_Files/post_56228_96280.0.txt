President Joe Biden declared a plan to begin bringing Ukrainians fleeing war to the U.S., addressing a promise the president made nearly a month ago to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, according to NBC News.

He endorsed legal and humanitarian migration to the people of Ukraine as soon as possible. The new plan, called Uniting for Ukraine, will require Ukrainians to have a sponsor in the U.S. who can “attest to their ability to support them,” said a senior administration official who briefed reporters. 

The Biden administration works in a way that most Ukrainians will want to seek refuge in Europe and return to their homes as soon as it is safe to do so, and therefore the U.S. does not need to provide the level of support to the war’s refugees as countries like Poland have done. 

Most Americans stand in double minds, as NATO is one of the main reasons why Putin did Ukraine's invasion. We have also done so much help to them yet the refugee crisis is a problem in the present state of America. America and many other countries like Canada as so much refugee intake such as Afghan and Ukrainian, the Visa is being halted to many. Many cannot avail spouse visas in America to those settled citizens due to the intense migration and refugee crisis. Hence America has a double mind as too many refugees can also affect the collapsed cultural distribution in the country.
