There are many plant-based sources of Omega-3, but these five stand out as the best options.
1. Algal oil: Algal oil is made from microscopic algae that have been cultivated and processed to extract their omega-3 fatty acids. These oils are high in quality and have a wide range of applications, including food, cosmetics, and medical treatments.
2. Hempseed oil: Hempseed oil is made from the seeds of the hemp plant, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids. It has a mild taste and can be used in a variety of products, such as cooking and skin care products.
3. Flaxseed oil: Flaxseed oil is another excellent plant-based source of Omega-3s. It's high in both alpha linolenic acid (omega-3 fatty acid) and gamma linolenic acid (omega-6 fatty acid), making it a valuable choice for those who want to get their daily dose of both types of fats.
4. Walnut oil: A powerhouse when it comes to containing both Omega-3s and vitamins E and B6, walnuts are one of the best sources of plant-based protein on the planet. Walnut oil is made from the nuts of the walnut tree, which are high in unsaturated fats that promote heart health and other benefits. It can be used for cooking or as a dietary supplement for people looking to increase their intake of Omega-3s. 
5. Chia seed: Another great source of Omega-3s, chia seeds are packed with nutrients and antioxidants that can help improve your overall health. They're also a good source of fiber, which can help regulate blood sugar levels and keep you feeling full throughout the day.
