When it comes to eradicating nudity and controlling peopleâ€™s sexuality, no religion has proved to be as effective as Christianity. Christian theology is designed to make you hate your own biology. One of the favourite past times of medieval church leaders in Europe was in mutilating naked statues of Greek gods and goddesses, in the name of obscenity.

Many brave Davids and Aphrodites of the classical world lost their penises and nipples to marauding Christians attacking them with hammers and chisels. Colonialism, effectively transplanted this erotophobia to its colonies, including India.

Like Greece and Rome, in India too there was a vibrant culture that accepted nudity and sex as it is, without shame or prejudice. The erotic sculptures of Khajuraho and Konark are just two examples of this ancient sex-positive tradition, which you will find all over this country.

The first time Indians became ashamed of this was with the arrival of the Christian Britishers. Along with looting and plundering, they effectively implanted a sense of shame and revulsion in our own bodies through obscenity law, the definition of which is as vague as the origins of Christianity itself, but nonetheless, provided plenty of opportunity for people to get offended, court instant fame or just engage in some plain old moral policing, depending on their mood.

If scholars in the West are still unable to get over 2000 years of cultural conditioning in exposing Christianity for what it is, despite the availability of evidence, how long do you think 200 years of Christian colonial rule will take, for many Indians, in accepting a bum as just a bum?
