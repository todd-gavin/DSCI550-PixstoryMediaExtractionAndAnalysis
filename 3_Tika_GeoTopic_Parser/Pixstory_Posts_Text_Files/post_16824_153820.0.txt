On Tuesday, October 11, viewers will be able to watch Goodbye for just Rs. 80! A source told, “Since the film’s lead, Amitabh Bachchan, turns 80 on Tuesday, the makers felt that it’ll be a great idea to sell tickets for Rs. 80 on this day. They spoke to the multiplex chains and they also felt it was a great idea. They readily came on board. The advance booking has already begun for the 11th.”
