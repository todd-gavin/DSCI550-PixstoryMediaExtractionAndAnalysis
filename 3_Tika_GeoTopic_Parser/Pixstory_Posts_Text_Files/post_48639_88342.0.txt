2012-13: 54-28 — The Knicks won over 50 games for the first time since the 1999-00 season, which was by far their best season in recent team history. Since then, they've struggled to get close to that figure, failing to win more than 40 games in the last six years.
2011-12: 36-30 — Despite two head coaches, this Knicks squad won 36 games and made the playoffs during the lockout-shortened season.
Amar'e Stoudemire and a mid-season Carmelo Anthony addition led the revived Knicks to a 42-40 record in 2010-11. For the first time in a decade, the team had a winning season.
2013-14: 37-45 – This was the start of New York's rapid decline, as they were plagued by injuries in 2013-14, which deterred them and resulted in a slew of changes, both at the head coach and in the front office.
2015-16: 32-50 — With Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis at the helm, this squad showed promise, but it still struggled to play well.
2016-17: 31-51 – Little changed the next season.
2009-10: 29-53 — The Knicks won just 29 games as they approached free agency in 2010.
2017-18: 29-53 — Prior to Porzingis' injury, the Knicks appeared to be a playoff contender. They continued to lose after that and eventually faded from view.
2014-15: 17-65 – Derek Fisher's first and only full season with the Knicks went horribly wrong, resulting in a franchise-worst record.
2018-19: 17-65 — The Knicks hit rock bottom in historic manner, resulting in a terrible season that only matched the four-year-old record.
