Having tracked developments at the site over the years I strongly feel that a systematic excavation and proper protection is urgently required If such excavation leads to the discovery of a relic stupa as suggested above the potential thereafter can only be imagined At present most people who visit Jaimanglagarh visit it for the temple or for boating and bird watching in the Kabar lake but if proper excavation sheds more light on the history of the Sin Che temple or towards an early connection with the Buddha s visit to Anguttarap the Buddhist identity of the site would also get clearly established along with the existing religious identity as a shaktipitha and that would surely serve to develop the site in the future as a famous international tourist destination To sum up one can surely envisage the development of the site as a promising ecotourism and heritage destination if arrangements are made for better accomodation and sightseeing and most importantly if scientific excavations are conducted to properly understand and establish the unique history of the region Concluded
