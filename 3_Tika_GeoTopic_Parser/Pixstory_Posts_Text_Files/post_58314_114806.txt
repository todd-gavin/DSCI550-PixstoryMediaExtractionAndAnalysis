Sequencing DNA means determining the order of the four chemical building blocks called bases that make up the DNA molecule The sequence tells scientists the kind of genetic information that is carried in a particular DNA segment For example scientists can use sequence information to determine which stretches of DNA contain genes and which stretches carry regulatory instructions turning genes on or off In addition and importantly sequence data can highlight changes in a gene that may cause disease Src National Human Genome Research Institute
