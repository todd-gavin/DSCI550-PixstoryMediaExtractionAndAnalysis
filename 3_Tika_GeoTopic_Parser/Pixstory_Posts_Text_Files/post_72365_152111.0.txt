Went to watch PONNIYIN SELVAN today. According to me it was worth watching, Superbly made. Great combination of storytelling and adaptation of the novel. Use of good cinematic ideas to move story forward.Trying to pack a lot of things in 165 minutes, but well packaged. Cinematography is also very good, especially the scenes with Aishwarya Rai (to bring out the divine beauty in her). And it was best movie about history. This is what we need in Indian film industry. Good story and great acting by Trisha Aishwarya Vikram Kathi JayamRavi everyone is give the best as they can!
