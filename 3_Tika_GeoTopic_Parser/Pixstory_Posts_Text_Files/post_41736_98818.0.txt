Australians are passionate about sport, but as families try to cut money, extracurricular activities are being cut, forcing more youngsters to wait on the sidelines. 

ABC News reported that over the last year, Australians spent about $13.5 billion on fees for participation in sport or physical exercise. 

Costs for children's involvement in sports totaled more over $3 billion, while fees for adults totaled more than $10.4 billion. In 2016, children received $2.3 billion and adults received $8.4 billion. 

According to a recent AusPlay poll, the average cost of participating in sport is almost $970 per year, with basic membership charges eating up more than half of that.

Parents are questioning investing money on their children's organised sports as fuel, grocery, and other living expenses have skyrocketed. 

According to a poll conducted by the non-profit Australian Sports Foundation in September of last year, approximately half of all clubs were experiencing membership declines owing to financial constraints. 

Tiffany Burstow, the president of the University of Southern Queensland Football Club, has witnessed the strain on the club's members.
“ I had a new family come and one of their big deciding factors on whether they were going to register their children for sport was how many away games they would have to go to because of the cost of fuel.”, she said.
