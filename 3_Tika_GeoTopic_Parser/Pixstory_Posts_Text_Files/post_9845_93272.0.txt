Don't make us take food from children that are hungry to give to children that are starving," pleads the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).
Soaring food and fuel costs, together with budget cuts in some traditional donor countries, have forced the WFP to halve the amount of food it is giving to millions of people in Yemen, Chad and Niger.
In December 2021, the UN made a record appeal for $41bn (Â£31bn) to help 273 million people this year.
As aid workers stress, these are not people who will be made a bit more comfortable by help from the UN. They are people, particularly children, who will probably die without it.

But that appeal was made before Russia invaded Ukraine. Both countries used to sell grain to the WFP.
Back then, Ukraine was a supplier, not a country in need of humanitarian assistance, as the WFP's Geneva director Annalisa Conte points out.
