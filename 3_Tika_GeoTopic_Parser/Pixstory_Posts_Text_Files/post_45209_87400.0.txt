Harry Kane speaks with Sky Sports about the progress achieved under Antonio Conte and what Tottenham can do between now and the end of the season, with their top-four hopes still alive.

Spurs have struggled for consistency under their Italian boss, and they are now in eighth place in the Premier League, six points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who have played one game more.

Kane has repeated Conte's recent assertions that Tottenham's rebuild is not a quick fix ahead of a key season run-in in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports ahead of Spurs' trip to Brighton on Wednesday.
"Obviously I still feel like we're in a process," he said. "We went two or three years challenging for trophies then we dropped off over the last couple of years. With Antonio, he's building a culture that he wants to be and wants to put us back in that place.

"The Premier League, it's such fine lines between challenging or being top four or being sixth, seventh or eighth. Every team is getting better and there are no easy games.

"Of course, the manager is working as hard as he can and the players are working. It's not a quick fix that happens overnight, it takes time and understanding. He needs to talk to the club and chairman and to see what direction we need to go as a club. We can't speak highly enough of him."

Kane was close to leaving Tottenham last summer, with Manchester City interested in signing the England captain, but the deal fell through and the 28-year-old remained loyal to the north Londoners.

If Tottenham fails to qualify for next season's Champions League, speculation about Kane's future will surely rise again, but the England captain insists that he is just concerned with the top-four competition, which begins on Wednesday night at the Amex Stadium
