Haryana is holding elections for 18 municipal councils and 28 municipalities on Sunday, with the results expected on June 22, according to officials.

The major struggle is between the state's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) coalition and the Congress, while the Aam Adam Party (AAP) is testing the waters ahead of the 2024 Haryana Assembly elections in its first civic body election.

The BJP-JJP alliance and the AAP, unlike the main opposition Congress, are campaigning on the party symbol. As independents, a large number of members of Congress have entered the contest.

In the 2019 elections, the AAP ran for 46 seats in the 90-member Assembly, but came up short with a vote share of just 0.48 percent.

Dhanpat Singh, the state election commissioner, told the media that 185 people are running for president in 456 wards across 18 municipal councils. There are 100 men and 85 women among them.

However, out of 456 wards, 15 councillors were unanimously elected, while the remaining 441 wards have 1,797 individuals running for office.
