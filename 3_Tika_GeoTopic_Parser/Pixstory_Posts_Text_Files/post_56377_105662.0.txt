Sleep paralysis is waking up without being able to move or speak. It can provoke feelings ranging from mild anxiety to outright terror. It is a phenomenon during which a person feels an existence of a supernatural malevolent being which immobilizes the person as if sitting on their chest or the foot of their bed(hallucinations)

Because hallucinations often happen at the same time as paralysis, this psychobiological knowledge feels supernatural to many people.

Sleep paralysis is a glitch in your normal sleep-wake cycle. Your mind wanders into a waking state while some of your muscles are still in a sleep-induced state of paralysis.


Your body undergoes various cycles as you sleep. The best known of these cycles is called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

During REM sleep, you’re likely to be dreaming. To prevent you from acting out your dreams, your brain discharges neurotransmitters that lock down some of your skeletal muscle groups.

The paralysis periodically prevents you from speaking or calling out. As REM sleep wanes, your brain reactivates your muscles.


Some of the common symptoms of sleep paralysis include 


The inability to move, speak or breathe properly

Hypnogogic hallucinations, or visions that happen while you’re falling asleep

Hypnopompic hallucinations, or visions that happen as you’re waking up

Auditory hallucinations, or imagining sounds.

olfactory hallucinations, or imagining smell.

A sense of heaviness or pressure on your chest

a feeling of being watched or touched, sometimes in a threatening or sexual manner

fear

You can always correct your sleeping patterns or consult a doctor if you suffer from sleep paralysis.
