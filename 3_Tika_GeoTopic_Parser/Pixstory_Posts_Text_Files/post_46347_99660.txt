I really don t remember the date but i do remember a scene I wanna share it with you all It was last day before Summer vacations It was the last period I was sitting on the corner window Seat And suddenly i heard faint sound of thunder I looked outside I saw suddenly Baarish Ka mausam A Loud Thunder My classroom got filled with Bahar Dekh Bahar dekh And Suddenly dark in the classroom My maths Teacher Asks Me To Focus On blackboard But My mind Was outside the window I whispered to my Bench Partner pointing on Her Wrist Time She said min left And the countdown begins mins left I Can t wait to go back home In rain The only thing in my mind cant wait to join summer camp cant wait to go park daily Cant wait to go to Nani house and Enjoy with cousins and many more things min left I could hear the my maths Teacher Telling us Holiday Homework kese krna h but who cares i was Knowing Krna To June last week mai he hai Suddenly A Loud Thunder Oooooooooo filled my class mins Left And My mind Was revolving Around After School today we all be doing party which simply means Gonna Have Samosa Funflips from canteen Yay Partyyyyy Two Months which for some reasons Feels like An eternity when you are a kid It feels like such a huge time gap Everyone started packing their bags The entire class Count Downs The bell Rang and It filled the Entire school with huge scream This Khushi on Face that comes once in year I really Miss My school Days Do you Tell me in notes
