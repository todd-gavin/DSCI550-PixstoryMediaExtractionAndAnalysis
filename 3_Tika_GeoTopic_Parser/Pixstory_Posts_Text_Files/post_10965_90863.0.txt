For the first time in 19 years, a whole year passed without any cross-border shelling along the Line Of Control between India and Pakistan, the result of a ceasefire agreement built on backchannel talks. Farming, schools and markets are back, and citizens now want the resumption of cross-LoC trade, bus route, development works.

Baramulla, Kashmir: Towards the end of February 2022, Fatima Begum, a 68-year-old widow who lives in Tarbal village of Gurez tehsil in the northern Kashmir district of Bandipora, began to decorate her two-storey wooden house, damaged two years ago when it was hit by artillery shells fired from Pakistan. 

Tarbal is the last Indian village of Gurez’s Bagtore sector, about 123 km north of the capital Srinagar and barely two km from the Line Of Control (LoC), the 740-km-long de facto border and military control line across Kashmir’s region. 



“There will never be any cross-border shelling again, I hope,” said Fatima.

Other residents of the village were busy with routine chores. Children played in the meadows framed by snow-capped peaks. The rattle of gunfire, which had in the past severely damaged six houses and a mosque in Tarbal, had fallen silent.
