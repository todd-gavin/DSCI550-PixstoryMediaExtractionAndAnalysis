Robert Downey Jr came close to quitting the Marvel Cinematic Universe on one major occasion. After the success of Iron Man 3 in 2013, and without a contract in place for future Avengers movies, Downey staged a renegotiation that partly played out in the public.
The actor said in an interview that Marvel was ‘pissed’ that he ended up making $50 million on the first Avengers film, and hinted that he might be done with the MCU if it wasn’t worth his while. This happened at a time when most major Marvel actors were said to be displeased with what was being offered to them.
