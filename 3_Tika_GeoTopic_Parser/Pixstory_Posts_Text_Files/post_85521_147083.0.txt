The world's largest museum dedicated to Harappan culture will soon open in Rakhigarhi, Haryana, to display artefacts from the Indus Valley that date back roughly 5,000 years. Between 2600 and 1900 BC, the settlement of Rakhigarhi was a part of the Indus Valley Civilization. A hamlet in Haryana's Hisar district, Rakhigarhi is about 150 kilometres from Delhi. This hamlet is also a well-known Indus Valley civilization archaeological site. This is a great initiative to promote the tourism sector in India and boost our knowledge and interest about our past culture and civilization.
