What does Women's Day really mean to you? 

To be honest, I'm still figuring that out for myself. I'm not so sure that I know much - beyond the obvious corporate gloss. 

I once saw a Vogue T-shirt that said simply, FEMINIST. It cost $465. To be fair, the T-shirt was very cute, and the pink letters emblazoned on it were undeniably striking. But really, who can afford to buy a T-shirt for over four hundred USD? How many women in the world have access to that kind of money? 

This is the kind of thing that often bothers me about token days: it feels like we don't spend enough time going beyond meaningless gestures. Or am I being too cynical? 

I identify as a feminist and I am always hoping to champion women's causes and celebrate them. I just don't know if we need one particular day for it - we wouldn't, if we spent the rest of the year uplifting them and empowering them in real ways.
