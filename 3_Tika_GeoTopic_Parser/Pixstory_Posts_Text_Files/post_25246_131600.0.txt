rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

i think i actually posted a review on this book before, but decided to revisit it recently to annotate and it only made me realize how much i love this book. sheridan wrote such a beautiful story with this novel, and i will never get over it.
something about archer & bree as characters is genuinely so beautiful and i love their romance →
archer made me cry multiple times ngl to you and all i wanted at times was to give them both HUGS. LIKE PLEASE please let me hug these characters??? reading how their love grew was so incredible and i loved that we got dual pov, especially considering that archer doesn't speak.
Archer hale love u forever fr you're everything to me.
