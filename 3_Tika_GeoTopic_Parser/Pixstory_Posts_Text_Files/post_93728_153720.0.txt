I have always believed in the supremacy of music and its therapeutic elements that make life easier.
Furthermore, music therapy is a therapeutic approach that uses the naturally mood-lifting properties of music to help people improve their mental health and overall well-being.  
It's never about listening to music only. Instead, it's the different processes that can help in their ways.
Like, making music, writing songs, singing, dancing, listening to music, and discussing music.
This form of treatment may be helpful for people with depression and anxiety, and it may help improve the quality of life for people with physical health problems.
 Anyone can engage in music therapy; you don’t need a background in music to experience its beneficial effects.
