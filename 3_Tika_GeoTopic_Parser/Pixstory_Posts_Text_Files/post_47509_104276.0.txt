The Biggest Surprise of the Year:-

Being a goalkeeper is difficult, but maintaining focus in a possession-heavy team at vital moments has long been an underappreciated aspect of Bournemouth's promotion.

Everyone has been surprised by Travers' first full season of first-team play, and the fact that
Asmir Begovic's name has not been spoken since his departure to Everton last summer demonstrates how brilliantly the Republic of Ireland international has performed.

The 22-year-old led from the back, whether the squad needed an extra hand (or two) to see out
wins in the final 10 minutes or to remain in games that appeared to be beyond them. Based on
the quality of shots he faced, Travers had prevented the most goals (5.6) of all championship
goalkeepers by February.

With a league-high 20 clean sheets, he was awarded the championship's Golden Glove trophy,
as well as the supporter's award, at the end of the season.
