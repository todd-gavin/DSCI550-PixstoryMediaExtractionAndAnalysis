When we go throughout the world, there are many aspects of Australian culture that we take for granted. The slang, way of life, and communication are all distinct and can be a culture shock for both immigrants and international visitors. 

Buzz feed talks about the biggest culture shocks that foreigners experience when visiting Australia and it is as interesting as it gets! 

- If you are invited to a party or BBQ and are asked to 'bring a plate' it means bring some kind of food to share." But, when they say not to bring anything, reduce the size and formality of what you take, but never take nothing. The minimum would be a little box of lollies or maybe a four pack of some sort of drinks (doesn't have to be alcoholic these days).

- “We use 'How's it going?' or 'How're you going?' as a greeting. I've heard that's weird to some people because they think 'How's what going...and going where? Huh?' The question doesn't really need a detailed answer either, at least not in a work context or casual context."

- A lot of older people called dinner 'tea' — so if someone asks you over for tea, they mean a full meal and If they're inviting you for a hot beverage, it's 'coffee' — regardless of what you actually drink.
