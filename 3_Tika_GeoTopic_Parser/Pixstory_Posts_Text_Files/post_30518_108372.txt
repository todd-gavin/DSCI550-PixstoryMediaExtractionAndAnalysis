After years of career and official matches Aleksandar Kolarov has announced his retirement The Inter class full-back announced it through a letter Today I announce my farewell to football I always knew that sooner or later this day would come and despite this I am grateful to having managed to realize what has always been my dream Now I am already projected towards my second life in the world of football And for this reason as soon as the calls are published I will enroll in the qualification courses first as an observer and immediately afterwards as sports director at the Federal Technical Center of Coverciano In the last season the Serbian had played very little with the Nerazzurri shirt, making appearances for just total minutes on the pitch In his career he won trophies and took part in two World Cups
