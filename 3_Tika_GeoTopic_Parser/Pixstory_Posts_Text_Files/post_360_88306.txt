If you want to know whats went wrong with the American Afghan policy one needs to meet Khalid Payenda who was Afganistan s finance minister when Taliban took over Kabul and now an Uber driver in Washington DC Washington Post reporter met him when he was driving his Honda Accord to pick up trips Once he used to be in charge of spending billion now he tells the reporter that if he completes trips he would a bonus of Being an Uber driver is a necessity for him to support his family consisting of a wife and four children It also helps to keep his mind away from whats happening in Afghanistan right now Even though he holds his own people responsible for surrendring before Taliban but also blamed the US for handling over Afghanistan to Taliban He had resigned a week before his country fell to Taliban as the then President Ashraf Ghani had chided him for not sanctioning a small payment to a Labanese company He feared that Ghani might get him arrested so he boarded a plane and reached the US His wife and kids were already there His phone has whatsapp chats between fellow Afghan ministers when Kabul fell They were angry and cursed some aides of Ghani and Ghani seemed to be reading chats Now his car passes IMF and World Bank offices where he once used to go as finance minister of Afghanistan He could not get his father out of Kabul and its his biggest regret
