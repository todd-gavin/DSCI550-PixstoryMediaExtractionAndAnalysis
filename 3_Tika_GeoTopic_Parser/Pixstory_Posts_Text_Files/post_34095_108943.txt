The offside is ready to be revolutionized Or rather, the first of the two episodes is coming which will change this aspect of football forever It is the semi-automatic offside, a system aimed at giving the last blow to the game situation which was once the most difficult to evaluate With this novelty that FIFA wants to introduce for the first time at the World Cup in Qatar, the times will be significantly shortened, there is talk of twenty seconds in the trials staged at the Club World Cup with positive results. The goal is to significantly shorten the times and avoid that in certain situations more than a minute may pass before having the final verdict There will be cameras inside the stadium that will trace data points of every single player on the pitch and his position In the future the number of data points will increase thus increasing the accuracy of the detection Has it also spoke Sebastian Runge head of FIFA technology We are tracking everything in frames per second So times per second we know where the players are We do the same for the ball So we know where the ball and feet are The second and final episode will then be the introduction of the fully automatic offside whose times are destined to be longer This system would have the same bases as the semi-automatic one but would cut a pass the communication would reach the referees directly on the field, shortening the times even more
