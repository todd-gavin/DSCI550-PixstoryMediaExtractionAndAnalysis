I remember when we first met How your eyes hold the mystery of a million dreams and how I wished i knew whatever it was that made you smile and so slowly I learned the language of your love By listening to the poetry of your Soul And when i heard you Speaking the same language as me I knew that you wear the one I could follow into every tomorrow and never look back Mark Anthony
