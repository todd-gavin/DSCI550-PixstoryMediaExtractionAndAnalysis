So overall it was a cool movie to watch.The movie was full of suspence,thrill and a adequate amount of action, action which can really be done by normal people,there wasn't too much fight scene as it can be gussed from the name maze "runner" so obviously they are running to save there life. 
Some wow moments for me - 
1} when those gaint spider like thing(GRIEVER) tries to kill them and the way they were saving themselves for a few i was feeling like i was also there in the movie all the credit goes to the camera men who thought for those camera angles. 
2}now if i talk about the acting part there was a scene where newt makes thomas as a maze runner and then Thomas says thanks to neet after that newt do some eye rolling kind of stuff and i really liked that. 
Atlast the things which i found inappropriate and for which i gave this movie 4 star's Every thing was going smooth but at the end they give a scientific response why are they doing this.
I found the resone quit inappropriate I don't wanna give spolier you guys will get it when you will see the movie. 
I hope my review was quite helpful.
