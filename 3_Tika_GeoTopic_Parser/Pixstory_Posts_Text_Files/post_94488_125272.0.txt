Remember the days , when songs along great music had meaningful lyrics? Yeah me neither . What has happened to lyrics these days ? We have absolutely nonsense and ridiculous sentences as lyrics now days . 

From Ajeeb Dastaan hai yeh , aja sanam madhur chandini main hum , pyar kiya to darna kya , pehla nasha pehla khumar , hum tum , we have gone to coca cola tu , main tera boyfriend tu  meri girlfriend.

So , what is the problem ? Many people attribute it to generation gap . But is it true ? Songs like Channa mereya , apna time ayega and the latest from gangubai have been appreciated for their lyrics .

To write horrible lyrics and say its because generation does not respond to deep meaningful lyrics is wrong . Any one of any generation can appreciate great lyrics ðŸ˜Š. It all depends on how well they are written.
