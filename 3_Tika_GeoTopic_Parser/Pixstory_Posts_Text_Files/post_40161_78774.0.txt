Wetlands come in diverse shapes, sizes, forms  and are very important ecosystems of our natural world. Not only they are repository of unique biodiversity they are also known as ecotones â€“ transitional habitats between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems

At WTI (partnering forest departments and local communities) we ensure that these wetlands are protected for life to thrive.
