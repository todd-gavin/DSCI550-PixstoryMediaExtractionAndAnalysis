The Barcelona striker represented his nation for over 10 years and also wore the captain’s armband.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has confirmed his international career with Gabon has come to an end. The Barcelona striker appeared 72 times for his nation, scoring 30 goals and also serving as a captain.

Following an early exit from the African Cup of Nations at the start of the year, he has decided to focus on his club career.

What did Aubameyang say about his retirement?

“After 13 years of pride in representing my country, I announce that I am ending my 
international career,” the 32-year-old wrote in an open letter to Gabon fans.

“I would like to thank Gabonese people and all those who have supported me in the good and the bad times. I will keep good memories like the I made my debut at romnisports, or the day I came back or the day I came back from Nigeria with the African Ballon d'Or.”

“Sharing with all the people was an unforgettable moment for me. I thank our President, his Excellency Ali Bongo Ondimba who has always supported the Panthers and has always worked towards the evolvement of football in our country.”

The bigger picture

Aubameyang’s last attempt to win the silverware for his nation ended when he tested 
positive for Covid-19 just before the tournament and was sent home with Mario Lemina.

“It’s very complicated,” Gabon boss Patrice Neveu said at the time. “I am not new to this 
team, I’ve worked with Gabon for three years and fortunately Caf gave us the option of 
having 28 players in our squad.”

“However losing Aubameyang and Mario, it’s a lot for the team. We don’t have the squad of Nigeria or Morocco and we know we are in hard competition.”

Without their star, Gabon managed to battle through to the last 16 of the competition where they went down on penalties to Burkina Faso.
