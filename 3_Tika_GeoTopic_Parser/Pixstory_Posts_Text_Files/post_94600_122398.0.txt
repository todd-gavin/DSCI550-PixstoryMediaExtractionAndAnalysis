For the first time in independent India, a programme of study was introduced to offer UG [Bachelor of Visual Art /Diploma in Visual Art, PG [Master in Visual Art /Post-Diploma in Visual Art and Â Master of Fine Arts [Museology] Courses and Research facilities in its various departments like Applied Arts, Painting, Sculpture, Print Making and Art History & Aesthetics .
