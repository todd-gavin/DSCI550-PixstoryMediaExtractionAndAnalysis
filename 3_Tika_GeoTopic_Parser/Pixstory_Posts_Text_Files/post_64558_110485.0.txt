In 2010, near the Residential Home that was started in 2002 by Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), the children there conducted an inter-class Football Tournament by themselves. They couldn't get a referee for the tournament, they told the DMSC volunteers about this. This request reached to the founder of DMSC, Dr. Smarajit Jana and he made the decision to send Biswajit Majmudar (Football Coach) and one other person to be the referees of this tournament. These two coaches saw 20 boys play a five a side tournament. They came to the conclusion that these boys are really talented at playing football and they should get some sort of training.

The coaches took this matter up with Dr. Smarajit Jana telling him about how these kids are talented and interested in football. As per the wishes of the coaches Dr. Jana agreed that they should go there once a week to train the kids. The coaches took a football with them and told the boys that they'll come once a week to train them. The boys got really excited when they heard about this.
