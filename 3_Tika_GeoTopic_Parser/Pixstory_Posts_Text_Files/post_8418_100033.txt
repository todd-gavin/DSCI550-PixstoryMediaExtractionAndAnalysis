When I see sunsets they always remind me that light comes only after darkness The day comes after the night and vice versa We all have some bad days shit days now and then YES All of us No matter how perfect we aspire to be and no matter how many things we promised ourselves we would do sometimes all the things we wanted to achieve just can t happen in one day and it is okay That s being called realistic So if your day was bad well pick yourself right back up and stop being hard on yourself Today was a bit a of failure Tomorrow is a new day Tomorrow sun will rise again Get that chin up and rise like a phoenix from the ashes Cheers to life
