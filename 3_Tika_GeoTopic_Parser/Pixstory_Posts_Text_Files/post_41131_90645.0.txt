The Tallahassee-based Black News Channel, which began operations about two years ago, announced its closure via email to its staff on Friday. 

WCTV reported that the disclosure was made in an internal memo acquired by WCTV from an employee who did not want to be identified. President and CEO Princell Hair sent the email at 2:55 p.m. Friday, praising employees' efforts before informing them that the network would "cease live operations and file for bankruptcy."

“Unfortunately, due to challenging market conditions and global financial pressures, we have been unable to meet our financial goals, and the timeline afforded to us has run out,” Hair wrote in the memo. “I understand that this surprising and unfortunate news will naturally generate a lot of questions surrounding next steps. Our leadership team and human resources will be in touch to address them over the coming days and weeks.”

Hair was contacted by WCTV with an inquiry about the apparent delay in employee pay. Hair submitted a copy of Hair's memo to BNC communications spokesperson Tim Buckman, who forwarded it to WCTV. Buckman later responded to a follow-up email with concerns about the accuracy of the missing paycheck claims. 

Buckman told WCTV that the payroll deposits scheduled for today (Friday) will be made on Monday, March 28th. 

They were outraged by the delay, with evening DJ Marc Lamont Hill taking to Twitter on Friday afternoon to say that employees were "being refused money they've already worked for."
