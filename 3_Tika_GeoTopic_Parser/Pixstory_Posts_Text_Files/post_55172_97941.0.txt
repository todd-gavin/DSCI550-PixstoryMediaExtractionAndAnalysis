Furry native creatures, sport, and beer may come to mind when you think about Australia. But there's a lot more that goes into making Australia the diverse and rich country it is.

For instance, as cohort go tells us, indigenous Australians are the world's oldest living culture. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have lived in Australia for more than 60,000 years. A special connection to the land, as well as a commitment to family and community, are important aspects of Aboriginal culture. Art, tales, song, and dance are used to document the rights of various Aboriginal people to live and administer specified portions of land. 

Also, did you know that Australians have their own dialect of English? The national language of Australia is English, which is spoken by the majority of the population, although it may not be the English you are familiar with. Many words are truncated in Australian slang, making it difficult for foreigners to understand. Even your own name might not be safe, when Australianâ€™s feel comfortable with you they may give you a nick-name which may be a slightly altered version of your name.
