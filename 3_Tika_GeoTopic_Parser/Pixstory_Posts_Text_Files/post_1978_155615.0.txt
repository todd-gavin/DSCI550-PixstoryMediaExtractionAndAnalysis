The term “Misinformation” has lost just about all its meaning. From its foray into the mainstream during the candidacy of Donald Trump in the 2016 election, the term has come to be used to describe information that doesn’t fit the narrative of the person it was told to. Because this term gets thrown around so often in the incorrect context, let’s look at two real examples where experts called things misinformation, which turned out to either be true or completely plausible.The Hunter Biden laptop was called Russian misinformation by 50 intelligence experts, despite the mountain of evidence that it wasn’t, turned out to be true and may be used to prosecute Hunter.The COVID-19 Wuhan lab leak theory, which was downplayed by the media as a form of anti-Asian rhetoric turned out to be an extremely plausible theory that warrants further investigation. The failure of the government to take this seriously might have cost many lives.And, as a bonus, let’s reverse the roles. The infamous Steele Dossier, which was the catalyst for the public’s belief that Trump was in bed with the Russians, turned out to be falsified information paid for by the Clinton campaign in an attempt to beat Trump in the 2016 election.
