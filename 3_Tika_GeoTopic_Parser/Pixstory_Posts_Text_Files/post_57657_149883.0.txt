Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behaviour. The term "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity.
Differences in communication and social interaction characterize these conditions. People with ASD often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behaviour.
ASD is found in people worldwide, regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, or economic background.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ASD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls. A study of 8-year-olds in 11 locations throughout the United States found a 4.3-to-1 boy-to-girl. About 1 in 54 of the study participants had ASD.
