Cristiano Ronaldo’s lovely gesture at Moldovan airport has attracted thousands of appreciations for the forward.
It’s not an everyday routine for Manchester United to travel to a small country like Moldovan. Thus, a massive group of fans gathered outside the airport to welcome the English club. The gathering further escalated when they saw Ronaldo coming out of the airport to head towards the team bus.
A fan wearing United’s jersey breached the first security to meet the Portuguese forward, before another security stopped him. However, Ronaldo, who noticed him, asked security to let him in and meet him. Later, Ronaldo hugged him and also autographed the jersey while taking him close to the team bus.
The 37-year-old forward’s gesture video is doing the rounds on the internet. Fans are amazed by the humility and are appreciating the legendary footballer.
