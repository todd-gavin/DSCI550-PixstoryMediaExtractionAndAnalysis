Abstract Introduction Excess weight is a public health problem associated with a greater burden of chronic diseases and increased use of health resources Material and methods A subsample of Spanish adults aged from the Spanish National Health Survey N was used The odds ratios of service utilisation of the group with BMI kg m were compared to the normal weight group using a model adjusted for sex age education socioeconomic level perceived health status and the presence of comorbidities Results In all of the sample had obesity Of these visited their general physician attended emergency services and were hospitalised during the last months which were significantly higher rates than in the normal weight population respectively However visited a physiotherapist and used alternative therapies compared to and in the healthy weight group After adjusting for confounding factors people with obesity were more likely to visit emergency services OR and less likely to visit a physiotherapist OR or use alternative therapies OR Conclusions Spanish young adults suffering from obesity are more likely to use some health resources than those of normal weight even after adjusting for socioeconomic variables and comorbidities but they are less likely to attend physical therapy The literature shows that these differences are less marked than in older ages so this stage of life could be a window of opportunity for prevention to achieve better resource management Sources
