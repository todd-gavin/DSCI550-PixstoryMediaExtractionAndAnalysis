The theme which motivated the local people was that if their ancestors could rise to such heights in the past as exemplified by the Rohtas Fort, why couldn’t the descendants of such worthy ancestors bring glory and peace to their homeland. The Rohtas Fort is a symbol of the illustrious past of the Sone Valley. People during the initiative discussed about their ancestors who did not have the benefits of modern technology and science and still could build such a marvelous fort at 1500 ft above sea level. 

Thus one wondered about the reasons why Rohtas today couldn’t prosper despite the advancements of modern science and thought.  People were being made to remember the landmarks of the past. Rohtas had also been for some time in the past as the capital of the area which now included the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and W. Bengal and the country Bangladesh. During Akbar’s reign Raja Mansingh used the fort as the administrative capital to govern this whole territory.


The fort of Rohtas was won over by Sher Shah Suri from a Hindu king by deceit, and the gain of this fort made him very strong. It was only after winning Rohtas that he could gradually conquer the seat of Delhi. Sher Shah was so much impressed by the magnificence of the Rohtas Fort, that he made a simlar fort with the same name on the banks of the Jhelum in present Pakistan. The Pakistani Rohtas Fort is included in the UNESCO list of world heritage sites.

Rohtas always has had a prominent place in the history of India. Rohtas Fort is associated with the tribes residing on the hills. The Kharwars, Oraons and Cheros claim to be descendants from the fort. History tells us that Kharwars who claimed to be suryavanshis were custodians of the present area of Shahabad and adjoining districts of Palamu and Garhwa. Oraon songs mention about the rule of Oraons from the fort.
