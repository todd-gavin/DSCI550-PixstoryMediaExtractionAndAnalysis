A total of trillion in student debt is owed by around million Americans Many of these debtors are hoping that their debts would be erased because that paying that kind of money is a nightmare College expenditures have climbed by more than percent in the last decade while student debt has increased by percent You claim that America is providing scholarships for deserving candidates but who according to you is undeserving of being able to afford a good lifestyle Jobs for those without a college diploma are fast disappearing and college graduates earn percent more than those with only a high school background The difference in average life expectancy between individuals with and without a college diploma is widening owing to differing economic possibilities For the following six years cancelling student loan debt may add billion to annual GDP on average Student loan debt cancellation might result in the creation of million new jobs Up to million American households could be lifted out of poverty as a result of the cancellation of student loan debt Consumer spending could rise by as much as percent as a result of debt cancellation Current debt cancellation plans would help more than million Americans who owe money to the federal government So probably it s not as much of a burden on America as you claim it is In fact it will only help a lot of Americans Using a superficial statement like the value of education as an excuse to drive Americans towards poverty is nothing but anti american
