Many Afghan girls across Kabul. NOW had arrived to their high schools on Wednesday. THIS morning eager to return to their education, only to learn that the Taliban had reversed their decision to allow girls' high schools to reopen this week.
Most high school girls have been banned from attending classes in Afghanistan since the Taliban retook control of the country in August last year.
The high schools will reportedly remain closed to girls until officials come up with a plan for them to reopen in accordance with their version of Islamic law. Aziz-ur-Rahman Rayan, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education, told the NYT in an interview on Tuesday that Taliban officials had decided not to allow girls above the sixth grade to return to school yet.
He attributed the decision to a lack of a religious uniform for girls and the lack of women teachers for girls, among other issues.
The United Nations and the United States
condemned the latest decision from the Taliban.
A pledging conference for Afghanistan is set to happen in the coming weeks, where the United Nations had hoped donor countries would commit millions of dollars in badly needed aid for Afghanistan. It is unclear whether donors will be willing to do so following the Taliban's reversal on the
key commitment of girls' education.
