Chris Finch should be smiling. Instead, seated on the podium in Target Center’s interview room after his Timberwolves tied up their first-round series against Memphis, the 52-year-old coach wears a long poker face while fidgeting with a black pair of eyeglasses on the table in front of him. Despite its gut-check victory, Minnesota was exposed by Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane, whose three-pointers carried the effortlessness of someone flicking raisins through a hula hoop.

For the second game in a row, Bane exploded behind the arc, going 8-for-12 for a game-high 34 points. (In Game 3 he went 7-for-15.) Responding to a question about the performance, Finch admitted that with Ja Morant also on the court “sometimes you can’t cover it all.” He praised Bane’s off-ball movement and quick release, then acknowledged how his own players somehow underestimated Bane’s ability.

“Sometimes I think his range catches our guys off guard still a little bit,” Finch said. “We kind of short-closed him a few times in the first half, and we talked about that at halftime. We can't do that.”

But over the next two games—both won by Memphis—they did that. Bane scored 48 points, made another eight threes and amplified his growing reputation as one of the league’s premier young talents.

On the whole, these playoffs have placed a spotlight on what Bane has been doing all year, and how important his outside shot is to Memphis’s offense. After finishing second in three-point percentage during the regular season (only Clippers guard Luke Kennard was better than Bane’s 43.6%), Bane is 29-for-64 from deep in the postseason. Those 29 makes are more than any other player. That 45.3% is ridiculous. (A back injury has hampered Bane’s all-around impact in the Western Conference semifinals, which is tied 1-1 heading into Saturday night’s Game 3 at the Chase Center. But Bane’s mere presence on the floor has drawn attention from the Warriors’ defense, so far deploying a strategy that’s opted not to help off him in an effort to slow down Morant.
