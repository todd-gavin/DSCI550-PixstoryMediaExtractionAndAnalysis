 Corporal Punishment doesn t mean ultimate violence It s used for disciplining and doesn t cause any harm to the children Corporal punishment is the appropriate discipline for certain children when used in moderation Corporal punishment sets clear boundaries and encourages children to behave in school When children are not corrected for the behaviour they do they tend to repeat it If a child bullies another corporal punishment will only help in disciplining the child so that he realises his mistake Moreover children at a young age don t know what is right and wrong they only realise by the way we discipline them towards it For many things students do at school we have can offer only suspension or detention But considering their future we give them corporal punishment so that they learn discipline Corporal punishment is often chosen by students over suspension or detention Also remember corporal punishment should be given only if they are not disciplined or rather repeat the undesirable activity even after correcting them or scolding It s just a way of bringing up Some of the negative stories cited by people who are opposed to corporal punishment were the result of failures in regulation and leadership not in corporal punishment itself
