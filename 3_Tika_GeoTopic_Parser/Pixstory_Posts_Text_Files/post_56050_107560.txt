 Remember by Christina Georgina Rossetti Remember me when I am gone away Gone far away into the silent land When you can no more hold me by the hand Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you plann d Only remember me you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember do not grieve For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad It was written in but not published until when it occurred in Rossetti s first volume Goblin Market and Other Poems The poet requests that the addressee of the poem remember her after she has died The addressee is presumably her lover since they had plann d a future together But what twists the poem is the inferring thought that it would be better for her loved one to forget her and be happy than to recall her if it makes that person sad It is this second part of the poem s argument that saves it from spilling over into corny sentimentality Rossetti entreats someone not to sing any sad songs for her when she dies and says it does not matter whether her lover remembers or forgets her The poem is an extraordinary technical accomplishment for a sonnet written by a teenager during any era
