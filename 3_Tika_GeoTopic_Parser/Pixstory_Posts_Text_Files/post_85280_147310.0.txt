The free agent concept has been gaining momentum among the clubs as it is the cheapest method to reinforce a squad. Players are allowing their contracts to run out to join another club in the lure of a higher salary.
Many had the impression that one can only get below-average footballers for free. But that has changed as in the past few years, we have seen many clubs conceding in signing top-quality players on a free transfer.
The 2022 summer window was a roller-coaster as we saw numerous mouth-watering transfers and the same is expected from 2023. With many superstars running out of contracts at the end of the season, the upcoming summer window will unfold a lot of drama.
Hereâ€™s a look at five big names who might become free agents at the end of the 2022/23 season:
#1 Lionel Messi
Lionel Messi, who joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the summer window of 2021, will run out of contract at the end of the season. Though he had a below-standard performance in his debut season, he has started off strong this season with six goals and eight assists already to his name.
If the Argentine keeps up his red-hot form, PSG might consider extending his stay for an additional year as the option is already under contract. The picture will only get clearer after the Qatar World Cup as Messi has already announced that he will only make a decision on his future after the marquee event.
#2 Cristiano Ronaldo
In the 2021 summer window, even Cristiano Ronaldo made the switch from Juventus to Manchester United, the club he had left for Real Madrid in 2009. Though he failed to make the Red Devils qualify for the Champions League, he had an impactful season on individual terms.
Ronaldo, who has been warming the bench mostly this season, will also see his contract run out in June 2023. Considering his age and huge salary, United might look to offload him by not offering him a new contract. But he will still be a good signing for any club as he is fit and can bring economical advantages.
