For most people nowadays, thinking of a black-and-white television is a relic of the past. Color television shows, on the other hand, were only introduced a few decades ago. IE reported that the first coloured television broadcast in Australia was unveiled through a clever farce that recently went viral on Twitter after being shared online. 

Danny Deraney, a publicist, shared a clip from Aunty Jack Introduces Color, a five-minute special edition of the popular Australian sitcom The Aunty Jack Show, on Thursday. 

The main characters of The Aunty Jack Show may be seen in the video attempting to fight off the invasion of colours on the screen. Throughout the video, as colours slowly bleed into the frames, the characters try to fight off “green slime polka dotis”, which is explained as a “horrible disease that comes with colour”. In the hilarious clip, the main protagonist called Aunty Jack tries to stop the colour from taking over the screen by using grey paint called the “colour remover”.

The video, which aired on Australia's national television network ABC TV on February 28, 1975, evoked nostalgia in some who had previously watched the show, while others expressed awe at the skit's ingenuity.
