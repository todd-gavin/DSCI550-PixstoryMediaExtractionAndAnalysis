Until the end of the season there will probably be no more talk of Lukaku&#39;s future In his tiring year at Chalsea the rumors of his farewell chase each other with a possible destination which would be a new return to Inter. agent Federico Pastorello interviewed by Repubblica But it was directly his client who denied the agent not so much for the words he said about the nerazzuri and a possible return but on a problem he had at Chelsea this year I will never allow anyone to speak for me I decided to keep keep your mouth shut and stay focused on helping the team on the pitch until the end of the season to the best of my ability So if someone talks about me and the club it&#39;s not in my name signed Lukaku But what Pastorello had said No one for the transfer parameters the season at Chelsea could have been expected. Ed. Much ado about nothing He has the club and the fans in his heart he has never hidden it like his love for Anderlecht where he would like to end his career But we cannot hypothesize negotiations Chelsea has finalized the sale of the club we do not know the interlocutors let alone if we can hypothesize speeches with Inter or Milan We have to wait
