There's no reason why juveniles should get any special privilege for the crimes they commit than an adult. Even though they aren't as mature as us but it does not mean they're walking bodies of stupidity with no intelligence in them whatsoever.

They understand the difference between right and wrong. We, as a society, have always taught children from a young age to be law abiding citizens, there is no excuse for breaking the law even for them. 

Why must a 15 year old stealing get any privilege over a 18 year old stealing? There's not much difference in these ages. Not to mention, there are more heinous crimes committed by children who get away with them simply because of their age. I'm conflicted if it should be on all charges, but most charges should be treating both the same.
