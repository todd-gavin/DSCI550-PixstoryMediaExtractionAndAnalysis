As Max Blearly writes, we all enjoy a good comeback story in the kitchen. Consider the resurrection of meatloaf or the inexplicable resurgence of prawn cocktail. From the cliche of "I learned to prepare this dish at my nana's knee," to accessing collective food memories, chefs are experts at fishing the depths of nostalgia. 

“I’ve always gone back and done a lot of reading of old cookbooks,” says chef Blaze Young, who heads up the kitchen at Fremantle wine bar Nieuw Ruin. “I kind of love old-school, 1950s grandma food, and old Australiana.”

Young isn't bound by her grandmother's culinary technique; she also enjoys interpreting other people's food memories. A confit fish "under a fur coat," for example, has become her signature dish. 

The notion for this twist on "herring inside a fur coat" came from Nieuw Ruin's owner Dimitri Rtshiladze's childhood experiences. Young learned about the Eastern European classic through Rtshiladze, who is of Georgian heritage.

“Traditionally it’s made with tinned, preserved herring, and then it’s layered with cold vegetables,” she says. “I guess to make the herring a little bit more appetising.” Young uses monkfish from Scott Reef off the north-west coast of Western Australia. It is a by-catch, which she says has a “beautiful vegetal flavour” reminiscent of leeks when slowly confited.
