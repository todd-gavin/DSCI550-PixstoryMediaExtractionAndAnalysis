I had many other ways to go I got educated I did my medicine MBBS in Srinagar and my school was beautiful I went to Burn Hall School in Srinagar The country runs the borrowed swimming pool of the Biscoe school on Sundays the scout camps in the summers the long bicycle drives and an Irishman driving you It had that charm It was next to the Shankaracharya temple on a hilltop We had a lot of outdoors a lot of upbringing a lot of comics and moral science as a subject So a bit of grounding in that I think the school was fantastic and I mean it It was an old wooden structure and I came to know later that it was called Burn Hall because in Scottish language Burn means a little river rivulet with a wooden house next to it And I am told it was also burnt a couple of times May be the people who supported the theory that it got called Burn Hall because it got burnt a couple of times were also right So I won t say that I am the last word on that But it was beautiful What I can tell you is that one way up the school as I grew up was a bicycle Till class three we were in the Convent and there was a co ed system In the fourth standard we were shunted out to Burn Hall because the girls had started growing up and so they didn t trust the boys next to them anymore They evacuated us to Burn Hall School which was a little bit further away but with the same kind of atmosphere Five or six of us would cycle one way But when I was a small kid it was the bus the old Bedford bus painted blue with Burn Hall written on it that ferried us and that was an amazing experience To be continued
