 Demonstrations and protests are across the country Isn t it enough to know the rage of citizens when their rights are taken away Does this country stand for its citizens or with the few powerful people A coalition of groups such as Planned Parenthood UltraViolet MoveOn and the Women s March are organizing demonstrations whose rallying statement is Bans Off Our Bodies More than protests are scheduled including in Washington DC New York Los Angeles and Chicago The protest is for the overturning of Roe v s Wade and giving the decision making to the states This would make half of the country ban abortion and people will have to travel long distances for an abortion While conservatives have celebrated the leak ruling liberals have objected vociferously gathering outside the supreme court building in Washington DC as well as the homes of some of the conservative justices to show their displeasure The Bans Off Our Bodies meetings will take place three days after Democrats in the US Senate on Wednesday made a largely symbolic effort to progress legislation that would codify the right to abortion into federal law All Republicans and one conservative aligned Democrat West Virginia s Joe Manchin voted against the measure leaving it well short of the votes necessary for it to advance Protests are going to be strong It is a shame that in a country like the US which claims to be the most progressive women have to match protest and fight for their rights rights over their bodies Source Guardian
