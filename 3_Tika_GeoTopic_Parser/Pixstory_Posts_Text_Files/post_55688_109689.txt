The landmark Roe v Wade decision that legalised abortion in the US in was overturned and I can this with certainty that this will not only affect women in the US but affect women across the world I think we are influenced by the American movement and I think that threat is escalating Dr Tania Penovic from the Castan Centre for Human Rights said I can t help but remember anti abortion protesters marched through the streets of Brisbane in late April arguing against Australia s reproductive policies nownews reported that Amanda Stoker a former assistant minister for women was present during the event too It was further reported that Yolanda Vega a resident of Melbourne was alarmed to see politicians attending the demonstrations and is concerned about the expansion of the anti abortion movement in Australia Every person should be able to make a decision on how they want to live We can t continue traumatising women because they need to make a very serious decision Vega said An interesting fact reported is that last year an online study by Ipsos found seven in Australian adults support access to abortion But the same study revealed abortion support is high in the UK but is on the decline Eighty per cent supported it in compared to per cent in The forces that we re seeing in the US right now do have the ability to influence laws and policies in Australia They do have the potential to wind back abortion access introduce restrictions Penovic said
