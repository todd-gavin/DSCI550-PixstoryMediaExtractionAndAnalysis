Nordic combined has been a feature of the Winter Olympics since 1924, and it puts skiers through their paces on jaw-dropping jumps and heart-pounding routes. Its time may have come to an end. 

As per US News, it is the only Olympic sport in which women do not compete, and the International Olympic Committee will decide whether or not to allow women to compete in Nordic combined in the 2026 Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo Games later this month. 

According to competitors and proponents, however, there is a chance that Nordic combined will be dropped outright from the Olympics.

“What I heard loud and clear in back channels is that the solution to take care of the gender equity dirty secret is to take men out of the program for 2026," said Billy Demong, a five-time Olympian in Nordic combined and member of USA Nordic’s board of directors. 

“To take away one of the original sports from the first Winter Olympics would be tragic, short-sighted and misguided."
