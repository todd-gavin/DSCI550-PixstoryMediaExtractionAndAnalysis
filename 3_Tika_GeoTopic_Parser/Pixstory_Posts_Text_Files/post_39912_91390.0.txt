Aam'er tok (pronounced "tawk") is a recipe for the hot Bengal summers when the mangoes are not ripe yet, and frequent nor'westers or afternoon storms keep knocking unripe green mangoes off the trees. Bengalis love making all sorts of cooling green mango recipes in these months. Besides a variety of tok dal, achaar (pickles) and chutney, aam'er tok or ambol too is popular during summers. It is a unique transitional course just after the fish and meat course and before dessert. Sometimes, on very hot days ambol or tok can even play the role of dessert in ending the meal.
For this aam'er tok recipe remember to select the smaller, more fragrant unripe green mangoes. The large, nearly ripe green mangoes don't have the same tartness, flavour or texture. This can be cooked very quickly and easily, and stored in the fridge for a few weeks. Serve chilled towards the end of the meal and experience the cool-sweet-savoury-sour tok make its way to your soul.
