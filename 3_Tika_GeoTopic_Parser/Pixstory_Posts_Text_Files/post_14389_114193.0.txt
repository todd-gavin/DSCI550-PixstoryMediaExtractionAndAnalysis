Former Manchester City player Danny Mills in a recent interview said that Leo Messi will not get into any of the Premier League's top six teams right now. 

 Mills, who was best know for his time at Leeds United said that, “Lionel Messi is the greatest footballer I have ever seen. I didn’t see Cruyff live or Maradona. Messi is the best footballer I’ve ever seen.

“In terms of being a footballer, Messi is the greatest. But would you take Messi in your team now, probably not. I don’t think they [top six] would take him. Liverpool? No. Man City? No. Tottenham? No, I don’t think they would,” added Danny Mills. 

It’s interesting to note that, despite never playing in the Premier League, the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner has scored 27 goals and assisted 6 times in 36 games against the English teams in a competitive fixture. Cristiano Ronaldo on the other hand has scored 36 goals in 87 games against the Top 6 teams. He also has 8 assists to his name!

The PSG star averages a goals very 114’ compared to Ronaldo’s 195’. The Argentine has also scored 2 hattricks against English rivals compared to Ronaldo’s 1. 

Messi has 6 braces to his name compared to Ronaldo’s 5. 

Whether Leo Messi gets into any of Top 6 teams will be an on-going debate but his number speak on his behalf. Based on the achievements over the last 15 years and what he still brings to the game, any team having him will only do better in terms of league position, points, brand value and in every other aspect.
