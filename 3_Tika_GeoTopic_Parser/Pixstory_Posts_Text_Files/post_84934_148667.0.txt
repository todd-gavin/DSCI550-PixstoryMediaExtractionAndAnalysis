5 Jordi Alba
The diminutive left-back was one of the best players on the field, thanks to his quick pace and accurate passing, which helped him become a key player for the club. Alba's speed permitted him to make in-between runs and cross in the box; he could also link-up play with wingers and was one of the best players on the counter-attack, as he could cover the ground or break the attack.
His time with Messi helped him form a great pair on the field because they both understood each other. Alba, on the other hand, is not as useful under Xavi, but he is still one of the best left-backs in the world, having played 433 games for Barcelona.

4 Dani Alves
Alves, a decorated right-back for Barcelona, was not your average left-back; his ball awareness was impeccable, he could orchestrate counter-attacks with his offensive ability, and he played a significant role during his time at the club. His distribution was unbelievable, and he was blessed with crossing precision.
Despite his lack of physical strength, Alves' tenacity, anticipation, and work-rate enabled him to regain possession and make timely tackles. He arrived as the youngest player and left as a legend, appearing in 391 games.


3 Javier Mascherano
Many questioned Barcelona's board of directors after they signed the Argentine defender to replace Carles Puyol. Because of his stature, Mascherano was labelled as an inept defender who was frequently outclassed in aerial duels with strikers, but the player was one of the best defenders in Barcelona history and quickly became Puyol's successor.
He was known as "The Little Chief" because of his ability to organise the team and lead it, as well as his passing accuracy, energy, and positional sense. He excelled at man-marking and was an aggressive player due to his hard-tackling style of play. The former Argentine played 334 games for Barcelona, including two Champions League appearances.
