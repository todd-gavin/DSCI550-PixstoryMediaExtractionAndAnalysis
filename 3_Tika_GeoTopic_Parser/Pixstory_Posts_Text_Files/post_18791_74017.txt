Ducati has postponed the presentation of the new bike to next February Initially it was scheduled for the end of the month in January but in the last few hours the rider Jack Miller tested positive for Covid and for this reason he will not be able to leave Australia where he lives The team has therefore decided to move the presentation was just over a week away even if the January appointment remained when the livery of the new bike will be unveiled as a preview Miller himself communicated the positivity on Instagram Unfortunately I tested positive for Covid and therefore I cannot leave for Europe Now I am in isolation at my home in Australia and I am fine I have no symptoms so I can at least continue training I am very sorry but in any case we will see you in Sepang for testing in early February
