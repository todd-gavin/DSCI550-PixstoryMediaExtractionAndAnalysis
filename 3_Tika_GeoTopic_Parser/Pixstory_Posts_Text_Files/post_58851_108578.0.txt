In the face of overwhelming criticism to the Centre's Agnipath initiative, Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, joined fellow entrepreneur Anand Mahindra in pledging jobs to Agniveers on Monday.


Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, voiced his displeasure with the violence against the initiative earlier in the day, and stated that the farm equipment to aerospace conglomerate welcomed the opportunity to acquire trained, capable, and young individuals through the programme.

The violence surrounding the Agneepath programme makes me sad. I stated—and I repeat—that the discipline and skills Agniveers develop will make them eminently employable when the initiative was proposed last year. "The Mahindra Group is delighted to have the opportunity to hire such well-trained and skilled young people," commented Anand Mahindra.

"The RPG group, too, welcomes the opportunity to engage the Agniveers," RPG Group Chairman Harsh Goenka tweeted, echoing similar views. I sincerely hope that additional businesses will join us in taking this pledge and ensuring the future of our young."

Several states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Telangana, were rocked by violent protests, while nonviolent agitations against the programme were organised in a number of locations.

The Indian Railways have been hit the most by the unrest. Due to the protests, almost 500 trains were cancelled on Monday.
