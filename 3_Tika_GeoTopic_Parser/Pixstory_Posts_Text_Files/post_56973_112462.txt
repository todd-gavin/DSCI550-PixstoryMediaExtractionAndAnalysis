 My castle crumbled overnight I brought a knife to a gunfight They took the crown but it s alright Call It What You Want Should ve kept every grocery store receipt Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me Marjorie Boys will be boys then Where are the wise men Miss Americana the Heartbreak Prince You held your pride like you should have held me The Story of Us You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars And why I ve spent my whole life trying to put it into words You Are in Love They told me all of my cages were mental So I got wasted like all my potential This Is Me Trying Barefoot in the kitchen sacred new beginnings That became my religion listen Cornelia Street
