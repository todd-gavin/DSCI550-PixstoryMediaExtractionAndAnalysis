The existence of the government is a necessity at least at the current level of development and human resources But the government is a legal entity not a human being so it has no heart no feelings It is unreasonable to expect the government to do good for us Nothing impersonal can replace us and take responsibility for us Many people in the present world who are more and more equipped and powerful than ever have made idols of the government and legal institutions and expect the government to do everything for them let alone say that the government loves them instead To be In any case such a life is not so valuable that the government falls in love with us Left wing governments socialism and even welfare pose such a risk of idolizing the state When the government does good instead of the people when the government falls in love with the people and when the government becomes omnipotent even if it is a very benevolent government it ends at the cost of dehumanizing people Because that benevolence for whatever reason is reflected in the law in the ideal situation people like the machine apply those laws but over time everything becomes soulless and people backward and diminished no longer have a reason to exist like the law
