South Africa Women’s team has been dealt with a huge blow ahead of the upcoming Commonwealth Games set to be played in Birmingham. Their star all-rounder Marizanne Kapp has been ruled out of the tournament. She had flew back home from England midway through the tour during the T20I series due to family reasons.

Kapp’s brother-in-law had suffered serious injuries in an accident which led to her returning home after the first of the three-match T20I series against England. South Africa head coach Hilton Moreeng confirmed the news of Kapp missing out on the Commonwealth Games after a 3-0 loss in the T20I series to England on Monday (July 25).

It has already been a tough tour of England for South Africa and couldn’t register a single win in the multi-format series. They managed to draw the one-off Test match thanks to rain and lost all the six white-ball matches. Marizanne Kapp getting ruled out is another blow to the team that is already unsettled with the sudden retirement of Lizelle Lee.

Kapp was in great form on the England tour scoring 150 and 43* in the one-off Test. She also smacked two half-centuries in the three-match ODI series. Meanwhile, South Africa are also struggling in terms of fitness of Shabnim Ismail and Sune Luus who missed the third T20I against England. However, Moreeng played down any concerns and is confident that the duo will be available for the team’s first game in Commonwealth Games.

“It’s a precaution from medical to make sure they are 100 per cent for that game and ready for the first game. Yes, they’ll be 100 percent. She is recovering well, Sune, and she will definitely be able to bowl. Regarding Marizanne, she will be out of the Commonwealth Games,” he said.

As for Kapp’s replacement, South Africa had added Tazmin Brits to the squad during the T20I series against England itself and she did well in the last game scoring 59 off 57 deliveries. South Africa will begin their campaign in Commonwealth Games against New Zealand on July 30.
