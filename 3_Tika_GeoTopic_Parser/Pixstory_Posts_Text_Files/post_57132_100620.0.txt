What you said could be true to some extent, but sometimes parents unknowingly forget to create that space for their children where they could even talk or share about what is bothering them. They're so strongly imbued in dealing with their problems and conflicts that they forget to realise what effect it would have on their kids.

From constantly trying to adjust to those conflicts, these children finally give up and decide that only separation from their parents would do some justice to their lives.

Although they might be adults, sometimes parents fail to comprehend that they are vulnerable. Seeing their parents fight or argue and witness all the abuse happening between the father and mother or any other family members, they lose sight of the hope that could mend things. 

I think parents should be more aware of what they're choosing to do in front of their kids, without making the situation so traumatising for a child that he is left with the only reasonable solution of leaving the parents.
And it could only be tackled if this understanding and awareness commence early in life when they decide to have a child so that their child can imbibe values and opinions that would not compel him to take such decisions.
