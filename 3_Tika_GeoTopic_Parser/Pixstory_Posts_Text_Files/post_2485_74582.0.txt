Helen: ‘You can’t come in here!’

Ivan: ‘Why not?’

Helen: ‘Well because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But I’m not sick.’

Helen: ‘It doesn’t matter.’

Ivan: ‘Well, why does that guy get to go in?’

Helen: ‘Because he’s vaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But he’s sick!’

Helen: ‘It’s alright. Everyone in here is vaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘Wait a minute. Are you saying everyone in there is vaccinated?’

Helen: ‘Yes.’

Ivan: ‘So then why can’t I go in there if everyone is vaccinated?’

Helen: ‘Because you’ll make them sick.’

Ivan: ‘How will I make them sick if I’m NOT sick and they’re vaccinated?’

Helen: ‘Because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But they’re vaccinated.’

Helen: ‘But they can still get sick.’

Ivan: ‘So what the heck does the vaccine do?'

Helen: ‘It protects them.'

Ivan: ‘So vaccinated people can’t spread COVID?’

Helen: ‘Oh no. They can spread COVID just as easily as an unvaccinated person.’

Ivan: ‘I don’t even know what I’m hearing anymore. Look. I’m not sick.'

Helen: ‘Ok.’

Ivan: ‘And the guy you let in IS sick.’

Helen: ‘That’s right.’

Ivan: ‘Nevermind. I’ll just put on my mask.’

Helen: ‘That’s fine.’

Ivan: ‘Now I can go in?’

Helen: ‘Absolutely not!’

Ivan: ‘But I have a mask on!’

Helen: ‘Doesn’t matter.’

Ivan: ‘I was able to come in here yesterday with a mask on.’

Helen: ‘I know.’

Ivan: ‘So the mask is no good anymore.’

Helen: ‘No, it’s still good.’

Ivan: ‘But I can’t come in?’

Helen: ‘Correct.’

Ivan: ‘Why not?’

Helen: ‘Because you’re unvaccinated.’

Ivan: ‘But the mask prevents the germs from getting out.’

Helen: ‘Yes, but people can still catch your germs.’

Ivan: ‘But they’re all vaccinated.’

Helen: ‘Because you are unvaccinated and vaccinated people can catch your germs and get sick'

Ivan: 'So isn’t really to protect me from getting sick, is it?'

Helen:' I'm just doing my job, I don't know anything... '
