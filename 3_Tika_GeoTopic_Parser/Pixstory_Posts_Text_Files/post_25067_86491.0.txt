The troubles for Everton seem to exceed far beyond the playing field at the moment. The Toffees could now be handed a points deduction as they have violated the profit and sustainability rules of the English Premier League. A points deduction at this stage of the season could place them directly in the relegation zone.

The Merseyside team have accumulated losses worth of £260m from 2017-2020. The club is in the process of negotiating with the Premier League, as to the losses that can be set off due to the covid-19 pandemic. In an ideal scenario, the league does not allow clubs to exceed losses further than £105m over the course of three years.

Everton are yet to submit final accounts for the 2020-21 season, which was due to be submitted in December. The club are expected to have occurred a further loss of £100m last season, which puts their future in jeopardy. Adding salt to the wounds is the fact that they were forced to cut ties with key sponsor, Alisher Usmanov which could cost them millions in the coming years.

All clubs had been informed to submit their final accounts by end of last year. The inspection process generally takes around a couple of months, and the clubs guilty of breaching the rules are handed a points deduction at the end of the season. Premier League have allowed clubs to set off losses arising due to covid-19, but there is no definite criteria in that regard.

Everton went on a buying spree in the summer of 2020, but their financial struggles led them to having a very subdued summer last year. With the club languishing in the bottom half of the table, a points deduction is the last thing Everton want at this point.
