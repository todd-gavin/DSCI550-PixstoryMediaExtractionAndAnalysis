As the exit polls show, BJP might become the largest party in Manipur with 25 to 32 seats in its kitty. Congress will be becoming the opposition in the north eastern state by getting around 12-17 seats. A party requires 31 seats to form the government in the state.

Exit polls do not always get it right. The final results will be revealed only today, after the  count ends.
