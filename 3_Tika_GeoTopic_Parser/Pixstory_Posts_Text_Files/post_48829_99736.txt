Your arguments make sense Like therapeutic cloning It is done to produce embryonic stem cells by cloning an embryo Similarly the organ replication one is great too However reproductive cloning for one of the things you mentioned ticks me off a little bit Yes cloning humans would give people babies without going through life threatening pregnancies or without needing a surrogate Queer couples can have their own children All that is true and there s no denying that But here s a question how ethical is that Reproducing humans for such selfish purposes is nothing that we don t already do We bring kids to life without caring about their well being so many times Childcare is close to nothing in most parts of the world Children are subjected to all sorts of cruelty yet we only focus on the birth part of it So many kids are in need of homes but instead of giving them that we continue to bring more into this world Tell me how ethical it is to bring babies that you know have an extremely high chance of chronic illnesses and other sorts of complications only because you want your own blood So basically giving them a life full of physical and mental miseries in a system that has marginalized their likes to the point they don t even receive basic help like making buildings wheelchair friendly is somehow justified because it gives people the sense of possession I think like Mr Wesson suggested rich people who re capable of bringing changes on the planet should focus more on making the world more feasible for the under privileged and then go do these otherworldly experiments that in the end put marginalized people s lives more on stake and would take nothing away from the rich
