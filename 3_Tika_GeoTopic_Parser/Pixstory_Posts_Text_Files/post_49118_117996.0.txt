Active learning is a something of that's not a part of homeschooling. Inside the classroom, students pick things very rapidly. Students are better able to actively learn the lessons being taught by the teacher thanks to one-on-one student-teacher interactions. This is frequently the standout aspect of conventional education.

Homeschooling takes away socializing from students. They are not able to meet kids their age and make friends. Other than that, the sense of discipline usually goes away.

Studying at home is also isolating and can cause children to feel lonely. And most importantly, parents are not professionals. They just can't teach everything to their kids while also working their own jobs. It's simply not practical. Learning from a parent and from a teacher is different. 

Homeschooling is a bad idea that takes children away from making friends, learning to grow in an open atmosphere, problem solving skills and most importantly empathy that comes from meeting people.
