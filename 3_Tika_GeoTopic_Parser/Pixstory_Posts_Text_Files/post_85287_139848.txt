Liverpool opened their UEFA Champions League campaign with an embarrassing loss to Napoli The Reds looked like a mere shadow of their former selves whilst Luciano Spalletti s nbsp Napoli side played a near perfect game Jurgen Klopp s side found themselves behind early in the game after Zielinski slotted in a penalty in the first minutes of the game Not long later Victor Osmihen had a chance to double Napoli s lead with a second penalty but it was saved by Alisson The travelling Liverpool fans believed this would be the turning point but it wasn t the case Goals fromZambo Anguissa and Giovanni Simeone saw the Reds down at half time Liverpool had to make a strong start in the second half if they had any chance of getting back into the game Unfortunately this wasn t the case and Jurgen Klopp s side conceded yet another goal in the th minute of the game However Liverpool were quick to reply as Luis Diaz took a sublime strike from the edge of the box to give Liverpool a goal This didn t prove to be enough and there were no more goals from either side through the rest of the game The issues for Liverpool lay in midfield which has been the case in many of their recent games Liverpool failed to control the tempo of the game in the middle of the pitch and this made Napoli s transitions from defence to attack too easy A side with as much attacking quality as Napoli were always going to pounce on these midfield vulnerabilities and ensure nbsp nbsp Reds were punished Jurgen Klopp did make changes to the midfield bringing on Thiago Alcantara and giving Arthur Melo his Liverpool debut However these changes were evidently too little too late and it appeared that Klopp had already given up on the game andwas just resting his main players Credit must also be given to Spalletti s Napoli side for their impressive performance Defensively Napoli proved to be tricky to break down and the Liverpool defenders struggled to cope with the counter attacks Spalletti s side were the better side and thoroughly deserved all three points
