We actually don't know what we gave our earth ? 

We all know that garbage and pollution makes our earth polluted and we do not still think about it.

-In spite of knowing it all, we continuously cut trees.
- We still using plastics .
-Throw garbage anywhere.
Many more such things we are doing daily .

We should have to think about it .

Now, here some steps to bring a change and we can bring a change together.

1) Use menstrual cup .No pad waste pad take 500 years to decompose per a down to earth article. 

2) We compost our waste. All cooked food leftovers, peels , veggie waste. 

3) Take your own cloth bag and dabbas. While grocery shopping avoid that useless plastic bag that you use for 10 min .

4 ) Most important thing to aware people about that .it's our duty to clean our earth and serve it as to coming generations.
