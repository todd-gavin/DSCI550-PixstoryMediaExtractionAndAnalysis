Individuals can use this simple breathing exercise while standing, sitting, or lying down to reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and panic. However, people should also consider adding it to their daily routine to get the most benefit.

1. Loosen any clothing that could restrict breathing and choose a comfortable position.

2. If lying down, place the arms slightly away from the sides with the palms facing up. Position the legs comfortably. If sitting or standing, place the feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.

3. Breathe in gently through the nose for a count of up to five, allowing the breath to flow deeply into the belly without force.

4. Then, without pausing or holding the breath, breathe out through the mouth for a count of up to five.

5. Continue the exercise for 3â€“5 minutes.
