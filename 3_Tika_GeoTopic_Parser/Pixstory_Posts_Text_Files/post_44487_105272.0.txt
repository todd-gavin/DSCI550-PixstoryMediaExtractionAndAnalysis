Austria and Denmark both beat stronger opposition and will be looking to continue their good start as they face off in Group 1 League A UEFA Nations League in Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna on Monday night.

Austria under new boss Ralf Ragnick put 3 past Croatia without reply, while Denmark cameback to beat reigning world champions France 2-1.

Austria will be looking to steady the ship after gaining promotion from League B last time out, with a good attacking form at their side - having scored in the previous eight UEFA Nations League matches.

Denmark come into the fixture in great form, with 11 wins out of their last 14 matches in all 
competitions.

Austria vs Denmark: Probable Playing XI

Austria: Heinz Lindner (GK); Maximilian Wober, Kevin Danso, Gernot Trauner; Konrad Laimer, Christoph Baumgartner, Christopher Trimmel, Andreas Weimann, Marcel Sabitzer; Marko Arnautovic, Michael Gregoritsch

Denmark: Kasper Schmeichel (GK); Joakim Maehle, Jannik Vestergaard, Joachim Andersen, Victor Nelsson; Thomas Delaney, Pierre Emile-Hojbjerg, Mikkel Damsgaard; Christian Eriksen, Robert Skov, Andreas Cornelius

Austria vs Denmark: Predictions

While Austria are benefiting from the new manager bounce under Ralf Ragnick, Denmark have had them beat in previous appearances - including a 4-0 scoreline. Denmark are a slightly better team on paper and expect the same to reflect in the scoreline this week.

Prediction: Austria 1 - 2 Denmark
