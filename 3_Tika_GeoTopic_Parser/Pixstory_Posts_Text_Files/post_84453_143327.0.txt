What's the one thing that you would like to change about your city or town to make it a better place?
Nomoshkar!!!
I am from Oxford Of Bengal, a heritage city of Nadia district. If you are from West Bengal then definitely you have guessed the name, 
Yes, it is Nabadwip.
It is regarded as a holy place by Hindus, and is the birthplace of the sage Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Famous for Rass festival where city is enlited with lights, idols of God and goddesses are made on each corner of Nabadwip town. Hundreds of people gather to this small town on the occasion of raas utsab.
But the only thing that I would like to change in my city is the drinking water problem. 
In few areas people are facing problem with the drinking water. It is totally contaminated due to huge amount of Arsenic and because of these peope are suffering from varoius health issues like skin problem, diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery etc. In long term it may effect the future generations of the city. 
So, what I think is Nabadwip Municipality should take immediate steps to carryout this issue.
