All round me are words, and words and words, 
They grow on me like leaves, they never 
Seem to stop their slow growing 
From within... But I tell my self, words 
Are a nuisance, beware of them, they 
Can be so many things, a 
Chasm where running feet must pause, to 
Look, a sea with paralyzing waves, 
A blast of burning air or, 
A knife most willing to cut your best 
Friend's throat... Words are a nuisance, but. 
They grow on me like leaves ona tree, 
They never seem to stop their coming, 
From a silence, somewhere deep within...
