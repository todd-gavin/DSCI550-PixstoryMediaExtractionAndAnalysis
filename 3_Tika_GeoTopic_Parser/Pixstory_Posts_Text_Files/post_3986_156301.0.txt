Onam went by a month ago and I did celebrate it at its best at the northern side of the country. But some delicacies can never be missed and when your family keeps a promise of treating you once you get back home, they keep it. 
Finally after much wait, this dish which is Pallada Payasam (Kheer) which goes perfect with a papadam or with a banana is worth all the wait.
