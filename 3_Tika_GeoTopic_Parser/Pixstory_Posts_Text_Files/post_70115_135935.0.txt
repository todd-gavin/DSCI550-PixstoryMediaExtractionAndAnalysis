FC Goa  will begin their Indian Super League league campaign for the 2022-23 season on October 12 when they take on Emami East Bengal in Kolkata. 
Two more away games - against Chennaiyin FC and Hyderabad FC on October 21 and October 29, respectively - await the Gaurs before they play their first home match.
It has been over two years since the FC Goa faithful last saw their beloved team at the iconic Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Fatorda. The wait ends on Thursday, November 3 when Jamshedpur FC pay a visit for what will be Carlos Peña's first home game as an FC Goa Head Coach.
November 20 will mark an interesting battle for the Gaurs as former head coach Juan Ferrando leads his current troop of Mariners. 
Thursday, February 23, marks the end of FC Goa’s league phase and they lock horns with Bengaluru FC in an away fixture.
