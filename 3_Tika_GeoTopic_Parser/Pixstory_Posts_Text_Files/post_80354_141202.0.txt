Juventus vs Salernitana Match Prediction
Juventus and Salernitana have had very similar fortunes in Serie A 2022/23 so far. Juventus have shockingly underperformed in the first few matches of Serie A so far. 
They have played 5 matches so far, won 2 and lost 3 matches. They are currently 4 points behind the table toppers Atalanta. Salernitana have had a similar outing. They played 5 matches and are currently placed in 10th place with 6 points.
However, Juventus showed signs of improvement in their UCL match against Paris Saint Germain and although they lost that match, it proved that they can improve a lot with time. With all that said, we predict that Juve will defeat Salernitana in their upcoming match with somedifficulty.
