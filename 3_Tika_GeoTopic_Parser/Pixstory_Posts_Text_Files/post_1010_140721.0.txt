Casper Ruud is the real deal 
First things first. This time around, the US open is not a  big draw in terms of star power. 
Still, Rudd is a show stealer. 
There are more spectacular players around the sport, characters who generate more attention and hype, but Ruud has continued at his own pace, looking to improve every time he steps into the court. The result is two grand slam finals in a single year, an achievement none of his more prominent contemporaries have yet pulled off.
This time, with no 13-times French Open champion on the other side, a great opportunity awaits. Whether he can take it or not, the 23-year-old has made his intentions clear for the coming years. When Novak Djokovic and Nadal finally depart, the men’s draws may continue to open up and more opportunities will be there. With hard work, humility and a cool head, Ruud will continue to be in the frame.
