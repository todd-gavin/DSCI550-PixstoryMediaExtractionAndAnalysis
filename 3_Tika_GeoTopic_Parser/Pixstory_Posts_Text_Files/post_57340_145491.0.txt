I think these points should be kept in mind while dealing with criticism.
Sometimes we cannot understand what might affect our work in a good or bad way; there, we need constructive criticism.
It can guide you to make a better understanding of your work.
No evaluation or opinion should be taken personally. Even if you find you're being criticised unfairly, never try to retaliate with extreme reactions. It will instead aggravate the situation.
This helps in the professional world because people are going to say things that might seem personal now and then, and it's ok to dislike it, but don't be offended by someone's remarks.
Every good professional's trait is that they take criticism well without feeling they're personally attacked.
Also, choosing a correct form of language in response to criticism is equally necessary.
Try to avoid arguments instead, and turn the exchange into a discussion about how to resolve the problem.
Instead of choosing your words to respond, choose your actions to do it, which can be done by improving your field of work.
