Abstract

Background and Aims

Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is associated with increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We aimed to investigate the impact of stress hyperglycemia on long-term mortality after AMI in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM).

Methods and Results

We included 2 089 patients with AMI between February 2014 and March 2018. SHR was measured with the fasting glucose divided by the estimated average glucose derived from glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The primary endpoint was all-cause death. Of 2 089 patients (mean age: 65.7±12.4, 76.7% were men) analyzed, 796 (38.1%) had DM. Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, 141 (6.7%) and 150 (7.2%) all-cause deaths occurred in the diabetic and nondiabetic cohorts, respectively. Compared with participants with low SHR (<1.24 in DM; <1.14 in non-DM), the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for those with high SHR (≥1.24 in DM; ≥1.14 in non-DM) for all-cause mortality were 2.23 (1.54-3.23) and 1.79 (1.15-2.78); for cardiovascular mortality were 2.42 (1.63-3.59) and 2.10 (1.32-3.35) in DM and non-DM subjects, respectively. The mortality prediction was improved in the diabetic individuals with the incorporation of SHR into the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, showing an increase in a continuous net reclassification index of 0.184 (95%CI: 0.003-0.365) and an absolute integrated discrimination improvement of 0.014 (95%CI: 0.002-0.025).

Conclusion

The improvement in the prediction of long-term mortality beyond the GRACE score indicates the potential of SHR as a biomarker for post-MI risk stratification among patients with DM.
