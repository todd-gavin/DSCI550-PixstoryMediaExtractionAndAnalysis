According to media reports, Shyam Mangaram foundation, an NGO, has filed a complaint stating, “Last week we saw many nude photographs were clicked in such a manner that any male or female will feel ashamed about it”. The complaint also emphasised that these kinds of acts should be strongly opposed. As per a report published in Times Now, a complaint has been filed under Section 67A of the IT Act along with Sections 292, 293, 354, and 509 of the Indian Penal Code for insulting women’s modesty. 😧😧

Meanwhile, several celebs from the industry have come out in Ranveer’s support after his pics went viral. Recently, Alia Bhatt was quizzed about the same, to which she stated, “I don't like anything negative said about my favourite co-star Ranveer Singh...toh main yeh question ko bardasht bhi nahi kar sakti (I can’t even tolerate this question). I love him, he's eternally favourite to every one of us actually and he has given us so much in the movies. We should only give him love”.❤️❤️
