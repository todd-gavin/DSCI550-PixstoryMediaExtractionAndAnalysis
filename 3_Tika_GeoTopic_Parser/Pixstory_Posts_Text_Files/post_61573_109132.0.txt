Wrestling Industry is going through a tough time. 

While wrestling did have incredible highs this year, like seeing Seth Rollins in the Shield Gear back again. Witnessing CM Punk win a wrestling champion after 8 years away from wrestling, or watching STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN open up One Last Can on Kevin Owens in the main event of Wrestlemania. 

But since then, it has been a downward spiral for all the wrestling world. We have seen only One Title Defense by Roman in the past 3 months. 

CM Punk, Kenny Omega, Daniel Bryan are all out with injuries. CM Punk won and had to give  up the title in less than a week. 

The Legend Killer Randy Orton who was supposed to face Roman at Summerslam is out with a back injury which will make sure that he misses out the rest of the year. 

Cody Rhodes who became a household name all over the world, got sidelined due to a torn pec for the next 9 months. 

To top it all of, we have only seen the light of the Vince McMahon scandal yet. 

Whatever the future holds, I hope it's better than the present of wrestling.
