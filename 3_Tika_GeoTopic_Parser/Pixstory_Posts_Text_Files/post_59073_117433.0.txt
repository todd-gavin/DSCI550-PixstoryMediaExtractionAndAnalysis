Yeap! looking at the sewers barely you feel disgusted. Imagine people going inside that sewer and being in it for a while and cleaning it. 

Isnâ€™t it horrible? 

347 people have died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in India in the last five years. Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Delhi account for 40% of these fatalities, according to government data.

Manual scavenging is a forbidden under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation (PEMSR) Act, 2013.

The Act prohibits the use of any individual for manually cleaning, carrying, disposing of or otherwise handling in any manner, human excreta till its disposal.

Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Virendra referring to the problem said the government has proposed the National Action Plan for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE)' a scheme that aims to bring the number of such fatalities to zero and ensure that all sanitation work is performed by skilled workers and no sanitation workers come in direct contact with human faecal matter.
