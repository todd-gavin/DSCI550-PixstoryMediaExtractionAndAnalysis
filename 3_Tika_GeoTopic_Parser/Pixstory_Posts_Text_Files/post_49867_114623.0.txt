Federal law would be the fastest way according to President Joe Biden to restore abortion rights as he signed an order to safeguard abortion access. 

The presidential order signed by  Joe Biden will have a limited impact and will surely mitigate some of the restrictions but will not fully restore abortion rights.

Mr. Biden has maintained that his ability to institute abortion rights is limited without action from the US Congress.

"The fastest route to restore Roe is to pass a national law codifying Roe," Biden said, referring to the landmark 1973 ruling that guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion.

He also focused on the recent horrible report on how a 10-year-old was forced to travel to a neighboring state for abortion after she was sexually abused.

"Imagine being a little girl. Just imagine being a little girl, 10 years old. Does anyone believe that?" he said.

Mr. Biden's new executive order strengthens the protection against potential penalties that women seeking abortion may face if they travel across state lines for the procedure, and protects access to contraception.

 It also includes access to abortion medication. The order also takes additional steps to protect patient privacy, including by addressing the transfer and sales of sensitive health-related data and combatting digital surveillance related to reproductive health care services.

A White House official warned that women should be wary of apps that track their menstrual periods after the rollback of federal abortion rights. Biden is under so much pressure amidst the midterms and he trying to protect abortion rights in a way that will favor him in the midterms but to what extent we didn't know.
