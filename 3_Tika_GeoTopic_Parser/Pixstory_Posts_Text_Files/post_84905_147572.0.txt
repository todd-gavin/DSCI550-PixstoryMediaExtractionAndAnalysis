Kylian Mbappe produced a brilliant solo goal against Austria in the Nations League fixture on Thursday evening (September 22).
Heading into the game winless in the tournament so far, the World Cup winners were in danger of relegation. Though France was dominant in the first half, they couldn’t find a way to net a goal.
The deadlock was finally broken in the 56th minute when Mbappe took the book roughly 40yards away from Austria’s goalpost. He then went left and right to dismantle the whole defense and finally found the back of the net with a powerful shot.
The goal sums up why there is so much buzz around the 23-year-old and justifies PSG’s position to make him the highest-paid footballer in the world.

Just nine minutes later, Austria dealt another blow when Olivier Giroud beat Patrick Pentz to give France a firm hold on the match. The match ended 2-0 in favor of Didier Deschamps’ side.
It was their first victory in the ongoing UEFA Nations League and will also give them a boost as they prepare for the upcoming Qatar World Cup, which is just two months away now.
Mbappe’s controversy before the game
A controversy broke out this week when Kylian Mbappe refused to take part in the France national team’s photoshoot due to a dispute over his image rights. Though the PSG forward donates all his commercials from the national side to charity, he is against promoting fast food and gambling brands.
KFC, a sponsor of France, threatened to take legal action after Mbappe refused to take part in the promotion. However, they turned it down by saying that they have no issues with the forward not doing ads.
However, the controversy didn’t affect Mbappe’s doings on the field as his goal helped his side take the lead and then seal a vital game. France will next face Denmark on Sunday(September 25).
