A group of Yale scientists injected a chemical cocktail into dead pigs to revive their cells. It worked. The New York Times reports it, explaining how the pigs&#39; hearts started beating again while the solution circulated in the veins and arteries. The cells heart, liver, kidney and brain worked again The animals never stiffened as expected The researchers&#39; findings come after a similar experiment four years ago when they discovered that brain cells from dead pigs could be reanimated A practical implication just to be clear could be that it is useful for increasing the number of human organs available for transplantation The technology could also be used to prevent serious damage to the heart after devastating heart attacks or to the brain after severe strokes But they are currently only hypothesis For now, researchers are wondering about the scientific definition of death Pigs were not considered conscious in any way yet their apparently dead cells revived The question still remains Are there reversible forms of death Or not
