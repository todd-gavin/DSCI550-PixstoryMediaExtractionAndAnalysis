1. God of Destruction (파괴의신)

Although he seems cute and fluffy on the outside, RM is actually very clumsy and unco-ordinated. He once bought some sunglasses and broke them the first time he tried to put them on. Also, he spilled a drink during Endplate King (Rookie King Episode 6). The time when he tried to cut onions on Weekly Idol is also very iconic, because he failed miserably and had to have assistance from Jin (Namjin!). RM is never too hard to find, since he leaves a path of destruction behind him. Bless him!

2. RipMon (찌몬)

This name has a similar origin to the previous one. During their live concept trailer performance on Music Bank, the boys were supposed to rip off their police shirts to reveal the white tank tops underneath, but RM and Jimin ripped both layers by accident. Jimin only tore one strap, but RM's tank top had been ripped at both of the shoulders. He had to hold it up during the rest of the action-packed performance, and was totally distraught at the end. However, he still tried his best and aced the dance.

3. Joonie (준이)

Just a cuter way of saying Namjoon :smile:

4. Rapjoon (랩준)

A combination of 'Rap Monster' and 'Namjoon'. RM really owns the stage when he raps, performing with accuracy, stability and power! He released his first solo mixtape in 2015, titled 'RM', which recieved a lot of love. He even teased part of his next mixtape, 'RM 2', in march 2018.

5. Kim Leader (김리더)

A nickname that V and Jimin like to use. Kim is RM's surname and he is the leader of Bangtan, so the meaning is quite self-explanatory. RM is truly the perfect leader. His confidence and knowledge are admirable, and he works so hard to produce the quality content that us ARMYs are lucky enough to see. Don't forget the fact that he's trilingual! RM is especially helpful and prominent throughout American interviews, in which he speaks in English and translates the questions to the others.

Happy birthday uri world best leader kim namjoon a.k.a RM(Rap monster)
