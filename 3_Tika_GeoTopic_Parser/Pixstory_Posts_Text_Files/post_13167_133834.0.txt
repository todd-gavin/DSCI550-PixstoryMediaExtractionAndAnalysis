A group of protesting women have founded a library called "Zen" in Kabul city.
This library was established by the "Spontaneous Protesting Women of Afghanistan" movement with the financial cooperation of the "Crystal Bayat" Foundation. This foundation is also from one of the protesting women who lives in America.
This movement says that the purpose of establishing this library is to grow and strengthen the culture of reading among women and provide free books for girls and women who do not have the financial ability to buy books or are deprived of work.
Women protestors say that removing women from public life is the first and most prominent order of the Taliban after the group took control of Afghanistan.
The Taliban have not allowed girls above the sixth grade to go to school. This group of women employees in the majority of government offices has also made them stay at home.
