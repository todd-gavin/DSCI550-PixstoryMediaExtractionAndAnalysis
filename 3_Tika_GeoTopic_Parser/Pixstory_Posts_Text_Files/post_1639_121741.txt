One of the most poignant images of the Titanic disaster is of a young newsboy outside the White Star Line offices in London holding an Evening News poster announcing Titanic Disaster Great Loss of Life The newsboy was Ned Parfett born in and one of four brothers from Cornwall Road Waterloo Tragically six and a half years after this picture was taken Ned was killed while serving with the British army in France He was Ned enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery in serving as a despatch driver then moving onto reconnaissance duties He was awarded the Military Medal and mentioned in despatches for his gallant conduct during a series of missions at the front He died on October just two weeks before the end of the war when a shell landed on the Quartermaster s stores as he was picking up some clothes before going on leave After his death the officer who recommended Ned for special recognition wrote to one of his brothers On many occasions he accompanied me during severe shelling and I always placed the greatest confidence in him Ned Parfett was buried in the British war cemetery at Verchain Maugr in France
