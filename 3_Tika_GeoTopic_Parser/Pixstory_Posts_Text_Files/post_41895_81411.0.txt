Mediterranean cuisine is the food and methods of preparation used by the people of the Mediterranean Basin. The idea of a Mediterranean cuisine originates with the cookery writer Elizabeth David's book, A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950) and was amplified by other writers working in English. 
Mediterranean food has been lauded in the press as the key to a long and healthy life, so go ahead and feast upon fresh chickpea salads, a slice of spanakopita and every now and then, some classic Greek lamb? We're firm believers that a dollop of tzatziki, hummus or a herby yogurt dressing can improve any dish and we're big fans of crumbly feta and golden-brown grilled halloumi.
