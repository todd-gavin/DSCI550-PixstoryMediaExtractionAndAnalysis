Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives is a non-fiction book written in 2016  by British journalist and writer Gary Younge.

 The book focuses on the stories of 10 American children and teenagers, varying from the ages of 9 to 19, killed by gun violence within 24 hours on November 23, 2013. 

Younge analyzes how the deaths are "normal" by American standards—in that none of the stories made national news—but not "normal" by civilized standards. The book was published by Nation Books.

Writing for The Guardian, Gillian Slovo wrote in her review said "The stories that Younge has uncovered are often sensational but he tells them without hyperbole and accompanies them with an analysis that lays bare the reality of being black and poor in America".

 Slovo finishes her review by writing, "Despite the composure of his writing, there is passion in Younge’s condemnation of a system that renders the poor and the dark in America invisible. In illuminating the stories of some of these people and their communities, Younge has provided us with a beautifully told and empathic account that wrenches at the heart even as it continues to engage the brain."

This book is important as it will make us realise from a third-person point of view how gun lax laws are ridiculous. Being a journalist Gary has reported the news-which makes this a very powerful book as many national headlines ignored them.
