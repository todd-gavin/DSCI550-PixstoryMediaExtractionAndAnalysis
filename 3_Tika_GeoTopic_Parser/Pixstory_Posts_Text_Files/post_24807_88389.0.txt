Simeone Inzaghi's men have now registered only one win in seven Serie A games after a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina on Saturday. With Milan doing their business over Cagliari later in the evening, Inter are now six points behind the top spot. The point gained was a valuable one for La Viola in their fight for European football.



Fiorentina started brightly with their high press forcing turnovers in Inter's half. Nicolas Gonzalez tested Samir Handanovic from 25 yards with a powerful drive. The 37-year-old was forced to make another save minutes later, this time from Saponara. Inter were pinned inside their box this period as the La Viola duo came close once again. Despite their chances, the final pass wasn't falling.



Hence, the Nerazzurri got back into the game later in the first half. Terracciano brilliantly saved Dzeko's shot on the slide as Vidal wildly missed a chance from close range. Lautaro Martinez found the back of the net just before the break only to be flagged offside.



Second half burst into life with Inter capitalising on a careless give away by Gonzalez leading to Vidal firing at Terracciano and Barella blazing the rebound. Fiorentina took the lead shortly after. The Argentinian made amend for his error by surging into Inter's box and setting up Lucas Torreira for an easy finish. The ex-Arsenal midfielder scored for back to back games, having lost a tooth early in the match.



Celebrations were cut short as the holders responded five minutes later. Both wingbacks combined for the equaliser with Ivan Perisic crossing from the right and Dumfries meeting it at the far post with an excellent header. Inter thought they got a penalty in the 62nd minute but VAR correctly ruled it out after referee Daniele Chiffi pointed to the spot. Substitute Jonathan Ikone almost won it for the away side in the last minute but Handanovic denied him twice.
