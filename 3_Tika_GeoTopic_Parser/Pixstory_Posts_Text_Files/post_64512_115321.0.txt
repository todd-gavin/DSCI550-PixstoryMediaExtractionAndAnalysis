You don't know how beautiful you are - with the magic and uniqueness that you have been carrying within you for so long. Never doubt your strength because you've come so far. It's your journey and you should be proud of it. 
It's okay if you fail sometimes, there might be so many obstacles on the road you choose to walk on but you are not allowed to stop. Keep going on. Pause for a while in case you are tired. Do not forget to expand yourself every day. 

You fail, You learn and eventually, you'll grow.
