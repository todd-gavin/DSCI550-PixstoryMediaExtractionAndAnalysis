The Russian Federation's foreign ministry expressed readiness to mediate between the Islamic Emirate and its "opponents."  

The remarks were made by the Russian foreign ministry's spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, in a press conference in Moscow.  

"There have been no contacts with Russia in this regard. But if we were asked based on regulations, we will be ready to facilitate the negotiations between the new Afghan authorities and their opponent forces," she told a press conference.  

But the Islamic Emirate downplays its political opponents, calling them "not serious" and saying that the chance for negotiations with those who fled the country has been squandered. 

"We don't have any political opponents. However, those who left the country and fled have also lost the chance for negotiations because we were ready for negotiations in the first place," said Islamic Emirate spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid.

This comes as earlier a delegation of the Islamic Emirate, led by acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi, met with Ahmad Massoud, leader of the Resistant Front, and Ismail Khan, the former Herat governor, in Iran.  

Muttaqi confirmed his meeting with Ahmad Massoud and Ismail Khan and said he assured them that they could come back and live in Afghanistan "without any worries."  

But will such a meeting be effective for the ongoing situation in Afghanistan?  

"The current Afghan problems cannot be solved without negotiations. Therefore, we are hopeful that such meetings be held, so the Afghan issues can be solved via (talks),' said Moeen Samkani, leader of Hezb-e-Haq Wa Adalat. 

"The Islamic Emirate should talk with its opposition groups and reach a good decision," said Sayed Hashim, a political analyst.  

The international community has repeatedly voiced its dissatisfaction over the lack of an inclusive government in Afghanistan.
