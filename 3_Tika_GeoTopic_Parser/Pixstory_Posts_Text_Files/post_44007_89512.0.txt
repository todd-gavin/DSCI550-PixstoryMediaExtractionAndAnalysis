Bukayo Saka, an Arsenal winger, is a huge worry for England's next friendly against Switzerland and may withdraw from the Three Lions team.

Saka was involved in training on Tuesday, but he missed the following day's session and was still too ill to play on Thursday, just two days before England hosts Switzerland at Wembley.

The 20-year-old has tested negative for Covid-19 so far, and if he continues to do so, he might be back in time for his country's second match of the international break, which takes place on Tuesday against Ivory Coast.

Saka, though, is a huge worry for the weekend's encounter, according to the Evening Standard, and if he does not recover quickly, he may have to withdraw entirely.

Since naming his squad for the two friendlies last week, England manager Gareth Southgate has already had to make adjustments.

Trent Alexander-Arnold and Reece James, forward Tammy Abraham, and goalkeeper Sam Johnstone - who was brought in to replace Aaron Ramsdale, who was injured - have all been forced to withdraw from the team.

Kyle Walker-Peters of Southampton and Tyrick Mitchell of Crystal Palace have been called up in their place, while goalkeeper Fraser Forster has returned to the squad for the first time since 2017.

Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa was also brought in to replace Roma striker Abraham.

England vs Switzerland head-to-head record:
Switzerland has only won three of the 27 meetings between the two countries, the most recent of which was in May 1981.

Since then, England has gone on a 12-game unbeaten streak against Switzerland, which includes nine wins and three draws.

Their most recent match occurred in the summer of 2019, when the two teams were battling for third place in the Nations League.

Jordan Pickford was the hero in a dreary match that ended goalless and went to penalties, where he scored one and saved another to seal the victory.
