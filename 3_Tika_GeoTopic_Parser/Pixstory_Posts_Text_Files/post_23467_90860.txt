The Ajanta Ellora caves despite being on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list have never featured in my list of go to places Maybe it s something to do with caves never been too enthusiastic about what one visualizes to be dark dingy places never mind the treasures found within But since we were in the vicinity now as conscientious parents we feel the child must be exposed to history art in it s natural dwelling So we set off early in the morning to beat the heat that the stone cut caves start radiating even in winter from Aurangabad which is about kms away The old tree lined highway is being widened the way is littered with the remnants of the living history which is what I think trees are exposing carcasses of roots some the size of our vehicle The end of an era of old canopied routes providing travelers with shade succour in the pre airconditioned days A short bus ride takes us from the parking near the Visitor Centre which has been developed with Japanese aid to the winding shallow gorge drained by the Waghora river where the caves have been carved out of the horseshoe shaped side of the gorge It seems to preserve the immediate environs of the caves adds to their aura of remoteness although there is a full fledged restaurant Which we are more appreciative of at the end of our round of the caves loos and the ticketing counter near the caves where we disembark
