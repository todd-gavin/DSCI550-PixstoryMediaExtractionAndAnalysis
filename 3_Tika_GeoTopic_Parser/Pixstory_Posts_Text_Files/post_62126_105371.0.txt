Never in the history of the sport have 3 individuals been so evenly matched that you cannot decide a better player between them. 

French Open saw Nadal and Novak reignite their rivalry as they faced off for the 59th time in their careers, where Nadal has won 29 times while Noval has 30 victories over him. A crazy balance for the two as they share this with Roger Federer who is certainly in the last phase of his career. 

These three have surpassed every record in the sport and have always been the center of the attention in Tennis for the last 2 decades with sheer dominance and with no intention to stop. 

A 36 year old Rafa Nadal has conquered Australian Open AND French Open just this year, and has 22 Grand Slam titles while his rivals have 20 each. 

Achieving this feat at any point in your career is nothing short of extraordinary, but to do it at 36 years of age is just maddening. 

Nadal has often stated that he is unphased by the talks of the GOAT title, as he is lucky to share this mantle with Nole and Federer. 

But the fans and pundits cannot help but notice that there is a good chance that Federer might never get to 22 Grand Slams, and while Novak is still in his prime, Nadal is still a formidable opponent who will do anything to protect his legacy. 

Nadal has been dominant ever since we saw him win his first Grand Slam, and he is still dominant today, he is an ambassador for the sport, and his humility makes him the perfect athlete all around. 

This debate may certainly never be over, but we cannot shy away from the fact that Nadal is inching closer and closer, with every competition that he faces in, to the title of GREATEST OF ALL TIME
