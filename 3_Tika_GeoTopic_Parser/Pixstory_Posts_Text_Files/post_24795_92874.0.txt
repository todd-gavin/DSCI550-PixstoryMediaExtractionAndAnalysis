The 24 year old forward/winger is failing to provide what the club needs at the moment. 



59 goals from 200 league appearances for Manchester United. 21 matches this season , 11 starts, 4 goals, 2 assists. Is that enough for a player in his position and in this league's standards?



Let us check a similar role handled by a player from a top club, Raheem Sterling. He joined Manchester City in 2015 (same year as Rashford joined Manchester United) and has scored 88 goals from 219 matches. Sterling has played 24 matches this season, scoring 10 times and assisting for 3 goals. And that too after missing 9 big chances (Rashford 2). Sterling has taken 47 shots in total while Rashford 24, hitting target 12 times, while Sterling 24 times. This statistical difference is causing differences in field and results too. 


If we look at the Manchester United greats like Ronaldo and Rooney, story is the same: 


Cristiano Ronaldo

Games: 200

Goals: 87

Assists: 34


Wayne Rooney

Games: 200

Goals: 70

Assists: 41



Marcus Rashford

Games: 200

Goals: 59

Assists: 32



₹5.83 bln (77mln USD,  70Mln Euro) market valued Rashford needs to look into himself and bring his better performance to help Manchester United to avoid losses like the one against Everton. 2019-20 has been the best of him so far in the league with 17 goals from 31 matches. He has scored 11 goals in previous matches also.


Rashford has represented England 46 times and has scored 12 goals. He was the youngest player in 2016 Euros, and has been part of 2018 FIFA World cup. The fans and the country backed him when he was racially abused after the loss in Euro 2020. He was also awarded a Member of the Order of the British Empire. His activities and charity works have been hailed all over the world, but he needs to give more attention to football - the game he plays.
