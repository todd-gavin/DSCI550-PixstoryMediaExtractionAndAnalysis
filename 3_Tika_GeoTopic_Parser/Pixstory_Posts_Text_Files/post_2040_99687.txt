Recently Kentucky senator Mitch McConnell proposed a nationwide abortion ban that if the leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade became the eventual outcome On both a moral and a religious level people have strong feelings regarding abortion Many think that abortion is immoral because it takes away a potential life very often for the convenience of the mother though this is not always the case A woman may seek an abortion for instance if she is too young or cannot afford to support the child Obviously there are circumstances in which the mother s life is in jeopardy or the child may suffer if it is born with a certain condition As is the case in practically every other area states not courts determine what is lawful and criminal This has long been a tenet of the conservative justices perspectives on such matters A possible worry with a nationwide abortion ban is that the voices of those who reside in states where the majority supports abortion would not be heard just as the voices of those who oppose abortion have not been heard since the Roe v Wade decision If the Supreme Court s decision ultimately results in Roe v Wade being overturned would federally banning abortion make Republicans any worse than those who want to federally protect it
