Roberto Mancini ready to return to the national team bench in view of the next matches first of all the one with Argentina on June 1st valid for the Final between the winners of the America&#39;s Cup and the European Championship In these days the coach has seen around fifty players in Coverciano some of whom will be part of the national team of the future of the group that Mancini must build to restart after the bitter elimination in the playoffs of the World Cup The three days of internships were excellent we saw more players and almost all good with a great future, he said in the conference print If the national team can return to the center of plans I believe that the fact that we can work with young people during the week during the year is a positive thing Maybe something more could have been done in March but what will happen in the future I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t he can prepare for such an important match in one day here is the European Championship and failure to qualify for the World Cup All in just a few months Mancini has ever thought about resigning Sometimes one can think like this But then after that the national team is so important and the joy was so great that it is worth waiting When you win with the national team something totally different then in life never say never Every coach loved when he wins and when he doesn&#39;t win much less I see that people still have the European Championship in mind so most of the people I met comforted me That mitigated the disappointment of not qualifying a bit but the difference is that the undeserved lack of qualification We have to restart and be stronger than before
