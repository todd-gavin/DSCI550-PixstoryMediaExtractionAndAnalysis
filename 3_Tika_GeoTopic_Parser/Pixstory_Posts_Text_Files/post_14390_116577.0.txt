The Argentine took part in PSG’s first pre season game vs Quevilly-Rouen Métropole.

With a strong 45 minutes minutes to his name, Messi won the penalty for the French based team in the first half, which later was converted by Sergio Ramos to give them the lead. 

The Paris star looked sharp and seems very settled and feels like he’s at home… heading into the second season in Ligue 1.
