Manipuri Weighlifter Mirabai Chanu won India's first gold medal at Commonwealth Games 2022, after completing her 109kg first attempt in the clean and jerk round. Earlier, Chanu had opened up a massive 12kg lead over her nearest opponent, by lifting 88kg in the snatch round. 
Mirabai Chanu, one of India's top gold medal prospects, lived up to expectations by clinching the first gold medal for the country at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 in the women's 49kg weightlifting final. Chanu, who had won the gold four years ago in Gold Coast, not only defended her title successfully by lifting 201kgs (88kg in snatch and 113kg in clean and jerk) but set a Games record. Chanu's efforts secured India's third medal of the day â€“ all three in weightlifting after Sanket Sargar had won silver and Gururaj Poojary had claimed bronze in their respective events.
