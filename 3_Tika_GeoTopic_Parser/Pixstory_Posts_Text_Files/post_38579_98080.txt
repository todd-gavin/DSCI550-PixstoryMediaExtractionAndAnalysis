Defensive Ability The Dutchman is considered one of the best technicians but his defensive contributions are very underrated As per his data in fbref he ranks very low in defensive contributions But if one watches him play one can see that he is jumping to support his backline when Barca loses possession He is able to tackle intercept block and recover the ball while helping the other center backs to clear the danger He usually shuttles movement and not giving into tackles and not giving unnecessary fouls He usually assesses the situation before diving into tackle However he is aggressive when the opponent team is transitioning drawing fouls He has ranked per in committing fouls He is very inconsistent in pressurizing his opponent to commit a mistake as he has made a total of pressures out of which he has been successful only times in dispossessing his opponents He ranks only in successfully dispossessing his opponents From the above heatmap we can see that most of his defensive actions have come in the defensive third or in the middle third He has also made some actions in the attacking third but the majority are in the defensive and middle third Knack For Goal Frenkie has scored goals this season He has popped in at the right time to help his team sit in a comfortable position or score during a vital time But his goal scoring ability cannot be ignored From the above goal map and the heatmap we can see from where Frenkie has scored his goals All have come inside the six yards box Even though he has taken shots from outside the box but he has been successful inside the six yards Looking at his expected goals vs non penalty expected goals he ranks heads and shoulders above the other defensive midfielders Frenkie ranks percentile and per in expected goals and he ranks percentile and per in non penalty expected goals per shots taken
