Group L of the 2023 African Cup of Nations qualifying will begin with Mozambique and Rwanda battling it out at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. The two teams have Senegal and Benin as their competitors in the group.

Mozambique featured last in the competition in 2020 and would be eager to return to battle against the best teams of Africa. However, so far they have not fared to well in 2022 – losing twice and drawing once in the three matches they have played so far. 1-1, 2-1 and 1-0 were the scorelines against Mozambique in the last three outings, all coming in friendlies. Mozambique have just 1 out of their last 11 matches in all competitions.

Rwanda have featured once in the African Cup of Nations, in 2004 where they exited the group stages. They have played 2 friendlies so far, winning one and losing one both.
