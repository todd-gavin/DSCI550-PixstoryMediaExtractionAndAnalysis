We believe in many food myths like carrot is hood for eye sight, carbs are bad and so. Now are these true ?
Let's make a fact check. 

Myth: Carbs are bad. 

Truth: The right type of carbs are important for maintaining energy. 

Most of the time you might have heard bread is bad and low carb diet is an easy way to lose weight and get healthy. It is partially true that some carbs are high in calories and doesn't give you any health benefits but let's not generalise them all. Not all carbs are bad ones and each of them are different. You just need to find which is the right carb to function. Like say fruits and veggies are high in carbohydrates but they are nutritious as well. 

Myth: Eating once a day is a good way to lose weight. 

Truth: Infrequent or inconsistent mealtimes can cause your body to go into starvation mode. 

Intermittent fasting or eating all the calories in a one meal can give you a temporary weight loss. But this weight loss will come to halt and it could even give you a reverse effect. And it can make you more sluggish which is not sustainable and suitable for the long run. 

Myth: Consuming carrots will improve your vision. 

Truth: Carrots are good for you, but eating them in excess isn’t going to give you 20/20 vision.


By eating all carrots at home won't improve your eyesight.  Carrots do contain vitamin A and iys a host of other vitamins that nourishes your hair, nails, skins and more so you can include all kinds of fruit and leafy veggies and give the carrots some rest. 

Myth: You have to stop eating at a certain time at night to lose weight. 

Truth: Your body doesn’t shut down at night. 

Our body isn't putting its shutter down at night, it would just slow down its functioning. It would take sometime for digesting heavy food in the evening. But this doesn't mean that you have to avoid food completely after 6 or 7 just to lose weight. If you are hungry please eat healthy.
