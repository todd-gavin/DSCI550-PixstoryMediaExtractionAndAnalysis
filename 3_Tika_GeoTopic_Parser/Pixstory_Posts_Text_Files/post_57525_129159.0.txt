Sure, there should be a fair debate when we speak about classroom behaviour and teaching, but I don't think most of the teachers who are genuinely willing to teach will have this intent.
At the end of the day, all the difficulties fall upon them, not on parents because, on the parent's part, it's just their child who needs to be taken care of, but for a teacher, it's the whole classroom of many students.
However, surprisingly, they make it possible.
The work they do in keeping every kid with care is phenomenal.
For this, they need the support of those equal numbers of parents.

Honestly speaking, the constant predicament and stress surrounding their jobs have made the tutors quit their jobs; even research has found that "44 per cent of teachers said they were "very" or "fairly" likely to leave the profession within two years. Many teachers have already done so,
leaving some states in America with catastrophic staffing shortages for this school year and creating extra work for those who remain."

The figures are appalling, and the only way to stop this chaotic situation is by making parents understand the value of teachers' work so the journey could be made a little easier for them.
