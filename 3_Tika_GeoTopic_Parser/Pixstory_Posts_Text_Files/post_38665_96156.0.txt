When Batlle left Barcelona, she had vowed to return to the club one day as that club made her what she is today. 


This season, she may be on the move as according to rumors Leila Ouahabi of Barcelona has been linked to Manchester City. It’s a perfect time for Ona to make a move back to where she once honed her skills to be one of the best full-backs in the game. Chelsea are also rumored to be after her in the summer, or Man Utd has the option to trigger her additional one-year contract and keep her on board.
