When the first modern humans arose in East Africa sometime between and years ago the world was very different compared to today Perhaps the biggest difference was that we meaning people of our species Homo sapiens were only one of several types of humans or hominins that simultaneously existed on Earth From the well known Neanderthals and more enigmatic Denisovans in Eurasia to the diminutive hobbit Homo floresiensis on the island of Flores in Indonesia to Homo naledi that lived in South Africa multiple hominins abounded Then between and years ago all but one type of these hominins disappeared and for the first time we were alone Until recently one of the mysteries about human history was whether our ancestors interacted and mated with these other types of humans before they went extinct This fascinating question was the subject of great and often contentious debates among scientists for decades because the data needed to answer this question simply didn t exist In fact it seemed to many that the data would never exist Svante P bo however paid little attention to what people thought was or was not possible His persistence in developing tools to extract sequence and interpret ancient DNA enabled sequencing the genomes of Neanderthals Denisovans and early modern humans who lived over years ago For developing this new field of paleogenomics P bo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine This honor is not only well deserved recognition for P bo s triumphs but also for evolutionary genomics and the insights it can contribute toward a more comprehensive understanding of human health and disease Mixing and mating revealed by DNAGenetic studies of living people over the past several decades revealed the general contours of human history Our species arose in Africa dispersing out from that continent around years ago ultimately spreading to nearly all habitable places on Earth Other types of humans existed as modern humans migrated throughout the worldRead more
