HIGHEST UNCLIMBED MOUNTAINS IN THE WORLD
1)Gangkhar Puensam, Bhutan
It is the highest unclimbed mountain in the world and will continue to be so as the government banned climbing above 6000 metres because of spiritual beliefs.
2)Muchu Chhish, Pakistan
The last attempt was made by Pete Thompson in 2014 which failed due to bad weather.
3)Mount Kailash, Tibet
Because of the religious importance of the mountain the Chinese government has banned climbing the mountain above 6000 metres so it will also continue to stay unclimbed.
4)Karjiang, Tibet
This is a very high and technical mountain making attempting it too difficult. There have been multiple attempts but none of them have been successful in climbing it so far.
