Netflix one of the largest streaming service is losing subscribers what What could probably be the reason Are people bored with Netflix Is the Subscription price Too many Competitors So Netflix lost almost m subscribers between April and July as the number of people quitting the service accelerated When questioned what may have stopped subscriptions sliding further the firm s chief executive Reed Hastings said If there was a single thing we might say Stranger Things The subscriber losses reported on Tuesday were the biggest in the firm s history with the US and Canada home to the highest number of cancellations in the quarter followed by Europe Guy Bisson executive director at Ampere Analysis said it was inevitable that Netflix would start to see its grip on the market loosen When you re the leader there s only one direction to go especially when a large number of competition launches which is what Netflix has seen in the last couple of years he said Already the new season of the hit drama Stranger Things has been a marvellous success and may have helped stem the exodus of Netflix customers So I think when the South Korean survival drama Squid Game Season releases It will bring back a large number of subscriptions to Netflix What do you think
