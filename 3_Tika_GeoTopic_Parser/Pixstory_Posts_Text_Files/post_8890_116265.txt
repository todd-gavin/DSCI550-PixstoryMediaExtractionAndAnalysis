Chief Justice of India continues Fortunately or unfortunately the big majority of the party in power made it possible for it to override an interpretation of the Constitution by the Court by amending the Constitution so as to bring its policies within the four corners of the Constitution It was certainly fortunate for the Court that such attacks on it were shortlived as its critics were usually glad to leave it alone once they had had their way As the Chief Justice of India I had a say in the appointment of judges of the High Court and of my colleagues in the Supreme Court whenever vacancies occurred I was greatly pained by the paucity of high legal talent for appointment to the High Courts The Chief Justices and the Governors of the States were content to look for such appointments within their own States alone I felt that if the appointment of High Court judges was made from an all India panel we might get much better material for manning the benches of some of the High Courts Mine however was a lone cry in the wilderness at the time But when later on the Law Commission went into the question it endorsed my suggestion Narrow parochial considerations were sought to be introduced in making these high legal appointments but I did my best in resisting such pressure I am glad to find the Union Government veering round to my views To be continued
