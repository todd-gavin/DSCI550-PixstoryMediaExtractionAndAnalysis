In 2009 a once quiet local Salafi group called Boko Haram became increasingly violent in north-east Nigeria and border communities of Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Its quest to forbid western education in the heavily Islamic region has led to the kidnapping of many school children, the slaughter of an estimated 2,200 teachers and the burning down of 1,400 schools. But the terrorist group was largely unknown on the world stage until the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from the Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014.The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, used in the international calls for the girls to be rescued, garnered over 3.3 million tweets in less than a month. It became Twitter’s most used hashtag at the time, reaching 6.1 million tweets in 2016. It inspired protests around the world demanding the immediate release of the girls.Some of these girls are still in captivity today; others have been rescued or have escaped. But some of the rescued girls returned to their abductors. It was a sign that there was more to know about Boko Haram terrorism.In a recent study, I argue that the global popularity of the Chibok girls case is due to the hard work of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. Its framing of the case, however, failed to offer a nuanced picture of realities in Nigeria.The violence of Boko Haram in the north-east is much more complex than the gendered divisions (female victims versus male perpetrators) that emerged. I turned to the testimonial stories that emerged after the kidnapping to offer more insights.Creative responsesWriters, journalists and artists responded strongly to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.The kidnapping has been taken up in novels (Buried Beneath the Baobab Tree), films (Nollywood’s Boko Haram and a scene in Hollywood’s Black Panther), documentaries (Stolen Daughters and Daughters of Chibok), poems (The Book of Chibok), literary memoirs (A Gift From Darkness), literary reportage (The Chibok Girls and Beneath the Tamarind Tree), visual art and songs – to mention just a few.Read more: https://theconversation.com/chibok-kidnappings-why-its-important-to-listen-to-the-survivors-of-boko-haram-terrorism-192271
