The first defendant in the January 6th riot was acquitted at trial for illegally entering the United States Capitol building. His principal defense, or at least a portion of it, seems to have been that Capitol police officers were waving people in. Because the offense for which the Justice Department was prosecuting him requires intent - he had to have trespassed "knowingly" – he was acquitted of the charges on the grounds that he was unaware he was violating the law. There are now over 530 criminal charges pending in connection with the January 6th riot, and this case may provide much-needed hope for many of these defendants.

The insurrection and trespass claims have been called into question by the release of footage showing officers opening barriers for the rioters, taking pictures with rioters, and waving them into the Capitol.

Let me state unequivocally that the bad actors who trespassed in the Capitol during that riot and who meant to incite violence should face the full weight of the law. Unfortunately, it is often the case that innocent individuals are lured into dangerous crowds and commit acts they would not have committed otherwise. For one thing, the FBI found no evidence of an insurrection or a coordinated assault by all of the rioters. For example, it is inconceivable that a 49-year-old grandma from Indiana who trespassed in the Capitol intended to overthrow the government. Overall, the charges would be significantly more severe than mere trespass prosecutions – the bulk of which do not even necessitate prison sentences upon conviction – if the great majority of those being charged staged a coordinated rebellion against the government. If there was a conspiracy, it definitely included far fewer persons than those who are being prosecuted or have been prosecuted.
