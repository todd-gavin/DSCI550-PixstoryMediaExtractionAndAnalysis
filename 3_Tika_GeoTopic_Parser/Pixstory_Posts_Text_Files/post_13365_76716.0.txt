Amnesty International has issued a statement expressing deep concern over the disappearance of two women activists, Temna Zaryab Pariani and Parvaneh Ibrahimkhel, in Afghanistan.

In a tweet, the organization called the activists "critical voices against the Taliban's discriminatory policies against women's rights in Afghanistan."

Amnesty International writes that female activists in Kabul say the Taliban have detained and tortured Tamana and Parvaneh.

The international body called on the Taliban government to investigate the incident and "release these women activists immediately and unconditionally if they are detained."

On January 19, Temna Zaryab Pariani posted a video on social media saying that Taliban members were beating her at the gate. After that, he and the butterfly disappeared.

Amnesty International has said that "the Taliban should disclose their whereabouts instead of continuing to deny their arrest."

On the first day of the conference, Hada Khamoush, a women's rights activist from Afghanistan invited to the Oslo Summit, called on Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Mottaqi to contact Kabul and release the women.

Taliban government spokesmen deny arresting the activists, saying the women were forged to file cases for asylum abroad.
