Unpaid internships frequently guide you in the proper direction. It is necessary to have experience in the field you want to get in and unpaid internships provide you just that. They are giving you what you need, it's a fair deal.

Employers give you a place in their industries knowing fully well that you have no experience of it whatsoever. You have no skillset yet, you're basically not someone who's fit for a job. And on top of that, you want to get paid for it? They pay you plenty in experience and skills. You'll learn much more than just the work you signed for. You'll learn not only working the job, you'll learn working at all. It's not easy to sustain in a competitive environment and an internship teaches you just that.

You need your employer, your employer doesn't need you. It is audacious to ask for money for something you don't even know how to do. If you're good enough, these companies do offer you a permanent job and a salary. But for that, you'll have to be good enough first.
