It always warms my heart to see black people not only being represented but getting their due for their hardwork. Black people in sports have been overlooked for a long time now but now it is their time to shine. Although the road ahead is still tough for black women, things are looking good for black men. 

Tshiebwe, who is from Congo, has made history in basketball making all black people over the world proud. The John R. Wooden Award for men's college basketball player of the year went to Oscar Tshiebwe of Kentucky. He is the second Kentucky player to win the award, joining Anthony Davis in 2012. 

US News reported that the Los Angeles Athletic Club made the announcement on ESPN's "SportsCenter" on Tuesday. 

With 515 total rebounds and 15.1 rebounds per game, Tshiebwe lead the nation. Since 1973, the 6-foot-9 centre has had the most rebounds in a season, with the highest per-game average since 1980. St. Peter's defeated Kentucky in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
