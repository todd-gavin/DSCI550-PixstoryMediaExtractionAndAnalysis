—Whoever sheds the blood of man,
     by man shall his blood be shed,
for God made man in his own image.
And you, be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it. (Genesis 9:6–7)

There will be death till the end of time, so have children to keep the balance. Children are beautiful, children are a blessing. They make a family beautiful and a woman complete. What a pity that many modern women, I believe, chose to forego that blessing, despite the fact that millions would give their right arm to obtain it.

The Bible does not share the modern perspective that the goal of life is to avoid suffering and hardships. Have children, it's not easy but it's the right way to go about life.
