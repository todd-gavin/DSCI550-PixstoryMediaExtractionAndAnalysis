Hi Jasmine Thanks for this great question Humans can be blamed for a lot of things chopping down rainforests worsening climate change and driving precious species like the Tasmanian Tiger to extinction But can we add hunting and eating woolly mammoths and dinosaurs to the list Well we can safely assume dinosaurs never fell prey to humans mainly because the two never even met despite what the Jurassic Park films suggest Dinosaurs had already been extinct for about million years by the time modern humans started roaming the planet But what about woolly mammoths In this case the movie Ice Age was actually correct Humans and woolly mammoths lived side by side for at least years Mammoth findings in the fossil record So did humans hunt woolly mammoths to extinction To answer this question we must look at clues in the fossil record which is made up of the preserved remains of ancient life In the case of the dodo a large flightless bird that went extinct documents from make it clear that over hunting by humans was the cause But woolly mammoths were around long before we had paper to write on They existed from about years ago a time when ice covered the northern parts of the world As for when they went extinct a small number of dwarf mammmoths survived on a little isolated island in the Arctic until about years ago But the full sized species disappeared from an area called Beringia located between Siberia and Alaska some years ago after living alongside humans for at least years Did humans kill them off Hunting for clues When early humans hunted they tended to kill many animals at the same time This created kill sites which are literally huge piles of animal bones And when they pulled the meat off the bones to eat they used stone tools that created cut marks or small notches in the bones Read more
