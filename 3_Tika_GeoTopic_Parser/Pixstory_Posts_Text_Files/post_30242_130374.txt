Pecco Bagnaia&#39;s run-up to the world championship continues The Ducati rider won the third race in a row, triumphing in the Austrian GP and now Fabio Quartararo finished second today Bagnaia commented on his victory I am very happy it was a long race in which I had to maintain calm and concentration Out of caution we used the soft front tire caution was needed because I made too many mistakes in the first part of the season and it was time to use my brain more and find more continuity this time I was able to keep the lead with constancy and determination afterwards incredible work with the team The Piedmontese seems to have come out of the crisis he entered due to mistakes and falls At home I did a great job with my head to understand certain mistakes but I believe that despite the compliments I receive the road to be united to greats like Rossi and Stoner, the last to score a hat-trick with Ducati, still a very long way off
