T20 World Cup 2022: 'Individual Records Don't Matter In Such Tournaments. Even If You Score... - Gautam Gambhir's Advice to Virat Kohl
Former India opener Gautam Gambhir advised Virat Kohli to not concentrate on his individual record in the ongoing T20 World Cup in Australia.
The southpaw suggested that in a tournament like World Cup it's crucial for any player to play effective runs which help the team to win the matches. Kohli has returned to form recently with a scintillating show in Asia Cup 2022 but India failed to reach the final there. The 33-year-old scored valuable runs for India in the T20I series against Australia and South Africa.
Recently, Kohli became the first Indian batter to breach the 11,000 runs mark in T20 cricket. The 33-year-old has slammed 11030 runs in 354 T20 matches so far in his career.
