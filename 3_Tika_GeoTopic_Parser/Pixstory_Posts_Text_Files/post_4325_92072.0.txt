Often unbelievable positive uplifting stories slip right under our noses. Today I want to take the time to share yet another one. 
A Thirteen-year-old graduate from college by the name of "Jack Rico" of California graduated from Fullerton College in May 2020 at only 13 years old. My guy is not only the youngest student to ever graduate from Fullerton, but while doing so, this young man graduated with a 4.0 along with four separate associates degrees in social behavior, social science, human expression, and history.

He completed the astonishing feat in only two years, thanks to what he calls “good old-time management and listening to his mentors and instructors.”  Rico is not done either, he plans to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, on a full-ride scholarship to study history.

The sky is not the limit when we are determined, resourceful, blessed and focused, there are no limits.
