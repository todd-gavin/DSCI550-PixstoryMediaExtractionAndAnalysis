Liverpool vs Wolves Probable Winners
Liverpool have not had the finest of starts in the Premier League this season. Their European campaign this season also started with an away loss to Napoli. Still, the Reds look a dominant side against Wolves and the home advantage will certainly be playing their way.
Wolves have not had a good record travelling away in the Premier League and although Liverpool might not be at their vintage best in this game, but they will be enough to get past Wolves in this game.
Prediction: Liverpool 2-0 Wolves
