I had to let out a scoff reading this What does the monarchy represent again What culture and history are you talking about The one where they looted the rest of the world If we take out all of what they stole from other countries from their culture there would be nothing left Throughout their history the British royalties has been very adept at taking advantage of other countries weak points They ve exploited their natural resources infiltrating their political systems and hijacking their intellectual property They ve killed their people They ve also done it through economic exploitation such as setting up unfair trade practices and deliberately high tariffs From gold and gems to cuisines everything has been stolen from some other country In addition to stealing other countries wealth the Monarchy did not even spare its own people So I think it s a far fetched claim that they love their people they certainly don t And no criticizing the British monarchy is not disrespecting the system they choose to follow that family is responsible for several barbaric acts throughout the history around the world So everyone does have a right to criticize the hell out of them Let s stop being colonizer apologists
