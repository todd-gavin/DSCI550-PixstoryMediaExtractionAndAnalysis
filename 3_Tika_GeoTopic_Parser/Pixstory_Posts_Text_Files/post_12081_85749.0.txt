Most of the covid restrictions in Saudi Arabia are being lifted, now restrictions like social distancing in public areas and quarantine for vaccinated arrivals have been removed. 

The official Saudi Press Agency cited an interior ministry source said that the decision involves suspending "social distancing measures in all open and closed places" also inside the mosques as well.Â  

The masks will be necessary in closed spaces and the decision came into its effect from Saturday. 

The Saudi kingdom, which is home to Islam's two holiest places in Mecca and Medina, will no longer require vaccinated travellers to provide a negative PCR or rapid test before their arrival in the kingdom or to quarantine, SPA said. 

The Covid-19 pandemic has hugely disrupted Muslim pilgrimages, which are usually key revenue earners for the kingdom, bringing in some $12 billion annually. 

Hosting the pilgrimages is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam's holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy. 

In 2021, the coronavirus outbreak forced Saudi authorities to dramatically downsize the hajj for a second year, and just 60,000 fully vaccinated citizens and residents of the kingdom took part. 

Since the start of the pandemic, Saudi Arabia has registered more than 746,000 coronavirus cases, 9,000 of them fatal, in a population of some 34 million.
