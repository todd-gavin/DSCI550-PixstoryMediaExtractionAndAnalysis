Hello there, first time posting on this app so thought I'd do an introduction ^^
I'm Miya, although that's not my real name but it's what i prefer. I'm a shy, awkward but warm person who loves many things, from the morning sky to tv series, pop-culture, history and fashion. I love humans, cat and dogs as well. If i were to compare myself to an emotion it would probably be contentment. On many occasions i describe myself as a part time human and a full time existential wreck and unfortunately a lot of people seem to agree with that.
Occasionally i like to go to the top of sky-scrapers whenever i find one just to feel how infinitesimal we are and that's where the photos in this post come from. 
To everyone who reads this here's a flower for youðŸŒ»
