From September to January the National Gallery of Umbria hosts the exhibition GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESI in the collections of the National Gallery of Umbria The exhibition curated by Carla Scagliosi in charge of the Gallery&#39;s modern and contemporary collections celebrates the visionary genius of the great Venetian architect, engraver and theorist through a selection of etchings dedicated to the ancient and modern beauties of Rome and its surroundings taken from the two volumes of the Views of Rome chosen among the most representative of his research path and his formal and technical stylistic evolution No other work like the Views of Rome in fact, it accompanies Piranesi throughout his life and symbolically covers every aspect of his production, emphasizing his extraordinary inventive prospective technical skills as well as the vast imaginary that underlies his archaeological and antiquarian but also visionary and fantastic obsessions. Thus it is possible to appreciate the pictorial characteristics of the views with the wide palette of blacks and grays which demonstrates perfect mastery of the etching technique as well as grasping Piranesi&#39;s increasingly evident interest in the ancient world and in antiquarian research which has gradually become an ever more predominant object of the tables so as to push the artist up to Villa Adriana to which he would have liked to dedicate an entire work that remained only a wish The Views will forge and hand down for centuries the appearance of a Rome filtered through the genius of the author and will spread its fame throughout Europe The classical city in its melancholy decline and in the dazzling coexistence of the present and the past with the gigantic ancient monuments and the grandiose magniloquent modern architectures populated by very small frenetic and anonymous presences it condenses all the characteristics that distinguish the great modern capitals through the anticipatory vision of an artist who claims the fundamental role of the license and imagination for the creation of an art that reflects one&#39;s era The exhibition itinerary is completed with the video installation proposing the animated film D Piranesi Prisons of Invention years created by the artist and designer Gr goire Dupond with the music of the composer musician and sound designer Teho Teardo www youtube com watch v guLBWupgh Q commissioned by GNU and presented in October on the occasion of the tercentenary of the artist&#39;s birth
