Sri Lanka won their 6th Asian Cup beating Pakistan by 23 run.
Rajapaksa unbeatable 71 runs helped Sri Lanka to reach the total of 170 runs.
Later Madushan and Hasaranga's magical spell stopped Pakistan at 147.
The first 10 overs of the Sri Lankan innings were dominated by Pakistan, but after that, Dasun Shanaka's team has mostly taken control. With an unbeaten score of 71 off 45 balls, Bhanuka Rajapaksa completely changed the Sri Lankan batting order. He smashed a four and a six off the final two balls to help them reach 170/6 in their 20 overs despite being at 67/5 after the first 10. After Dilshan Madushanka bowled a no-ball and four wides, one of which went to the boundary, Pakistan subsequently gained ten runs to start their innings. Since then, Sri Lanka hasn't exactly given Pakistan much of a chance.
