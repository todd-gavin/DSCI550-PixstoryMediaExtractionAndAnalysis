Porto arrive in Italy knowing that a win will send them through to the knockout stages of the Europa league when they face Lazio in the second leg of the Europa league playoff tie tonight.

Porto enter this contest on the back of a 2-1 first leg victory in Portugal, with Antonio Martinez scoring a brace after Mattia Zaccagni had given Lazio the lead. With the away goals rule abolished, Lazio will be hoping to take full advantage of their home form, losing only once so far throughout this season. 

Porto enter this game on the back of a 9-match unbeaten run, winning 8 of those. The dragons have been practically invincible this season, unbeaten in the league and will be looking to go ahead in the tournament that they last won in 2011. Porto also have the better of Lazio in this tournament, beating them in the semifinals of the 2003 UEFA cup before going on to win it. They also have an almost full squad to choose from as well, with only Wendell missing out due to suspension.

Lazio will be hoping that star forward Ciro Immobile recovers from the illness that kept him out from the first leg and lead the line for them. With Zaccagni suspended and Pedro injured, Felipe Anderson could slot in as a "false 9", although that could change if Immobile is available. Defenders Francesco Acerbi and Manuel Lazzari remain injured, while Lucas Leiva and Luis Alberto return from suspension.

Lazio are well aware that this represents their only chance at any silverware this season, with the Serie A and Coppa Italia already out of reach. Lazio do have a great record against Portuguese opposition at home, unbeaten in all 6 fixtures. Porto, on the other hand have a horrendous record against Italian sides in Italy, staying winless in all of their 9 games against Italian sides in Italy.

Will Lazio turn up the heat on Porto in their own backyard, or will the Dragons be too powerful for the Italians today. There is a lot to play for in this fixture which could go anyway.
