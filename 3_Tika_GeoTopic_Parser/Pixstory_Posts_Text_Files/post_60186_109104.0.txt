Sadio Mane, a forward from Senegal, has been signed by Bayern Munich from Liverpool. The English club's success in recent years has been greatly attributed to the 30-year-old forward, who helped Liverpool win the UEFA Champions League trophy in 2018-19 and the Premier League championship in 2019â€“20.

With the defending Bundesliga winners, the winger signed a three-year deal that will end on June 30, 2025. According to reports, Bayen spent 40 million euros for the 30-year-old.

Mane arrived in Munich  for a medical examination, and when he exited the facility, he was observed wearing a Bayern Munich shirt.

Mane was one of Liverpool's standout players last season, scoring 23 goals as Juergen Klopp's team won the domestic cup double and only missed Manchester City for the league crown.

Herbert Hainer, the president of FC Bayern, welcomed the star forward to the team and stated that his addition will make the German Bundesliga more appealing.

Mane claimed to have made up his mind about joining Bayern when they made an offer, and he is hungry to win championships with his new team.
