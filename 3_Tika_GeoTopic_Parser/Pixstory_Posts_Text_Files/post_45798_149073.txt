Mars is a far off fantasy That is not to suggest that people have not arrived on the planet we have albeit indirectly as a result of our rovers visits to the planet s red soil Wion reported that however no human has ever set foot on the surface of Mars However a recent study shows that our species has already left more than pounds kg of waste on the red planet Cagri Kilic a postdoctoral research fellow in robotics at West Virginia University calculates that there is pounds or around kilogrammes of human waste on the red planet He calculated this estimate by analysing the mass of all Mars rovers and orbiters and then subtracting the weight of those that are still in operation The debris according to Daily Mail consists of disused equipment idle rockets and spacecraft that have crashed onto the planet including the Soviet Union s Mars orbiter that landed there in Scientists worry that our species is not only destroying yet another planet while fighting to rescue our own but that this rubbish may also contaminate samples being collected by NASA s Perseverance rover and jeopardise expensive expeditions to look for life on Mars
