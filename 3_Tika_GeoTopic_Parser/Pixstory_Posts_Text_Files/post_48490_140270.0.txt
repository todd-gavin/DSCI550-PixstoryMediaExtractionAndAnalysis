Queen Elizabeth II was seen observing her own Christian faith throughout her historic reign, even though never too openly. Although she held strong opinions and convictions of her own, she was also remarkably tolerant of people of other faiths, evident by the diverse population of her land.
Elizabeth publicly asked for prayers from her subjects twiceâ€”once when she turned 21 and once when she was getting ready for her coronation. 
She'd always been an extremely private person, maintaining the dignity and royalty of her grandeur. It is beautiful to know that even behind such power lies a normal woman who held her belief in God above all.
