Based on the writings of English diarist Anne Lister(1791-1840), Sally Wainwright’s immensely popular BBC television series Gentleman Jack has returned for a second season. In comparison to the first, the new episodes rely more heavily on the language of the diaries.

Lister lived at a time when women were not supposed to talk about sex at all. Nevertheless, in her diaries, she recorded her own sex life in explicit detail. This sometimes meant having to come up with her own words for what she wanted to say. At other times, she turned to slang used in her narrow circle of female friends and lovers to avoid being understood by outsiders.

Here are five 19th-century lesbian words and phrases from Lister’s diaries that you need to know to get as much as possible out of series two of Gentleman Jack.

1. Jack
The most obvious lesbian-related word in Gentleman Jack is the “jack” of the title. This was a 19th-century slang term for lesbian. But Lister herself used the word in the slightly more specific sense of masculine-presenting lesbians, which is reflected in the second series of the show.


In episode two, Lister’s old friend and sometime lover Isabella “Tib” Norcliffe says that it was probably just as well that Mariana Lawton, the daughter of a local doctor, “stole” Lister from her since “after all, two jacks don’t suit”. This line comes from Lister’s diary, where the possibility of a long-term relationship between the two of them, who are both butch, is dismissed (September 12 1825).

In her relationships with Lawton and also the heiress Ann Walker, Lister always referred to her partner as the wife and to herself as the husband. She never seems to have reflected on the feminine-presenting women she pursued as either heterosexual or homosexual. For her, her masculinity meant that they, as women, could be attracted to her.
