Due to the continuous history and local traditions at Jaimanglagarh regarding earlier visits having been made by Chinese and Siamese travellers, the site of Harsain Stupa near Jaimanglagarh seems to have been the very site of the Sin-Che temple. The probability of its having existed since the times of the Buddha is quite high, owing to it being a mud-brick stupa. 

As stated earlier, my attention to the probability of the site having been one of the original 8 relic stupas of Lord Buddha was drawn by a video on YouTube, which was documented during a seminar held by Sai Society in Begusarai. Interestingly, the local historians in the video mentioned that out of the original 8 relic stupas, 6 had been identified so far and 2 remained to be identified. It was proposed that the Harsain stupa could be the one made by the Bullis of Allakappa and of the cogent reasons proposed for such identification was the very name of Allakappa, which signifies a lake, that never dries and since the Kabar lake exactly fitted the descriptions.

 The Bullis were a powerful clan in the times of the Buddha and may have enshrined the holy relics at their capital Allakappa. The stupa at Harsain is also seen to be very similar to the one at Piprahwa, where the Archaeologist W.C. Peppe had discovered the relics of Lord Buddha during a chance digging of the neglected mound in the late 19th century.
