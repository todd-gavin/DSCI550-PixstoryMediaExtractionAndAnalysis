President Vladimir Putin’s most vocal critic and the strongest political opponent Alexei Navalny faces a new trial that opened at a penal colony, far away from Moscow, that could extend his current prison sentence to 15 years. Charged with fraud and contempt of court, the trial is happening when the world’s focus is on the West’s standoff with Russia over Ukraine.

In the past two years, rattled by Navalny and his Foundation for Fighting Corruption, a network of his co-activists and supporters, Putin unleashed a reign of terror against the opposition. According to a statement Navalny made in the court, he is not afraid of Putin’s onslaught because he knows it's all designed to humiliate him and his popular movement. 

Navalny revealed to the Time magazine, in an exclusive interview, conducted via handwritten letters from his confinement at Penal Colony No. 2, that what Putin fears most is “democratic dissent”. According to him, troops at Ukraine’s border and a pretension to talk with the West is just a ruse to distract the world from the real issue: rising disgruntlement against Putin and his oligarchs’ colossal corruption and protest movements across Russia calling for a change.

Even though Navalny’s attempt to run for President failed in 2016, his co-activists ran in local elections and exposed rampant corruption among Putin’s cronies across Russia. Navalny travelled across the country to sense frustration of the masses and a craving for a democracy. But while he was travelling to shoot a video about corruption in Siberia he fell ill and was on the verge of death. Later, it transpired that he had been poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent used as a chemical weapon. Russian authorities have consistently denied any wrongdoing.

He was taken to Germany for treatment where he barely survived. After he returned to Russia in January 2021, to renew his protests after convalescing, he was immediately arrested over the parole violations from the 2014 suspended sentence of an alleged fraud case.
