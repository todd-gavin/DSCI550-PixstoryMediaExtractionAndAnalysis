Awkward moments we all have them Whether it s trying hard to make a conversation over dinner or asking the boss for a raise all of us have been in situations we would rather not be in There s no avoiding them because life makes sure to put us in such tough spots every now and then just to remind us that we too are flawed I have known this feeling too when you just wish that the ground would swallow you so that you didn t have to deal with what s in front of you I was in th grade and I had been assigned a role in the famous Speech Day the annual prize ceremony of the school I was one of the many narrators and had a simple line On the day of the rehearsal we all put on our costumes as the teachers put make up on us I went up on the stage and a bout of stage fright took hold of me The faces of the audience scared me and for a moment I forgot my lines I searched my mind for the words which I had practiced so many times but nothing My mind was blank After seconds of silence my forehead was sweating My heart beat with quick and hard as if it were a rabid animal trying to get out of a cage I felt awkward and frightened My mouth refused to open and I stood there dumbly Fortunately someone whispered the first few words of my lines from the backstage wings and I narrated my line I was saved but that awkward moment will forever be with me in my memories
