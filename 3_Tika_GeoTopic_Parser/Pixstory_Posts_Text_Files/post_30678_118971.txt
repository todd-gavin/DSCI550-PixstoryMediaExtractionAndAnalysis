Taking advantage of Juventus&#39; American tour Giorgio Chiellini went to visit his old teammates and was then a guest on the Bianconeri&#39;s Twitch channel How it feels I&#39;m happy I&#39;m spending a few days with friends I&#39;ll be back in Italy in December greetings Paul Pogba ed I haven&#39;t seen him yet when he is well a player who makes the difference I saw that there was a lot of enthusiasm he brings a lot We need to redistribute responsibilities to the players let&#39;s hope it will be a great championship Speaking instead of his new adventure with Los Angeles FC Chiellini explained I was lucky a good team The city is big but life is good We have organized ourselves we try to do as much as possible to train feel good to play Different from Italy but I settled in quickly I am increasingly convinced that I have made right choice at the right time and in the right place It gives me the possibility to see the future and enjoy the present I am happy to be able to experience new emotions again
