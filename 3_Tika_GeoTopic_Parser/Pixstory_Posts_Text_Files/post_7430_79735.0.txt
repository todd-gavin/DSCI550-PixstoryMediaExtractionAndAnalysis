Mayor Adams ordered his administration Sunday to move ahead with implementing a controversial new Medicare plan for retired city workers, angering some retirees who have for months contended it could water down their benefits.

The Medicare Advantage Plus plan, first unveiled by former Mayor Bill de Blasio last fall as a cost-saving alternative to the city’s current retiree coverage, will maintain “premium-free” insurance for the roughly 250,000 ex-municipal workers who stand to benefit, Adams said in a statement.

“That is why after a careful and thorough review by my administration, I am announcing my support for this plan,” he said. “I believe the new program will be in the best interest of retirees and the city’s taxpayers, who stand to save $600 million annually.”

At the same time, Adams said he feels for those retirees who have expressed fear that the new plan could curtail access to certain care.

“As a blue-collar mayor and someone who himself will collect municipal retiree benefits, I am sympathetic to those who have voiced concerns about how this plan will affect their coverage,” said Adams, a retired NYPD captain. “Our administration will continue to work to assuage these concerns before and after the plan is implemented.”

Adams’ thumbs up ostensibly means the new plan is a done deal after a months-long court and publicity battle between the city and a group called the NYC Organization of Public Service Retirees.

The group, which sued the de Blasio administration over the new plan last fall, lambasted Adams for his Sunday announcement.
