Jannik Sinner, who had not won a grasscourt single match on tour until this tournament and had just 9 matches on the grass court in the pro circuit in his name, just rallied from 1-4 down to win the opening set 7-5 against grasscourt master and top seed Novak Djokovic.

From breaking services to winning tough rallies, Sinner looks in a good form so far, Novak however has follied on several occasions giving away crucial break points.

The heat has turned on in the QF game as the 20- year old tall young man from Italy looks determined to make the biggest upset of the tournament.

Can he beat the odds and beat Novak to glide through the semis? Will be interesting to see how this game proceeds as there is much more left to play in this match. It's always super exciting to watch such kinda competitive play in tennis which defines the beauty of this game.

Who do you guys think is gonna make a winner outta this game?

Novak or Sinner?

Update: Sinner leads 4-2 in the second set !!Woah!!!!!
