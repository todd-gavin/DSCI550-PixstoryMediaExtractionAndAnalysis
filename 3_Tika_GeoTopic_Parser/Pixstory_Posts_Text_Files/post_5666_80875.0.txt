Secularism is about respecting diversity & identites of other, whether you understand it or not. People won't live their lives according to your understanding of the world.

Everybody has the right to practice their faith. If someone's attire makes you uncomfortable, that's your problem, not their. It shows that you as a person need to learn to be more humane and respectful. 

And when it's one community who's identity is being put in question while everyone get to express and propogate their faith in every fashion. Then the hate towards that particularly community is clearly visible.
