After four years of hard work, Dillard University student Jada Sayles was preparing to walk the stage on her graduation day, but her baby son made a heartwarming debut first.

Shoutout to my university for still bringing my graduation and degree to me. 🎓 Ima college graduate & mommy, talk to me nice! ” Sayles wrote on Twitter.
