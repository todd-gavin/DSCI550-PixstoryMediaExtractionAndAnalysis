Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, a Disney/Marvel Studios film, remained undefeated for a third weekend, grossing an estimated $31.6 million in North American ticket sales until May 22. The sequel, starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the title character, grossed $342 million in the United States and $803 million worldwide. 

Media play news reported that MGM Studios' James Bond actioner No Time to Die ($774 million) and Warner Bros. Pictures' DC superhero The Batman ($768 million) have now surpassed the global total.

The ongoing strong box office results were enough to thwart the theatrical return of Focus Features’ family period sequel Downton Abbey: A New Era, which generated a reported $16 million across more than 3,800 North American screens. The domestic opening was only about 50% of the 2019 original Downton Abbey movie, but still topped $51 million worldwide.

Lisa Bunnell, president of domestic distribution at Focus Features, suggested in a media interview that the sequel might help bring back the older female moviegoer.

“The only way you are going to get older audience[s] to theaters is to offer them films they want to see,” Bunnell told Variety.
