This was not the first brilliant movie which got ignored by Indian audience There are many more movies like Lootera Swadesh which were also ignored despite being the brilliant movies of their time And then we say that Bollywood does not makes good movies Tamasha lacked disgusting item songs which not seem connected to each other illogical fight scenes boring love story which can be found in most of the commercially successful Bollywood movies Tamasha was so deep One needs a good IQ and good observation to understand this movie Majority of Indian audience who are of low IQ only prefers crap movies There was just a Taara female character s name in the movie I mean there was exceptional acting but that exception was not expected to be understood by the majority of movie viewing audience Ranbir at that time was considered to be choosing crap movies EVIDENCE Besharam Roy Bombay Velvet etc But Tamasha was a class apart miles above the other movies barring YJHD The movie was perceived as a movie which had no target audience But as it turns out any human on the earth is the target audience for this masterpiece This movie wasn t a flop It was awesome You just couldn t get through enough
