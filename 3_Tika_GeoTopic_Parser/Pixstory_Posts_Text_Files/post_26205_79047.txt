In the partial classification of last night February the first two places on the podium are occupied by Elisa and then by the couple Blanco Mahmood This positioning is not surprising since December the names of the winners have been the most cited in full, what is striking is that both Elisa and Blanco wear made to measure by Valentino The winner of Sanremo last night opted for a haute couture white cady dress with a train and bare shoulders Sanremo is unpredictable so we don&#39;t know if this ranking will be confirmed what we can afford to say that Valentino has bet on the right horses
