Giorgio Chiellini&#39;s farewell to Juventus is now a sure thing Remains uncertain as to what he will do once he leaves the Juventus Stadium dressing room for the last time He could take a few steps and immediately accept the offer to become Juventus manager or try an experience abroad In the latter now the rumors have become more insistent that they would like the Tuscan defender to be close to the Los Angeles Galaxy, a team that has already seen several important former European players including Beckham and Ibrahimovic Chiellini hasn&#39;t made a decision yet there are still two games to play championship Then he will decide perhaps also by discussing with the Juventus management as he did in a phone call with Andrea Agnelli yesterday And most likely he will do the same thing when an official proposal arrives from America
