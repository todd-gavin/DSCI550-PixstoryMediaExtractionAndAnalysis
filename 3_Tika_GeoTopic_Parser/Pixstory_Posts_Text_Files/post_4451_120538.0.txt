The feeling is different when you enter your college after 2 long years , where you spent 3 years of your life.🤍🎓

You know you were living in a cocoon when you have to face the real world, you have to step outside your house comfort zone.

I still remember my first day of college, i was hell nervous because i knew i was gonna meet a-lot of new people now, some may like me and some may not. 

It was all different feeling when i stepped in my college for the first time, Delhi University is a small world in itself, its a vibe. If you want to enjoy your college life one must study there once here. 

Honestly, i never liked my college crowd, i used to always rant about my college, but someone i managed to make good real friends there, i’m really glad to all my batch mates and my seniors who made my college life tolerable. 🥶🥰

I don’t remember taking classes regularly because it used to take me 1hr 30min to reach college from my home. So,i was never a regular student and whenever i used to go i was always late. 😏🫣

All i liked about being in college was DU’s fests!! I don’t remember if i ever missed any fest in my college life, we used to have months long events for whole university, and we used have amazing time there.

After 2 years, sadly covid hit all of us, it was my last year of college ,We had attend online classes and gave our final exams online, i never thought i would say goodbye this way to each other to the teachers , we have virtual farewell too , we could see each other but couldn’t gave a goodbye hugs. 🥺

But this convocation was unexpected, i had the best time, i could feel the classrooms, the time we spent there. 
I will miss everything about my bachelor’s life.  🤍🎓
