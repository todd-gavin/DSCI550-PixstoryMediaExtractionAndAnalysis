I have a dual affection for Two Hands As russh says first you ll want to go back to Kings Cross Bondi and Chinatown in the s just to ride the monorail and listen to Powderfinger because of the movie s feeling of time and location The next Chemistry That is all there is to say about the hot duo of Heath Ledger and Rose Byrne Second is Samson and Delilah Again as Jasmine Pirovic points out with his unwavering eye Warwick Thornton draws us into this tale of survival Thornton introduces us to Samson and Delilah two year olds who meet and develop a secret but strong friendship in the Australian outback The two are forced to live in this plot of reality that has been carved out by violence and indifference they eventually want to flee it Isn t that the cutest love story
