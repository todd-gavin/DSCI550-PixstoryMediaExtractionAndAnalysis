Cyberpunk 2077 has been quite the rollercoaster ride. It had a disastrous launch back in December 2020 due to having many bugs and glitches, especially with the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version leading CD Projekt Red refunding the game for various dissatisfied customers and Sony delisting the game from the PlayStation Network Store as the situation was unfolding.
The game was later relisted on June 21, 2021, but with the warning that it was best experienced on PlayStation Pro and PlayStation 5. Both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of Cyberpunk 2077 were finally released on February 15, 2022.
As of late, Cyberpunk 2077 has begun seeing a player resurgence and is showing no signs of slowing down, as according to the report given by CD Projekt Red over 1 million  people have played the game each day this week. “Each day of this week Night City has been visited by 1 million players, both new and returning,” CDPR tweeted. “We wanted to use this opportunity to thank you for being with us and playing the game.”
This impressive revival of the game can be attributed to a number of factors chief being, the Edgerunners anime, several updates of the game in the past few weeks, and the announcement of the game’s first major expansion as well as going half price last weekend. Reports from Steam Charts seems to confirm this as Cyberpunk 2077 had around 85,555 concurrent players on Steam this past weekend.
It would seem that the new Netflix anime in particular along with the 1.6 update accompanying it is to be thanked for this massive boost. The update added lots of new content and features a couple of weeks ago. These features include cross-progression , new quests and weapons, and new easter eggs and content related to Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.
