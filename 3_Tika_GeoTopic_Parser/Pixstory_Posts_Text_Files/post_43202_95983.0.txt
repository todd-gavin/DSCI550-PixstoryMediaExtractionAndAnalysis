Episode 4 finds Marc Spector/Steven Grant (Isaac) facing off against Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke), and the soft-spoken villain shoots Marc in the chest, seemingly killing him. But Moon Knight is a six-episode miniseries, and we've still got story to go! So Marc wakes up, moments after his apparent death. Instead of lying in a dusty Egyptian tomb, he's in a stark white mental health facility, and his entire reality has shifted.

Here, Marc isn't an adventurer but a mental health patient. Locked in this hospital, he's surrounded by familiar faces: Layla (May Calamawy) is a fellow patient with a passion for bingo, while Harrow is the facility's head doctor, rocking a beige sweater vest and a delightful mustache. All around Marc are objects that seem to hint that all his experiences have just been inside his head: the Canopic jars in Harrow's office, the goldfish floating in a bowl, the white-caped action figure he's been clutching in his hand. And on the TV, there's a VHS tape playing. It's a campy movie called Tomb Buster, and it looks like a made-for-TV Indiana Jones knockoff, complete with a John Williams-esque score and vintage VHS fuzz. The name of the film's swashbuckling archaeologist hero? Dr. Steven Grant.
