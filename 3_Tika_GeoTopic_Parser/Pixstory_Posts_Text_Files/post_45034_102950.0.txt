Sergio Agureo has been happy with the business his former team Manchester City have been carrying out, signing the world’s best young striker in Erling Haaland. City were able to sign Haaland from Borussia Dortmund for a sum of £51 million. Haaland will be joining an already star studded team who has won the league in the last 4 seasons out of 5.

Haaland was signed in particular to replace the void left by Sergio Aguero, with the Argentine leading the all time goals scored for Manchester City (260 goals in 389 appearances.) Aguero expects Haaland to be the final piece in Manchester City’s jigsaw puzzle, with the English side finally ready to win the Champions League. 

On Haaland’s signing, Aguero had to say, “I think it's a great signing. He can contribute towards scoring and that's big. I hope he racks up a ton of goals.
Adapting to the Premier League will take some time for him, but I'm confident he'll be able to do so well.
Regarding the Champions League - now that's a huge task, but football is about the team, not the players by themselves. If the whole team works like it has been, the trophy will be more reachable.
I think City has grown in experience over the past few years and it's something that can be achieved sooner than later.”

Erling Haaland will be hoping to fill these shoes, and looks certainly capable of doing so. The Norwegian striker has finally arrived to the Premier League to much dismay of other clubs, believing that a team already so dominant will just become that much more imposing.
