Since fresh turmeric is only available for a few months in the year, pickling is also an exemplary way to preserve turmeric year-round.

This recipe was introduced to me by my late aunt. Making and sharing this recipe is my way of keeping her memory alive.

Adding fermented foods like pickles to your diet is a delicious way to improve your gut health. This tangy and refreshing pickle is chock-full of antioxidants and a great source of Vitamin C.

Turmeric pickle adds a bright flavour to ay dish. You can have it withÂ paratha, serve it as a condiment, put it in tacos, burgers, sandwiches, or anything else your heart desires! My favourite way to have it is on top of savoury oatmeal to add a bit of zing and texture!

Ingredients
1/2 cup sliced turmeric 
250ml lemon juice 
1 tbsp honey 
2-3 peppercorns

To make this quick and easy pickle:
1. Peel and thinly slice the turmeric.

2. Pack the turmeric slices in a clean glass jar along with the peppercorn.

3. Combine the honey with the lemon juice and pour over the turmeric until all the slices are fully submerged.

4. Cover and keep in a warm area away from sunlight. 

5. Store in the refrigerator after 48 hours.
 
Always use clean utensils when handling pickle to prevent microbial growth.

Pickle lasts in the refrigerator for 3-4 weeks.

Use gloves when processing turmeric to prevent staining.

You can also use the pickling liquid to make a refreshing drink by diluting it and adding more honey!
