The tenth album in Machine Head s discography Of Kingdom and Crown marks the return of Machine Head to the metal scene after four and a half years and damn is this a bloody bombastic thrashing and thundering hellstorm of a comeback While certainly not bad Catharsis was quite a disappointment considering the gem that preceded it but if Machine Head s direction with Catharsis was the disappointing sort of surprise then Of Kingdoms and Crowns is the ridiculously good kind of surprise Machine Head s first concept album Of Kingdom and Crown tells a dystopian tale of existential torment and horrifying violence it tells the tumultuous tale of two troubled protagonists more reminiscent to antiheroes than your traditional heroes The album depicts how their lives entwine resulting in some less than pleasant consequences Musically this album has everything you could ask for Blazing long epics such as Slaughter The Martyr murderously heavy thrashing bangers such as Choke On The Ashes Of Your Hate Become The Firestorm Bloodshot and Rotten or the more melancholic heavy songs with melodic undertones such as Unhallowed Of Kingdom and Crown has it all No track here is one dimensional Despite featuring some insane level of heaviness and aggression Machine Head have always had a good sense of melody and this time around too it is no different There is an element of blazing technical ferocity aggression skill and creativity here that has not been witnessed in the band since The Blackening which blows away all expectations Featuring an entirely new lineup the expectations riding on the shoulders of Machine Head were fairly high As such it is simply amazing just how much above expectations they have risen It is no exaggeration to say that Of Kingdom and Crown has surpassed even The Blackening becoming the greatest album in the Machine Head catalogue This is not just a comeback but rather a very creative reinvention of sorts with Of Kingdom and Crown simply being more than what Machine Head is in all its aspects Highlights Slaugter The Martyr Choke On The Ashes Of Your Hate My Hands Are Empty Unhallowed Rotten Arrows In Words From The Sky Score
