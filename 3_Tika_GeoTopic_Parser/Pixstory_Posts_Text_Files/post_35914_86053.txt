President Biden announced the U S will ban Russian energy imports to punish the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine We re banning imports of Russian oil gas and energy Biden said in a White House address on Monday The American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin s war machine We will not subsidize Putin s war he added The action bans Russian oil coal and natural gas from entering the U S Another significant step is to ratchet up the sanctions against Russia which heavily depends on energy exports to keep a steady influx of cash flowing despite restrictions on its financial sector Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stepped up his pleas for more and tougher sanctions to pressure Russia to end the punishing invasion killing thousands and sending an estimated million refugees fleeing to neighboring countries Biden framed the move as part of a successful campaign to push the Kremlin to end the invasion boasting that financial and technology sanctions have crippled Russia s economy He conceded that European allies need more time to find more sustainable alternative energy supplies before implementing similar bans We re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies may be able to immediately join us We can take this step when others can not Biden sought to ready American consumers to take a hit noting that the move has wide bipartisan support Defending freedom is going to have costs Biden added Republicans and Democrats alike have been clear that we must do this The move is sure to spark a further increase in global energy prices and gasoline prices for Americans at the pump Prices have already soared above a gallon near all time highs Before the invasion Russian oil and gas made up more than a third of its government revenues Global energy prices were already on the rise due to the economic recovery from the COVID pandemic They ve surged more since the invasion and have continued to rise despite coordinated releases of strategic reserves Natural gas from Russia accounts for one third of Europe s fossil fuel consumption The U S imports a much smaller amount of mostly crude from Moscow
