So, let me start with those circumstances that have relevance to who I finally became in life and who I am as a person. 

My mother told me she had never lived in the village (Chukur in Pulwama) because by the time she got married my grandfather had moved out. The migration happened under unnatural circumstances. He (my grandfather) was working as in-charge of a custom post at Attari, a point that divided India and Pakistan. But he belonged to a landlord family and came back to the village at some point of time to take care of his holdings. 

And when he came back, he didn't settle down completely as a landlord probably because he had been working for such a long time as the customs officer. 

And I was told in very hush tones, which as I grew up a little bit more I learnt that at that point of time that there was supposed to have been a thief who was troubling those areas. He was one of those celebrated thieves who find mention in the works of many noted Kashmiri writers. 

I don't remember his name but am told he had terrorised the entire area. The locals were fed up with him and they approached my grandfather who as I said was the village sarpanch. So, everyone (Hindus and Muslims) flocked to him. They told him that nobody is doing anything about this guy. Apparently, he had some sort of patronage and hence always got away scot free. 

Peeved over his frequent robbery, the villagers decided to do people's justice. So, they caught him and burned him alive.

Now, that is why when I was a kid, my family never told me about this incident. Perhaps they thought and even considered it such an atrocious thing to have happened in those times. 

There was a huge public outcry and political parties ran a massive campaign on the issue. This was perhaps the early Sheikh Abdullah (former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference founder). The incident had shocked the entire valley as Kashmiris were considered very docile.
