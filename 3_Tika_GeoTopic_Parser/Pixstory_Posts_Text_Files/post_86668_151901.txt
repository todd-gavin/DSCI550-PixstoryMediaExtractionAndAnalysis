 Heart is where the home is Joseph C Neal Home is where my habits have a habitat I am connected to this so much everyone feel this some or the other day when they stay away from their home Your home is a place that accepts you for the person you are It is a place you know will hold you warm and cozy in days when you feel lost and teary eyed A place that is sacred to you and holds a shelter for your near and dear ones
