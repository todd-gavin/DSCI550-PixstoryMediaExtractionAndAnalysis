Red Coral—The Gemstone of Mars/the God of War

Red Coral for Gemini ascendant

In this ascendant ruled by the planet of communication—Mercury, Mars becomes a problem-creating planet because it owns the 6th house of disease, debts and enemies. Individuals should consider wearing red coral gemstones only when Mars periods are operating and Mars is posited in 6th or 11th house and that too after a trial. The individual should tie the red coral in a white cotton cloth on the right arm from an auspicious time calculated as per electional astrology and assess tolerance and suitability for a period of 7 days.

Red Coral for Cancer ascendant

Mars becomes a potent and a significant planet in this ascendant ruled by Moon. Maharishi Parashar in his magnum opus Brihat Parashar Hora Shastra classifies Mars as the most potent Yogkaraka (potent and auspicious result giving planet) because it becomes the lord of the 5th trine house and the 10th quadrant house of career and profession. 

Those individuals in whose horoscopes Mars is posited in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, or 10th house should wear a red coral/Moonga birth stone for life. The red coral blesses the individual with divine grace, intelligence, and good luck in circumstances of chances, good career, recognition and rewards. It grants 
professional success and achievement to the individual.
