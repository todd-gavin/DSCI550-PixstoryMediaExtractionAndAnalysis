Well meaning celebrities peace appeals rarely make an impact amid a charged up atmosphere But the one from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Russian people is different It has the potential to make some Russians reconsider what their president would like them to believe about the illegal war in Ukraine Firstly the former bodybuilding champion and action hero who played a Moscow militia captain in Red Heat too hardly fits the image of a flower power peacenik He has also served as Governor of California from the Republican Party buttressing his serious credentials In other words he more than matches the shirtless macho of Putin Secondly in the video message he addresses Russian citizens at a personal and emotional level In the minute video he says I love the Russian people That is why I have to tell you the truth He tells them how it was Russian named Yuri Vlasov champion at the World Weightlifting Championships inspired him to start lifting weights The strength and heart of the Russian people have always inspired me he says The Austrian born star shares another Russia connection His father he tells the viewers participated in the siege of Leningrad in World War II though for the wrong side as part of the Nazi army and against Russia He appeals Russian soldiers reminding them of his father s pain and guilt Schwarzenegger s video also features footage of bombings of children s hospital and a maternity ward This matters because Russia is under an information blackout and citizens refuse to believe the atrocities going on Ukraine even when conveyed by their own family members from there But given the censorship will the message reach home Schwarzenegger is sending it out through various different channels and urges all viewers to share it with any Russians they know And can citizens make any difference when world leaders have failed to persuade Putin Schwarzenegger has faith in their power and cheers those protesting in the streets against the war The world has seen your bravery You are my new heroes You have the strength of Yuri Petrovitch Vlasov You have the true heart of Russia Also see
