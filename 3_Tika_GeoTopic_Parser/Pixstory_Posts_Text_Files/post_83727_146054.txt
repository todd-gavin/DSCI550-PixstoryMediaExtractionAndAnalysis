Here s how you know that you have a friend for life or just a passing acquaintance Aristotle says my friends there are no friends That seems like a contradiction in terms How can you tell your friend that there are no friends Well that s the paradox of friendship because you don t have to be friendly to have a friend In fact as Zizek says one sign of friendship is that you can be rude to the your friend you can insult them and they ll see it as a sign of kinship not a sign of being enemies A friend is somebody who knows you better than you know yourself A friend is somebody who doesn t judge you but stands with you A friend is somebody you don t always have to be friendly with You re never polite to your friend You re comfy with your friend A friend is not just a friend A friend is another you Someone who knows you better than you know yourself is a friend And yet a friend is somebody who allows you to be yourself in a way that you never could A friend is someone who does not judge you but stands by your side A friend is someone with whom you do not always have to be friendly You are never polite to your homie You re at ease with your homie A friend is more than just a friend A friend is another you
