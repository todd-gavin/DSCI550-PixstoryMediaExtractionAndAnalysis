We all know that Delhi is the heart of India but still in Delhi itself I am much bias towards the "purani or old delhi". Delhi 6 was founded as a walled city named Shahjanabadh in 1639, when Shah Jahan decided to shift the Mughal capital from Agra. The construction of the city was completed in 1648, and it remained the capital of the Mughal Empire until its fall in 1857, when the British raj took over as paramount power in India. It was once filled with mansions of nobles and members of the royal court, along with elegant mosques and gardens. But even till now, the vibe which this area of Delhi can give to me is exclusive.
