When the Gers travel to Seville to face the German side in the final on May 18, the 33-year-old tells how he has a score to pay. When Rangers face Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in Seville, Nigerian international Leon Balogun admits he will have a score to settle.

The 33-year-old Super Eagle was one of Giovanni van Bronckhorst's key players as the Gers advanced to the final on May 18 after a 3-2 aggregate victory over RB Leipzig at Ibrox Stadium on Thursday.

“I was born and raised in Berlin, Germany. I used to play for Mainz and they have quite a rivalry with Eintracht Frankfurt,” Balogun said as quoted by Glasgow Times. “So for me, it’s personal as well. I have to make two teams proud.

“But I am very confident that with this group, with this bunch of players, we can achieve that big dream that everybody now has and had before the game. I didn’t think about [getting to a European final when I joined Rangers]. But you always have to dream big.”

Balogun also revealed that the team had doubts about reaching the competition's final, but that their confidence grew when they defeated Borrusia Dortmund.

Balogun believes his side did not go into this season expecting to make it all the way to the final. With each game, especially after the Dortmund game, the belief strengthened. Balogun recently spoke with Toni Rudiger, who told him, "You know, you're going to make it, you'll see." Rudiger was absolutely correct. They've now advanced to the final.

Other African players on the Rangers roster include Balogun's Super Eagles teammates Joe Aribo and Calvin Bassey, as well as Zambian international Fashion Sakala.
