‌Republican leaders are calling on Congress to pass legislation that would shut down a new Department of Homeland Security working group assigned to combatting disinformation and would block federal funds from being used for similar activities.
‌
‌‌House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Wednesday said the group, which he dubbed President Joe Biden's "ministry of truth," was an "un-American abuse of power," and indicted Democrats of aiming to use the group to "manipulate the facts and discredit the truth when it's inconvenient for their narrative." "They fear Americans having unfettered access to information because it will challenge the power that they want to have over people’s lives."
‌
‌Other Republicans also claimed that the administration wants to manipulate information. In addition to this, They also accused the group's executive director, Nina Jankowicz, of previously spreading misinformation. Jankowicz previously served as a disinformation fellow at the public policy think tank the Wilson Center, where she studied the intersection of democracy and technology in Central and Eastern Europe.
‌
‌They also said the board would curb the freedom of speech and the damage will be large. The disinformation board is getting to the people's right to express their opinion.
