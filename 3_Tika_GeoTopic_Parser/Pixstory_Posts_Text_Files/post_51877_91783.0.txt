North China's Inner Mongolia is a facing rodent plague according to news reports in the country. The local authorities have issued warning after a dead rat in the city of Baotou was found to be having plague. 

The city has announced a Level VI plague warning. It has asked the residents to stay away from mice, foxes, and other wild animals. 

A level IV warning issued by the city authorities is considered the lowest level of emergency. 

Residents have been asked to be vigilant and report any sick and dead rats, patients with high fever or sudden death.Â 

This is not for the first time that a plague has been linked to Inner Mongolia. Last year, Northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region reported a bubonic plague case in its capital city Yinchuan, and the case was traced back to Inner Mongolia. 

The authorities responded with alacrity and and nipped it in the bud. It has to be seen if Inner Mongolia will be able to control plague from spreading. 

After Covid-19 outbreak, which was first traced to China's Wuhan city in late 2019, the world is wary of any news of disease from China. Most countries in the world believe that China didn't reveal the full extent of the Covid-19's seriousness when it first came to light in Wuhan.
