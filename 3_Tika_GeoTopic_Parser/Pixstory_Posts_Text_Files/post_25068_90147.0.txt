England kickstarted their 2022 Qatar World Cup Preparations in style, as they edged past Switzerland by a score-line of 2-1. The two Qatar-bound teams clashed in an International Friendly at the Wembley Stadium on Saturday evening. The Three Lions extended their unbeaten streak to 21 games, after Harry Kane scored the decisive penalty.

Switzerland, ranked 14th in the FIFA Rankings drew the early blood, after B.Embolo put the visitors in front in only the 22nd minute. As expected, England kept ghe majority of the ball, but it was the Swiss side that were looking threatening on the counter. The visitors should have been up by a score-line of 2-0 of more until the half time whistle, however, it was England that went into the dugout with a huge boost in morale.

Luke Shaw scored yet another goal at Wembley, leveling the proceedings after the first 45 minutes. It was a well-orchestrated goal which involved the likes of Kyle Walker Peters and Conor Gallagher in the build up play.

The second half was dominated by England, with a goal from the hosts being imminent at some time in the match. Finally, England were awarded a penalty after Zuber seemed to have handled the ball in the penalty box. Harry Kane made no mistake from the spot, as England held on to their 2-1 lead.

England have not lost a single game in playing time in the last 21 encounters, which includes their penalty shootout loss against Italy in the finals of Euro 2020. Now, England have another friendly fixture against Ivory Coast on Tuesday night. Gareth Southgate will look to rotate his squad, and try out various formations in lead up to the World Cup in Qatar, later this year.
