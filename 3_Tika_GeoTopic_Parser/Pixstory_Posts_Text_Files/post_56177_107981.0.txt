‌After a property developer hampered on its promise to fund a venue in the wake of the closure of the famous Joiners Arms, Queer campaigners have launched a £100,000 fundraising drive to open the UK’s first community-run LGBTQI+ bar. This shows the never-ending strength of the queer community and their determination.

The Friends of the Joiners Arms campaign group launched a crowdfunding initiative 
 selling shares in the proposed new bar and community venue for as little as £25 in a “fightback” against the number of queer venues lost to property development.

The developer had promised to pay £100,000 to fund a “pop-up LGBT+ bar” to give Londoners an inclusive place to meet during the demolition and redevelopment of the Joiners. However, it has declined to provide the money because work on a planned hotel at the site has been hindered by the pandemic.

Amy Roberts, chair of Friends of the Joiners Arms, said: “London has lost so many of its LGBTQI+ spaces to property developers and rising rents, and we’ve been fighting back against this. It’s taken eight long years, but the strength of our community won through. We are so proud to be opening a new queer space, in memory of the Joiners Arms, and are so grateful to the community for all the support we’ve had so far on our long journey.”
By Friday evening, the campaign had already raised nearly £14,000. But Roberts said the bar would not be able to open if the fundraising drive fell short of the £100,000 target.

It is hoped that the space, which will host regular drop-in events for residence advice, HIV/Aids testing and health outreach, will open by the end of the year.
