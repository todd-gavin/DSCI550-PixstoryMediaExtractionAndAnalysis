How has this happened We have the same Scriptures as countless prior generations yet they lie largely unread We have the same Churches and Temples as our forbearers though they are now largely empty Our children are yet further removed even than us from the moorings of our faith traditions What we see as we gaze out the window is the consequence of rebellion The Scripture instructs that we submit to God and in so doing Satan will flee from us This act of submission is the first step toward wisdom In the current epoch there is a growing unwillingness to take that first step We are endlessly enamored with ourselves What need do we have for submission Our ingenuity has led to fabulous technical innovations longer and more prosperous life dazzling feats and dizzying progress Surely we are the wonder of history We can create our own ethos rules of conduct that suit this moment and not be hidebound to archaic Law and dusty tradition These then are the seeds of rebellion This is the trap into which these generations have fallen The frenzy we see and the madness we feel in the world now arise as we move further and further from our Creator At the dawn of time Lucifer likewise felt no need for God He rose up in rebellion and invited countless others to join him And join they did Now they prowl the world looking for yet others to join in their rebellion Let s take this moment and assert our oneness with our Maker return to His Word and not make the same calamitous error of those legions of fallen angels
