📍Cancer appears to be an ever growing disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. It accounted for 7.4 million deaths (or about 13% of all deaths worldwide) in 2008. There has been a constant increase in the incidence of cancer. World statistics indicate that in India alone 22.2% of women presently suffer from cancer.

📍Apoptosis or programmed cell death in the tissues is a normal phenomenon, which is a very important and inevitable event in the remodeling of tissues during development and aging. It is a crucial process for eliminating cancer cells.

📍Most carcinogens appear to induce tumors by damaging cellular DNA that results in abnormal cells. Apoptosis is one of the protective mechanism by which cells undergo self-suicide in response to DNA damage. Given that faulty DNA repair is associated with an increased incidence of abnormal cells, the processes for repair or destruction of damaged cellular DNA are critical when it comes to defending the body against carcinogens.

📍Yoga 🧘‍♀️

Yoga is a mind-body therapy that includes three components: physical alignment poses (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayamas), and mindful exercises (meditations).The word yoga is derived from its Sanskrit root “yuj,” which means “to yoke” or join together.In this case, yoga refers to joining the mind and the body.

📍Stress and its molecular consequences in cancer progression.
Stress, caused by psychological, physiological and physical factors,has an adverse impact on human body homeostasis.There are two kinds of stress: short-term and chronic. Cancer patients usually live under chronic stress,caused by diagnosis-related strong emotional experience and depression, resulting from various difficulties associated with disease progression and treatment.At the molecular level, stress factors induce production and secretion of stress-related hormones, such as catecholamines, glucocorticoids and dopamine(as a part of adaptational body response), which influence both normal and transformed cells through their specific receptors.The particular effects exerted by these molecules on cancer cells have been also observed in in vitro cultures and include changes in proliferation, apoptosis susceptibility and migration/invasion potential.As a result,it has been suggested that stress hormones may be responsible for progression of malignancy and thus accelerate the metastasis formation in cancer patients.
