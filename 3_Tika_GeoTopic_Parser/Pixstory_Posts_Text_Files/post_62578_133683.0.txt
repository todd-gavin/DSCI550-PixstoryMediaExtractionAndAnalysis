Turmeric is a natural dye that can help you achieve a more radiant complexion. Here are three face masks that will make a good space in your skincare routine!
1)Turmeric face mask: Combine 1 teaspoon of turmeric with 3 cups of cold water in a pot and place over low heat. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Apply the mask to your face, leaving it on for 10 minutes before rinsing off with warm water.
2)Turmeric skin brightening face mask: Mix together 1 teaspoon of turmeric with 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in a bowl. Apply the mixture to your face, using gentle circular motions, and leave it on for 15 minutes. Rinse off with warm water and apply moisturizer as usual.
