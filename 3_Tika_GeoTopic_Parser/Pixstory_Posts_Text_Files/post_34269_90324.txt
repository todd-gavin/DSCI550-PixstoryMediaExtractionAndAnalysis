After the cry of alarm from the U coach Paolo Nicolato regarding the situation of young players in Serie A, the words also come from one of those directly concerned Nicol Fagioli midfielder of the Cremona side but owned by Juventus One of the many blue talents sent by the top clubs to mature in minor realities I see that in Spain maybe a little less in England but also in Germany and France young people play more than in Italy Certainly here with us when a young player plays and then maybe in the top clubs he misses a game or two the player is immediately criticized it is said that he is not ready and that perhaps he has to go and gain experience abroad first and therefore it is also difficult for the coach to get him to play continuously Nicolato is not entirely wrong in saying that in the main leagues in Italy it is difficult to trust the young players because we too feel and see it. We hope that things will change over time, I hope so
