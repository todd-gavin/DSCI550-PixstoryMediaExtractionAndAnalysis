Hellas loses at home against Spalletti&#39;s Napoli These are the words of Igor Tudor the La Scala coach after the match Napoli played a good game they did better We had a few problems this week a few injuries and some things what happened It wasn&#39;t enough today to score points you have to have players who always go and today it didn&#39;t happen I&#39;m sorry about the red light the second yellow card for Ceccherini doesn&#39;t exist We were pushing to come back and I&#39;m sorry the referee took away this possibility There&#39;s no bigger motivation for a player than going to show the opponent that you are stronger This must be the motivation I also find it a bit absurd to talk about this topic You always have to go strong with the desire to win I don&#39;t see a reason why motivations can be lacking We are doing not even more well I see guys who give everything and we are there The longer the season you keep these things the more you grow Now the important thing for us is to recover the players in the best possible way we have about ten players who will miss next season
