Aamir Khan s Lal Singh Chaddha and Akshay Kumar s Raksha Bandhan are both set to release on the same day on the box office A lot of people are looking forward to the showdown between these superstars People are curious how will these films fare I personally believe that Raksha Bandhan will surpass Lal Singh Chaddha because of its theme I feel as they are releasing on the festival of Rakhi people are more likely to watch it over Lal singh chadda As it explores brother and sister bonds over Lal singh chadda that is a remake of Forest Grump which deals with more complex issues Though it is only a speculation what will be the outcome only time will tell
