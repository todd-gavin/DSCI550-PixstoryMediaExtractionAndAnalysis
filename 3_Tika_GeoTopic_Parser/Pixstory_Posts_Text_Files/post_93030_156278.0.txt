Hey! It‚Äôs me, Charvi and I‚Äôm just out here trying to figure out who I am without what I work for.So here‚Äôs about an unofficial me. I love to travel, I believe that one should travel like a local and make sure to know the basics of the local language of the place they are travelling to. I‚Äôve been to dozens of places, but mostly, I love to notice little details, a little new detail at places that I visit every day. So some days? It‚Äôs a new flower, or a dried leaf that has changed its place or a new crack at a wall through which a little plant pops out.I love collecting memories, so I make travel reels for a private account that literally no one watches but it makes me smile, watching them.I am fascinated with books, my love for travel came from my love for books. I developed this habit of reading from the time I learnt to read and I kid you not, books have helped me travel places and then stepped in my family who helped me travel.I would also call myself a food enthusiast, I have always loved cooking, well, I thought I wanted to be a chef until I realised I just love to eat, so I make sure to eat a dozens something wherever I go.I like the world around me sometimes, the colour on the walls around me, the lights, the pictures, the smiles, the pictures, the way someone‚Äôs lips curve when they smile, the way someone‚Äôs eyes gleam, I love to watch.So here I am, watching, and hoping to write something worth writing. Creating something worth creating. üçÇ
