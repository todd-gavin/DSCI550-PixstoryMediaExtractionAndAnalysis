This has very low chances of keeping within oneself or becoming depressive. This shared space makes it easier to relate to other people and share personal perspectives. 

In many Romantic relationships binge-watching together is core because it serves as a fun activity that creates a shared interest and offers an easy way to spend time together. This activity makes them feel connected as they go through different emotions.

A study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that binge-watching can help long-distance relationships by replacing shared activities such as going to dinner together and having mutual friends. 

Binge-watching is a major stress buster. Dopamine is released from the brain and thus makes us relax. Psychologists say that finishing a series can give viewers feelings of control and power, which can be beneficial if viewers are not feeling that in their daily lives. Binge-watching has lesser chances to force something other than its content into our brains.
