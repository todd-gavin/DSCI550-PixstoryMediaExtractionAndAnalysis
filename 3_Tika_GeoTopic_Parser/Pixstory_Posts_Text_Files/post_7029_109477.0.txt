On Monday, World Refugee Day was observed to honour the courage of millions of refugees who were forced to flee their home country because of war, conflict, terrorism, persecution and human rights abuses. As per the UNHCRâ€™s annual Global Trends Report, by the end of last year, the number of people displaced in the world stood at 89.3 million, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine further pushed these figures over the 100 million mark. India, too, is not immune to this crisis. Prema Sridevi UnBreaks this news for you!
