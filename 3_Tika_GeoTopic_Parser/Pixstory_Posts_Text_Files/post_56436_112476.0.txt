Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental illness that prompts repeated unwanted thoughts or obsession or the urge to do something over and over again (compulsions). Some people can have both obsessions and compulsions.

A compulsive habit might be to wash your hands seven times after touching something that could be dirty. Although you may not want to think or do these things, you feel powerless to stop.

Always expect the unexpected. You can have an obsessive thought at any time or any place.  Don’t be upset when old or even new ones occur.

Be willing to accept risk. Risk is an a crucial part of life, and as such it cannot be totally gotten rid of.  Remember that not recovering is the biggest risk of all.

Never seek reassurance from yourself or others.  Instead, tell yourself the worst will happen, is happening, or has already happened.  Reassurance will counteract out the consequences of any therapy homework you use it on and prevent you from improving.

Always try hard to agree with all obsessive thoughts — never analyze, question, or argue with them.  The questions they raise are not real questions, and there are no real explanations to them.  

Don’t waste time trying to prevent or not think your thoughts.  This will only have the contrary effect and lead to thinking more thoughts.
