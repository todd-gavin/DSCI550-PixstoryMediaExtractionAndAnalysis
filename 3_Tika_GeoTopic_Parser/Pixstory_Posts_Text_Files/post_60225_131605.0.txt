Today will be a test of Nitish Kumar's majority, who earlier this month formed a government in Bihar with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and other parties after breaking off his alliance with the BJP. The CBI conducted raids on many RJD leaders hours before the vote.
Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, a BJP MLA, resigned from his position before the assembly began. Soon after the "Mahagatbandhan" or grand alliance assumed power, a motion of no confidence was made against him. Prior to stepping down, Mr. Sinha, who had earlier declined to do so due to unsubstantiated assertions, stated that he wanted to address those claims.
Maheshwar Hazari, the Janata Dal's deputy speaker, is currently presiding over the floor test (United). Stormy scenes were seen inside the house as Tejashwi Yadav and Nitish Kumar were insulted by BJP leaders. After "Mahagathbandhan 1" fell apart, the two were reminded of their comments made about one another.
The homes of several RJD leaders, including Sunil Singh, Subodh Rai, Dr. Faiyaz Ahmad, and Ashfaque Karim, were raided by the CBI in Patna hours before the trust vote. This was in relation to a "land-for-jobs" scam that dates back to the time when party leader Lalu Yadav served as Union Railway Minister in the UPA-I government
Tejashwi Yadav, the deputy chief minister of Bihar, said they would respond to questions about the CBI raids in the assembly, but Manoj Jha, a member of his party, claimed it was anticipated and suggested the BJP was behind the raids.
No raids, according to RJD leader and Lalu Yadav's wife Rabri Devi, could frighten the "Mahagathbandhan" government. "Except for the BJP, all parties support us. We are the majority in this state, so we won't be afraid "She stated
The majority test in the 243-member Bihar assembly is largely a formality because 164 MLAs back Nitish Kumar's administration. The assembly now has 241 members, and any party or coalition needs the backing of 121 MLAs to command a majority.
