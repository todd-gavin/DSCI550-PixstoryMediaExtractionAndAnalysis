I realized I love doing such stories It s fun to learn about these fascinating creatures and comparing them in a hypothetical scenario The shark in this case does not like conflict so in any real scenario it might just avoid it But if it came to that who will win Crocodiles hunt in ambush Instead of pursuing their victim they lie in wait on the surface of the water or at the bottom waiting for an opening to attack This is an issue since it exposes them to the great white s preferred form of attack the polaris breach while they wait near the surface Great Whites are known to stalk their victims by swimming beneath and behind them well out of sight then gaining speed and striking from below in a breach assault The lb shark is already travelling at mph when it enters the crocodile s field of vision and is likely too close to avoid by that point When they attack it is more than simply a bite it s a high speed slam with the entire shark s weight behind it The saltie wouldn t know what hit it The crocodile could die from one injury alone The crocodile can be easily grabbed anywhere the shark strikes because of the shark s wide mouth The shark will then start to thrash which has a high chance of killing the crocodile in one strike However crocodile don t have much to hold on to when trying to bite a great white A Great White can therefore deliver more forceful blows than a crocodile Additionally the croc s metabolism will be slower because this conflict is taking place in open water Salties rarely swim in open water since they are accustomed to warm climates rather than the chilly open sea in addition to avoiding huge sharks Therefore unlike a Great White Shark they would not be able to respond to a racing torpedo as swiftly One way a saltie can win is by biting the shark s face off Risky move but no harm in trying Except death
