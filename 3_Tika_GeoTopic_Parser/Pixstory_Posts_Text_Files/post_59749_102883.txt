Bollywood is no more about just the same storyline Romantic movies The recently released films attempt to break the stereotypes and bring a change in the viewpoint of people They do not portray women as housewives Films like Neerja Mission Mangal Dangal etc show that women are standing shoulder to shoulder with men and are capable of doing anything and everything Pad Man Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui etc are making sure that topics concerning periods and LGBTQ community are not hush hush and trying to make people talk about different stigmas While many movies might still stigmatise we are moving forward The bollywood industry is experimenting with different topics to evolve and it sure is giving birth to conversations among people and sensitising them about these things
