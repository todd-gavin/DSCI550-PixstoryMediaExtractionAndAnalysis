Ash Taylor didn't cry when he told the world why he retired from football.

It can't have been easy, but there were no tears from the athlete whose NRL career was dying young.

There was emotion, certainly. But that was for his Warriors teammates, not for the world. 

"Not being able to do something I've been a part of since I was five years old, it hit home a fair bit," Taylor said.

"When I came on the scene, footy was my life. I thought it was going to be my life forever.

"Looking back now, I'd tell a young Ash to look at the education, the post-career side of footy."

Even with no tears, Taylor seemed very human, sitting up there and fielding questions from a bunch of people he didn't know.

And the week went on, and the rugby league discourse rumbled past Ash Taylor, and then the player who once was unlike anybody else became just another guy who used to be somebody.

Ash Taylor, the footballer, has to give way to Ash Taylor the man.

It's another reminder that athletes don't die when they retire, they're re-born into a second life.

The man seemed at peace with what was going on. Retirement came unexpectedly, but with great certainty.

Taylor did the right things, he saw the specialists, he tried to keep going, but this was the end.

He isn't raging against the dying of the light, he's ready for it. His time has just come earlier than anybody, including himself, would have thought.

It's tempting to say that Taylor's end is a tragedy, that he never lived up to the considerable potential he showed because that potential was so very considerable and so very obvious.

After all, he won rookie of the year ahead of Nathan Cleary, Cody Walker, Latrell Mitchell and Suliasi Vunivalu back in 2016, and it was the right decision.
