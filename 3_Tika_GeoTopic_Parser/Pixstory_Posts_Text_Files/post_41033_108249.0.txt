Where else can you find a movie market that doesn't exist today but could be worth $1 billion in five years or less?" 

As per Hollywood Reporter, it's just been four years since AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron made this bold declaration about Saudi Arabia, speaking just months after the Kingdom announced for the first time since the early 1980s that cinemas would be allowed to open. 

AMC was at the forefront of a gold rush of major international prospectors at the start of 2018, proudly being responsible for the first new cinema of the new era — a refitted ultra-modern conference hall in Riyadh's King Abdullah Financial District — where a historic screening of Black Panther took place on April 18. Saudi Arabia has also been designated as a high-risk country by PwC. 

Pw C also declared Saudi to be a “billion dollar opportunity” in a detailed report later in the year, claiming it could reach the figure by 2030 and adding that the reopening of cinemas was “unlocking an untapped and lucrative economic opportunity.”

Much has changed since then. The fallout from the Jamal Khashoggi scandal saw many international companies forced to rethink their business dealings with the country, or at least appear to, while the COVID pandemic shook the entire global theatrical industry to its core. But with a box office recovery now seemingly in full swing, another major factor has come into play that few could have foreseen.
