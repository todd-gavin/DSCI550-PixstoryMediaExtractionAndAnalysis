These are two sets of photographs of and by women at leisure, aka us! 

Dark and stormy clouds gather on the Chennai beach today as Pavithra and mom spend the day here. Pavithra says her mom returns to her playful teenage self whenever she comes to the beach, and we have the evidence to show for it! 
Beware, her mom missed only one out of all the balloons in target practice! 

The second set of photos is from Cambridge, UK where peekayty spent an entire evening by the window mesmerised by the supreme artistry of nature; bright sunlight pierced through dark grey rainy skies and a perfect rainbow took shape (a double one in some places!), After which the rainbow dissolved into a purple-pink-orange sky. A magnificent symphony.
