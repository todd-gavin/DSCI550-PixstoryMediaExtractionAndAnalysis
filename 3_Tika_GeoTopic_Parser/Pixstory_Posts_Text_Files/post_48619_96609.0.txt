As a still emerging technology, AI is already having a significant impact in fields such as medical, science, engineering, advertising, and data analysis.

Take a look at how Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant are already benefiting you through AI. And that's only the beginning. Computers are gaining new abilities, learning from a variety of inputs, and behaving in human-like ways that they have never done before.

Humans make mistakes, but machines, if correctly programmed, will not make the same ones. Errors can be minimized, accuracy is improved, and precision is attainable since AI decisions are based on compiled data and designed algorithms.

It's always beneficial to find strategies to save time by making speedier selections that you're confident in. This is something AI can help you with. AI is used in conjunction with other technologies to help machines make decisions faster than humans can. As a result, actions are completed more quickly.

AI never sleeps or rests, whereas the human body and mind require rest in order to perform at their best. This continuous availability, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with no gaps in coverage, can have a significant influence on productivity gains for your firm.

The ability of AI to take on difficult tasks that would be exceedingly dangerous for humans is a big benefit and its strongest characteristic. As a result, the hazards associated with some undertakings are reduced.

AI robots, for example, can mine for coal, explore the ocean's deepest depths, defuse a bomb, and even penetrate a volcano.

The pros of AIs outweighs its cons so I think we should go forward with it.
