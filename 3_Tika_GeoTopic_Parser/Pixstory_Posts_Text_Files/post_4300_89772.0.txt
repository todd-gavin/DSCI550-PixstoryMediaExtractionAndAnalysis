Ever since I can remember, I have been obsessed with drinking water and valuing what it does for our bodies. Have you ever felt sluggish, massive headaches, skin dry, hair loss, red eye?  It is probably due to dehydration you thought?

While I am no doctor, I can only speak for myself.  Today I wanted take time to outline the benefits of my favorite liquid form……. Water.

Water carries nutrients and oxygen to your cells.

-Flushes bacteria from your bladder
-Assist with digestion
-Prevents constipation.
-Normalizes blood pressure
-Stabilizes the heartbeat

We can find how many ounces of water we need to consume daily based on our weight. Please stay hydrated.
