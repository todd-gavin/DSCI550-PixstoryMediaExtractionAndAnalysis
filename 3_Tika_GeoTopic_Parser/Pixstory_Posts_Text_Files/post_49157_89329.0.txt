A Rasmussen Reports and The National Pulse poll indicated that 54% of likely voters say Joe Biden would go down in history as one of the worst American presidents.
Former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama both had better results in the poll.

Trump was recognised as one of the best presidents in US history by 41% of those polled.

People were less enthusiastic about Obama, with 34% believing he would be one of the greatest and 33% believing he would be one of the worst.

The poll was conducted over two days on Sunday and Monday, with a margin of error of 3%.

The president's and ex-presidents' image was strongly influenced by party politics.

Seventy-four percent of Republicans and 62 percent of unaffiliated voters believe Biden would be remembered as one of the worst vice presidents in history.

Democratic voters, on the other hand, did not provide a counterweight, with only 27% saying Biden would be among the best.

Another 39% said he'd be average, and 28% of Democrats said he'd be among the worst.
