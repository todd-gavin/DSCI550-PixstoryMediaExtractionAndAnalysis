On July 24, the musician celebrated his daughter Casie's 13th birthday by posting adorable pictures of her on his Instagram Stories. In the first picture, Colson Baker, aka Machine Gun Kelly, posted a picture of the kid looking suave while sporting a pair of white sunglasses, stating, "Today is your first day as a teenager. My darling, happy 13th birthday."

Gun Machine Kelly also provided followers with a sneak preview of the family's celebration, featuring a photo of Casie hugging her father while he is holding a large birthday cake with the words "OMG YOU'RE A TEENAGER" written on the icing.
