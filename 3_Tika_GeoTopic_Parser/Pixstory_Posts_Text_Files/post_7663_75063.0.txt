What a fight it turned out to be, a thrilling main event to last moment. the evening. Before talking about the main event. I want to talk about the fight of the night which was definitely between Deiveson Figueiredo and Brandon Moreno, it was an end to end contest, in the end Figueiredo go the unanimous decision in the end. He looked more focused and tactical in this fight and again became the flyweight champion. Another rematch is on the cards and it'll be the first time two fighters fight four times in the UFC.
Moving on to the main event, Francis Ngannou vs Ciryl Gane, Ciryl took the advantage in the first two rounds but from the third round we saw a change, Ngannou dominated the fight with his wrestling and if you've watched Ngannou's previous fights you'll know he wasn't a good wrestler. He's definitely improved this aspect of his game as we saw him doing slams, trips and even counter sweeps from the ground. Ngannou impressed everyone by how much he has improved and he retained the UFC Heavyweight Championship in the end.
