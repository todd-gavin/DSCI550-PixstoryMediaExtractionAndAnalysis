Nigel De Jong

Nigel De Jong, arguably one of the scariest footballers ever, spent three years at City after
arriving in 2009. Following the 2012 title win, the Dutch defensive midfielder, who memorably
avoided a red card in the 2010 World Cup final for a 'tackle' on Xabi Alonso that can only be
characterised as assault, joined AC Milan.

De Jong went on to play for the LA Galaxy and Galatasary, among other clubs, and most
recently for Al-Shahania in Qatar. De Jong was substituted for Aguero in the 60th minute
against Swansea, and Aguero scored twice in the next half-hour.

Gareth Barry

Gareth Barry, the Premier League's all-time appearance leader, was perennially
underappreciated at City after joining from Aston Villa in 2009, where he stayed until being
loaned out to Everton in 2013 following the arrival of Fernandinho.

Barry had a successful career with Everton, where he made 99 of his 653 league games before
moving to West Bromwich Albion. His tenure at the Hawthorns was another tumultuous spell in
the Midlands for a City player, as he was suspected of stealing a taxi during a training camp in
Barcelona with three others.

Adam Johnson

Johnson, a former England international winger, joined Sunderland after leaving City.

Johnson
was imprisoned and served time in jail in the North East from 2016 to 2019. Since then, he
hasn't played professional football.

Stefan Savic

Stefan Savic made his debut alongside Aguero and Clichy, although he only stayed at the
Etihad for one season before joining Atletico Madrid.

Under Diego Simeone, the Montenegrin international developed into a solid defender, and he is
still a mainstay in their backline.
