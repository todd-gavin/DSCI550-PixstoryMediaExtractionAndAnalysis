#3.  Kaka

Before the age of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, former Real Madrid great Kaka was the last player to win the prized Ballon d'Or award. As a result, his move to Real Madrid was greeted with high hopes. In the summer of 2009, the Brazilian joined Los Blancos for €65 million.

Unfortunately for the attacking midfielder, he would have a miserable time at the Santiago Bernabeu. Kaka only stayed in Madrid for four years, scoring 29 goals and providing 39 assists in 120 appearances across all competitions.
After failing to make an impression at the club, the Brazilian was signed as a free agent by AC Milan in the summer of 2013.


#2.  James Rodriguez

During the summer of 2014, James Rodriguez's transfer to Real Madrid created a lot of buzz.
At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he was the breakthrough star. Following his €75 million move to the Santiago Bernabeu, the Colombian was supposed to shake up the football world.

In the Spanish capital, however, the assailant was unable to realise his full potential. During his six-year stint with Los Blancos, he scored 37 goals and added 41 assists in 125 games across all competitions. After failing to impress with Everton after leaving Real Madrid, the Colombian joined Al-Rayyan SC in Qatar this summer.


#1.  Luka Jovic

Luka Jovic joined Real Madrid after a productive season with Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt, where he scored 27 goals and added seven assists. Transfer fees for the striker totalled €70 million for the Spanish giants. He has, however, been unable to justify his move to the Santiago Bernabeu.

In 42 games with Los Blancos, the Serb has only three goals and four assists to his name. After failing to impress in front of goal during the first part of last season, he was loaned back to Frankfurt for the second half.
