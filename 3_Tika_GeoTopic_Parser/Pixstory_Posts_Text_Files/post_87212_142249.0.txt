#3 Man City 2-3 Man United, December 2012
United came into this match on the back of an unbeaten run, and this win would have easily given them a huge point gap in the table. Mancini's men looked out of focus, and United were an unbeatable team. 
Rooney deservingly put them ahead with a scuffed finish, then added another one in the 29th minute. Man City needed a goal to ignite their momentum in the match, and Yaya Toure gave them belief from the box. Just four minutes on the clock, City were able to capitalize when Pablo Zabaleta drove the loose ball from Tevez's corner. It looked like both clubs would share spoils but United came out top, as the Red Devils got a freekick, and a perfect position for Robin van Persie, who successfully curled the ball in the bottom left corner, escalating a euphoria in the stadium.
#2 Man City 3-3 Man United, October 1990
City were having a great season under their new manager, losing only one game out of nine, and they took United by storm with David White's brace and Colin Hendry's third goal made the score-line 3-1, and Hughes had scored a formality goal. 
United were glaring at another defeat until Brian McClair and Steve Bruce took the game to their head and earned a point for United.
#1 Man City 3-1 Man United, November 2002
The Derby was remembered for Shaun Goater, who stayed for a year at City and starred in a role in another high-intensity derby.
After Anelka and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got their deserved goalkeeping score 1-1, it was time for Goater to show his class before his departure. He netted his first goal after snatching the ball from Neville in 26 minutes before striking another one and the 200th goal for City with a clean finish past gazumped Barthez.
