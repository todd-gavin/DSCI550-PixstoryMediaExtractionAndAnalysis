France has voiced for a bill in support of imprinting abortion rights in the constitution of France as an aftermath of the US Supreme Court revoking Abortion rights. Worldwide protest hits as the US comes into this decision. 
‌
‌France was one of several US allies to denounce the decision, with President Emmanuel Macron criticizing it as a threat to women's freedom.
‌
‌The leader of Macron's party in parliament on Saturday said she had tabled a bill to "enshrine the respect for abortion in our constitution" amid the rise of the far-right National Rally, a party she described as "fierce opponents" of abortion.

"Women's rights are always fragile rights that are regularly threatened," Aurore Berge told the France Inter radio station.

Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said the government would support the bill "wholeheartedly", echoing the support expressed by other ministers.

"For all women, for human rights, we must set this gain in stone. Parliament must be able to unite overwhelmingly over this text," she wrote on Twitter.
