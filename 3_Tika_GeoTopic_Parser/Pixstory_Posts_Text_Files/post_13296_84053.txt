It means I m sorry there is a war in the first place there is tragedy murder and blood spilling especially war where a country I was born in is attacking another It also means that I am sorry for these actions of the government that I didn t chose If I was born in a given country it does not mean that I agree with the government policies actions and decisions It is not because of hatred for someone but because of love for humankind and people I don t believe that there ever is a need for war and murder not when we have means to communicate Therefore I am ashamed and sorry for these actions of the Russian government
