LeBron James’ competitiveness has brought him four NBA championships, most recently with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019-20.

In the past, James compared his perfectionism and desire to win to Kobe Bryant’s “Mamba Mentality.” Both will forever be remembered as some of the most ferocious competitors in NBA history.

But to prove one’s competitiveness, a player’s world doesn’t have to revolve entirely around basketball. James said he can separate his professional career from personal life and enjoy playing basketball — even though the Lakers have played well below expectations in 2021-22 and media narratives have come with that.

“Because I can care less about what the narrative of our team is,” he explained. “At my point in my career, I don’t get involved in stuff. I don’t read about it, I don’t hear it too much. I go home, drink wine or drink tequila every night and if I’m at my house in L.A., I’m watching a movie with the kids or playing Madden. None of that stuff matters to me.

“I’m having a blast playing the game of basketball. And like I told you the other night, yes, I get frustrated, angry from losses, things we could’ve done better, and things of that nature, but once I leave the arena and I get home, I leave it there. I try to leave it there and let’s move on to the next day, how can we get better.

“I’m literally having the time of my life right now, the game is such a beautiful thing and as long as I’m healthy enough to put on a uniform, I’m gonna play with a lot of passion, a lot of energy to give my teammates what they deserve, what they need.”

The Lakers faithful can hardly argue James has not put in enough effort to make L.A. successful after he became the only player to record multiple 50-point performances at the age of 37 or older — and as he leads the NBA in scoring with 30 points per game.

And the All-Star once again ensured he will continue the hard work for as long as his health allows.
