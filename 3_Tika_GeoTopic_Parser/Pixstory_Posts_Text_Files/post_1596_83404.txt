There has been much written about Marvin Bagley and his upside This year he went from warming the bench under coach Luke Walton to getting significant playing time and starting for Coach Alvin Gentry It seemed he had turned a corner with improved defense and could be a valuable player with a young Kings team It turns out it was all a beauty contest The number pick of the draft who was picked ahead of Luka Doncic is now no longer with the team that drafted him Bagley was traded to the Detroit Pistons for two mediocre players and a second round pick Ironically the return was greater than most people had hoped for While Doncic is being mentioned already as one of the top players of all time Bagley is fighting for a roster spot for one of the worst teams in the league What went wrong In a nutshell Bagley is an intriguing athlete and a great rebounder but is not a good defensive player and passer and has not developed In a league that is dominated by ballhandling guards and bigs who can distribute the ball and defend multiple positions Bagley is a dinosaur A big who doesn t defend the rim extend the floor with his shooting and or facilitate the offense with his passing is a dinosaur Let s hope the Pistons maximize the return on what he does best which is being a garbage man in the middle to grab rebounds and get put back s I believe Bagley will find a place in this league but it seems his limitations with defense and passing will keep him in a reserve role rather than anything very impactful
