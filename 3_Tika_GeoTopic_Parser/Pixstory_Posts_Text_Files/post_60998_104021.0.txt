Personally, I love the summer season since it motivates me to work on myself and enjoy the season- especially since we get a vacation during the summer season. My go-to place and activity are the beaches and sports. I enjoy relaxing, playing in the water, and building sandcastles on beaches while also enjoying ice-creams, sandwiches, and all sorts of treats. Nevertheless, also I am a very active person, and sports have always been a massive part of my life to build myself and enjoy the company of others in a fun way. So it is always a win-win situation when these two go together.
