 Samuel ESV Talk no more so very proudly let not arrogance come from your mouth for the Lord is a God of knowledge and by him actions are weighed Romans ESV For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned Proverbs ESV The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate Isaiah ESV I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity I will put an end to the pomp of the arrogant and lay low the pompous pride of the ruthless Luke ESV He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with contempt Two men went up into the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus God I thank you that I am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even like this tax collector I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I get But the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but the one who humbles himself will be exalted Proverbs ESV Let another praise you and not your own mouth a stranger and not your own lips Proverbs ESV Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall
