After watching this short documentary, my first reaction was, how lucky and privileged we are that we were born in India where there is no tension of war. 

“Three Songs for Benazir” is a documentary based on the story of Shaista Khan and his wife Benazir. The documentary is based on the backdrop of Afghanistan where people of Afghan are scared that either they will be bombed by Americans or killed by the Taliban. 

Shaista khan is a young lad living in a camp for a displaced person in Kabul and he has only one dream to get educated and join the army but his relatives are against us. 

Shaista khan’s father told him that no one in the family went to school to date, so, why do you wish to go to school. Instead of going to school, you can do opium harvesting and earn bread for yourself and your pregnant wife. 

Shaista tried to get into the army but army personnel told him that he have to fill out the form and get signed with the guarantor who will take his responsibility, in case he make mistake or stole something in the future but no one heard his plea. 

When Shaista become a father then he gave up his dream of joining the army and joined his family farming and starts harvesting opium. But there is a quote in English that says, “You reap what you saw,” and four years later he ended up in Addiction Treatment Center. 

“Three Songs for Benazir” is directed by Elizabeth Mirzaei and Gulistan Mirzaei and they showed the condition of all the displaced afghan very well and how badly they want freedom. 

Where countries are fighting for more power and individuals are looking for more recognition and here are these people who just want freedom and education but no one cares about them. 

“Three Songs for Benazir” got the nomination for ‘Best Short Documentary’ at Oscars. The runtime of the documentary is 23 minutes and you can watch it on Netflix.
