Donald Trump s effusive praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin found traction within the right wing fringe but the Republican Party has refused to play second fiddle to him This puts him in a dicey situation when he wants to project himself the sole leader who can bring it back to power in In February as Russia started an offensive against Ukraine Trump had certified in a radio show that Putin was a genius and he was impressed by his savvy tactics His followers took the hint and portrayed Russia in glorifying terms while denigrating the West on social media Some Republican leaders too joined the bandwagon seeking to criticize President Biden s leadership However as Russia is accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine more and more Republican leaders have spoken out against Putin showing a bipartisan support to Biden s stance if not criticizing him for not doing enough to counter Russia I do not think anything s savvy or genius about Putin I think Putin is evil He s a dictator And I think he s murdering people right now House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy R Calif said this week What President Putin is is a ruthless thug who s just invaded another sovereign country and killed thousands of innocent people That s what President Putin is said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky last week Former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory has targeted fellow party leader in an ad As Ukrainians bled and died Congressman Ted Budd excused their killer As the narrative is going out of his hands Trump himself seems to be rethinking his stance At least his son has given a new spin to the praise Trump He knew exactly how to play these guys and he played them like a fiddle If it was a ruse Trump Jr will have to explain why he is exposing it so early in the game As GOP supporters too come to terms with the threat that Putin poses for the US itself Trump faces the unlikely prospects of fellow party leaders talking against his line That won t be good for his self claimed indispensable leadership
