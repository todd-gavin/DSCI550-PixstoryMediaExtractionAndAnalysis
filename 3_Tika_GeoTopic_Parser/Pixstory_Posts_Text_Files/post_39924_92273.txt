In the second episode of the Moon Knight it isn t as good as the first one when it should have been the other way around When you start a six episode series you should move with confidence and self assurance even if the show doesn t move very quickly at first But this second chapter in the Moon Knight world isn t all bad There are some good things about it too Once again we see Steven bewildered out of his depth and in a bad mood SPOILERS He has been asked to leave his job because of the chaos at the museum the night before which was the focus of the last half of the show When we see Layla May Calamawy the wife of Marc Steven she helps him in his quest to serve the Egyptian god of the moon CGI in some parts of the movie looked bad like when Ethan Hawke s Arthur was seen calling on the goddess Ammit Crackles of electricity and bright lights just didn t do anything for me which is a shame because this was supposed to be a powerful moment This is a great movie Oscar Isaac is an excellent actor who does a good job of portraying the dissociative disorder that our hero has The tired sluggish eyes with dark circles under them the panic the confusion Isaac knows everything about body language and everything else You think he s right Hawke on the other hand plays Arthur s delicate unassuming sinister self to perfection Seeing Isaac and Hawke talk to each other on screen is going to be a big part of the episode In addition we see a new suit for Steven Marc This one is more modern easy to work with as well as practical and it looks great As Isaac s character moves his movements form the shape of a crescent moon This happens in episode two as well A stunning picture A little more spice is all Moon Knight needs to make things move forward more quickly
