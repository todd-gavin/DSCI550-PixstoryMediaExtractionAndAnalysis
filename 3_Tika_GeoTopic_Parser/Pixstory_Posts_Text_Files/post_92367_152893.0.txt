For Balenciaga’s spring 2023 show, mononymous designer Demna presented his collection atop mountains of mud piled into the stadium venue. 🤌🏻😌
Models stomped through the dirt, undoubtedly dirtying the clothes in the process. A once-in-a-lifetime sight to see, you might be thinking. Not if you’re Kim Kardashian. Unable to make the Balenciaga show in person, Kardashian recreated the conditions herself. In a new series of photos uploaded to Instagram, Kardashian posed while lying down in the dirt, wearing a dress that resembled a series of dark belts, Alien-esque sunglasses, and a pair of black slides. She captioned the series, “When I couldn’t make it to the @balenciaga show @demna sent the show to me.”💗
