In Iran and in India We are fighting There is the struggle to not conform to the conservative patriarchal dictatorship here is the struggle to allow a hijab to be worn Now I realize in the most truest sense that the struggle for religious symbolism and their practise is and should be of choice CHOICE and the FREEDOM TO CHOOSE is what the point women are trying to make in both these countries What purpose does independence serves when half the population of this country and half the population of the world is suffering is dying is urging the people in power to listen to them pleading for their right to make a choice This is the protests and uprising we can see and are made visible through widespreadmedia coverage I bet there are countless other battles that women across the globe are silently fighting suffering and losing I am deliberately using the extreme negative word with helpless connotations because it is the reality My heart goes out to women who have lost their lives in Iran and throughout history for fighting for a mere right to choose For not wearing what they do not want and for wearing what they want to Countless women strife to not be treated as second class citizens in this world and their homes on streets and at workplaces A lot of people lack the insight why misogynistic sexist jokes that circle the whatsapp groups are not something to laugh at They perpetrate the same kind of culture of demeaning nbsp women irrespective of their working areas domestic or outdoor Women also need to be sensitized towards our disparities of caste class religion race and region so that we can all form a world that supports not only us but everyone suffering irrespective of the gender
