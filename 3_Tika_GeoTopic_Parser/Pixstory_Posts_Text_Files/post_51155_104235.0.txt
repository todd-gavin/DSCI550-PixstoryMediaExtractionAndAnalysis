BRAIN DAMAGING HABITS 🧠: 

You Miss Out on Sleep
You do a few things you know you shouldn’t -- we all do. But some of those bad habits can take a toll on your brain. For example, lack of sleep may be a cause of dementia

You Eat Too Much Junk Food
Parts of the brain linked to learning, memory, and mental health are smaller in people who have lots of hamburgers, fries, potato chips, and soft drinks in their diet. 

You Don’t Move Enough
The longer you go without regular exercise, the more likely you are to have dementia. You’re also more likely to get diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure

You Still Smoke
It can shrink your brain -- and that’s not a good thing. It makes your memory worse and makes you twice as likely to get dementia, including Alzheimer’s. 

You Overeat
If you eat too much food -- even the right kind of food -- your brain may not be able to build the strong network of connections that help you think and remember. 

You Stay in the Dark Too Much
If you don’t get enough natural light, you may get depressed, and that can slow your brain. Research also shows that sunlight helps keep your brain working well.
