In Retirement continues .....

Rai Bahadur Lala Lal Chand was the first President of the D. A. V. College Managing Committee and Lala Lajpat Rai the first Secretary. They set up standards of devotion to work and a keen sense of identification with the institution which has been followed by the office bearers ever since.

When I first became the secretary of the Managing Committee, Mahatma Hansraj was its President. His own sacrifice and devotion to the cause further strengthened the earlier tradition of devoted work in the Managing Committee. 

He was succeeded as President by Lala Durga Das who had been associated with the Managing Committee in various capacities for a long period. 

He was a forthright zealous, and devoted worker in the cause of the Committee. I served as the General Secretary of the Committee when he was president. He was succeeded by Bakshi Tek Chand. His father Bakshi, Jaishi Ram had been an eminent lawyer of Lahore and had made large donations to the funds of the D. A. V. College Trust and Managing Society including the building which ultimately housed our School of Divinity and the Jaishi Ram grounds which the college used for its sports activities. 

Bakshi Tek Chand served as a Headmaster of the D. A. V. High School, Lahore, for a short time after taking his Masterâ€™s degree and was for long its General Secretary. At the time of his election as president in 1923 he commanded great influence in the social, educational and political life of the Punjab and, next to Lala Lajpat Rai, he could be said to be a leader of the Punjab in all spheres of life. 

Never sparing himself in the causes to which he devoted himself, he was a hard task master. Rai Bahadur Durga Dass and Bakshi Tek Chand were syndics of the Punjab University and commanded great influence in its counsels.
