Mesut Ozil
Mesut Ozil is one of the craftiest midfielders that football has ever seen. The German international was one of the key players in the Real Madrid setup. Ozil went on to win Copa del Rey (2011) and La Liga (2012). He left Arsenal on the deadline of the transfer window after Jose Mourinho left Los Blancos.

Eden Hazard
Eden Hazard has faded away after his move to Santiago Bernabeu. But he gave nightmares to the players in the Premier League. From the left flank, he posed a threat to the opposition and Jose utilized the player to the best level. Under Jose, Hazard went on to win the Premier League, Community Shield and League Cup with several other accolades.  

Didier Drogba
Didier Drogba is one more loyal servant of Jose Mourinho but not moved out when the Portuguese stepped away from the London club. The big-game player and one of the famous players in the Chelsea folklore formed the strike force of Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. He has scored 10 goals in 10 finals that helped to win the club 10 trophies. 

Cristiano Ronaldo
The man, the myth and the legend played under two legendary managers during his career. In his early days, he played for Sir Alex Ferguson and he played for Jose Mourinho during his peak. The Portuguese winger was the part of the side that scored 100 points in a league season in La Liga. The player even won the individual awards at Santiago Bernabeu during Jose Mourinho’s tenure.
