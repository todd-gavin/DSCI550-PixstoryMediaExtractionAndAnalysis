Imagine you're having a good time with your family and friends until someone comes along and takes you away. Your kidnappers keep you imprisoned in a glass box and force you to eat cuisine you're not used to. The air in the box is not the same as the air you breathe at home, and it makes you sick. Every day for years, groups of people walk by and stare at you through the glass, but no one ever helps you escape. Doesn't that seem like something out of a nightmare or a horror film? That horror is a reality for numerous creatures locked in aquariums.

Orcas generally spend their entire lives in the wild with their mothers and siblings. Other wild dolphins dwell in familial pods as well.

Aquariums, on the other hand, pay little attention to the welfare of the animals, and some even kidnap them from their families. Boats are used to chase a pod of breeding female dolphins into shallow seas, where the animals are enclosed by nets and then hauled onto the boats. The undesirables are dumped back into the water. When water enters their lungs through their blowholes, they may die of shock or stress, or pneumonia.

Artificial insemination is frequently used to forcefully impregnate bred animals. According to studies, 90 percent of public aquariums have creatures that exhibit stereotypical neurotic behavior. This means they're driven insane in confinement and spend hours pacing back and forth, bobbing their heads, or circling their enclosures.

Animals are not only psychologically harmed by being kept in captivity, but they are also physically harmed. The chlorine and copper sulfate used to keep tanks clean have caused dolphins' skin to peel off, potentially blinding them.

It gives rise to one question: How long are we going to hurt and torture other beings because we feel superior to them?
