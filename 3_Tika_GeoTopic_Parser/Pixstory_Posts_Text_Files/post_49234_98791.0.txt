1500 people were given IQ tests and asked about their preferences for eighteen musical genres.

“…net of age, race, sex, education, family income, religion, current and past marital status and number of children, more intelligent Americans are more likely to prefer instrumental music such as big band, classical and easy listening than less-intelligent Americans.”

In the 1980s, a similar survey of thousands of 16-year-olds and their musical tastes was conducted in the United Kingdom.

The study’s authors write:

“It would be difficult to make the case that big-band music is more cognitively complex than classical music.

On the other extreme, as suspected, preference for rap music is significantly negatively correlated with intelligence.

However, preference for gospel music is even more strongly negatively correlated with it.

It would be difficult to make the case that gospel is less cognitively complex than rap.”

I was browsing the internet and came across this piece of article. I found it so interesting. However, I'm not sure if it's okay and even accurate to judge a person's intelligence by their music taste. IQ is something that's not variable, I suppose? And people's music preferences keep changing. What do you think about that?
