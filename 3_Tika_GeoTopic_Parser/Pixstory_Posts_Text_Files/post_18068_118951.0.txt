The model, who dated Depp from 1994-98, was drawn in the legal battle after Heard testified about a fight with Depp during which Heard punched him to protect her sister.

In a recent interview, Kate Moss discussed her decision to testify in her ex-boyfriend Johnny Depp's defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard.

When challenged about supporting both Depp and fashion designer John Galliano, who was found guilty of uttering racist and antisemitic remarks in a Paris court in 2011, Moss spoke up in an interview with BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs.

Moss responded, "I believe in the truth, and I believe in justice and fairness. "I am aware that John Galliano is not a horrible person, but he did have a drinking issue. While they are drunk, people don't act like themselves and say things they would never say when sober.

She said, "I know the whole story about Johnny Depp. I am certain that he didn't kick me down the stairs. That truth has to be said.
When Heard testified about a fight she had with Depp in which she hit him to defend her sister, the model, who dated Depp from 1994 to 1998, was implicated in the legal dispute.
