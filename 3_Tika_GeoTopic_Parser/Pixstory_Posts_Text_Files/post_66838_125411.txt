Olive tells us how it s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this from being denied opportunities not being believed in to being seen as inferior all because she s a young woman in a predominantly male dominated curriculum While I m not a STEM student I even see it myself in the political field I study in Men teach most classes most advisors and major professors are also male most students in classes end up being men and everything else is usually male dominated Other than that there was nothing One part of the problem is Adam himself Adam felt very very bland It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it s something we are constantly and repeatedly told especially from Olive I usually like fictional men like him even if the way he acts and looks is nothing new but this case didn t work for me You could say he needed much more seasoning That was it While I had no problem with the writing style itself I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam I couldn t understand how or why Adam liked Olive Other than her being nice and intelligent there wasn t anything to appreciate Olive first had a crush on Adam but based on her inner monologue that crush quickly turned into I love him mode which I was unable to understand where it came from Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme they want Anh other students and faculty to see them for reasons Don t ask While they talk professionally and personally it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable a crush is easily made anyway but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue And the sex scene We don t talk about it I wish I could say I laughed at the humor but I truly didn t laugh at anything Well I did laugh at the stupidity of this book
