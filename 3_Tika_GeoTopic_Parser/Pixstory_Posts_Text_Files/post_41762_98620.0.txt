The Australian sports industry faces a “shake-up” and local rights-holders must act more like entrepreneurs than administrators if they want to continue growing, the chief executive of the market’s biggest sports broadcaster says.

Speaking to SportBusiness at the SportNXT conference in Melbourne last week, Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany said: “I think the sports that will succeed the best are those that…see themselves as entrepreneurs and have a vision for their sport, a vision for how it grabs the imagination of the Australian population, how it embraces tribalism, how it can emotionally connect.”

Australia’s relatively small market, and large number of popular sports, points towards tough competition going forward for media rights dollars.

“It’s a small country…25 million people,” Delany says. “Everyone thinks it’s big and glamorous, because it’s Australia and we speak English [but] there’s not many households here. To have many sports like we do – more mainstream sports than the UK and America – it is going to be survival of the fittest.”
