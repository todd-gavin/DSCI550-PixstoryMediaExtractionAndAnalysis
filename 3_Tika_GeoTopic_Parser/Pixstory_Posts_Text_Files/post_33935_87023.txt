Marco Giampaolo Sampdoria coach spoke to the club&#39;s official website after the defeat against Juventus The game was played in a serious manner The team put in a good performance We found ourselves down by two goals without Juve shooting on goal I had good sensations I told the team that we could reopen the match by scoring in the second half The team didn&#39;t give up until the end trying to reopen the game by spending every last drop of sweat This is not the match we have to blame ourselves for The team played it to get results It was not a team at the mercy of the opponent then they won because they are stronger but the level of performance was good In the long run, with these performances you win games Not that you always meet Juventus Sampdoria&#39;s merit today is that it has always been in the game without getting used to the fight I have to say that this is a game played well
