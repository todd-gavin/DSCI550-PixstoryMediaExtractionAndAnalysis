Visit to Narwar fort continues There is no mention of Narwar till the next years but it seems probable that the last Parihar Raja who made his escape from Gwalior when the Fort was captured by Iltutmish in AD must have sought refuge in the neighbouring stronghold of Narwar He is called Sagar or Sarang Deo by the Hindu Chroniclers but by the Muhammadan historians he is styled Milak Deo son of Basil and Deobal From the tradition of the Kacchwahas it is believed that Narwar must have fallen into the hands of the Parihar Prince of Gwalior in AD It is certain that years after attack of Iltutmish in AD Narwar was in the possession of a Hindu Raja called Chahada Deva who is said to have strengthened the fortress and who surrendered the fortress to Nasir ud din Mahmud of Delhi Regarding Chahada Deva in one of the Narwar inscriptions it is said that he belonged to the royal race which indicates that he may not have belonged to the Parihar dynasty Coins of Chahada Deva are dated in AD to and of his son Asala Deva from AD to Similar coins are found of Malaya Verma Deva from to AD Ferishta has also given an account of the siege of Narwar where the host was defeated with great slaughter after a few months siege Inscription of AD at the Sati Pillar near Kulharas bears the names of Asala Deva son of Chahada Deva and another at Narwar Fort records him as the grand father of Raja Gopala who made a grant As coins of Gopala and Ganapati are not found though their names are found in inscription of the genealogy of at a baoli at Sarwaya it is inferred that they must have become tributaries of the Sultan of Delhi It seems probable that the expedition recorded by Ferishta in AD may have been directed against the king of Narwar To be continued
