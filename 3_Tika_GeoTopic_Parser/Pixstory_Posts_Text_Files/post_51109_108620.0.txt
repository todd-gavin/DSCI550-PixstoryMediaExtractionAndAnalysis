Estrogen is an important hormone that naturally occurs in both men and women. Levels are higher in women, where estrogen helps regulate the urinary and reproductive systems, and plays a role in sexual health and metabolism.

Maintaining a balanced estrogen level is key to a womanâ€™s reproductive health, but women of all ages can develop low estrogen. While there may be many factors out of our control in the quest for hormonal balance, eating foods that increase estrogen levels is an important step to take if you suffer from low estrogen. 

Low estrogen levels
Hormones are the signaling system of the body, sending tiny messengers through the blood to tell tissues and organs what to do. When hormone levels are out of whack, even tiny changes can have serious knock-on effects throughout the body.

Most common symptoms of low estrogen include:
Fatigue, trouble sleeping, or insomnia
Irregular or missed periods
Mood swings and depression
Hot flashes
Breast tenderness
Frequent urinary tract infections
Painful sex
Other symptoms may include headaches, bone density loss

Low estrogen can be caused by: 
any issues impacting your ovaries such as menopause, removal of the ovaries, or damage to them; any issues with caloric intake such as anorexia or other eating disorders, malnutrition, excessive exercise, gluten insensitivities, autoimmune conditions, and issues with your thyroid or pituitary gland.
