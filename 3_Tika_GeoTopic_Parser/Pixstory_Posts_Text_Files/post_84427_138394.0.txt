Basketball is one of the most famous sports in the world with over 2 billion fans and millions of players, from amateurs to professionals of all age groups. It is a fairly simple game played between two teams of 5 on a rectangular court. At each end of the court stands a basketball hoop, supported by a backboard 10 feet of the ground. The players must dribble the ball while following the rules of the sport and attempt to put the ball in the net. 
Playing basketball helps to improve motor coordination, flexibility. It also encourages speed, teamwork, agility and strength. These skills are shown to have a positive effect on promoting a healthy body weight and encouraging more physical activity, which can enhance cardiorespitory fitness and self-esteem. 
On a professional level, the most popular tournament is called the NBA (National Basketball Association). Usually, we see basketball being played by those who are very tall and strong but even those without such "blessings" can play just as well if not better. Basketball is a high paced game with the dynamics changing in the matter of seconds. As both a fan and a player, basketball is truly a fun sport
