Despite the high amount, Australians who earn less than $92,000 annually are now regarded as having below-average incomes. 

This comes after the Australian Bureau of Statistics' most recent wages report showed that the average full-time worker earns $1769.80 per week, or $92,029.60 per year (pre-tax). 

The typical full-time worker's weekly total wages rise to $1835.20 per week once overtime, penalty rates, incentives, and commission are taken into account. The average annual wage before taxes now exceeds $95,000.

Although the average salary in Australia is $92,000, the year-over-year gains reveal a worrying problem with the country's wage growth. Australian full-time workers may be making 2.9% more than they did a year ago, but that increase pales in comparison to the country's 6.1% inflation rate (measured by the consumer price index). 

Despite an average annual salary growth of 2.6%, Treasurer Jim Chalmers stated on Wednesday that when measured against inflation, Australia's real wage growth was "still sliding backwards, substantially."

“This is the strongest wages growth since September 2014, but at the same time it’s the biggest fall in real wages since 1998,” he said.
