Former Real Madrid legend, Iker Casillas made it clear as to what his sexual preferences were on Sunday. He disclosed the fact and let everyone know that he is gay. He made these shocking revelations on tweeter via a tweet on the 9th of October towards the latter half of the day. The tweet has taken several football fans from all around the world by surprise. While on the other hand a fair amount of people also respected his words.
The tweet by Casillas that was written in Spanish read â€œI hope I'll be respected: I'm gay". Barcelona and Casillas' teammate from the world cup winning Spanish team in 2010, Carles Puyol responded to this with a tweet that had two emojis and read, "It's time to tell them about us". Casillas however deleted his tweet. He said that his account had been "hacked". The earlier tweet by then had caught the attention of several people on the social media platform who reacted to Iker's urging everyone to respect his homosexuality. The 41-year-old perhaps was the most unexpected former player amongst all others who claimed himself to be gay. It is thus still unclear as to whether Casillas is actually gay. 
The Legendary goalkeeper had married Sara Carbonero in the year 2016 whom he had kissed after the final of the 2010 World Cup which was lifted by Spain. The couple stayed together for 5 years before parting ways in the year 2021. The couple had two children each of whom were boys. Iker spent a total of 25 years at Real Madrid and had won loads of trophies which included five La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies. His achievements with the Spanish team include winning the World Cup in 2010 along with a couple of European championships in 2008 and 2012 respectively.
