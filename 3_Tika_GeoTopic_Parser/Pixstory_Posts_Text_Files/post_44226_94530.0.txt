Manchester United player Bruno Fernandes has averted major harm after being involved in a
vehicle collision on Monday morning.

The 27-year-old was driving his Porsche when he was involved in the collision, but he is
expected to train normally at United's Carrington headquarters ahead of their Premier League
match against Liverpool on Tuesday.

United confirmed to Express Sport that Fernandes was involved in an accident in his Porsche
ahead of Monday's training. However, no major injuries were reported, and the 27-year-old is
already prepared for the crucial match against Liverpool, which United will practise for this
afternoon.

Ralf Rangnick, the Red Devils' temporary manager, talked to the media on Monday afternoon,
clarifying the situation.

He stated," Yes, he was practicing with the team, and the accident most likely occurred on the way to Carrington. As far as I'm aware, no one was hurt. He was OK, and he'll be fine tomorrow.

Pictures of the situation were then posted on the internet, showing damage to Fernandes'
Porsche and another car.

On the football, Fernandes hasn't been as crucial for United this season, with the Red Devils
just scraping by for a top-four finish.

The Portuguese international has nine goals in 30 Premier League appearances, guiding United
to fifth place, but he was unable to register in the Champions League, from which United exited
in the last 16 rounds.

Fernandes just signed a new deal at Old Trafford that would keep him at the club until 2026,
with an option for a further year, and he is expected to be at the heart of United's ambitions for the next several years, which will be led by Ajax manager Erik ten Hag.

According to 90min, an agreement has been reached for the Dutchman to take over from
interim manager Ralf Rangnick at the conclusion of the season, bringing an end to a protracted
managerial search that began in November following the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
