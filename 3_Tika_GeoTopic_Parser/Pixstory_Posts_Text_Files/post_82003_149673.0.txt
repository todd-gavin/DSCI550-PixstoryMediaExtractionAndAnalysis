Blue heaven eyeliner is one of the best eyeliner that I have tried till now💥.
The best part about it is that it does not smudge like other eyeliners✨✨. 
It is not too light and not too dark, it has a perfect shade which is another good thing about it♥️.
Very smooth and silky liner✨✨.
The quality is really good and in terms of money it is cheap and best.I love the small bottle and also the smooth texture of it.Loved it!!!!❣️🥹
