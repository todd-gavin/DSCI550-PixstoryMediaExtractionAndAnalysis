Introduction 

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that commonly manifests in childhood as insulin deficiency and resultant hyperglycaemia. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of T1D has occurred in recent decades and is currently considered to be complex interaction between an individual's genetics, environment, microbiome, and immune system. Oral complications of T1D include periodontal disease, xerostomia, and mucosal changes and early evidence suggesting an association with dental caries. Caries in children with T1D can lead to serious complications including poor sleep quality, reduced performance and attendance at school, and decreased oral intake.There is preliminary evidence suggesting that poorer glycaemic control is related to a higher experience of caries. 

Materials and methods 

A crtical review of the literature was undertaken to hypothesise the pathogenesis and explore the presence of a potential relationship between T1D and caries. 

Conclusion 

Children with T1D who have poorer glycaemic control face an increased risk of caries experience. Further research is required to determine if there is an association between glycaemic control and oral microbiota.
