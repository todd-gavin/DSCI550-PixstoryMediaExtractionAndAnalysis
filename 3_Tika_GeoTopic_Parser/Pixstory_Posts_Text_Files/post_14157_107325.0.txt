Manchester United have made an offer to sign Christian Eriksen, The Athletic understands.

Eriksen, 30, is available to sign on a free transfer as his Brentford contract expires on June 30.

The Denmark international signed a short-term deal with Thomas Frank’s side in January and made an immediate impression, helping the club to secure an impressive 13th-place finish.

Brentford won seven out of the 11 matches in which Eriksen featured, meaning they secured safety a couple of weeks before the season ended.

Brentford have been very interested in extending the midfielder’s stay in west London, but last month Eriksen said he was considering multiple options from numerous different clubs.

Eriksen, speaking to Viaplay, said: “I have different offers and options, which we are considering, and then we make a decision.

“I would love to play Champions League football again. I know how much fun it is, but it isn’t essential for me.”

Eriksen trained with Ajax's reserves before joining Brentford in January in order to get back up to speed following his cardiac arrest at the delayed Euro 2020. He played for Ajax between 2010 and 2013.

Manchester United could only manage a sixth-place finish under Ralf Rangnick last season, but could offer Eriksen a route back into Europe in the UEFA Europa League.

Former Ajax manager Erik ten Hag has taken over the reins at Old Trafford after joining the club on an initial three-year deal.

Barcelona player Frenkie de Jong is believed to be the club’s top midfield priority, with United aware of the Spanish side’s financial difficulties.

But it is understood talks between United and Barcelona have some way to run and the Premier League club have other options.

Manchester United declined to comment.
