All that trans people sitting in protests are required to do, is kind of continue to rehash the story of their pain and trauma. The media is actually deeply tied to all the other infrastructures that trans people have to continue to use in order to access subsistence, right.

Whether we enter a doctor's clinic for accessing our certificate; whether we enter the magistrate's court; or whether we enter the newsroom — all that is asked of us, is the story of pain and then everyone else gives us the theoretical viewpoint on our life, right.

We are not capable of representing ourselves apart from only representing ourselves, right. So the trans voice can only speak as the trans voice, and that's the double bind. On the one hand, trans people are made to speak for everyone, right.
