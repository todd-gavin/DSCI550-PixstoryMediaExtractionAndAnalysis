David Seaman MBE had a long and successful career as a goalkeeper for Arsenal and England. At Arsenal Seaman won the league title in 1991, 1998, and 2002. He also won the FA Cup four times (1993,1998,2002,2003), the League Cup in 1993, and European Cup Winners Cup in 1994. He represented England in the World Cups of 1998 & 2002 and Euro96 & 2000. In Euro96, he was named in the UEFA Team of the Tournament after a great campaign that included two penalty saves. Seaman has the second most appearances for Arsenal in goal after Ray Parlour, with 325 starts in goal. In the 90s, David Seaman was one of the most well-regarded goalkeepers in the world, best known for his bravery, agility, reflexes, and incredible sense of position. Seaman was bought for a record fee for a goalkeeper at the time: 1.3m pounds. In the 1990-91 season, Seaman conceded only 18 goals in 38 league games. He improved on this record in 1998-99 by conceding only 17 goals even though Arsenal missed out on the title by one point. He was nicknamed ‘Safe Hands’. Arsene Wenger was professed to be a great admirer of his athleticism. Seaman was remarkably agile for a man of his size. What he lacked in technical ability, he made up for in consistent athleticism. In 2003, he made a save in the FA Cup that was described by former Manchester United keeper Peter Schmeichel as the ‘best save I have ever seen.’ Paul Peschisolido of Sheffield United directed a header towards what appeared to be an open goal as Seaman was stranded at the near post. An extraordinary sideways leap allowed Seaman to stretch his right arm and scoop the ball away. He was 39 years old at the time. In what turned out to be his last season at Arsenal, he was then able to lead the time in the FA Cup final as captain. Lifting the 2003 FA Cup was his final act as an Arsenal player. Seaman was then signed by Manchester City,  but he had to retire before the end of that season due to a recurring shoulder injury.
