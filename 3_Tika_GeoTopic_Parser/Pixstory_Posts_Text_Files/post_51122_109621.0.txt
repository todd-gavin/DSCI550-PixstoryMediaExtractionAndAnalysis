Ok there was challenge given to me in which I have to satisfy my hunger in just â‚¹100 and which is i think a super easy task to me bcz I live in 
CHATPATI DELHI where I can get super delicious street food in a very reasonable rate . 

So letâ€™s get ready with me to have some super tasty and reasonable dishes in north campus .

So first iâ€™ve tried FATEH KI KACHORI which costs me just Rs.30 it is near Raj niwas marg , 
Civil lines Delhi-110054 

It's just my favorite street food till date. I recommend you all to go Once there and try their kachori and also Chole Kulche roll. As Their price of kachori is reasonable. And also they serve the kachori and chole kulche with h savoury / tangy sauce which makes it more interesting and delicious ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
