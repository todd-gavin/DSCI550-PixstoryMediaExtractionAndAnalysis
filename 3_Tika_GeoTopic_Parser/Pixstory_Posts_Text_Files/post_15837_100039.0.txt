Abstract

Introduction

Due to the increasing incidence of diabetes in Zimbabwe, complications such as diabetic foot (DF) are anticipated. Establishing local gaps and needs in DF healthcare is paramount for tailoring management strategies.

Aims

To determine the status of DF services in the healthcare system and explore awareness of DF management and practices among registered general nurses (RGNs) in Zimbabwe.

Methods

A mixed-methods approach was applied. Thirty-one RGNs from 16 public health facilities in Harare, Zimbabwe attending a DF workshop were administered with a cross-sectional survey instrument and a semi-structured questionnaire. Data collected included presence/absence of DF services and podiatrists in healthcare facilities, healthcare system approaches in DF care and availability of DF training/education programs for RGNs. Analysis was performed using Stata and Nvivo software.

Results

No respondents reported availability of podiatrists. Only 1 (3%) of RGNs reported DF screening in primary care. Sixty percent (18) did not know or had never screened for DF. The RGNs reported inadequate DF educational programs/modules in primary care settings.

Conclusion

This data highlights a need to improve DF education for RGNs at the frontline of managing PLWD. Understanding the needs for DF services may guide interventions to improve education and awareness programs that are appropriately tailored to local constraints in the health system. The non-communicable diseases director is encouraged to develop DF educational programmes for frontline health care workers.
