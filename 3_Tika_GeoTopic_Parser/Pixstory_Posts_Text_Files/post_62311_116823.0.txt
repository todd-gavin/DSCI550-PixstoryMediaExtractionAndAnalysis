People leave but memories don't. When I look back I see myself being innocent,miserable and too fragile and yet glooming. Bring a kind hearted is a good thing but people misusing your kindness it's good. I trained myself to be hard and now here I am stronger, surpassed my hard time and stood up for myself. I'm very greatfull for old me czs having tolerating all the hardship I'm proud of myself 🤗❤
