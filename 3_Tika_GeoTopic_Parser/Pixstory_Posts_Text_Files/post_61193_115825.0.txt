Kulfi falooda is a delicious, cooling and filling dessert. Can't you just imagine the heat wave disappear the moment you hear or see those words. If one awesome Indian dessert just isn't enough for you or your taste buds, this combination dessert will definitely do it.

You can get hooked to kulfi falooda at first sight. The creamy and chilled kulfi, lying in a bed of and topped with falooda--sweet vermicelli flavoured with rose water. Isn't that just what a summer fantasy is made of?
