The 23-year-old has been shown the way out of the Estadio El Alcoraz, according to the
Spanish second-tier club. Kelechi Nwakali, a former Arsenal player, is now a free agent after his
contract with Huesca was cancelled on Tuesday.

He appeared in 19 league games in 2021-22 before joining the Nigerian national team for the
Africa Cup of Nations in 2021. Xisco Munoz, the manager of his club, has been considering him
for action since his return from the Super Eagles' disastrous expedition in Cameroon.

The Aragon team, on the other hand, revealed in a statement on their website that they had
parted company with the former Nigeria U17 captain, but could not say why.

“Sociedad Deportiva Huesca have terminated the contractual relationship maintained by the first
team player Kelechi Nwakali with the Barca entity,” the club wrote in a statement.
“The club has informed the player of the decision to terminate the contract that united both in
the current campaign but expired in June 2022.

“SD Huesca wishes Nwakali the best in his professional future.”

After a dominant performance with Nigeria at the 2015 Fifa U17 World Cup in Chile, Nwakali
was voted the tournament's Fifa U17 Player of the Tournament, which drew Arsenal's interest.

Following his failure to break into Arsenal's first team, the Gunners loaned the Nigerian to MVV
Maastricht of the Dutch second tier. Before being moved out of the Emirates Stadium for a move
to Huesca, he played for VVV-Venlo and FC Porto B.

He played in just five games in his first season at the Estadio El Alcoraz as the Spaniards were
promoted to the Spanish top flight. Huesca was relegated to the second tier, and he was
assigned to Alcorcon for the rest of the 2020-21 season.
