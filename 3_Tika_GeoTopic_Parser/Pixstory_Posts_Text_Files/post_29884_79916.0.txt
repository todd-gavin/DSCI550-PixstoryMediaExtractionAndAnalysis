Cloud computing is typically defined as a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. 
In cloud computing, the word cloud is used as a metaphor for ‘the Internet,’ so the phrase cloud computing means “a type of Internet-based computing,” where different services – such as servers, storage, and applications – are delivered to an organization’s computers and devices through the Internet.

Cloud computing is comparable to grid computing, a type of computing where unused processing cycles of all computers in a network are harnessed to solve problems too intensive for any stand-alone machine.
The goal of cloud computing is to apply traditional supercomputing, or high-performance computing power, normally used by military and research facilities, to perform tens of trillions of computations per second, in consumer-oriented applications such as financial portfolios, to deliver personalized information, to provide data storage or to power large, immersive computer games.

A report published by IT research and advisory firm Gartner estimates that in India alone the market for cloud-based services will rise by a third to $557 million this year-, and more than triple by 2018. India’s IT giants are becoming experts at going in early, at the planning stage, and defining what their corporate customers ought to be doing to take advantage of emerging technologies.

“They are playing to their strengths, which is services. Even in the cloud, they are in the services [area], specifically focussed on services brokerage,” says Arup Roy, research director at Gartner.
