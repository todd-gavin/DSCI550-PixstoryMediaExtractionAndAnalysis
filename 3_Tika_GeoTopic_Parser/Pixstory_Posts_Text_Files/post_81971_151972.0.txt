The feeling is different when you enter your college after two long covid years😌❤️.
I was very anxious and nervous too for the first day of my college but then i met these crazies🤣 and went super comfortable with them♥️.
Can't figure out where did all the nervousness went🤔💭!
Ekanki, Harshita, Kalash, Priyanshi and Sharique are like a family to me😅
Can't believe it's just been two weeks since i met them😅💭.
Yesterday we went on a movie date too🎞️🍿.Somehow it became  an unplanned red and green theme ❤️💚.
Enjoyed a lot there!!!😌❤️
We are a small-happy-college family now 💕!
Let's see where does this new chapter of my life takes me😌🌸.
Cheers to more good and exciting college days ahead!!🥂
