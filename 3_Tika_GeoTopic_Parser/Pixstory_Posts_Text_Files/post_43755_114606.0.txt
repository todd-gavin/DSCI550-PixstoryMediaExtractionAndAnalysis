Huddersfield boss Carlos Corberan has resigned today amid concerns about the direction the Championship club is headed, with Danny Schofield as his replacement.

It is found that Corberan has interests in other rival clubs, but as it stands he does not have an agreement to join another team. Instead, his reason for stepping down as Huddersfield's boss is linked to concerns that his vision for Huddersfield is not aligned with those at the very top of the club.

A club statement read, “Huddersfield Town can confirm that Carlos Corberan has resigned from his position as head coach of the club.

The 39-year-old was appointed to the role in July 2020 and following a 20th place finish in his first season, coached the team to the Sky Bet Championship play-off final in the last campaign. However, on Wednesday evening, he notified the club of his decision to leave alongside his long-term colleague Jorge Alarcon.”

Head of football operations Leigh Bromby said, “It is with sadness that we have accepted Carlos Corberan’s resignation. He was a big part of what was a fantastic season in 2021-22, but he has subsequently come to us over the last 24 hours and made it clear that he doesn’t think he is the man to take us forward.”

“The time is disappointing, with our preparations for the new season already underway.”

“Danny Schofield will now step up to lead the team. He knows the club, the players, our coaching environment and our structure as well as anyone and is ideally positioned to give us continuity.”

Sources are adamant that Corberan, despite growing some interest from other teams, will not walk straight into another club but it felt it was beneficial for everyone involved.
