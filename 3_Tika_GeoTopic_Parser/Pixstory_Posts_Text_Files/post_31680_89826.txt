An international research team coordinated by Sapienza has developed a new type of nanoparticle for the delivery and transport of drugs which, thanks to a coating of human plasma proteins, is able to deceive the immune system by remaining in the body for a long time. The results of the study have been published in the journal ACS Nano In the biomedical field, liposomes represent the ideal tool to convey the transport of drugs in anticancer therapies These nanoparticles formed by one or more lipid bilayers offer numerous advantages compared to traditional technologies such as the possibility of reducing the doses of drugs by increasing selectivity towards target organs and reducing potentially harmful side effects However, only a small number of liposomal formulations have been approved by regulatory bodies and entered steadily into clinical practice Decades of research have in fact established that the limited clinical success of liposomes is mainly due the changes they undergo as soon as they come into contact with the blood once introduced into the organic liquid these are covered with a protein crown and are recognized by the immune system as a foreign body to be eliminated What the immune system fights therefore not the liposome itself but precisely the protein dress it wears in its blood Hence the idea of an international research team coordinated by Giulio Caracciolo and Saula Checquolo of Sapienza to create a protein coating invisible to the immune system to deceive it and make it accept the nanoparticles they contain drug therapy The biomimetic particle developed by researchers in a study published in the journal ACS Nano with the collaboration of the University of Technology of Graz in Austria and Utrecht University in the Netherlands called proteoDNAsome and consists of three distinct compartments DNA lipids and proteins
