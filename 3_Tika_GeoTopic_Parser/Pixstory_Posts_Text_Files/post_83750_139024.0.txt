I am a designer so i like to create random designs. This is a model of a kitchen that was done using a free software called SketchUp. It is cery simple to use and all it takes is just drawing shapes and extruding them to make it a 3D sketch. It's a very interesting tool that i have used since I was 10 on a very Low Spec laptop. This is probably one of the most useful softwares I've used and its something that everyone must learn.
