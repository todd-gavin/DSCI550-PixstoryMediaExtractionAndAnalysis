1- Never wear your shoes inside the house.
Always leave them outside.👎

2- Dont pour your own drinks.
Receive or present in both hands.🙌

3- Dont write someone's name in Red pen❌

4- Dont put the chopsticks straight, putting them on the top is the right way 👍

5- Dont present anything with No.4 to someone. In the elevators you will not find floor no.4 instead written as F. ✍️
