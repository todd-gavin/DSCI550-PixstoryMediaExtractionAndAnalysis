The House voted 228-195 largely along party lines to pass legislation to codify the right to contraception nationwide, seeking to conserve it from potential Supreme Court intervention.

The Right To Contraception Act, sponsored by Rep. Kathy Manning, D-N.C., would solidify a right in federal law for individuals to obtain and use contraceptives. It would also assert a right for health care providers to provide contraceptives and allow the Justice Department and entities harmed by contraception restrictions to seek enforcement of the right in court.

Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., said the United States is facing "a perilous time, where an extremist Supreme Court and the GOP are rolling back our rights."

Democratic leaders said they were prompted to act by Justice Clarence Thomas' opinion in the ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, who wrote that the Supreme Court should also revisit decisions like 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut, which prohibited states from banning contraceptives and "correct the error" it made.

Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H., said that the "overturning of Roe v. Wade was a wake-up call" and that Congress could not leave other rights like that of contraception "up to chance," saying it is "none of the government's business."
