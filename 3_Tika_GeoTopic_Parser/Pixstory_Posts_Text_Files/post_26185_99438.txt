The new sneaker launched by the French brand is called Paris Sneaker and on paper only in theory believe me it would seem like a tribute to the city that has seen the brand grow The sneakers in question are very rare and only available in pairs they have already been run in if we can define it that way in fact they are completely worn out with a destroyed sole and the shoe itself practically in tatters It is thus necessary to conceive a new use since it seems difficult to imagine wearing them for a walk in the center The most obvious and perhaps the only correct idea is to treat them as a piece of art and keep them under a plexiglass case in the north corner of the living room So how should this launch be seen as yet another provocation by Demna Gvasalia Also, but above all, a statement of position The press release that accompanies the announcement of the shoes bears advice in large letters, rather a motto meant to be worn for a lifetime It is utopian to think you can wear something for life but it is an interesting topic of analysis regarding sustainability
