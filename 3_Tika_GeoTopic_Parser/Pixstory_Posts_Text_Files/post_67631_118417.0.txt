Juventus could reportedly propose Adrien Rabiot in a swap deal for PSG’s midfielder Leandro Paredes.

Rabiot’s future in Turin is still up in the air as he’s heading into the final year of his contract. Although multiple reports claim that Juve are not putting the Frenchman on the transfer list, he could still leave the club.
The 27-year-old’s absence from Juve’s pre-season tour in the USA triggered speculation about his future. Rabiot did say that his decision not to join the tour is because of personal reasons, but many believe that it could be a sign of his departure.

According to Tuttosport(via Juventusnews24), the French international might really leave Turin this summer. Rabiot reportedly could make a return to PSG in a swap deal with Leandro Paredes.
