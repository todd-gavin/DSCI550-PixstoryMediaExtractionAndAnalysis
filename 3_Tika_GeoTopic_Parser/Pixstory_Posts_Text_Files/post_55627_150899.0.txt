Australia has announced that it will stop requiring Covid isolation as of the next month. BBC News reported that starting on October 14, the five-day isolation requirement for those who test positive for the virus will no longer apply. Since the outbreak started, the nation, sometimes referred to as "Fortress Australia," has imposed some of the harshest regulations worldwide. The "emergency phase" of Australia's reaction, according to Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, is probably done. The decision, according to Prof. Kelly, "does not in any way signal that the pandemic is finished." One of the few limitations that was still in place was mandatory isolation. According to official statistics, Australia continues to report 5,500 viral cases every day. It has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. Prof. Kelly predicted that nation would see "future peaks" of the virus, but it currently had "very low" numbers of hospital admissions and aged-care outbreaks.The Australian Medical Association opposes the change, saying those who pushed for it are not "scientifically literate" and are putting lives at risk.
