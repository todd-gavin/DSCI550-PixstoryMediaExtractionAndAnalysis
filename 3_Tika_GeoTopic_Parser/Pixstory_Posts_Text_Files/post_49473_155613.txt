At the end of the day it s on the parents on how they decide to raise their kids as long as the kids are safe and protected and of course feels that way as well In an ideal world gender wouldn t truly exist Because to be very honest what is gender other than a bunch of letters But considering they have been a part of our society for so long people have learnt to make it a part of their identity Whether they want to raise their children gender neutral or assign them a gender I think the most important thing is that the child KNOWS they re going to get support from their family no matter who they are and choose to be That they have the freedom to choose their gender in future Parents need to stop assigning gender roles and stereotypes to their kids They should be taught that absolutely nobody is superior to others Parents should raise kids with liberal thoughts and ideas and by liberal I don t mean a political ideology but free thoughts
