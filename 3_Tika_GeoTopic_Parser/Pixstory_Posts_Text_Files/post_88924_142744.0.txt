Two major republics in the Caucasus region, Armenia and Azerbaijan came to blows again on Monday night over the disputed region of Nagorno- Karabakh. 
Armenian and Azerbaijani defence forces exchanged artillery fire escalating instances of terror and fear similar to the 2020 war and reported a combined death toll of nearly 100. 
On Tuesday morning, Azerbaijanin forces shelled Armenian troops at several locations along the border, calling it a response to a buildup of Armenian landmines and weapons near the border. Armenia later retaliated through the similar means. 
In 1991, the domiciles of landlocked region of Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence and ruled itself since then, with the Armenian support- later known as Artsakh. 
The settled conflict, erupted again in 2020 where Azerbaijan recouped broad swaths of Nagorno-Karabakh in a six week long war. 
Azerbaijan has a population of Muslim majority while Armenia has a population of Christian majority due to which conflicts have aroused earlier on religious terms. 
According to the AFP report, Armenia claimed that Azerbaijanin forces launched combat drones towards Jermuk overnight, and initiated intensive shelling with artillery and high calibre rounds, in the direction of Jermuk and Verin Shorzha village near the Sevan lake shortly after midnight.
Meanwhile, the Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of shelling former's position in the Kalbajar and Lachin districts. 
Nagorno-Karabakh region plays an important role in the global energy trade, with pipelines connecting Azerbaijan and Turkey passing by the territories, the dispute can lead to uncertainties in global energy market. 
Although the conflict is considered to be at a regional extent, the Minsk Group has sought to prevent military clashes and to implement a peaceful settlement.
Notwithstanding the efforts, the likelihood of a peaceful settlement seems unattainable.
