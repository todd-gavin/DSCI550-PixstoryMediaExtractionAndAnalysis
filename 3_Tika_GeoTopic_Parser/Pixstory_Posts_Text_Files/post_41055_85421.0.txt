The slogan, Ars gratia artis, is curled above a roaring lion's headshot, a corporate logo as well-known as any produced by twentieth-century capitalism. We know what's coming next, but the curtain raiser is a double ruse, first because Latin was not the studio's customary second language (that would be Yiddish), and second because the main attraction was never for the sake of art alone. The roaring lion (or Leo, as the ad-pub lads dubbed him, depending on which cat did the vocals) was, on the other hand, pure truth in advertising: the king of the Hollywood jungle prepared to eat the competition alive.

That was back in the day. Hollywood Reporter said that MGM is now projected to be swallowed by a company that is named after a jungle, which is higher up the food chain. While Amazon waits for the Federal Trade Commission to approve its $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM to fuel its streaming pipeline, it also appears anxious to bask in the reflected glory of the greatest of all studio system brands. 

Louis B. Mayer, the biggest of the Hollywood big machers, the mogul who lived and sold the American ideal as passionately as Benjamin Franklin, is the last initial in the abbreviation. He was born in 1885 (or possibly 1883) near Minsk (or possibly Kiev) and was brought by his Jewish parents to St. Petersburg.
