Former Bayern Munich player  believes the club should be fined for fielding 12 players on the pitch at the same time during their Bundesliga victory over Freiburg on Saturday.

Niklas Sule was brought onto the pitch to replace the already-departed Corentin Tolisso before a switch between Kingsley Coman and Marcel Sabitzer could take place during the closing minutes of the Bavarian side's 4-1 win at Europa-Park Stadion.

Around 20 seconds had passed when the game was brought to a standstill, causing a major delay as the game neared its conclusion, and now Hamann has chimed in on the issue, claiming that Bayern should face disciplinary punishment.

"It's a violation of the rules," Hamann stated while covering the game for Sky Sport Germany.

"If one goes onto the field, another has to go down. It doesn't matter whether they play 20 seconds, twelve or five minutes.

"There is no question in my mind that it must be punished."

What exactly are the guidelines?

The DFB's substitute policy states that in the event of a substitution incident, the match is forfeited by the opposing team by a two-goal margin.

"If a player is not entitled to play or to field a game, the team that culpably fielded this player loses the game 0-2 and the opponent wins 2-0, unless the match has not been restarted by the referee after the player who is ineligible to play has been fielded," per the DFB's rules.

Freiburg has not yet announced whether they would pursue legal action against Bayern, but given that a win would have kept them in touch with fourth-placed RB Leipzig in the Champions League competition, the situation is certain to escalate in the coming days.
