The country has witnessed an eighteen year old who just turned eighteen bought an AR and carried it into an elementary school and shot kids in the face and killed them he firing almost rounds The shooter isn t the only one responsible isn t the lax Texas gun laws responsible Governor Greg Abbott s signature batch of legislation in the area relaxed several restrictions and made it easier to carry a gun Salvador Ramos s eighteenth birthday was May th and he legally purchased an AR style semi automatic rifle the very next day Then on May th his second gun On May th he went on a shooting rampage that concluded in the deaths of nineteen children and two educators at Robb Elementary School Let s not forget about a similar eighteen year old who had bought an AR style semi automatic rifle soon after his birthday and took it in to a supermarket in Buffalo New York where he shot and killed ten people Isn t it so scary that when people turn eighteen first thing they do is buy guns and be armed Is this the aim of the second amendment One might also think that tighter age regulations on such purchases would be a relatively modest commonsense law to enact After all at the federal level there is already a minimum age of twenty one on handgun purchases though the long gun minimum is only eighteen and there are obvious loopholes for private sales and transfers in a gun country like America It is absurd enough that civilians of any age can easily buy such semi automatic weapons Isn t a background check and a proper gun license a minimum necessary for an individual to own a gun This will prevent year olds from purchasing guns right away without any license or training and help prevent violence from an extinct as America s gun culture has led to a state wherein people could not imagine a life without guns
