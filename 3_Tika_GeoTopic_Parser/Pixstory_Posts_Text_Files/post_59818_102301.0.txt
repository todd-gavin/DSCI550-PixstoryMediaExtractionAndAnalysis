At  supreme court a plea was registered to challenge delhi HC judgment having lack which was heard but later dismissed. Which was the best decision i believe and SC being the most powerful court having people and powerful judges having knowledge of every psychological and other environmental issue if they have approved it and asked people to feed it means its not the mess of dog its the mess of execution of right behavioural activities and better utilisation of resources and unorganised regular feeding and other health check programs. 

Hc delhi had a wonderful judgment and its for people and for the people long term betterment. If followed at right direction and guidelines were also passed by sc. What i believe its lack of awareness and difference what we need to distinguish for what wild dogs were and what pariah dogs are if we give same treatment we are automatically encouraging a major and deadly environmental loss cause hate is something which creates the biggest mess and to rectify and proofing it is the best option in humans have a psychology of learning till the day they are capable of surviving and ego prevents the betterment of human life and sometimes others also. Its all about the compassion to rectify and solve the issue.
