"If girls' schools remain closed, all the achievements of Afghan women will be lost and Afghanistan will return to the period of cultural and social decline. This is an irreparable regression of women to the dark period, as a result of which several generations of girls in this country are deprived of literacy and development. I want to reopen schools for Afghan girls and all schools should be opened for girls as soon as possible. I want the new generation of Afghan girls to blossom again. They have the right to study science based on civil and Islamic laws.
 Unfortunately, after the Taliban came to power, most of the citizens of Afghanistan have been deprived of their basic rights. Women and girls, who make up half of the country's population, have been deprived of their most basic rights, which is education. Taliban do not allow girls to study and this situation has made life difficult for the majority of citizens. Women are not only deprived of the right to education, but they are also not allowed to engage in political, social, cultural and economic activities. Women cannot travel inside and outside of Afghanistan without a "mahram". Women and girls are not allowed to exercise. Afghanistan is the only country on earth that does not allow women and girls to study.
