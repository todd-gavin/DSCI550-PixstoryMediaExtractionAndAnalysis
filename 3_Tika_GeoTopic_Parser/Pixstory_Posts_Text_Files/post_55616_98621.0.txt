Media Werk had reported that Warner Bros. International Television Production Australia in partnership with Speech & Drama Pictures has secured the exclusive international rights to develop the Australian ballad How to Make Gravy into a Christmas film.

Written by Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly and originally released in 1996, How to Make Gravy tells the story of a prisoner named Joe who writes a letter to his brother Dan about his longing to be with family at Christmas.

26 years since the song was released, the Australian song will now see its lyrics and story adapted into a feature film. Paul Kelly said, “Dan and Joe and Rita and Angus and Dolly and all the others have been stuck inside that song so long, I’m glad they’re going to get a chance to live life a different way.”

Michael Brooks, managing director of Warner Bros. International Television Production Australia, said, “In Australia, December 21st is known as Gravy Day. Few songs have risen to cult status and secured a date on the festive calendar, which is why Paul Kelly’s How to Make Gravy is so special. 

“It’s a privilege to be given the opportunity, alongside our partners Megan and Nick at Speech & Drama, to unravel the mystery and meaning captured in Paul’s now iconic lyrics and bring this incredible story to the screen.”
