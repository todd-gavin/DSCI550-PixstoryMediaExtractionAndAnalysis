We all have an inner critic At times this little voice can actually be helpful and keep us motivated toward goals like when it reminds us that what we re about to eat isn t healthy or what we re about to do may not be wise However this voice can often be more harmful than helpful particularly when it gets into the realm of excessive negativity This is known as negative self talk and it can really bring us down Negative self talk is something that most of us experience from time to time It creates significant stress not only to us but to those around us if we re not careful Negative self talk can take many forms It can sound like I m not good at this or I can never do anything right Negative things we say to ourselves I hate how i look today I m so ugly That would never look good on me I m a failure I wish i had that too I m so stupid i can t believe i made this mistake I don t deserve to he happy Everyone has their life together except me I m never going to be successful I suck All these critical inner dialogue are directly linked to depression and poor mental health Those who find themselves frequently engaging in negative self talk tend to be more stressed So it s definitely something to fix Always remember Optimism and positive self talk take practice It may feel strange at first But the benefits you ll experience are real Positivity is like a muscle It needs regular exercise to become stronger but with practice you ll get the hang of it and reap the rewards
