The capuchin monkeys of Fazenda Boa Vista usually use large stones to open palm nuts with very hard shells and a previous study has shown that the use of opportunistic tools occurs when the nuts are more abundant. For these small monkeys it is a very tiring behavior and which requires years and years of practice to be learned Why do it What nutritional advantage do capuchin monkeys derive from the use of tools To answer these questions adequately a question that strangely no one had ever asked before we had to determine the quantity and quality of the food ingested throughout the day from each cebo on the days when he used tools and also ate palm nuts and on the days when he didn&#39;t use them explains Visalberghi Lucas Peternelli dos Santos then a doctoral student at the Brazilian University of SÃ£o Paulo for more than a year every day from sunrise to sunset he followed without ever losing sight of a specific capuchin recording everything he did everything he ate and how much he ate With the help of local assistants all the foods that each individual had ingested were collected, identified and dried in each day and then in the laboratory he examined the content in terms of macronutrients continues Visalberghi We then compared the energy and macronutrients acquired on the days in which the capuchin monkeys used and in which they did not use tools. Naturally, the weight of each individual was also considered on which his energy requirement and the high energy cost required by lifting heavy stones and using them as strikers The aim is obviously to evaluate the convenience of using tools in the relationship between relative caloric expenditure and the resulting nutritional benefit The qualitative analysis then made it possible to calculate how many calories consumed daily came from proteins carbohydrates lipids and the fiber content The results show that for the same amount of food ingested in terms of dry weight the use of tools allows the capuchin monkeys to acquire about 1 of more calories per day from to kcal per kg of weight
