Andrea Gios, president of the Italian Ice Sports Federation, has arrived at the statements made by Arianna Fontana after the medals won at the Beijing Winter Olympics. The star of our short track has denounced the climate of hostility towards her and her coach husband Anthony Lobello on the more elements of the national team Gios commented Arianna hasn&#39;t spoken to me for months The last time it happened in October at the delivery of the Coni collars I knew she would have let off steam but as a Federation we have nothing to reproach ourselves for We have always worked with the utmost scruple in the interest of the Federation and Arianna She is our most important asset because there are no rules, not that the athletes can choose the coaches of the National team. She was put in the conditions that we considered optimal to be able to carry out her activity following her and her coach husband&#39;s requests without any repercussions on the group And the results prove it by his and the team Gios also spoke of the attempts to damage in training by male colleagues about which Fontana complained The most out of tune part of Arianna&#39;s utterances concerns this story which moreover it dates back to three years ago which we had addressed and clarified at the time and which for us was dead and buried It emerged that it had been a typical situation of a common training in which a female athlete has to deal with teammates who have a decidedly more important physical structure so the contacts that there may be in the short track are not the same as there would be between women. Moreover, these same men whom you accuse trained for years with Arianna they made her grow they brought her up to to these medals I find this unpleasant exit of his destroyed the climate of the team in such an important moment
