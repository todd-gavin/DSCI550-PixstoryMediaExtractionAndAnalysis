Wentworth is a television show largely based on the popular 1980s television drama Prisoners. It's believed to be a modern remake of the popular show, featuring a younger version of the main character, convict Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack), at the start of her sentence. 

As per collider, Bea enters a correctional facility while awaiting trial for the attempted murder of her husband, and we witness her learn to navigate the complexity of prison life and eventually master the system to rise to the top of the prison hierarchy over the course of eight seasons. 

As the series proceeds, the focus of the show changes away from Bea and into the lives of other convicts and prison personnel at the correctional facility, giving the drama additional energy and depth.

Perfect for you if you liked Orange is the New Black but wanted a touch more thrilling drama and Australians.
