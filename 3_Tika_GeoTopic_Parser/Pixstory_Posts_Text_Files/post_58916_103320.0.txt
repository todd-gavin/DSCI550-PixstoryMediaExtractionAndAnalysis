Sidhu Moose Wala, a popular Punjabi singer and rapper who joined the Congress before the Punjab elections, was assassinated.

Moose Wala ran for the Mansa Assembly seat on a Congress ticket. He was defeated by Dr Vijay Singla of the AAP by a margin of 63,323 votes. Moose Wala, who is from Moosa, a village in Mansa district, joined the Congress in November last year to much fanfare. With the Congress granting him a ticket from the Mansa Assembly constituency, the sitting Mansa MLA, Nazar Singh Manshahia, revolted against the party, stating that he would oppose the controversial singer's candidacy.

Shubhdeep Singh aka Sidhu Moosewala Sidhu was born in the Punjab village of Moosa. He continued to sing and later became an actor and politician. He was in contact with a gangster, and news of his fights with various people was constant.

Yesterday, the CM removed Sidhu Moosewala's security, and the singer was killed within 24 hours. According to me, the blame is on the state government, but many people have different perspectives and blame different people.
