Woooooow The people did it They did it even though they were crazy I don t know what to say about this ending Also what fun Since Moon Knight came out this Marvel hero has had a lot of cooks in the kitchen That s true for every Marvel comic but think of these cooks as people who are trying to have fun with a certain type of food Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood came up with one of the most creative takes on the Fist of Khonshu back in when Marc Spector woke up in a mental hospital not sure if he d dreamed about everything or not So that s how Episode came to an end And it wasn t just a brief moment at the end or a stinger at the end It lasted for the last ten minutes and we re still not out of the woods so to speak Episode may have looked like a break at first Not at all There is no Moon Knight With their supernatural protection gone another bonus twist Steven and Layla were on their own in the tomb of Alexander the Great They had to race against time to get there before Harrow did This was the right episode at the right time for a TV season As a tomb raider Layla was the star of the show The ghouls stalking everyone inside the tomb the interesting love triangle between our heroine and two men living inside one body made this the best instalment yet
