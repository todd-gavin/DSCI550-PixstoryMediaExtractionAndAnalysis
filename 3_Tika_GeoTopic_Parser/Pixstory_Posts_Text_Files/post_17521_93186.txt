The Los Angeles Lakers started the team s overhaul by dismissing head coach Frank Vogel after he led L A to a record in his third season with L A The decision seemed inevitable after the Lakers failed to qualify for the Play In Tournament Although several factors played a role in the Purple and Gold s failure the franchise decided it was time for a leadership change and that it would achieve so by bringing in a new head coach That s what Lakers Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka told Vogel in a very open and honest meeting on Monday Earlier today I had a chance to get with Frank Vogel and upstairs in a meeting and just want to thank him for three very strong years as the head of our basketball coaching department Pelinka said in a press conference We expressed gratitude for the three years of being able to work together with a capacity of trust and collective mindset and collaboration And just let him know that it was a point in the Lakers history where we felt like it was time for a change in our leadership voice and those are difficult things to do Frank was grateful for the opportunity he had and we had a conversation about how this is just an inflection point where he goes from being the leader of the Lakers to part of our legacy and especially our championship legacy So I would characterize it as a very open and honest meeting and was thankful for the time with him and just wanted to start today with expressing our gratitude to him to his family for their three years of service here Frank is a great man and a great coach and will go on to do great things and we re very thankful that we had that three seasons with him as a part of everything we do
