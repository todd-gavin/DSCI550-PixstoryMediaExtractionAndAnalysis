 The final trailer for 'Halloween Ends' is here concluding the ‘H40 trilogy’ which started all the way back in 1978. Releasing both theatrically as well as streaming on Peacock on the same day on October 14, Halloween Ends promises to be the final confrontation between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers, the killer who has been haunting her for 40 years.
Whether this is the last Halloween film, or whether the franchise goes dormant for a few years before rebooting remains to be seen, but Jamie Lee Curtis has said this will for sure be her last time in the role that made her a Scream Queen. The actor has been playing the character for almost 45 years, all the way back from the original film in 1978.
The official synopsis of the film reads, "Final Girl. Final Face-Off. Final Trailer. After 45 years, the most acclaimed, revered horror franchise in film history reaches its epic, terrifying conclusion as Laurie Strode faces off for the last time against the embodiment of evil, Michael Myers, in a final confrontation unlike any captured on-screen before. Only one of them will survive."
In addition to Curtis, the film also stars James Jude Courtney as Michael Myers while Andi Matichak, Will Patton, Kyle Richards, and Omar Dorsey reprise their roles as Allyson Nelson, Officer Frank Hawkins, Lindsey Wallace and Sheriff Barker from previous films, respectively. The role of Corey Cunningham will be played by The Hardy Boys' Rohan Campbell in the film.
