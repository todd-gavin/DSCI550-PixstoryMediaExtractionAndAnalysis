Relief for Borussia Mönchengladbach fans! The torment of the 2021/22 Bundesliga season came to an end in the middle of May. The club's sporting Director and chief has since been
in the works to find a new head coach. Of all managerial profiles on the market, Daniel Farke
most suited Gladbach's demands. The ex-Norwich man is a passionate manager, up right
from the grassroots of German football with Dortmund's youth teams.

“In Daniel Farke, we have been able to sign a coach that fits perfectly to the path that we want to go down as a club,” said sporting director Roland Virkus. “We are looking forward to
tackling the challenges that lie ahead of us, together with him.”

The 45 year old has managed an impressive total of 404 matches across stints in Germany,
England and most recently Russia averaging 1.63 points per game. The club hierarchy is
convinced Farke has the CV and the mentality to win the Gladbach faithful after a season
that brought disappointment after disappointment.
Farke left Russian team Krasnodar in
early March, following the invasion of Ukraine.

Prior to that, he was in charge of Norwich City in the Premier League. He transformed the canaries' in terms of the ideals they uplifted as a football club, the kind of industrious football
they played and all that with relatively low-profile signings and a miserly budget.

Mönchengladbach have commendable resources and global reach when compared to
Norwich who are minnows in the English game, but the same carries the weight of the club's
expectations.

Farke finished 14th with Norwich in the Championship before gaining promotion, albeit being
immediately relegated. Although at the beginning of the 2019/20 campaign the canaries
were flying with Teemu Pukki in surreal form. Gladbach, who finished 10th with a negative 7
goal difference in Germany will hope for more of the same.
