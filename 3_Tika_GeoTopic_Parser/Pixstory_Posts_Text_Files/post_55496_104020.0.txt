Majority of the times, I get into a strict diet with whole lot of energy, end up feeling overwhelmed and go  back to my  old habits.

And itâ€™s a vicious cycle that never ends.

Variations are always good as long as they incorporate healthy balanced nutrients packed together.
Which is all healthy eating is about.

Consistency is ðŸ”‘.
