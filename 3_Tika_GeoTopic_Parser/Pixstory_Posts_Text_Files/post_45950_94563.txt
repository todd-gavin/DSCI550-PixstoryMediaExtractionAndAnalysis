We have always been taught that prisons make us safer and are a necessity in our society We are told that prisons play a crucial role in keeping the criminals away from the streets and their existence is a form of justice for those who have been wronged But is this really true In my opinion No America should abolish prisons This is just not my opinion but the opinion of experts too Punishment and deterrence should be the goals of the criminal justice system However as Peter Salib argues jails are perhaps an extremely ineffective means of accomplishing this Long prison sentences have no impact on crime according to the research and a prison sentence can actually make someone more inclined to commit crime by exposing them to more criminal elements At the same time jails are extremely expensive diverting funding from other government programmes that would be more helpful in combating crime Can you imagine the cost that is borne by the government through OUR taxes to feed clothe and essentially house these criminals And to what end Is there a productive end to this system No On the other hand if we look at the alternatives we might realise how abolishing prisons is the best move For starters there are other ways to serve justice instead of useless confinement Why not use the labour of these criminals in society so that anything beneficial can come out of it There are other ways to pay for the damage one caused rather than enjoying life on the money of taxpayers
