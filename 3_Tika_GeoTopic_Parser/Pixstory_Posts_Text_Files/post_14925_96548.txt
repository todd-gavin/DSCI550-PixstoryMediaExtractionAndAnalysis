The crew of six analogous astronauts selected by the Italian section of the Mars Society operated from to April in the MDRS station located in the Utah desert. A dozen experiments mainly on medicine and human physiology were performed. The analogous space simulation suit designed by Mars was successfully tested Planet and carried out in partnership with the Radici Group The number one mission conducted in the context of MDRS conducted by a crew of six similar astronauts selected by Mars Planet and made up of four Italians, a Canadian and a French, made it possible to carry out a series of activities and experiments simulating life and work in a remote environment assimilated to the conditions found on the Red Planet The crew was made up of Vittorio Netti space architect and project manager of DOME research group focused on the development of drone assets for the exploration of Mars with the role of commander of the SMOPS mission Paolo Guardabasso aerospace engineer and principal investigator of the analogous simulation suit developed by Mars Planet and Radici Group and used during the mission Luca Rossettini managing director and co-founder of D Orbit world leader in space logistics Simone Paternostro space engineer at ESA ESTEC Nadia Maarouf Canadian doctor candidate astronaut scientist engaged in biomedical space research Benjamin Pothier French human factors expert for the Human Space Flight Committee of the International Astronautical Federation The SMOPS mission hinged on the use of innovative technologies entirely developed in Italy and in particular by Mars Planet started on Sunday April and ended on Saturday April During the SMOPS mission, the suit designed and developed by Mars Planet in collaboration with Radici Group, a leading company in the textile sector and head of an all-Italian supply chain for this specific project, was tested and worn. The tests of the SMOPS mission were mainly focused on monitoring the health of future astronauts and on support technologies. In particular, during one of the experiments, the level of stress of the astronauts during the activities was analysed, and through the use of special sensored shirts it was possible to monitor the vital system of analogous astronauts
