Items with a connection to "His Airness" always bring in a lot of money at auction. 

This was seen this week when an unused ticket to NBA legend Michael Jordan's first game was auctioned for $468,000. Other goods relating to the retired Chicago Bulls player and Basketball Hall of Famer, on the other hand, are becoming a little more inventive. 

Jordan's shoes from the 1985 game in which he injured his foot, for example, went for $422,000 earlier this winter. Now, the Lelands auction house is offering a one-of-a-kind item involving one of the six-time NBA champion's favourite pastimes: cigars.

Lelands is auctioning off a smoked Jordan cigar, along with photographic confirmation that he smoked it, as part of its 2022 Winter Classic. 

Jordan has mentioned his fondness of cigars — as well as smoking them — on several times during his playing career, particularly amid the Bulls' major victories. 

Until March 12 at 9 p.m. CST, fans can bid on one of these used cigars. 

Jordan was recently honoured as a member of the NBA's 75th-anniversary team during NBA All-Star Weekend, and the item was put up for auction. He and former Bulls teammate Dennis Rodman attended the game's halftime ceremony on Sunday in Cleveland.
