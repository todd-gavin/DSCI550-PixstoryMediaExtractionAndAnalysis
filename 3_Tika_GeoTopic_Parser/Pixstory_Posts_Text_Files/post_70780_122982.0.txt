Pyrshang Da Lade’s Little Star Football Club was started with the objective of keeping children away from excessive screen time. Muthok Khongmawloh, the club's founder, wanted children to have holistic development where they balanced academics with sports and physical activity.

The club has transformed many lives and has successfully organised a tournament called the Riwar Cup. The Riwar cup was the largest organised football tournament in the area and was attended by several young players from surrounding regions. It saw 198 children participating in the games and had other camp facilities provided to the players during their stay. 

The Little Star Football club has won several local games, and the club managers ensure that the village children can attend as many tournaments as possible. Finances become a problem because sponsoring sports kits and travel arrangements are expensive. Hiring coaches to train the village children are an added expense too. However, Muthok’s indomitable spirit has made it possible to run the club for so long. He says the club has a bright future and is grateful for the encouragement and support he received from the village and his elders. He likes to see families in the village happy because their children are getting to live a happy and active childhood with access to opportunities they might not get otherwise.

Muthok has several plans for the club. He wants to take the children to more tournaments at the national level and have formal practice sessions with expert coaches. He also wants to extend the club activities to more villages, sponsor more kits and guide talented children to become professional players.
