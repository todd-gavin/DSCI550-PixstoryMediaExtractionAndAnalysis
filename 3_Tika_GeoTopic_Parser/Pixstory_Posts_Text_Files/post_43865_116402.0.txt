Liverpool FC took on Crystal Palace at the Singapore National Stadium today in their second
pre-season game ahead of the much-awaited 2022-23 season. The match ended in a 2-0 win in
favour of the Reds. It was a positive and refreshing result for Jurgen Klopp and his men after
their disappointing 4-0 defeat in the last match against Manchester United at the Rajamangala
Stadium.

Jurgen Klopp started with a much more ‘serious’ playing XI against Crystal Palace, perhaps
taking a lesson from the last match’s result. They were quick to open the scoring at the 12
minutes mark, with a superb shot by captain Jordan Henderson from inside the box following a
praiseworthy assist by Liverpool’s Academy product Harvey Eliott who leaves no opportunity
unturned to set himself aside from Liverpool’s other youngsters.

Talking about Crystal Palace, although Patrick Vieira’s men were not able to dominate
possession (quite understandably), they got quite a few great chances which were either skied
or saved by Adrian. They attempted a total of 4 shots and had just 1 shot on target. Had it not
been for their missed attempts, it might have turned out to be a much more entertaining match.

Liverpool brought in their big names like Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez and Virgil Van Dijk in
the latter part of the game. Mo Salah, who recently signed his new contract with the Reds
scored in the 46th minute to make it two for Liverpool. Crystal Palace was never really able to
come up with a good attack in the second half.

This was Liverpool’s first win in the pre-season and there have been a lot of positive takeaways
for them. They will now take on RB Leipzig on 21st July followed by RB Salzburg on 27th July.
