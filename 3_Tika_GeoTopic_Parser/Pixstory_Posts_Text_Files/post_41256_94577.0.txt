In Philadelphia, the first US penitentiary is established in 1790. 

According to the Law Library, when the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia was extended in 1790 to ease overcrowding, it became the country's first penitentiary. It featured a purposefully built setting that, while safer and more sanitary than other jails, kept offenders isolated to their cells for the duration of their term, with little human contact. The idea was to provide detained persons with uninterrupted time to reflect on their acts.

When Eastern State Penitentiary opened in 1829, it became the first "modern" prison in the United States. It defended the use of solitary confinement as a means of giving criminals time to think about their offences and finally become reformed. The penitentiary would go on to be known as the prison where Al Capone was imprisoned. 

Getting to the present, according to Reason, the number of persons imprisoned in the United States reached an all-time high of 2.3 million in 2009. If criminal justice reforms are implemented over the next decade, the jail population will reduce by 11% by 2020.

However, a Bureau of Justice Statistics' survey found that around 419 of every 100,000 Americans were imprisoned in 2019â€”the lowest rate in nearly 25 years, according to The Washington Free Beacon. The decline in the number of people behind bars can be partly attributed to the First Step law, which reduced prison sentences at the federal level.
