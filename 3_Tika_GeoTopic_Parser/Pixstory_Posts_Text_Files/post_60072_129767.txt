A Punjabi farmer who was building a house had no idea that one day he would have to move the entire thing The farmer however had no choice because of an unexpected expressway construction The man is currently relocating his dream home to make space for the projected national expressway The residence of Sukhwinder Singh Sukhi in Roshanwala village Sangrur was constructed on his soil Sukhi s two storey house must now be moved around feet away from its existing site since it is blocking the Delhi Amritsar Katra Expressway The Punjabi government offered the farmer compensation in exchange for removing the structure but the farmer decided against it Sukhi made the decision to shift the home as rather to destroying it Sukhi has therefore moved the house feet so far The farmer explained why he made his choice as follows This house cost me crore rupees and two years to construct I didn t want to build another house but this is my ideal project The key question that arises right now is how a whole property can be moved Hence the transfer of a construction from one place to another A structure can be relocated primarily in one of two ways disassembled and then reassembled at the desired location or transported intact For the latter the building is first elevated and then if the distance is small may be pushed on movable rails or dollies Otherwise wheels are used like flatbed trucks
