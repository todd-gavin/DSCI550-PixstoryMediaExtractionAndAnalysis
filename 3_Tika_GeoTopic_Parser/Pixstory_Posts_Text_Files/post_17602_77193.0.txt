Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna were memorialized with a bronze statue placed at the the crash site on the two-year anniversary of the helicopter collision that killed nine people.

The statue of the NBA hall of famer and proud father of four, with 13-year-old Gianna, was placed at the site of the tragic accident in a mountainous area of Calabasas in Los Angeles.

The sculptor, Dan Medina, inscribed, 'Heroes come and go but legends are forever,' and honored the other seven victims with their names on a plaque, at the base of the statue.

The piece depicts Kobe looking adoringly down at Gianna, who was just 13-years-old at the time of her passing, with his left arm on her shoulder.

She's depicted carrying a basketball while looking up to her father, who in real life stood at 6ft6in.

Both father and daughter are wearing their respective basketball uniforms: Kobe in his Lakers No. 24 uniform, which was his second team number after wearing No. 8 in the first part of his career.  

Medina lugged the sculpture to the crash site this morning, where it will only stay for the remainder of the day. However, he plans to continue to display it every anniversary of the tragedy – and on Bryant’s birthday – Medina told TMZ Sports.

Dozens paid their respects to the basketball legend and victims of the tragedy by placing flowers and memorabilia in front of the statue. Medina told TMZ Sports that he has been working on a life-size version of the same statue that is 90% complete and will stand at 6-foot and seven-inches.

Kobe, who was 41 at the time of his death, and Gianna were flying from Orange County to a youth basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy in Ventura County when the pilot encountered thick fog and slammed into a hillside on January 26, 2020.
