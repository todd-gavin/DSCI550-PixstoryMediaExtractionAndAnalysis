Rogue former Coalition MP George Christensen has prompted one of the early shocks of the 2022 election campaign, announcing he will run for Pauline Hanson's One Nation party at the May 21 election.

The vocal critic of COVID-19 restrictions and vaccinations had declared his intention to retire from Parliament, after holding the regional Queensland seat of Dawson for the Nationals since 2010.

Last week he quit the Liberal National Party, concerned the Nationals had surrendered their conservative values during the merger with the Liberal party in Queensland.

"My resignation should come as no surprise given the public disenchantment I have expressed about the party's direction," he posted on social media.

It is not clear whether Mr Christensen will try to re-contest Dawson, as One Nation has already selected Julie Hall as its candidate for the seat.

At the 2019 election, Mr Christensen recorded a massive 11.3 per cent swing toward him – something Coalition members put down to his personal brand in North Queensland.

The details of Mr Christensen's tilt for election in 2022 are expected to be revealed at a press conference with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson later this morning.

Senator Hanson will today commit to fielding candidates in all 151 House of Representatives contests.

"It's taken almost 12 months to bed down the team we're taking to voters at this election," she said in a statement.

"It's a significant step up from the 2019 election when we fielded candidates in about a third of Australian electorates.
