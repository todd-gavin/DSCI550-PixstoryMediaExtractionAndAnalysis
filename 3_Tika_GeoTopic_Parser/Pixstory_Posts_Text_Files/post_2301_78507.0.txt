Former finance minister P Chidambaram:

When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and officials of the Ministry of Finance sat down to write the Budget speech, what ought to have stared them in the face were the following facts: 

> India’s economy has not recovered yet to the level in pre-pandemic year of 2019-20; 
> In last two years, millions of jobs have been lost, some perhaps forever; 
> Approximately, 60 lakh MSMEs were closed down; 
> In two pandemic years, 84% of households have suffered a loss of                   income; 
> Per capita income has declined from Rs 1,08,645 in 2019-20 to Rs 1,07,801 in 2021-22 (or even less); 
> Per capita expenditure has declined from Rs 62,056 in 2019-20 to Rs 59,043 in 2021-22; 
> An estimated 4.6 crore people have been pushed into extreme poverty; 
> Huge learning loss among school children, especially children who live in rural India and are enrolled in government schools; 
> Malnutrition, stunting and wasting among children has increased and India’s rank in the Global Hunger Index has fallen to 101 (out of 116 countries);
> The unemployment rates have reached 8.2% for Urban and 5.8% for Rural workers; 
> WPI Inflation is estimated at 12% and CPI inflation at 5.3%.

After the Budget was presented this morning, we asked ourselves what has it done to address any of these grave challenges. The blunt answer is NOTHING.       

The government behaves and acts as though it is on the right path and has delivered on the issues that matter to the common people. This is false. This is also bull-headed obduracy. This also reflects the government’s contemptuous disregard of the burdens and sufferings of the people.  

I was astonished that the Finance Minister was outlining a plan for the next 25 years, which she called the Amrit Kaal !  The government seems to believe that the present does not need any attention and the people living in the present can be asked to wait patiently until the Amrit Kaal dawns. This is nothing but mocking the people of India, especially the poor and the deprived. 

To be continued....
