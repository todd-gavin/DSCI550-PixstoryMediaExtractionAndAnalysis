The education of our children is revered because the lessons they learn will stay with them for the remainder of their lives. What we learn as children molds us and might drive us to adopt certain ideas that drive our behavior. However, fringe, far left individuals have assaulted our educational systems in an effort to shove political topics down our children's throats.
 
The fundamental purpose of education should be to produce upstanding citizens and provide them with the tools necessary to pursue their own path. This is why we teach children the alphabet, since if they can't spell or talk, they can't do anything and they can't learn anything new. Why then do educators persist on teaching children subjects that do not achieve either of these two goals?

What is the purpose of educating children about LGBTQ issues? Maybe it makes children more accepting, but it is not necessary to present a scantily-clad man in drag in front of young students in order to educate them that it is immoral to hate someone based on their identity. Devoting a significant portion of the school day to educating pupils about LGBTQ-related issues only serves to perpetuate the assumption that these individuals deserve more respect than others.
 
Whether or not far-left liberals and school officials understand it, the majority of Americans are accepting of the LGBTQ population. Sure, there are m any individuals disagree with the lifestyles of many LGBTQ individuals, however, the majority of individuals disagree with the lives of people from other cultures anyway.
