Bhubaneswar: The flood situation in the Mahanadi river system in Odisha remained grim on Tuesday as over two lakh people in 10 districts were affected by the calamity, a senior official said here.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik asked officers concerned to ensure "zero casualty" in the flood caused by heavy rainfall due to the week-long low pressure and depression.

Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) P K Jena said that as per preliminary data, two lakh people have been affected due to the flood while around 24,000 hectares of farmland have been hit.

Of them, 1.20 lakh people in 237 villages were marooned and over 26,000 people have been evacuated.

Jena said that the flow of flood water will reach its peak in the Mahanadi delta region comprising Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Puri districts after midnight.

The peak flow of flood water is occurring currently at Mundali barrage in Cuttack.

The SRC said that breaches have been reported at two places in the Mahanadi river system – one in Makara river in Puri district and the other at Rajua Raiki in Khurda district.

Rescue teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) and Odisha Fire Service have launched an operation to rescue 600 school children trapped in a private residential institute at Gatiroutpatna in Cuttack district.

Around 450 children have been brought to safety by 9 pm, the SRC said.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik reviewed the flood situation and asked officials to ensure “zero casualty” in the calamity, besides immediate repair of roads and communication channels affected by the flood, Jena said.

“The CM has said that every life is precious for the state and all efforts should be made to ensure that not a single life is lost in the calamity,” the SRC said.
