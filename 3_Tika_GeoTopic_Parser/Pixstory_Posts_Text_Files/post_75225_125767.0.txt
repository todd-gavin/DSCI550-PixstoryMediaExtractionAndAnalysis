I like to start the day off
with a nice plate of food,
or something steaming and hot in a bowl.
There are so many options.
I’m spoiled for choice,
and none of those options get old.

There are pancakes and muffins,
and hot buttered toast.
Cereals and mueslis galore.
I can pile them all up,
and pile them all in.
Then, there’s seconds if I really want more.

Now, I know some like dinners
as their favorite meal.
For others, it’s lunches or brunch.
But for me, I’ve discovered
that eating a brunch
is just a little too like eating lunch.

So, I’m up bright and early,
to start the day right.
Just come to the kitchen and see.
You can keep all your dinners,
your suppers and lunch.
Breakfast’s the main meal for me.
