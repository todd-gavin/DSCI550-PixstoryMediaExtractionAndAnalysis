 Racial profiling is not something exclusive to America or American minorities White people are a part of it too and honestly it is important too Why do you all have the most out of the box ideas always Profiling helps law enforcement to prevent crime By focusing on potential criminal suspects based on their race officers can identify individuals who may be more likely to commit crimes in the future This information can help them plan their strategies accordingly and they may even be able to arrest criminals before they commit any crimes Racial profiling also allows officers to protect innocent people from harm When officers focus their attention on particular groups of people they are less likely to mistreat or injure them simply because they re members of that group This makes policing more fair and equitable for everyone involved including the minority communities that are often targeted by police forces It also has the potential to reduce tensions between different ethnicities in America By identifying specific groups of people law enforcement can help defuse tensions before they escalate into violence or riots Racial profiling happens all the time all around the world This is how criminals are caught This fancy word does not take away from the fact that if a criminal is a certain rave or religion that will be mentioned and it includes white Christians too
