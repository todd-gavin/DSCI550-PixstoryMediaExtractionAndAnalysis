Here are some food ideas that you can include at the breakfast table to supply enough micronutrients for better immunity:
ğŸ‘‰A glass of freshly squeezed orange or lemon juice for that vitamin C boost.
ğŸ‘‰A couple of spinach idlis (spinach puree added to idli batter) to fulfil the needs of iron and probiotics, for gut immunity.
ğŸ‘‰A glass of oats and milk porridge for meeting riboflavin, calcium, fibre and complex carbohydrates requirements. A spoon of jaggery powder can fortify the porridge with iron, magnesium and manganese content.
ğŸ‘‰A simple boiled egg provides selenium, an important mineral for the immune system.
A laddoo or energy bar made up of nuts, seeds and dates is nutrient-dense and contains omega 3, zinc and iron.
ğŸ‘‰Breakfast cereals that contain added micronutrients like Vitamin and minerals and can be served with milk and fresh seasonal fruits.
