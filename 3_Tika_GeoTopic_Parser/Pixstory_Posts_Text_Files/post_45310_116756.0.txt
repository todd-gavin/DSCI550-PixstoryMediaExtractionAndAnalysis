Chelsea kicked off their pre-season campaign today in Nevada, United States as they took on
Club America at the Allegiant Stadium. Head coach Thomas Tuchel used a fairly competitive
starting XI today and it did the work for them as they secured a 2-1 victory in their first friendly.

Chelsea quite expectedly had the upper hand in almost the entire match and they dominated
against Club America entirely. They had 19 attempted shots compared to Culb America’s 7
shots and had 8 shots on target. Chelsea also had 64% possession which pretty much speaks
for itself. This result was quite anticipated as apart from midfielder Robert Kenedy Nunes, all the
other players in their playing XI today were Chelsea’s regular starters.

Talking about individual performances, it was Chelsea’s academy player Conor Gallegher who
impressed everyone with his omnipotent skills in the midfield. He was simply everywhere on the
field today. Conor Gallegher returned to Chelsea this year after a sensational loan spell with
Crystal Palace in 2021-22. He is expected to get a lot of exposure in the main team this season
as Chelsea fans see him as their ‘Next big thing’.

Kai Havertz’s performance on the other hand was underwhelming today. The German youngster
did not have a great season in 2021 and he will have to up his game lest he gets overlooked by
Tuchel in the coming season.

Timo Werner, who came in as a substitute in the latter half of the game, scored Chelsea’s first goal in the 55th minute. Club America equalised in the 60th minute thanks to Reece James’ 60th-minute own goal but the Blues regained their lead in the 83rd minute through Mason Mount.

Chelsea will play three more pre-season friendlies before the commencement of the 2022-23
season. They take on Charlotte on 21st July, Arsenal on 24th July (Florida Cup) and Udinese on
30th July.
