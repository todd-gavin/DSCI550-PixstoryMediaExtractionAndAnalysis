Black holes are dense objects with gravity so strong not even light can escape them The newly discovered black hole has a mass at least nine times greater than our sun It was discovered in the Tarantula Nebula a huge gas cloud in the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy It is about light years from Earth It is typically assumed that the collapse of massive stars into black holes is associated with a powerful supernova explosion In this case a star perhaps times our sun s mass blew some of its material into space then collapsed in on itself without an explosion The shape of its orbit with its companion offers evidence for the lack of an explosion
