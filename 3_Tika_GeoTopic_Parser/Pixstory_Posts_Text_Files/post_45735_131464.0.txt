A proposed private space station has advanced to the following stage of design after passing an important early NASA inspection. 

Space News reported that the Orbital Reef station completed a system definition review (SDR) with NASA, according to the station's primary partners Blue Origin and Sierra Space on August 22. The evaluation is a component of a Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations, or CLD, award they won from the organisation in December to advance the Orbital Reef design. 

The mid-June to mid-July review's goal was to verify that the Orbital Reef concept complied with a number of functional and performance requirements. 

The businesses can forward the space station's overall design after passing the review.

“This SDR moves Orbital Reef forward,” said Brent Sherwood, senior vice president for advanced development programs at Blue Origin, in a statement. “We are meeting the needs of both the commercial marketplace and NASA’s requirements.”
