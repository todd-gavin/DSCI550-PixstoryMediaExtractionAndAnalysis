Rodrigo De Paul could return to Italy exactly one year after his farewell to Udinese and his departure to Madrid with Atletico. Italy would be a welcome destination for the player who was already being courted by Inter in Friuli at the time Inter could come forward if the opportunity arose The only problem would be the cost, if Atletico let him leave on loan then the deal could go through but if the Nerazzurri were to disburse from to millions of euros, nothing would be done about it Another issue would be the obligation to buy out or not A much more complex alternative to seeing De Paul in Inzaghi&#39;s line-up c Atletico Madrid are interested in Lautaro Martinez and Inter most likely he will have to deprive himself of a big player If the Madrilenos offered De Paul plus a balance of millions of euros the deal would be done Difficult very difficult but a viable path
