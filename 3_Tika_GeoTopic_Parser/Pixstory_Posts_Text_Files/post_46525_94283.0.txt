Lemme Ask you all ? What is Emotional Intimacy According to you ?? 
Well According to me : 
𝗘𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗰𝘆 is a connection based on emotional safety, vulnerability, and trust. It is the feeling of acceptance and belonging in your relationship. Our level of intimacy is not fixed, which means we can work on strengthening it in the relationship.

I , You and all of us need Emotional Intimacy ! As humans, we are hard-wired for connection. Emotional intimacy brightens our mood ! 

Some people really don't know that what What to do and what to not When it comes to Emotional Intimacy ! Relax ! I'm gonna Tell you Do and Don't of it -

𝑫𝒐:
✅ Support their dreams
✅ Listen to what they have to say
✅ Validate how they feel
✅ Follow up/ask questions about things that matter to them
✅Express your feelings

𝑫𝒐𝒏'𝒕:
❌ Criticize or put down their ideas
❌ Ignore emotional bids or what they have to say
❌ Dismiss how they feel
❌ Keep your feelings in then explode

Which do you respond to most? For me, it’s asking questions. Even in non-romantic relationships, it feels good when loved ones ask questions about the things that matter to you. They don’t have to care about what you’re saying but they care that you care and make an attempt to know more. That’s effort. 

I feel like , If You are not connected with your partner emotionally then you will feel like alone ! And Lemme Tell you ! Not having a connection with your partner emotionally can Take You mental Peace Away ! Yaa that's True ! Anything which Costs you , your mental Peace is not at all acceptable !

*Always Remember*
Emotional intimacy is not sexual intimacy .
