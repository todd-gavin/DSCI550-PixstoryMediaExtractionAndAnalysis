Melania Trump has spoken out about the Russia-Ukraine crisis for the first time. The former First Lady described Russia's aggression on Ukraine as "heartbreaking" and "horrific" in a tweet on Monday, February 28. The former first lady urged her Twitter followers to support Ukraine by donating to the International Committee of the Red Cross. 

Melania Trump expresses her condolences and prayers for the people of Ukraine in a tweet. She also wants people to donate to the Red Cross, which will utilise the money to help people in need. "Seeing innocent people suffer is heartbreaking and horrific," Melania said. "My thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people." "Please, if you can, donate to support them ICRC," Melania, who was born in Slovenia, wrote.

The former model's tweet is her first public response to Russia's military offensive against Ukraine, which began last week. Since her husband left office, she has kept a minimal social media profile, only tweeting once in a while.

Melania's comments contrast sharply with previous President Donald Trump's statement, in which he praised Vladimir Putin's invasion plan as "brilliant." The 45th President claimed on a conservative podcast that if he were still in power, Russian forces would never have advanced. 

Some, however, are concerned about the contribution link she included in her tweet, fearing that it is an unregistered charity that would not benefit the people of Ukraine but will instead go into Trump's wallets.
