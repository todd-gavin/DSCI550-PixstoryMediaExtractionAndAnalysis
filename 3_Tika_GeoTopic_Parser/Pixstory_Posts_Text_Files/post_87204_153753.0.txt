Erling Haaland was arguably the most lucrative transfer of the recent summer window. He moved to the Premier League champions Manchester City for a fee of £51m from Borussia Dortmund.
Being one of the hottest properties in the football world, it was already expected that the Norway international would be handed a massive economical contract. As per reports in the Daily Mail, he is earning close to £900,000 per week at his new home.
Reportedly, the 22-year-old striker has a series of almost guaranteed bonuses alongside a basic salary. He is set to earn at least £45m this season, which already makes it over £865,000 per week.
Haaland’s handsome salary makes him the highest-paid name in the star-studded Premier League. Justifying that figure, he has been proving his worth for the Sky Blues as he has already netted 20 goals in all competitions.
Although Haaland is bound to be at Eithad until 2027, he has a clause in contract which would allow other clubs to poach him in the near future.
Why could Real Madrid go all out to land Haaland?
Former La Liga side Malaga president Fernando Sanz has claimed that Real Madrid could try to land Erling Haaland in 2024.
"The information I have is that there is an exit clause for Haaland in the second year, and the curious thing is that with very beneficial conditions compared to the rest for a club, which is Real Madrid,” he told Mundo Deportivo.
"Haaland puts in a clause that allows him to leave after two years but with priority for Real Madrid.Madrid puts up whatever money it takes and takes Haaland without talking to City,” he added.
Real Madrid went for Kylian Mbappe, who took a u-turn at the last moment to sign a new contract with PSG which will keep him in Paris till 2025. With Karim Benzema already being 34, the Spanish side will want to find a replacement.
And who better than Haaland? The Whites have the money and might go all out for the Norway international.
