Inequality is impossible to eradicate, and if it were, life would be a living nightmare. It can only be accomplished by non-material means. Equality before the law, but only in some areas of human rights, is a worthwhile goal to pursue. The foundational papers, particularly the Declaration of Independence, are brilliant in that they explicitly state this, if anyone bothers to read what they actually say.

The self-evident reality is that all men (people) have certain (but not all) human rights, which are granted by something higher than the government, not by the government. This is to reject the claims of kings who claimed "divine right" to be above the law.

As a result, they are unalienable, which implies that they cannot be taken away by the government until it can be demonstrated that a person has violated another's rights via due process of law.

There would be no men or women, simply a single meaningless gender, if all people were equal in every manner. There would be nothing unattractive, and beauty would have no significance in a society where everyone is 'beautiful'.

It would also be meaningless to compete, making innovation impossible.

Because every match would result in a tie, there would be no sports. Because everyone would be equally wealthy (or similarly poor), no one would strive for financial achievement, and the pursuit of greatness would be worthless because everything would be average.

Fortunately, ultimate equality is an impossibility, and hence life has meaning.
