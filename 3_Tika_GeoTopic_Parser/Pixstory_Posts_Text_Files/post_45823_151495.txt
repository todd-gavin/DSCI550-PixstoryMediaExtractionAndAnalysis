The Juno probe captured the first image of Jupiter s ice covered moon Europa as it passed past and NASA has now made it public As per news reports the photo was taken on Thursday at around kilometres away during the solar powered spacecraft s closest approach The closest glimpse any spacecraft has given at Europa since Jan when NASA s Galileo flew within kilometres of the surface is offered by this close approach which is only the third in history below kilometres in altitude The sixth largest moon in the solar system Europa is a little smaller than the moon of Earth Scientists speculate that a miles thick ice shell covers a salty ocean raising concerns about the possibility of life supporting environments beneath Europa s surface
