A diet rich in fiber can improve the therapeutic response of the tumor to immunotherapy thanks to its beneficial effects on the intestinal microbiota as confirmed by a new study that appeared in the scientific journal Science to which the European Institute of Oncology contributed The research team led by MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston TX retrospectively examined the data of a group of patients who received immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma by studying the composition of their microbiota and clinical pathological characteristics. Those who entered the study at the beginning of the therapy were asked to fill in a lifestyle questionnaire and eating habits In patients it was possible to radiologically evaluate the therapeutic response to immunotherapy and in the response was positive. Within this subgroup of responders, it emerged that those who took in a greater quantity of dietary fiber were those who responded better to the treatment. From analysis of clinical data emerged a strong link between therapeutic response and fiber content in the diet to suggest that patients who eat a higher amount of fiber derive greater benefit from immunotherapy said Dr Luigi Nezi who heads the Unit of Microbiome and antitumor immunity of the European Institute of Oncology Another point to underline concerns the use of probiotics to support tumor immunotherapy The results published in Science in fact show how the effect of taking probiotics is not necessarily associated with a better therapeutic response, on the contrary The studies we are currently conducting in mine as in many other laboratories in the world they aim precisely to deepen this knowledge These are enormous efforts that require the collaboration of both the patients who adhere to our studies and multidisciplinary teams of researchers In this field the IEO is working to become a reference center
