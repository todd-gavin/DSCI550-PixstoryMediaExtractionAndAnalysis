George Floyd passed away two years ago on Wednesday, May 25. Officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, arresting and killing the 46-year-old African American man. This happened just months after Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery were killed. 

Floyd's killing sparked a new wave of Black Lives Matter rallies while also reigniting global conversations about race. The pandemic may have played a role in this, as lockdown caused white people to observe live what police brutality can do to Black people. 

As per HuffPost, millions of white people around the world began "doing the work" to demonstrate their support. Part of doing this apparent work has been donating money to Black advocacy organisations and listening to Black people’s experiences, but a major part was white people educating themselves about race through their own reading.

It’s good to see that white people are taking an initiative to not only talk about the change, but be the change. There is a growing realisation that while they cannot imagine what black Americans go through in their daily lives, they can learn a lot simply by LISTENING to their fellow black people. The change is coming, slowly, but it’s coming.
