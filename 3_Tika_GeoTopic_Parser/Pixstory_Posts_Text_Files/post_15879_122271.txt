Summary Background Early prediction of childhood type diabetes reduces ketoacidosis at diagnosis and provides opportunities for disease prevention However only highly efficient approaches are likely to succeed in public health settings We sought to identify efficient strategies for initial islet autoantibody screening in children younger than years Methods We harmonised data from five prospective cohorts from Finland DIPP Germany BABYDIAB Sweden DiPiS and the USA DAISY and DEW IT into the Type Diabetes Intelligence T DI cohort children at high risk of diabetes enrolled before age years were included and followed up for islet autoantibodies and diabetes until age years or type diabetes onset whichever occurred first Islet autoantibodies measured included those against glutamic acid decarboxylase insulinoma antigen and insulin Main outcomes were sensitivity and positive predictive value PPV of detected islet autoantibodies tested at one or two fixed ages for diagnosis of clinical type diabetes Findings Of the participants enrolled in the Type Diabetes Intelligence cohort total were followed up to age years or until onset of type diabetes Type diabetes developed by age years in children but did not develop in children Optimal screening ages for two measurements were years and years yielding sensitivity of CI and PPV of CI for diabetes by age years Autoantibody positivity at the beginning of each test age was highly predictive of diagnosis in the subsequent year or year age intervals Autoantibodies usually appeared before age years even in children diagnosed with diabetes much later in childhood Interpretation Our results show that initial screening for islet autoantibodies at two ages years and years is sensitive and efficient for public health translation but might require adjustment by country on the basis of population specific disease characteristics Sources
