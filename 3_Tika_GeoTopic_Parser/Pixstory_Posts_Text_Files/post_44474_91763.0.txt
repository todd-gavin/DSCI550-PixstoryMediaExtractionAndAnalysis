Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, according to Michael Owen, is "one of the biggest exponents" of how-to time runs into the box during a cross. In Liverpool's 2-0 triumph over Watford on Saturday, Diogo Jota scored the opening goal. Jota's ability to perfect his runs when crosses came within the opponent's box impressed Owen.

The former Liverpool striker also praised Jota's aerial skills, claiming that the 25-year-old is among the finest in the world. This season, the Portuguese international has been a reliable player for Liverpool. In as many as 40 appearances for the Reds in various tournaments, he has scored 20 goals.

After Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane joined their national teams to compete in the AFCON tournament, Jota performed a good job of taking up the attacking responsibilities. The 25-year-old Portuguese international scored one goal and assisted on another to help his country qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Diogo Jota's ability to timing his runs helps him stand out among the greatest of the best, according to critics. Premier League Productions quoted Owen as saying:

“It’s all about timing. When Gomez hits it, how long is that ball going to take to get in that area and how long do I need to get onto that cross. All of those things constitute what you call ‘timing of a run’. And he is one of the best exponents of it in the Premier League.''

“A great header of the ball. But his timing is right up there with the very best – when you have got players like Jota then you know why.”

Diogo Jota, according to Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, is on his way to become a world-class striker, delivering on a consistent basis for both club and country. Jota's first goal for Liverpool against Watford was his 33rd in 70 appearances since joining the club in September 2020. The Portuguese international has gained Jurgen Klopp's trust and is now a frequent starter for Liverpool.
