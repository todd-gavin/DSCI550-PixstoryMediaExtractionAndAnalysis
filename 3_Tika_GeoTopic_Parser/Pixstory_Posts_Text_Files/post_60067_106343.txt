It s nothing more than staying in touch with someone on Snapchat for roughly two months or longer I ll try to walk you through it step by step Steps The yellow heart which represents the application s first degree of best friendship is the first heart we ll look at While it may not seem like much this degree of friendship is significant While Snapchat employs an algorithm to determine who your best friends are a list you can readily check when sending snaps to pals from your contacts list only one person can actually be your number one best friend on the app and that person gets given a yellow heart to mark the occasion The red heart on Snapchat serves as the next level similar to a video game While the red heart ostensibly signifies the same concept as the yellow heart namely a shared degree of best friendship on the network earning one isn t as simple You must be their number one best friend for two weeks in order for this red heart to appear next to their name on your feed It s at this point that you ve reached the end of your journey You ve travelled a long way if you ve reached this point Not only did you become another user s number one closest friend which is no small feat in and of itself but you also managed to stay strong with them for not just the two weeks it took to earn a red heart but also the two months it took to earn the two pink hearts and your name You ll have to keep snapping with your best pal to keep those pink hearts if you want to stay in first place To avoid losing the double pink heart emblem snap your number one as much as possible You might or might not lose if you go a few days without speaking to them It all depends on how much they communicate to one other and whether they wind up becoming best friends Mention your Super BFF below You can also add me rks mehra
