Among sea shells conch shells are my favourite Ever since I was young I was fascinated with the ones my mom would use during her daily worship rituals In Bengali language we call it shaankh I d try my best to assist but it s kind of hard to use it However the sound it generates is truly marvelous Today while I was out buying some art supplies in the market here in my hometown I found these conch shells at my uncle s shop It reminded me of my childhood and my mother because those memories are the ones I cherish the most Other than that conch shells are interesting for many other reasons Did you know that some of these conch shells also produce some of the rarest pearls in the world You ll probably find a pearl in every conch shells you come across
