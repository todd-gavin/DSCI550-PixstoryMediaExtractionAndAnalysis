It startles me how a deeply emotional moment or any emotion is cleansed out with catharsis A strong word though Catharsis came from a Greek word which means cleansing or purgation of emotions Art plays a significant role in purifying those emotions It could be a piece of art like a painting or a piece of solemn music that could evoke in you a sense of acknowledging or dealing with hidden emotions People sometimes tend to conceal or stay away from accepting that they have been thrown into the emotional morass and putting it all out would bring a positive change in their character and even help them heal where catharsis plays its role Besides catharsis has the power to invoke those emotions in his theory of poetry Aristotle points out that it is a purification of emotions primarily through art In modern times catharsis is used as a therapy The way of putting all the negative emotions and stress out And like Aristotle said here also art helps in purgation In psychotherapy experts try to help the patient so that they can communicate and talk about feelings that have been harming them The confrontation and facing your emotions would treat the lying anxiety or other traumas that have been avoided or buried inside our subconscious minds Hence venting out would heal the person But certain studies have shown that catharsis can be temporarily effective when it comes to emotions like anger Still it doesn t work for long lasting effects as dealing with rage could not always be related to venting emotions out
