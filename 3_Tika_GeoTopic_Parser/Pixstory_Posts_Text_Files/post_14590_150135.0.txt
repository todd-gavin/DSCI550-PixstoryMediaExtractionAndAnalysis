Cigarette smoking and the use of tobacco products can cause health problems in children and teens. Over time, these can include the serious health problems discussed above, which might start at even younger ages.
One of the most serious problems is nicotine addiction, which often leads to long-term tobacco use as kids get older. There is also some evidence that nicotine harms the brain development of teenagers. It is important to know that most e-cigarettes and similar products also contain nicotine.
Children and teens who smoke regularly tend to have more health problems than kids who donâ€™t, such as:
ğŸ‘‰Coughing spells.
ğŸ‘‰Shortness of breath, even when not exercising.
ğŸ‘‰Wheezing or gasping
ğŸ‘‰More frequent headaches.
ğŸ‘‰Increased phlegm (mucus).
ğŸ‘‰Respiratory illnesses that are worse and happen more often.
ğŸ‘‰Worse cold and flu symptoms.
ğŸ‘‰Reduced physical fitness.
ğŸ‘‰Poor lung growth and function, which increases the risk of COPD later in life.
