Serena Williams slayed the September 2022 cover of Vogue, posing on the beach with her daughter Olympia in a tight powder blue gown. The 40-year-old wore a skintight, high-neck blue Balenciaga gown with a lengthy train, while Olympia, 5, was covered up at the end.

She looked gorgeous on the beach-shot cover, accessorising her sleeveless gown with a long blue fringe Bulgari High Jewelry earring. Serena wore a delicate smokey eye and a nude lip, with her long brown hair down and parted in the middle in curls.

Olympia, meantime, looked adorable as she wrapped her face and torso with the end of her mother's train. Olympia donned a small white little dress and was entirely barefoot in the sand, with her hair piled up into a high bun.
