When the mangos are at their peak, why not make this creamy, delectable, and fruity lassi? Mango pulp, yoghurt, honey, a dash of cardamom, and crushed ice make up this seasonal cocktail. Saffron threads and crumbled nuts are used to decorate the dish. One of the most delicious ways to enjoy mangoes is in this refreshing lassi. This drink is a sweet, cold, and oh-so-refreshing love letter to your taste buds and body. Since yoghurt thickens and creams the drink, it is traditionally used to produce both sweet and spicy lassi. When it comes to lassi, if you don't like the taste, you can always add some milk to thin it out. Vegan mango lassi can be made with plain almond milk yoghurt in this recipe. Any non-dairy yoghurt can be used, except for coconut, which is not suggested because it can alter the taste of this beverage. As a result of perspiration, the body loses glucose stores, which are replenished by mango lassi. It has a low calorie count, but is packed with protein, sodium, potassium, calcium, and even vitamin A. You can serve it at any time of the day to both kids and adults. A cold glass of mango lassi can be served to your visitors as well because of its beauty and taste.
