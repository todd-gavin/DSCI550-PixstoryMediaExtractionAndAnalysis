Some characters go beyond script. Playing a good guy or bad guy, it’s about how they relished it. Did that role mesmerize them or did they make others feel so? Frank Costello in Departed is one such man who never wants to be a product of his environment but the environment to be a product of his.

His very Irish part is the issue. Americans considered them migrants. Even a bright student failed to fetch a job. Frank’s motto was clear. No one gives it to you, you have to take it. He almost turned into a sociopath following it. Being a mob king, no moral codes stop him. When Billy Costigan reminds him he was a feudal and people under him were not paid well so anyone could be a rat in his gang, the guy smiles, that sharp, wicked smile brightens his eyes.

Frank does look for a sense of ambition in others and never waste a moment if he misses it. His complaint about Billy Costigan’s father was that - he never wanted money. You can’t do anything with a man like that. But his pinned feeling for him was respect - a paradox.

Martin Scorsese's love for paranoid characters never ends. In certain scenes, Frank Costello personifies it. Remember how he questions his gang man for dumping a body at the wrong place? One of the best scenes in Departed. An unnoticed one, he dusts a black hooker with cocaine and asks her to suck it. Such power and contempt rule his eyes!

Soft side of Costello is his father figure. He sees the poor kid Collin Sullivan at a local store and raises him to a statie. Though he is Costella’s mole inside the department he doesn’t give up on him easily. While picking Billy Costigan to his gang without much conviction also this feeling works. He wanted his legacy to be intact. That made him a bit vulnerable before Collin. A slight pain fills the environment when he shoots Frank, an etched scene from Departed.

Jack Nicholson was so real in the robe of Frank Costello!
