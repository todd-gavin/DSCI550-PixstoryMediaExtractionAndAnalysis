On the weekend, Karna Solskjaer made her debut for Manchester United in their game against Bridgwater United in the fourth round of the Women’s FA Cup. United progressed to the next round after beating the home side 2-0, thanks to goals from Hayley Ladd and Ella Toone. Solskjaer came off the bench in the 85th minute, following her dad Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s footsteps in the world of football. 

Karna and Ole have become the first daughter and father pair to play for Manchester United Football Club. Proud parents - Ole and Silje were sitting in the stands as Karna was subbed in. 

Ever since her debut, some people have stated that Karna made her debut just because her dad played for the United men’s team and later managed them. What these people need to understand is that this is a football club. There is no Nepotism involved at a club like United. Karna has worked hard to reach this stage. She deserved that call-up to the senior team and she deserved her debut. Karna's stellar performances in U-21s rewarded her with senior team debut.

This season, for Manchester United Women U-21s, Solskjaer has scored 13 times in just 12 games across all competitions - FA WSL Academy League and FA WSL Academy League Cup. An integral player in Charlotte Healy’s youth set-up, Karna and her teammates have been performing admirably well as they have reached the League Cup final. In the semi-final, United U-21s scored 5 goals against Aston Villa.(Karna scored a goal and grabbed an assist in that game).

Marc Skinner: "It wasn't a token for Karna, it was a deserved one. Obviously she's got a famous Dad but she wants to be famous in her own right."

She has earned her spot and has worked equally hard as any other academy player would to earn their debut. Ole’s legacy will always be there in the history books but this is Karna’s moment. 

Marc Skinner: "I know Ole and I know he would be like: ' No, it's not about me. It's about Karna'."
