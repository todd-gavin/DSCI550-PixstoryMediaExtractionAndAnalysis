Laal Singh Chaddha has recorded a low opening weekend in the vicinity of Rs crore as the film has collected in the range of Rs to crore on the third day The Aamir Khan starrer opened at Rs crore on Sunday followed by a percent drop to Rs crore on Friday and finally a percent spike to collect in the Rs crore range on Saturday The film has continued to get around to percent of its business from the national chains as the single screens and non national chain audiences are refusing to come on board the film The weekend biz is not up to the mark despite a holiday release on Thursday The film has two more days Sunday and Independence Day to put up some numbers and clock a day extended weekend around the Rs crore mark The fate of the film was more or less sealed on the opening day itself and its now a journey to minimize the losses with daily business With Aamir Khan returning to the big screen after long years a lot was expected from Laal Singh Chaddha but the below par trailer followed by not so encouraging film has resulted in a repulsive reaction from the audience Day Wise Box Office Business Thursday Rs crore Friday Rs crore Saturday Rs to crore Total Rs crore
