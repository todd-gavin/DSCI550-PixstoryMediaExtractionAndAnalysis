Paris Saint-Germain are delighted to announce the signing of Oriane Jean-FranÃ§ois on a two-year deal. The France international is now tied down to Les Rouge et Bleu until 30th June 2024. ðŸ”´ðŸ”µ

Born in French Guiana, Jean-FranÃ§ois began her football career at CO Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, her hometown club. She then moved to mainland France in 2016 to join FCF Juvisyâ€™s U16s.

Three years later, the midfielder signed her first professional contract with Paris FC and made her Division 1 debut at the age of 18. The France international would go on to rack up 50 appearances for PFC, scoring one goal.

After being in and around Franceâ€™s U17 team, the French Guianian played for her countryâ€™s U19s, winning the UEFA European Womenâ€™s Under-19 Championship alongside another Paris player, Laurina Fazer. She later broke into the U20 and U23 sides before being given her very first call-up with Les Bleues against North Macedonia in October 2020.

The club is delighted to welcome Oriane to the squad and would like to wish her all the best with Les Rouge et Bleu.
