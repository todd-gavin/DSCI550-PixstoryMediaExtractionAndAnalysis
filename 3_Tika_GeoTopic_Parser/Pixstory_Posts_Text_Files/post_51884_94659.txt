Will ever stop talking to me will you ever stop seeing me the way I am As I get closer to you The fear of separation tortures me I have been here before I have been through the torments before Please never let change what you have for Me Lets keep it on our closed loop Just you and me in your horizon of life Lets remain the way we are Let me stick in your own world invisibility A true world of senses were being different is not a problem
