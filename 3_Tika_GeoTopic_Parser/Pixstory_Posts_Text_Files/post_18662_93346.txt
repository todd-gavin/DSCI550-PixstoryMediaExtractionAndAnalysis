The hat-trick against Genoa in the championship brought back Ciro Immobile&#39;s smile after the beating with the national team and the failure to qualify for the next World Cup For the second time in a row The major criticisms have come to him who is so prolific in the biancocelesti when he is harmless in front of goal when he wears the national team shirt The future is therefore completely uncertain on the one hand coach Roberto Mancini is pushing for him to find the right motivation to answer the next call-ups on the other there is Maurizio Sarri who instead advised his forward to focus only on Lazio The last word will obviously be of Immobile who at the moment has overtaken Boniperti in the ranking of the best bomber in the history of Serie A with the last goals scored c Fabio Quagliarella still active and Batistuta on goal Immobile will still have some time to decide given that the next match for the national team will be in June against Leo Messi&#39;s Argentina and then for the Nations League against Hungary, Germany twice and England
