We as humans love to have varieties in our list Right from smoothies to clothes we always want changes and options according to our mood Just like that we also have a great variety in our social media world We have different platforms with different approach and we keep switching from one to another One of the famous and most used social media platform is twitter Twitter is a platform where we find users interacting and discussing about latest trends and hot picks according to their opinion Unlike other social media platforms Twitter is considered to be one of the most strongest social media tool From World Politics to Global entertainment everything can be a hit or can receive massive drawbacks by just a single tweet People come and tweet about their opinions and sometimes they fail to recognise some errors in their tweet and sometimes they wanted to change their tweet according to their current thought process Unfortunately twitter having no edit button makes this an impossible task which can take place Either you keep it raw or you delete it There is no in between Due to this there has been a lot of pressure on Twitter to introduce an edit button to their platform And recently Twitter has planned to launch an edit button for their social media handle on a trail mode to check the response and technicality And I think it is right In a digital world everything must have a process through which we can edit or redo what we have created Twitter is a powerful medium which can bring both war and peace to the world Sometimes we as humans do mistakes but later we want to make it right Mistakes are human nature and every human should get a chance to rectify their mistakes So the introduction of the edit button by Twitter is a very interesting thing that s happening We must have a chance to rectify rewrite or redo our thoughts That s how support each other to make this world a better place
