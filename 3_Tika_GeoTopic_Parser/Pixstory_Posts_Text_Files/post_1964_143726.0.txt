Since the raid on his Mar-a-Lago residence, Former-President Donald Trump has lambasted the Department of Justice, claiming that he had already declassified the documents that they raided his residence for. However, despite his constant proclamations that they were declassified, in recent court filings his attorneys, rather than claiming that he declassified the documents, merely stated that he had “absolute authority . . . to declassify any information . . . There is no legitimate contention that the Chief Executive’s declassification of documents requires approval of bureaucratic components of the executive branch.” It becomes extremely difficult to defend Trump sometimes, for he is a persistent liar and deceiver. If he actually declassified the documents in question, then he would have a slam dunk case, so his attorneys would have said that he declassified the documents. But they did not. Why? This is merely a legal sleight of hand – the statement above could either mean to imply that he did declassify the documents and that he didn’t need approval from anyone else, or that he didn’t declassify the documents and that if he wanted to, he could have without any approval from anyone else. In other words, it is written so ambiguously that when the DOJ comes at them asking for proof that the documents were declassified, they could easily say that they never claimed that he declassified them, but at the same time, because they never said that he didn’t declassify them, Trump can always publicly assert that he did. This is extremely deceitful behavior by the former President.
