In consecutive wins over Manchester United, Chelsea, West Ham United, and Leeds United, the
squad players would step up, but Arteta's luck ran out in the rescheduled North London derby,
as Spurs broke the fight for Champions League football wide open with a 3-0 victory.

Arsenal needed a miracle on matchday 38 after failing to respond in a humiliating 2-0 loss to
Newcastle United on the final matchday, losing the initiative to Spurs in the process. Despite
cruising to a 5-1 victory over Everton, events at Carrow Road did not go their way.

Hit of the Season: Bukayo Saka

Bukayo Saka has rebounded from his Euro 2020 heartbreak to become one of Arteta's most
consistent performers.

Saka's tally of 12 goals and seven assists explains why he was nominated for the Premier
League's Player of the Season award, and it's no wonder that Arsenal is trying to keep their
Hale End youngster.

Speculation of a move to Liverpool or Manchester City hasn't deterred the England international,
and his humble, down-to-earth demeanor has won him fans at the Emirates throughout the
season.

FLOP OF THE SEASON-NICOLAS PEPE

Nicolas Pepe needed a huge season after a couple of disappointing ones during his time in
north London, and he certainly didn't get one. With only 681 minutes of Premier League action
this season, he was understandably rusty in those appearances.

He is expected to leave this summer and will go down as one of the worst signings in club
history.

Top Goalscorer-Bukayo Saka (11 GOALS)

Following a great campaign last term, Bukayo Saka has distinguished himself once again this
year. The inventive forward has been a significant goal scorer as the Gunners try to recover
from a sluggish start to the 2021-22 season.
