The Italian league is set to take the world by storm from 13th August when Sampdoria will face Atalanta in the first game of the 2022/23 season. Though the Spanish, English and French league are starting from 5th and 6th August, the Italian league is delayed due to the delay in the cup fixture. The teams are drawing their final strategies before the first week and are active in the summer transfer window.

After losing the title to AC Milan last season, Inter Milan and Juventus will be looking forward to conquering the Italian territory that they have lost in the recent times. Juventus have not won the title since the last two years and have struggled to finish in the top four as well. However, they have signed the premium players as well and got Maximiliano Allegri as the coach who will be in his second season now. It remains interesting to see if the Old Lady can go back to the place where they were in the past.

Ahead of the 2022/23 season, the question for the fans is where will we find the stream? The 
answer lies in Voot. Viacom 18 have bought the streaming rights for the season and will stream the content on their Over the Top (OTT) platform, Voot. Subscribing the platform will help the fans to not only watch Juventus’ games but also to watch the remaining Serie A fixtures as well.

Juventus will start their Serie A campaign against Sassuolo on 15 th August. Juventus will play the last game of the first gameweek in Italy. The team has added Paul Pogba, Angel di Maria on free transfer which has boasted their frontline as well as the midfield. However, Paul Pogba’s injury would have set them back but the team looks fresh and raring to go to the 2022/23 season.
