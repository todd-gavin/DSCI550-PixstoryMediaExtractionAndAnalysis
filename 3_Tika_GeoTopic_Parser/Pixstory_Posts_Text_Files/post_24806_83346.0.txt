Two sides with a combination of five European titles between them, Benfica and Ajax lock horns for the 1st leg of the Champions League round of 16 games at Est√°dio da Luz in Lisbon. Ajax are unbeaten in the last 6 meetings including the last three visits while Benfica hasn't won since their first-ever matchup way back in 1969. 


Eric Ten Hag's Ajax are free-scoring and an entertaining team to watch not only in their domestic league but also in Europe. They won all six of their group stage games topping the likes of Dortmund and Benfica's rivals, Sporting CP. On the other side of the pitch, they are watertight conceding merely 10 goals in all competitions this season. Ten Hag has turned out to be a hot managerial prospect in Europe and wants to emulate his 2018/19 class with a much better team this time around. 



Benfica also had a healthy ride in the group stage highlighted by their 3-0 win over Barcelona on matchday 2. Jorge Jesus was in the dugout in that win but things didn't turn out well for him leading Nelson Verissimo to take charge at the turn of the year. But Benfica have fallen off from league title pursuit. The gap now stands to 10pts with leaders Porto. They have kept only 10 clean sheets till now in every competition. The record also doesn't favour them at all. 


Predicted Lineup 

Benfica: Vlachodimos; Lazaro, Otamendi, Vertonghen, Grimaldo; Silva, Taarabt, Weigl, Everton; Yaremchuk, Nunez


Ajax: Pasveer; Mazraoui, Schuurs, Martinez, Blind; Alvarez, Klaassen; Antony, Berghuis, Tadic; Haller


Prediction 

Sebastian Haller will be eager to continue his magical scoring form in the Champions League after setting multiple records in the group stage with an elite attacking force to help. Benfica will stay compact as usual  with but Silva the sole creator on the break, an Ajax victory seems imminent. 3-1 to the visitors.
