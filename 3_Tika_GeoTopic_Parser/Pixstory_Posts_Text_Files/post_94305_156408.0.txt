The India U-17 Women’s football team had a bitter end to their World Cup campaign as they were brushed by a much more dominant and polished team in the form of Brazil. The South American side marched into the quarter finals winning the match by five goals to nil.
Brazil had more than 12 shots on goal converting almost half of them and managed to keep the maximum possession throughout the match. India on the other hand were made to toil and chase the ball against a side that had way more quality on the pitch. 
Berchon started the proceedings for her side in the 11th minute after she slotted home from a nice cross that came from the right flank by Ana Flavia. India almost got their first goal in the World Cup after a defensive error by the Brazilians allowed Neha to be in a one-on-one position with the goalkeeper but in the end produced a very weak shot.
Brazil mounted the attacks as India’s shot stopped Melody had to save a shot in the 33rd minute from Alice. The pressure was too much to handle for the Indians as another cross from Ana Flavia found Aline who beat the diving goalkeeper to double the lead.
With the Indians sitting back and trying to defend most of the balls, the Brazilians scored from long rangers in the second half. Aline completed her brace as she curled one in the 51st minute. After a brief period of relief for the Indians, substitute Lara scored from outside the box that beat Melody in the process. She too completed her brace in injury time giving the women in yellow a comprehensive.
This ends a disappointing campaign for the hosts as they conceded 16 goals in three matches. The lack of technical prowess was clearly on display and India simply couldn’t match up to either of the 3 teams they played.
