Travelling have turned into an effective way of finding relief. And we are aware about other kind of therapies like art and music and yes now we have travel therapy added to the list. 

A recently published journal article in Tourism Management found that the experience of going for a vacation is beneficial for people who deals with dementia. 

Travel therapy is not just confined in helping those with dementia but it also helps those who are struggling with other mental health issues as well. 

Researchers looked into how travel keeps one engaged in thinking, feeling, and sensory experiences to develop a framework on the existing positive psychology interventions for dealing with dementia. While drawing on the positive psychology, some tourism interventions was including theme park, beach related travels and family trips. 

Through this way travel for both who are dealing with dementia and with other mental health challenges have positive effects. 

The research is one of its kind to find the connections between tourism experiences and mental health interventions through the lens of positive psychology with such benefits as savoring the moment,Â  feeling gratitude and reflecting about positive experiences.
