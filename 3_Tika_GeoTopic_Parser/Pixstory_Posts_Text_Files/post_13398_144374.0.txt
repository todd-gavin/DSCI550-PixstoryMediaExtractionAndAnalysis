An investigation by Amnesty International shows that Taliban fighters attacked a house belonging to the Hazara people in Ghor Province in the month of Cancer and killed 4 men and 2 women.
These 4 Hazara men, who used to be part of the popular uprising force, were tortured and executed in the field by the Taliban.
The report of this organization shows that the Taliban attacked this house at night, during which a woman and a 12-year-old girl were killed.
4 Hazara men were shot and executed with their hands tied after being arrested. The organization said that the photos show signs of torture on the body of at least one of these men.
Amnesty International said that this incident is an example of the campaign of Taliban fighters to kill Hazara people and members of the security forces of the previous government.
The documents of this organization show that the Taliban executed a number of Hazara people in Ghazni and Daikundi provinces last year.
The head of this organization asked the Taliban to end their targeted, brutal and field killings.
He requested the International Criminal Court to start its independent and complete investigation if the Taliban group refused to investigate these killings and arrest the perpetrators.
