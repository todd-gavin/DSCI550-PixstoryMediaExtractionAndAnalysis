Arsenal were back in action after a delay in the premier league due to the passing of Her Majesty the Queen, but it looked like the break done no harm picking up where they left off before the United game.

William Saliba headed Arsenal into an early first-half lead.The defender met Bukayo Sakaâ€™s corner and the ball flicked off the far post and over the line to put the Gunners 1-0 up.Bees stopper David Raya palmed the ball away but it had already crossed the line, with the strike awarded by goal-line technology.Gabriel Jesus headed home to put Arsenal 2-0 up and in control at Brentford.The in-form Brazilian lost his marker before delivering a fine finish.Arsenal carried their 2-0 lead into the half-time break, with Brentford struggling to get into gear in west London.Fabio Vieira whipped home from 20 yards to put Arsenal 3-0 up shortly after half-time.The Gunners picked up where they left off before the interval, with Vieira delivering a fine goal.To top off a fine afternoon Young Ethan Nwaneri only 15 years old came off the bench to become the premier leagues youngest player. Simply amazing for the young man.
