When I was a young reporter covering health, my bosses would tell me de jargonise the health reports. 
Pan to year 2019-2022 and people are talking covid 19, coronavirus, spike proteins, T genes , delta variants, omicron , BA.2 sub variant .
Now all of a sudden I am getting forwards in family, society and work groups about the NeoCov. 
I looked up the original study, did a post about the same-With a footnote explaining how the virus is only found in bats, the mutation hasn’t happened not likely to happen anytime soon.
What was interesting the study was not peer reviewed was unpublished . However someone on the desk in some media organisation decided that NeoCoV will be killing entire humanity soon. 
Others followed and we were told this virus will kill one out of three people . Clickbait for sure the killings and Wuhan lab. What else does the already paranoid nation which saw a devastating delta wave in April last year, need. Another scare . 
The headlines didn’t tell us the virus was found only in bats. If only a mutation happens and it jumps specifies are the humans likely to be affected. 
The most important of all, the virus has nothing to do with covid . 
THE STUDY IS NOT PEER REVIEWED. 
I tweeted saying this is not the case, asked for health ministry to intervene . Alas when did media have any accountability when it is needed. Unless ur speaking about those whose names need not be taken. 
With covid dominating news everyone seems to have become an expert on health and in the process lot of facts have become compromised . 
Health reporting is a specialized field and false information impacts human lives. 
In the times when we are trying to get back to normal living, the scares and paranoia will push us back.
Covid is here to stay, it might become endemic but we will have to learn to live with it. 
More viruses might come, and the globe might be shut again but we don’t want false alarms please.
