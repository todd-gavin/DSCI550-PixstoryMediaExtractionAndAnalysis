Only one player escaped the ire of the Parc des Princes Paris Saint Germain s fans whistled and jeered every time Lionel Messi touched the ball They howled and crowed at the sight of a wayward shot from Neymar There was no allowance in their anger for reputation no discrimination by status It encompassed mortal and immortal alike The lone exception during last weekend s routine win against Bordeaux was Kylian Mbappe There was no romance behind his pardon He was not excused because he is a boy from the French capital s banlieues an identifiably Parisian superstar a local kid made good All of those terms except perhaps superstar apply to defender Presnel Kimpembe too but the fans deemed him as guilty as everyone else Nor was it related to performance Mbappe almost alone had emerged with credit from PSG s elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid He had scored once and had seen two goals ruled out for offside He had gleamed under the bright lights of the Santiago Bernabeu He had almost single handedly carried Mauricio Pochettino s team to the quarterfinals His brilliance though has not stopped PSG s ultras targeting him before It was instead a rather more cynical calculation that ensured Mbappe s reprieve The year old forward s contract at PSG expires at the end of the season Although it has long been assumed he would move to Madrid this summer PSG has not yet given up hope of changing his mind Reports have suggested that it might be willing to pay him as much as million a year to stay PSG s ultras as a statement on their protests explained might despair of the way their club is run They might believe its executives are more concerned with releasing special edition jerseys and gathering superstars to sell them than building a coherent team They might abhor the way the team seems to regard Ligue as little more than a training exercise
