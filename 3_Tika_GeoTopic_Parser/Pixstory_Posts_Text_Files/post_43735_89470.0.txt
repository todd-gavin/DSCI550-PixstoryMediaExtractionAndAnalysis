It's a well-renowned fact that Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the most-hardworking players in world football. 

Despite being 37 years of age, he is relentless, scoring and playing like none other. Despite this, his former Manchester United teammate Dimitar Berbatov recently revealed the name of a player who trained better than Ronaldo. 

Together, Berbatov and Ronaldo formed a formidable partnership, before the latter left for Real Madrid in 2009. 

Ronaldo was the peak of his career back then, scoring goals for fun. But despite this, there was a Manchester United player, who trained ‘better’ than Ronaldo, in fact, he was the best in terms of training, per Berbatov. 

In a recent interview, the Bulgarian legend revealed how Gary Neville, and not Ronaldo, or even Wayne Rooney was the most hardworking player at United.

“Purely on training and wanting to produce in every training session and working hard, I must say Gary Neville is up there,” Berbatov told FootyAccums (via Express). 

He further continued, “He (Neville) trained very hard every session, to be honest. It was just like his professionalism and wanting to still show that he was better than the other players around him.”

Cristiano Ronaldo’s dedication has been heralded by many players of past and present. 

In a recent interview with Mirror Sport, the 37-year-old’s former coach Aitor Karanka revealed how the Portuguese skipper remains professional as ever, despite having achieved so much in his career. 

“It was a pleasure and a privilege to have worked with Cristiano. He is a proper professional and a leader – but not one who is always shouting, but he shows he is a leader with his work ethic. He is the first player at the training ground and the last player to leave. He always is driven to win and to score goals,” he said.
