Arsenal have completed their initial bit of business in the summer window, after signing Porto midfielder, Fabio Vieira for €35m. The Portuguese has signed a five-year contract with the Gunners, and is thought to be a part of Mikel Arteta’s long term plans. 

Fabio Vieira showcased his talent on the big stage last season, where he scored 7 goals and collected 16 assists in all competitions. Mikel Arteta has been building a team around young guns, and as such, the 22-year-old playmaker could directly fit into the manager’s plan. In an official interview with the Arsenal website, Fabio Vieira explains the decision to join the Gunners, and the massive step he has taken in terms of his own career progression.

“This is an important step forward in my career. Arsenal is a huge and historic club, so I’m delighted to be here at my new home,” said Vieira. "It certainly was a fast process [the transfer]. It was something that I was drawn to. Meeting the people at the club was a real positive for me. I’m loving it here and I’m here to give the team my all,” he added.


Fabio Vieira is a player who has sound technical ability, and has often been compared to his Portuguese compatriot, Bernardo Silva. The new signing is excited about donning the Arsenal jersey, and cannot wait to get started for his new club. He also recognizes the task that lies ahead, given that he has signed for one of the biggest clubs in the world, with a huge fanbase.

"Arsenal is a historic English club. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world. Everyone knows that Arsenal are a fantastic team. That was one of the main factors behind me choosing Arsenal. I really like the way the team plays and I can’t wait to get started,” Vieira aded.
