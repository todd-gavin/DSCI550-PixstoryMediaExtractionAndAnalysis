A half-century after the Apollo programme came to an end, NASA is still at least three years away from attempting to send men back to the moon's surface because most of the required technology is still being developed. 

But as IE reported, with the inaugural flight of its next-generation megarocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), and the Orion crew capsule it is intended to transport on Monday in Florida, NASA hopes to make a significant advancement in its revived lunar ambitions. 

The unmanned capsule will go around the moon and back to Earth on a six-week test voyage called Artemis I when the combined SLS-Orion spacecraft lifts off from Cape Canaveral's Kennedy Space  Center. 

“We are go for launch,” NASA Associate Administrator Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle pilot and commander, told a news briefing late on Monday following the mission’s flight readiness review.
