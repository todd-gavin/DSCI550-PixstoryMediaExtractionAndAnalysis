I used to wear a nose ring,
Even though, I look happy in this picture, i tried to show people that their looks won't affect me, or won't bother me, I faced constant judgy eyes because how I presented myself, those judgy eyes kind of affected me to remove the ring cause i couldn't take it anymore. I now wear a stud, which is barely visible.
When i got my nose ring for the first time, i felt sooo beautiful, i couldn't take my eyes of it,
But the world is a cruel place, 
Got decriminated everywhere i went, 
In the interview instead of interview questions they asked me about my nose ring which was nothing to do with my profession, it still haunts me, while walking on the roads, people saw me like is that supposed be allowed, 
In college i used to go one boy told me don't wear ring cause ut doesn't look good on "men". The list goes on.
When i was removing my nose ring i felt my heart race faster, cause I couldn't believe i lost to this heteronormative world, i got defeated by them, but still i chose to wear stud piercing cause I didn't want my piercing to disappear.
