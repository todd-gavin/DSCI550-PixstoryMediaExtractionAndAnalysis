22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal reached his 8th Wimbledon quarter-finals.

This is his first quarter finals at Wimbledon since his run to the semi-final in 2019 after he defeated Netherlands' Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets (6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (6)) in the men's singles 4th-round match. 

Rafael Nadal's dreams of winning a Calendar Slam remain alive as he faces 11th seed Taylor Fritz of the USA in the quarter-finals later this week. Nadal won the Australian Open in January and dethroned Novak Djokovic at the French Open, taking his Grand Slam tally to 22, two ahead of the Serb and Roger Federer who are tied on 20 each.
