Experts believe that Kho Kho originated in the Maharashtra region of India and in the ancient times was played on chariots and was called Rathera. Rath is the Hindi translation for a chariot.
The present version of Kho Kho, played by individuals on foot, originated in 1914 at the time of the first World War.
Puneâ€™s Deccan Gymkhana club first came out with formalised rules and regulations for Kho Kho. These gave the sport a structured look. 
Kho Kho, along with other indigenous Indian sports like  kabaddi and  mallakhamb, was demonstrated on the sidelines of the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
The first ever All India Kho Kho Championship was held at Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh in 1959-60 while the national championship for women was played in Kolhapur, Maharashtra in 1960-61.
Kho Kho was also demonstrated during the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi and the first-ever Asian Championship was held in Kolkata in 1996. It was also a medal sport at the South Asian Games 2016 in Guwahati.
Currently, almost 25 countries have their national Kho Kho teams.
The objective of Kho Kho is to tag or hunt down an opponent and score points. However, it is bound by a strict set of rules rather than being a free-for-all playground game.
A senior international Kho Kho match has two innings separated by a brief break. Each innings has two turns, lasting nine minutes each, where teams alternate between chasing and defending. The team with the most points at the end of the two innings wins the match.
If the teams are tied at the end of the match, an additional innings is played to decide the winner. If there's still no definite winner, both teams take a turn each and the side to win one point in the least amount of time is the winner.
