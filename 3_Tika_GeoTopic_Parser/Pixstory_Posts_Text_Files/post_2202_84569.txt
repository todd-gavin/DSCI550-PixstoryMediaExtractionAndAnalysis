KCR has revived his national ambitions and renewed his bid to forge a federal front against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party BJP a move he initiated in but failed Soon after retaining power in Telangana in the assembly elections KCR tried to cobble up a grouping of non BJP and non Congress parties However the move was a non starter as there were not many takers to his idea He shelved the initiative after Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned to power in Since then his Telangana Rashtra Samithi TRS had sided with the government in Parliament and ensured a smooth passage of many key bills in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha However the relationship turned bitter with the BJP trying to make inroads in the state In the Lok Sabha elections the BJP won of the seats in Telangana and it s vote share increased from to with two years Then came its performance in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Council GHMC elections and the subsequent Dubbak and Huzurabad bypolls This had visibly rattled KCR as he began to feel threatened with the slow and steady rise of the BJP He was convinced that it would be easy to tackle the Congress than the mighty BJP KCR devised a strategy to take on the BJP not only in his state but across the country At the same time he argued that it is high time to come up with a credible and a viable alternative to Prime Minister Modi since the Congress has failed to do so in the past nearly eight years His first stopover was in Chennai where he met Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin He then went to Mumbai where he met Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar The three endorsed his proposal to forge a united front against the BJP but insisted that any such formation without the Congress would be a futile exercise as after BJP it is the only political party that has pan India presence The same argument was given to Mamata Banerjee who too wanted a non Congress grouping
