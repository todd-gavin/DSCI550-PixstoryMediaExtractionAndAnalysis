During holidays I love to go to my village I think village is the still the most beautiful place to make your mind fresh and relax Every evening I just click a random pic of the area and every time it s turn to become the most beautiful scenery of the day Every month of year I spend like a villager giving up all my luxuries Making food on chulah eating with whole family seating on floor getting early in the morning enjoying sunrise visiting farms with nanu is still my favorite work of the day No other beauty can bite the village beauty
