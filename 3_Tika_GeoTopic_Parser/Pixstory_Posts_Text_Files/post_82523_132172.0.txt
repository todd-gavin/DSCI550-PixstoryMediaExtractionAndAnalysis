Photography has always been my hobby. I love taking pictures. I think I am a very anti-social person ðŸ˜‚ so I feel the best way to connect with nature is through...atleast I do not need to behave like an imposter...Photography is like a medium for me to portray my inner self..may be i always donot take pictures in the most artistic way possible...some are just random clicks ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£...but some of my clicks really soothes me........
