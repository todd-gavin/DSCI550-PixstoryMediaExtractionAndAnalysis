From today Thursday May TATUAGGIO and URAGANO are available digitally, the new songs by the Turin singer-songwriter EUGENIO RODONDI These two tracks represent the manifesto of the gentle provocation of which the artist makes his voice What would happen if I published my songs and it wasn&#39;t me who sang them Eugenio Rodondi tries to answer this question by publishing two tracks in which he does not appear except as an author. Tattoo and Uragano are the two new songs by Eugenio Rodondi written and set to music together with creative Francesco Moroni Spidalieri and part of the collective Cali Low oversaw its production The purpose of this gentle revolution implemented by Eugenio Rodondi is to play with the by now too inflated concept of ego by opting for an elision when this risks representing a brake on productive and collective creative processes This initiative it represents a gesture of rebellion against performative dependence and the subtle narcissistic pleasure that one feels listening to one&#39;s own voice that speaks, explains, even sings. The important fact for me is that those words are sung, not that I sing them. of those who will listen not to the sound of my voice The song Tattoo in fact interpreted by the sublime voice of Rossana De Pace, a young Apulian singer-songwriter who has made this song her own, which represents the first step in the long journey of this delicate revolution conceived by Rodondi
