Bipasha Basu is all set to welcome her first child with husband Karan Singh Grover.
The actress took to her Instagram handle to share a picture from her maternity shoot and wrote❤️

"A new time, a new phase, a new light adds another unique shade to our prism of life. Making us a little more whole than we used to be. We began this life individually and then we met each other and from then we were two."❤️👩‍🍼

Too much love for only two, seemed a little unfair for us to see…so soon, we who once were two will now become three.👨‍👩‍👧👨‍👩‍👦

A creation manifested by our love, our baby will join us soon and add to our glee."
Thanking her well-wishers, Bipasha continued, "Thank you all, for your unconditional love, your prayers and good wishes as they are and will always be a part of us. Thank you for being a part of our lives and manifesting with us another beautiful life, our baby🙏Durga Durga"❤️
