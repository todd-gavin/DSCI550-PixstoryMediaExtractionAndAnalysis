After VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system, there is yet another addition of technology to football, which will be seen during the World Cup football in Qatar. According to a FIFA announcement, players during World Cup will obtain insights regarding their on-field performance through the FIFA Player App. FIFA said that all players at the finals will be able to browse their performance data on a purpose-built app developed by the governing body which allow footballers of all 32 teams access to analysis and information. The app has been created after feedback from players, through the players union FIFPRO, and the data will be synched with video of the action to allow quick assessment of key moments.
FIFA explains that the FIFA football performance analysts and insights team will compile “enhanced football data metrics, physical performance metrics, and enhanced football intelligence metrics.” Additionally, they will also develop a series of algorithms and models and implement an accurate in-stadium tracking system consisting of multiple cameras for maximum player coverage. FIFA says that metrics include distance covered at various speed thresholds, number of actions above 25km/h, and maximum speed, all displayed on positional heat maps. “This data is then synchronized with match footage to enable players to watch all key moments of their own performance in detail, using different camera angles,’’ claimed FIFA. When players arrive in Qatar for the FIFA World Cup, they will be able to access the FIFA Player App. They can also save or share the photographs on social media, along with their favourite match statistics, directly from the app.
While such data and metrics are widely available to players with the top clubs and national sides, who employ teams of analysts, the app will ensure squads with fewer resources also have access. Players will also be provided with photographs from the matches which they can share on social media along with stats and data.
