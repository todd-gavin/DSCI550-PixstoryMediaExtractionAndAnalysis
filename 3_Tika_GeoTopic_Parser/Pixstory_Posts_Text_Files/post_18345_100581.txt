Jos Mourinho has chosen who to start with again next year Paulo Dybala The Juventus playmaker whose contract is about to expire would be the missing piece of the puzzle to start building a winning Roma Of course there is no shortage of suitors and the signing requested by the player risks being a problem but the Portuguese coach has also made his request to the club For now yes to words and nothing official It also seems that there have been no contacts yet but the rumor continues to spread The operation would also be sustainable in terms of exits that would allow Santon to succeed in deadline and save millions of euros a year With the suitcase ready there are also Veretout Carles Perez There is Shomurodov Diawara Villar and Darboe Plus Zaniolo could be sold in the face of an offer worth millions of euros In any case, the telenovela Dybala will still be very long
