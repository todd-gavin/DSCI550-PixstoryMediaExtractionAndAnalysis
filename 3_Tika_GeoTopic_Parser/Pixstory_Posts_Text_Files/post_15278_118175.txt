The ARPA informs that the low rainfall which has persisted since December in Lombardy has reduced the total water reserve of lakes invaded and snow water equivalent below the minimums observed in recent years. The quantity of water reserve on a regional scale recorded in July is in fact, it is below the average for the period with the water equivalent of the SWE snow depleted for over a month and with the lakes and reservoirs at the minimum for the reference period. Local showers are expected in the Alpine and Pre-Alpine reliefs in the next few days. From Monday to Thursday the probability of scattered thunderstorms increases, which occasionally may also affect the plain. In the first two weeks of August, the most probable scenario re-proposes above-normal temperatures and low rainfall. The situation on a district scale is in line with the regional one. The Observatory for water use in the The District Authority has established a high level of water severity for the entire Po Valley district. In addition, the presence of an anticyclonic area in the Mediterranean basin will continue to create favorable conditions for the formation and accumulation of photochemical pollutants in the coming days as well
