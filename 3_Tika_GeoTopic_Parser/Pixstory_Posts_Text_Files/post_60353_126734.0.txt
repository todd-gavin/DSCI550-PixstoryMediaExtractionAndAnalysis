1. Kim Seon Ho
It was during episode 66 of the show that the cast members had to experience wildlife and in order to survive, they had to set up tents and campfires by themselves. 

For the first mission, the "2 Days 1 Night" cast did their best and was able to finish the task. 

However, as the production team let the cast members leave the island, the PD mentioned that they have to build a canoe to depart from the island. 
The task made Kim Seon Ho furious and said with a loud voice "Hey, what else are you doing?" while fellow actors calmed him down. 

Unfortunately, viewers found it rude and criticized the star for his impolite gesture to the female PD. 

However, some defended the actor claiming that the reason why he acted that way is because he is close to the director and it was his form of a joke.

2. Kim Yoo Jung
In 2016, the actress had to cancel her activities due to minor health issues. Unfortunately, an online post titled "Kim Yoo Jung's stage manners attitude" featured a clip where the actress reportedly showed disrespect to the crowd after she was seen leaning on one leg and looking at her nails. 

At the time, netizens pointed out that it would be nice if she acted "a little more courteous" to fans who lined up to see her. 

The actress' agency then issued an apology statement, saying that Kim Yoo Jung will "deeply reflect on her own attitude as a result of the controversy."

3. Seo Ye Ji
Besides the gaslighting and manipulation issue with Kim Jung Hyun, Seo Ye Ji was also accused of abusing her staff. 

Various reports noted an online post from anonymous staff claiming that the actress "verbally abused" them and would be asked to buy cigarettes for her.
