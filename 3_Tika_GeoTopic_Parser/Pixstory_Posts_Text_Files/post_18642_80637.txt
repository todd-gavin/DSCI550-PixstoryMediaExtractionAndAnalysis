There was a lot of anticipation for the super-G in Beijing but unfortunately it didn&#39;t go as hoped After a year in which the Italian athletes had won six races out of seven in the World Cup, many believed in a medal Even after Sofia Goggia&#39;s forfeit And instead no medal arrived the first Italian was Federica Brignone who finished seventh to hundredths from the gold of Lara Gut Behrami Elena Curtoni winner this year in Cortina instead finished tenth Marta Bassino seventeenth and Francesca Marsaglia twenty-second One of the main problems for the Italian athletes turned out to be being the track an unknown until the start since no pre-Olympic tests were done A not very technical track Honestly today I didn&#39;t do my best performance but I&#39;m not the strongest in these conditions A super-G so easy so flat so trivial I&#39;m not the best in the world and today this thing came out commented Brignone to Sky&#39;s microphones at the end of the race I improved a lot but not enough to do a good race here Giving everything is the only thing that makes you clear with conscience and me today I am I really gave in to the medal and honestly I could even deserve it the games are so especially in speed It makes me nervous how it went because I think I really could have deserved a medal in the super-G this year I was disappointed by the track I don&#39;t want to find excuses you also have to accept may the others be better than you A medal in four years I don&#39;t think about it I think about tomorrow&#39;s races
