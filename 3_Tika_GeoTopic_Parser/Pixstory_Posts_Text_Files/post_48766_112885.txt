Hustle culture may be described as an environment that moves quickly and thrives on long hours spent working and a restless desire to pursue unattainable objectives The fact that the Hustle Culture is fairly pervasive is a sign of how badly the larger political economy has failed to provide societal needs for employment and services In reality it s just another way to blame the poor for their circumstances In this culture the homeless is blamed for his state instead of the system Any kind of systemic failure is pinned on the individual because they must not be hustling hard enough Any society that attempts to minimise leisure time is toxic by nature because it is fundamental to wellbeing It cultivates a perpetually poisonous climate where you feel terrible if you spend too much time on something unrelated to work A form of cognitive dissonance is fueled by it You risk contradicting your true objectives and losing sight of your why if you overwork and live by the maxim grind hard It is deadly It promotes not only unhealthy habits but those habits have deadly consequences From physical illnesses to mental ones Hustle culture is a direct contributor to many problems like depression anxiety lethargy insomnia and even drives people to suicides It s not okay never will be
