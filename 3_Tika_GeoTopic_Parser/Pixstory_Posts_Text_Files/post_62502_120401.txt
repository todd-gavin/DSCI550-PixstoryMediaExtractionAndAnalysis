In general wolves do not attack people in fact their basic nature is to stay away from humans Would you be engaging in behaviour that put the wolf or its pack in danger If you accidentally entered the pack s den and they had puppies to defend the pack is going to attack you Even though they are reported wolf attacks on people are relatively uncommon because canids prefer to avoid all human contact They smell us from afar and flee away themselves These attacks typically result from starvation territorial behavior or provocation If you re camping in a place with wolves around always light a fire They will avoid coming near one The last thing you want to do when a wolf or a pack of wolves is approaching you is run You can t They are one of the fastest species and they will catch up to you in no time Running is a prey behavior You don t want to be their prey Make yourself appear larger Your jacket bag or hands Hold them up and slowly back off There s a debate on whether or not you should stare the animal down Wolves tend to take staring as a challenge and these haughty animals do not like to back away from them However wolves are also known to be uncomfortable by the staring In my opinion avoid doing that Wolved usually wander in packs so if you see a lone wolf get out of there If you can t climb a tall tree nearby Lone wolves are often rabid and unnecessarily aggressive and you have to absolutely avoid getting bitten by them Once they bite you there s little to no chance of surviving If you re being attacked by wolves your best bet is to crouch in a fetal position and do your best to cover your neck Wolves go for throat or neck cover it to your best ability You have a stronger chance of surviving this way even though you will be injured Remember wolf attacks are rare but never trigger one They don t like it
