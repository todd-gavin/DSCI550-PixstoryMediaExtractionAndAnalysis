Institute Of Management Studies, my college teaches me that No, sky is not the limit. It is only the beginning. The educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living differ from the dead. An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.ðŸ¥‚
