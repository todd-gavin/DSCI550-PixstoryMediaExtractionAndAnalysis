A Taliban police spokesman in Kabul confirmed three explosions at a boys' school in Dasht-e-Barchi, saying at least six people had been killed and 11 wounded.

Some sources report that 20 to 30 students were killed and several others were injured.

Abdul Rahim Shahid School is the largest school in Afghanistan with 30,000 students.

Early Tuesday morning, three more explosions occurred in front of the Abdul Rahim Shahid School after an explosion at the Mumtaz Educational Center in Qala-e-Naw Dasht-e-Barchi.

A number of reporters say the Taliban prevented them from entering the scene and detained some reporters to prevent them from covering the incident.
Meanwhile, families who went to Mohammad Ali Jinnah Hospital with their children were dispersed by Taliban gunfire.

Mumtaz Educational Center is located in District 18 and Abdul Rahim Shahid School in District 13 in the west of Kabul.

The bomber struck shortly after noon as students were leaving the school, sources said.
