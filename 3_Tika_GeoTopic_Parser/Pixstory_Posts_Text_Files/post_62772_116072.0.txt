" We don't inherit the earth from our fathers, we borrow it from our children."

Whatever we decide to do will have an impact on future generations, including our offspring. Many of the existing environmental and ecological harms may take decades to manifest themselves. However, misusing resources and the natural world will ultimately be very expensive for everyone, especially those who are going to come after us.

We have a moral responsibility of protecting the Earth and we must fulfill it while we have the time.
