The Indian women cricket team’s spectacular win against Pakistan in their opening match of the Women’s Cricket World Cup at Mount Maunganui has become the talk of Twitter town.

 However, it’s the photos of Indian players vibing with the baby of Pakistani skipper Bismah Maroof which have won all hearts. The International Cricket Council (ICC) tweeted a photo of the Indian team taking a selfie with the adorable baby and captioned it: “Little Fatima’s first lesson in the spirit of cricket from India and Pakistan."
