There was a lot to do in Kochi The wonderla water park in Kumarapuram was an exciting option for kids It was one of the craziest places I have been to The rides gave me a scare I ended up watching on the sidelines The musical tides almost gave me heart attack but my children didn t seem to get enough The artificial waves lashed with loud and beautiful music played live by local artists We went to many places the cathedrals the museums old bazaar enjoyed the most amazing food on streets and in cozy restaurants I and my husband ended up becoming fan of Kerala cuisine and relishing their famous fried dishes better to keep them unnamed although the meat had nothing to do with cow Honestly never had a bad food day in that part of the world The days ended with some souvenir shopping which included local gift items I packed my bags with masala which was vacuum packed and even with my crazy love for cooking I still have some left And not to forget the banana chips of different flavors We did not do the tea gardens this time left it for another visit because you can t visit the place once and get your fill You need to enjoy it in parts Till we return Kerala Concluded
