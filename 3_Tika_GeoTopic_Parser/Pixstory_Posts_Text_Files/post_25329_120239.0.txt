This book owns my heart. Kanthony own my heart. If you haven't read this book yet - WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING ON HERE?
Anthony Bridgerton. The man that he is. He has easily become one of my favorite book boyfriends! If you love a moody and traumatized man who does not want to fall in love you'll most likely love him as much as I do!
Now let's talk about my girl Kate. Kate Sharma (Sheffield) is a strong, selfless and loving woman. She'd do anything for her sister's happiness and is very VERY strong headed.
From the very first moment it is clear that Kate and Anthony feel drawn to each other. Mutual pining, constant banter and tension. That's what makes this book so good. Also: the sisterhood aspect is so beautiful in this book!
Lovers of enemies to lovers, period drama and Pride and Prejudice will LOVE this one. Trust me. It's such a fun and entertaining book that will have you hooked from the very beginning!
I couldn't bring myself to put this book down. It was everything needed. Pure perfection!
