Police in New York City arrested a man who allegedly pushed an Asian woman in front of an oncoming subway train Saturday morning, NYPD said in a news release.

The man, identified as 61-year-old Simon Martial, was charged with second-degree murder, NYPD said. He turned himself in to police less than an hour after the incident and was taken into custody. CNN has not been yet been able to identify an attorney for Martial.

NYPD Sgt. Anwar Ishmael called the incident a "random" attack.

Police said 40-year-old Michelle Alyssa Go died after she was pushed onto the tracks of the oncoming train at the Times Square-42nd Street subway station. The suspect then fled the scene, authorities said.

The incident, which took place around 9:40 a.m., was "unprovoked and the victim does not appear to have any interaction with the subject," NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said during a Saturday news conference. An investigation is ongoing, Sewell said.

On Sunday, Mayor Eric Adams told media the subway system is safe.

"What our battle is in the subway system is fighting the perception of fear that cases like this can happen," Adams told CNN Affiliate NY1.

"When you see homeless individuals with mental health issues not being attended to and given the proper services, that adds to the perception of fear," Adams said, speaking to a scrum of media after an unrelated press event. He reiterated the proper transit security plan was implemented at the station where the incident occurred.

"I keep continuing to say: this is a horrific incident, we lost a New Yorker, but we don't see how many lives we saved because of a proper plan like that," Adams continued.

Go was employed by Deloitte Services LP, a multimillion-dollar financial services firm.

Go was a volunteer with the New York Junior League (NYJL). Its president, Dayna Barlow Cassidy, said Go was working with several NYJL community partners that serve at-risk communities.
