I can well imagine how much of an strength effort and courage it takes to encounter wicked stares at a girl or a woman in a bus Metro in public transport malls streets with a question kya dekh rahe ho bhai Or just ignore it not wanting to create a scene The cruel and dehumanizing acts of some men trying to grab your breasts or butt when you walk past them at a very close distance its threatening and abusive both physically and mentally and makes a woman feel vulnerable to sexual assault in public places Now this is the state of women in public sphere when there is no pandemic and the law and order is in place Fast forward to the exodus of migrant workers from mega cities like Mumbai and Delhi to their homes in UP Bihar MP and many other states Imagine how badly vulnerable those little girls and women would feel when they would have to adjust in trucks or buses or trains or autos which are crammed with young men just men Wouldn t it be traumatizing for a girl when she would feel unsafe in her neighbour s lap while her parents are already loaded with her brothers and sisters and luggage to be carried home to their hometown which is hundreds of kilometres journey TW How terrifying would a girl of or would feel to be touched inappropriately and not being able to do anything about it TW ends How helpless and vulnerable would she feel to have to be in that vehicle where she feels unsafe and suffocated for the long hours of the journey How her life would change after that only one Journey which she will not be able to forget her whole life Though the pandemic is now coming to a rest
