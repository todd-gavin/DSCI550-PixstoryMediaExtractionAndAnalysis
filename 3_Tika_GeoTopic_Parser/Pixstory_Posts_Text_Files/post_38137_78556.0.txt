There has been a lot of interest surrounding the Tyneside club ever since the Saudi Arabian takeover took place. Owing to this, a lot of signings were expected in the January transfer window. 

Who signed for Newcastle United in January? 

Newcastle United showed that they meant business as soon as the January transfer window began. The club made instant headlines by signing Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid for €15 million. The fullback has signed a contract for two and a half years. 

Next, the Tyneside club signed Chris Wood from relegation rivals Burnley for €30 million. The New Zealander has scored 3 goals in 17 appearances for Burnley this season.

On the penultimate day of the transfer window, Newcastle United signed Bruno Guimaraes. The midfielder was a target for Arsenal but the Gunners could not match the salary that Newcastle were willing to pay. The club paid €42 million to secure the midfielder's services. 

The Deadline day was full of excitement as Newcastle United completed two more signings. First, they signed Matt Target on a loan from Aston Villa until the end of the season. 

To add to this, The Magpies paid €15 million to Brighton to sign center-back Daniel Burn. The defender has played 13 Premier League matches for the Seagulls this season. 


Who left the Magpies in the transfer window? 

Newcastle United parted ways with Freddie Woodman on loan in January. The goalkeeper has joined Championship side Bournemouth until the end of the season. 

Jeff Hendricks was also loaned out to Queens Park Rangers. The central midfielder has made just 3 appearances in the 2021/22 Premier League season. Hence Eddie Howe felt it was better to let him leave. 

To add to this, Mathew Longstaff and Joe White have also been loaned out until the end of the season. The former will play for Mansfield while the latter will take the field for Hartlepool United.
