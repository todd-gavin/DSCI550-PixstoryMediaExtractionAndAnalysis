Yesterday I have seen this film on Netflix “Love & Gelato” it's actually a book then made into a film. 

It's quite an emotional drama. Lina, a high school graduate, would rather spend her summer preparing for college than fly ✈️ to Rome to fulfil her mother's last wish. Once she decides to go, she finds herself immersed in new experiences.
