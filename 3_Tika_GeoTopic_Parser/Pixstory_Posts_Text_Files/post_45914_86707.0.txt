Former Attorney General Bill Barr may not be able to solve the issue of whether Melania Trump truly knows five languages, but he believes she was "smarter" than her husband, former President Donald Trump. 

In his new memoir, "One Damn Thing After Another," Barr may have grounds to make this claim. According to The Independent, Melania Trump persuaded her husband to recruit him. 

According to The Independent, in the book, the controversial Barr describes a meeting he had with then-President Barack Obama, who told him that Melania was completely responsible for him being hired to join Trump's cabinet and serve as the US government's senior lawyer. 

However, Trump's claim that Barr was "straight out of central casting" appears to be his own invention. When discussing why he nominated a given person to a job or appreciated them working in certain positions, Trump frequently used the term "central casting" or talked about how someone was "excellent looking" or "looked the part," CNN reported in 2019. 

If Melania Trump believed Barr looked the part of an attorney general, he reciprocated by praising the Slovenian-born former model as an excellent first lady of the United States. Barr characterised her as "gorgeous" and "clever" in his book. 

Barr even seems as if he would welcome her return to the White House as first lady.
