West Side Story actor Ariana DeBose wins the 94th Acedamy Awards!

After appearing in some of our favorite musicals over the years, including Hamilton and Summer: The Donna Summer Musical, the 30-year-old takes on the iconic role of Anita in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake. 

The adaptation of the 1961 film has received high praise from critics since its release. But people are especially loving DeBose's portrayal of the character, who was originally played by Rita Moreno.
