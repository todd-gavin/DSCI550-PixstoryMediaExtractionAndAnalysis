When the dress code of the 2022 Met Gala—“Gilded Glamour,” to pair with the “In America: An Anthology of Fashion” exhibit at the Met's Costume Institute—was announced in April, most attendees rushed to begin preparing sartorial agendas that relied heavily upon ruffles, glitz, and old-school panache.

This wasn't the case for British-Pakistani actor and musician Riz Ahmed, who arrived at the event in a silk shirt and undershirt that he topped off with an understated Cartier necklace, saying, “This is an homage to the immigrant workers who kept the Gilded Age going.”

Over the past year, Oglala Lakota and Han Gwich'in model Quannah Chashinghorse has been lighting up the fashion world with her distinctive look and her traditional face tattoos. The Indigenous beauty also uses her platform to champion her culture, advocate for more Indigenous representation in fashion, and highlight her ongoing climate activism work. It’s no surprise, then, that her look at the 2022 Met Gala look last night was rich in meaning. Clothing-wise, she wore Prabal Gurung’s upcycled, hand-planed tulle gown in aqua, complete with hand-embroidered strass at the bodice—but her accessories told a much bigger story. 

Chasinghorse’s accessories—her intricate jewelry and feather hairpieces—celebrated the idea of Native community and love in a unique way. The custom jewelry by Lenise Omeasoo, a Blackfeet and Cree artist who runs Antelope Women Designs, was intended to quite literally envelope the model with Native pride. “The piece was inspired by the Native community,” Omeasoo tells Vogue. “The tipis surrounding Quannah represent the love of her community, there with her.” Omeasoo applied dentalium shells, porcupine quills, and beads on smoked hide. “All the traditional materials I used were gifted through trade with other Native artists over the years,” says Omeasoo. “This was my first quilled jewelry set—a bit risky, but I wanted to give my all for Quannah’s iconic moment.”
