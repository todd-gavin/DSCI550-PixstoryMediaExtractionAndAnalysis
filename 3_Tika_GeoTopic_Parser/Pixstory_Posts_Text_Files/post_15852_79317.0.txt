Abstract 

Aim 

To investigate whether diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications (mMVC) influence cancer-related events in people with type 2 diabetes. 

Methods 

People with type 2 diabetes from the SURDIAGENE cohort were characterized (duration of diabetes, HbA1c, mMVC, history of cancer) and prospectively followed-up for death and cancer-related events (occurrence, dissemination and cancer-related death). 

Results 

Between 2002 and 2012, 1468 participants (58% men, mean age 64.8 ± 10.7 years, mean duration of diabetes 14.5 ± 9.9 years at baseline) were enrolled. At baseline, 119 (8%) had a personal history of cancer. Incident cancer occurred in 207 (14%) patients during a mean follow-up of 7.3 ± 3.7 years and was associated with older age, smoking status and personal history of cancer. mMVC were not associated with cancer-related events, considering cancer occurrence, node/metastasis dissemination and cancer-specific death. Risk of all-cause mortality was increased in diabetic patients cumulating cancer history and mMVC (HR 1.73, 95%CI 1.25-2.38) compared to those with neither cancer nor mMVC. In our cohort, cancer-related death was not associated with mMVC (HR 1.05, 95%CI 0.67-1.64), but conversely history of cancer was significantly associated with cardiovascular-related death (HR 2.41, 95%CI 1.36-4.26). 

Conclusion 

In our cohort, mMVC were not associated with cancer-related events, while history of cancer was significantly associated with cardiovascular death.
