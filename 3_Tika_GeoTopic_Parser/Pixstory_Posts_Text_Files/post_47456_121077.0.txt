Stars in the Premier League want to cease kneeling prior to every match.

The topic came up at a gathering of the 20 club captains last Thursday despite growing worries that the significance of the gesture had been diminished. Before the new season, which begins on Friday when Arsenal travels to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace, the captains discussed strategies for moving forward.

Footballers in the Premier League's top division worry that the protests against kneeling before games have lost their impact.The gesture might only be used during games that are broadcast on television or it might be decided upon game-by-game. Although a toned-down version of the gesture is presently the most likely result of the negotiations, it is still unclear how Premier League teams will choose which weeks they execute the anti-racism symbol.

Players will also probably kneel during any No Room For Racism campaigns to express their commitment for the Premier League's pro-equality action plan. Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace and Marcos Alonso of Chelsea have both voiced their worries that the gesture has lost its significance. Bournemouth plans to maintain its existing position and continue to believe that the emblem is not having the intended effect. Midway during their Championship season, The Cherries said in February 2021 that they will stop engaging in the act.

Not everyone has this opinion; in fact, there are still many Premier League players who support the gesture strongly, and it is possible to let each person make their own decision.

The first players to kneel in the Premier League were from Aston Villa and Sheffield United in June 2020. It was a very dramatic gesture at the time, and it received a lot of attention for its significance. It came after George Floyd's murder one month earlier in the US.

Before the 20 club leaders issue a statement via the Premier League announcing their plans for the 2022â€“23 season, more discussions will take place this week.
