Tottenham have opened talks with Juventus over Dejan Kulusevski as they look to end the January transfer window with some additions On the th of January David Ornstein revealed that Spurs are speaking to the Champions League giants about the year old The Swedish international s contract expires in so Ornstein believes that Tottenham will be signing Kuluveski on loan with an obligation option to buy Spurs have had a very frustrating January so far and have appeared to miss out on two of their top targets So it seems as if Tottenham are moving onto other targets and Kuluveski could be moving to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium On the face of it this could be a good deal The year old is naturally a right winger but he can play in various positions including centrally So that versatility would definitely help Spurs and he has performed reasonably well in Serie A However he hasn t really hit the ground running for Juventus this season and in league appearances this season he has scored just one goal and provided three assists transfermarkt Now these numbers can be improved and Antonio Conte might be able to get the most out of Kuluveski but is he really what they need Tottenham s other targets have included Luis Diaz and Adama Traore who are both very different players to Kuluveski I just hope that Spurs aren t trying to sign Kuluveski just for the sake of it because they appear to have missed out on numerous targets That would be unfair on Kuluveski and would also signal that the club didn t have a proper transfer policy in place for this transfer window So it remains to be seen if Spurs complete this signing and if he proves to be enough for Conte
