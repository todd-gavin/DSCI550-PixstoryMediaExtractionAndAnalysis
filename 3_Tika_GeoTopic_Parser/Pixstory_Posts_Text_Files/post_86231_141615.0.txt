Workplace cultures and job satisfaction in both government and private sectors in the UAE are some of the best in the world. Due to the security and opportunity the country provides, particularly a tax-free income, which is the largest pull for people from around the world to take up jobs here, millions of expats call UAE its home. Every month, tens of thousands of people travel here in search of work. An updated entry permit, designed exclusively for job seekers, is included in the revamped visa system, which will take effect in October.
Here are the different ways you can look for a job in the country, as listed by the official UAE government website.
1. Government job portals

2. Recruitment agencies 
You can register with any of the recruitment firms that are recognized in the UAE. You can contact these agencies online, particularly through  LinkedIn. "Job seekers are not obligated to pay money to a recruitment agency since the onus to pay such fees falls with the employers," the official UAE Government website states.
3. Private job portals
In the UAE, there are several private employment platforms. For suitable job openings, you can register on any of the websites. Some of the popular websites include: Indeed.ae, NaukriGulf.com, gulfjobs.com. (P.S. Keep in mind that you are not obligated to pay the recruitment agency a commission.)
4. Networking websites
You can look for jobs on professional networking sites like LinkedIn. Besides searching for jobs, you can also use these platforms to set notifications for the desired positions, which might be available on the site in the future. The best way to get a response from a recruiter is to drop them a message after applying for the position.   
5. Websites of firms and government agencies
Most private and public sector companies list out their vacancies in ‘careers’ or ‘work with us’ sections of their respective websites. But in order to do this, you should be aware of the businesses in the UAE that are relevant to your expertise.
