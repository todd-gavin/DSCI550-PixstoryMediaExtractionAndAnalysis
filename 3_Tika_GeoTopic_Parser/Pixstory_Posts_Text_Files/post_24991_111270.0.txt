After years of being oblivion to sounds, my son Mohammad Numaan, can hear it all now. Whether it’s a bird chirping , splattering rain drops or simply his mother calling out his name. Moulana is now student of UKG standard of Legends School of Education, Sadrebal, Srinagar. 
A few years back he was suffering with hearing loss and we had almost given up hope . 
Howeve after consultation with Dr Mohammad Rafiq Pampori, Ex- Principal of Government Medical College, Srinagar, our hope rekindled. He is not just a doctor but like a guardian angel for such kids.
Dr Rafiq gives confidence and hood to high to parents . Likewise for us he was guiding us at every step . Cochlear implant surgeries are-not common ans  very costly. He however made us realize how beneficial it is to get it done at ab early age .  
Mohammad Numaan, at the age of 4 years got the Cochlear Implant sugery in February, 2020 it was done by Dr Mohammad Rafiq Pampori and after two years of continuous speech therapies he is able to learn and speak in school with all other ‘normal children “.
As a parent I don’t have enough words to express my gratitude to my God and than the surgeon.
