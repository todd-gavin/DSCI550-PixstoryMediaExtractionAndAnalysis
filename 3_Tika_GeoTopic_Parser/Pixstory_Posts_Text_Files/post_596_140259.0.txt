What about Camilla Parker Bowles? 
Well let me make it clear in the beginning only- I am team Diana , was and will be . 
Having said that what about Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles, wife of King Charles . 
Will the Queen consort be accepted by the general public. Will she finally come out of shadow of princess of hearts Diana, Charles’s first wife who died in a tragic accident in 1997. Queen Consort and the king have had a tumultuous relationship which started before both of them entered into marriages with two different people At the time of Diana’s death Camilla and her relationship with the King Charles was a huge question mark. Even when the two later married, Camilla wasn’t accepted by the general public- Princess Diana in a famous interview to BBC had  said that there were always “three people in the marriage “.
Has the public forgotten and forgiven that needs to be seen. Well may be after decades of facing hate, the queen consort might find some love coming her way.
