For the balance of the 2021-22 season, the outstanding young defender will be part of the Castilla squad. GOAL can reveal that Real Madrid and Shakhtar teenager Vinicius Tobias have agreed on a loan deal.

Vinicius, who joined Shakhtar from Internacional in January, will leave the Ukrainian club without making a single first-team appearance. The 18-year-debut old's was postponed indefinitely due to Russia's armed invasion of Ukraine, and Madrid seized the opportunity to sign him when UEFA's transfer rules were temporarily changed.

Up to June, UEFA will allow any international players based in the Russian and Ukrainian leagues to sign a deal with a new club without punishment.

Vinicius has agreed to a loan move to Real Madrid for the duration of the 2021-22 season, with the Brazilian expected to join the club's Castilla side immediately. In the summer, Madrid will have the option of making Vinicius' move permanent, but he will be unable to play for their senior team until he receives a non-community card.

Vinicius is regarded as one of Brazil's next-most generation's promising players, with the ability to play in a variety of positions. Due to his muscular frame, outstanding quickness, and crossing ability, the Shakhtar defender can play as a right-back, a centre-back, or even a winger.

From next season onwards, Madrid are considering bringing him in to provide support at right-back for Carlo Ancelotti's first squad. This season, Dani Carvajal and Lucas Vazquez have played in that capacity, but neither has impressed, with Vinicius being mentioned as a long-term replacement.
