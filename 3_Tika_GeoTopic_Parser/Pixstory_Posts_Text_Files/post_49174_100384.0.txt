What happened to those people is terrible, and they didn't deserve it, at all. My sympathies and heart goes out to them and their loved ones but I am, once again, just appalled by how casually people have started blaming all white people for that.

Just because a lunatic wakes up and goes on a solo rampage does not mean he represents the group of all the people who have the same skin color as him. This is tone deaf and passing the blame. One person cannot be the representative of all, especially not when he's a murderer. Most white people have utmost care and respect for our black and native folks and we do not deserve to be blamed for something like that.

Similarly, gun violence has little to do with gun ownership and more to do with who owns the gun. Any sane person will never carry out something like this. There's a dire need to see all of this from a more rational perspective.

My prayers to everyone affected by this cowardly act, may the victims rest in peace and their families and friends get the strength to heal.
