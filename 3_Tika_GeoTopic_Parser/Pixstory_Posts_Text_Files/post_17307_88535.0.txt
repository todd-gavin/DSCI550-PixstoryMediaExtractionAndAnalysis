Paris Saint-Germain produced a woeful performance as they lost 3-0 at Monaco in Ligue 1, a result that will put coach Mauricio Pochettino under more pressure less than two weeks after their Champions League exit.

PSG, on 65 points from 29 games, still lead Marseille and Nice by 15 points before those sides meet later on Sunday, following a third straight away league defeat.

With Lionel Messi ruled out by a bout of flu, the capital side showed close to nothing at the Louis II stadium 11 days after being knocked out of the Champions League last 16 by Real Madrid.

“They played well, congratulations to them. They’re a good team, a great club,” the PSG striker Kylian Mbappé said. “The goal is to get the 10th French title. We can win 8-0, 9-0, people will talk about the Champions League. Whatever happens we must respect ourselves, if we have a little bit of self-esteem. We also need to respect the fans.”

Wissam Ben Yedder put the hosts ahead on 25 minutes after beating Presnel Kimpembe at the near post to deflect Youssouf Fofana’s cross into the top corner. PSG were not much better after the break, although Mbappé wasted a couple of good opportunities before Monaco doubled their advantage in the 68th minute.

An unchallenged Fofana found Ben Yedder on the right and the France striker’s pass reached Ruben Aguilar who deflected the ball for Kevin Volland to score from six metres. PSG conceded another goal six minutes from time.

Volland was tripped in the box by Kimpembe and Ben Yedder converted the resulting penalty to confirm PSG’s fourth consecutive away defeat in all competitions.

In Serie A, first-half goals from Paulo Dybala and Dusan Vlahovic earned Juventus a comfortable 2-0 win over the bottom side, Salernitana, as Massimiliano Allegri’s side kept in touch with the leaders, Milan.
