Coming back to the question of penile fracture, you may be surprised to know that despite the absence of a bone, it’s very much possible to ‘fracture’ an erection. Though such cases are rare, men in almost all cultures have reported cases involving a broken penis at some point or the other. The reasons can be as diverse as penis bones.

In Japan, people have broken their penises while accidentally rolling on to it in an erect state. Trying to suppress an unwanted erection or making it go away forcefully, have led to some serious accidents, among men in the Mediterranean region. 

In the US, the most common reason is missing the target during sex. Men try to penetrate in haste and hit somewhere else: their partner’s pubic bone or perineum, the area between the genitals and the anus. What about Indians? 

Sadly, there is no research available. So I talked to Dr Narayana Reddy, a globally acclaimed sexologist, fellow of the American college of Sexologists and a VVOX expert.

Dr Narayana Reddy: In my clinical experience of 40 years, I have come across only two cases of penile fracture. One reason why some doctors call it penile fracture is because there is a popping sound almost like the way a bone cracks, when the thick covering of the penis muscle ruptures.

Any blunt injury on an erect penis can produce this. Woman on top is one common sexual position that can make men vulnerable to a penile fracture, so people should be careful.

The two cases which came to me were due to this. But the real problem is even if something like this happens many men don’t come forward and seek medical help as they are too embarrassed. 

This can be dangerous, as any delay in time can make it difficult for doctors to manage the situation. The penile tissues too will get damaged, leading to permanent erectile dysfunction or deformity.
