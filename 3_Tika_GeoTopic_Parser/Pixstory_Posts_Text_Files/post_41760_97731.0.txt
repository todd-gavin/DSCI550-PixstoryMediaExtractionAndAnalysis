Professional sports in Australia have been taken captive by the promise of cash that data may bring, resulting in a "explosion in the collection" of athletes' personal and private data acquired via 24-7 monitoring with few to no rules or protections, as reported by ABC News.

According to the authors of a recent discussion paper requesting action from professional sports authorities, the "catch all" strategy without the application of a legal, ethical, and medical framework leaves players and governing bodies exposed and vulnerable. 

The Australian Academy of Science and the University of Western Australia's Minderoo Tech and Policy Lab have published Getting Ahead of the Game — Athlete Data in Professional Sport.

Sports now capture large amounts of data that violate privacy, bodily autonomy, worker protections, and human rights, according to an expert working committee (EWG). 

Professor Julia Powles, the group's co-chair, stated that the amount of data collected is vast. 
“There's information from the chest harnesses that athletes wear, there's information from devices that we might use for our weekend run … but there's also information collection when they're off the field – wellbeing tracking, sleep track, a range of physiological measures," she told The Ticket podcast.
