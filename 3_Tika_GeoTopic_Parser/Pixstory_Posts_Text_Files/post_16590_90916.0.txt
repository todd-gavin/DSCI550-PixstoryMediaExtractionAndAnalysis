Kriti Sanon was clicked outside Anand Pandit's office,today. The actress looked stunning and her minimal sleek hair bun look grabbed our attention. The actress was seen in a brown bodycon dress and she paired it with a lighter shade shrug, which she has accessories with her black sunglasses and a matching bag. The actress seemed to be in hurry as she rushed to her car but still give the cameras a glimpse of her dazzling smile.
