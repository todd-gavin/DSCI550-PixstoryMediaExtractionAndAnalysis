It has been suggested that the Argentine tactician is on borrowed time despite delivering the Ligue 1 title in 2021-22.

Under-fire head coach Mauricio Pochettino has told the Paris Saint-Germain board they should back him in the same way that Manchester City do with Pep Guardiola while insisting he is "calm" about his position at Parc des Princes.

Pochettino has delivered three trophies since inheriting the managerial reins at PSG in January 2021, including last season's Ligue 1 title.

The Argentine has helped the club maintain their dominance of French football, but has been mainly judged on his failure in Europe, with a round of 16 defeat to Real Madrid in March sparking question marks over his future.

What has Pochettino said about his position at PSG?

It has been reported that PSG are preparing to sack Pochettino as they iron out a new project on the back of tying star forward Kylian Mbappe down to a contract extension.

Zinedine Zidane and Jose Mourinho have both been touted as potential replacements for the former Tottenham manager, but he is not concerned by speculation in the media and still believes he is the right man to take the club forward.

“I have one year left on my contract and there are a lot of rumours. Every week I am fired," Pochettino said in an interview with Esport3.

"PSG arouses this kind of thing. The club is trying to reinvent itself. The president will soon explain his new project, but I'm calm.

"To get there (at PSG), you have to be a good coach and after a year and a half there, I feel like one of the best. To lead a locker room with so many stars was a daily learning experience.

"We were very close to knocking out Madrid, like Chelsea, City and Liverpool. We went through it. I think we were far superior, but we missed the finishing touch. If the objective is to win the Champions League, it is normal to generate this kind of storm."
