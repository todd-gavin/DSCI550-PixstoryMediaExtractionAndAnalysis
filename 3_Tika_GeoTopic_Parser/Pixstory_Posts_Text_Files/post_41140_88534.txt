Every movement for justice is a trend these days It s nothing more than a hashtag that trends on twitter for weeks and then is forgotten about People change their profile pictures for a few day to be a part of the mass movement and as soon as the trend dies down so does the inspirational quotes and pictures People said the same thing about the Black Lives Matter movement However this time something was different The death of George Floyd shocked people to their core and as as a result this movement for justice for black people is not simply a trend Even after more than one year of his death the BLM movement stands strong The Black Lives Matter movement signifies that time for words is over and its time to take action to ensure that racism is a thing of past not just in history books but in real time also A research done by Indian University sheds light on how this movement is not a moment of awakening When protest happens it changes the way people talk said lead author Zackary Dunivin a doctoral student in sociology and complex systems at Indiana University He further elaborated how Black Lives Matter got people to pay attention when people weren t paying attention The protests got people to care and that has changed the way people are talking and thinking about race Black Lives Matter has shifted the conversation around racism raising awareness of issues and laying the foundation for social change
