Is it really any surprise that someone would come up with the brilliant notion of a Scream Day in this day and age, with so many stresses and anxieties? 

As daysoftheyear tells us, while a massage or meditation can undoubtedly help to calm those stressed nerves, some psychologists believe that a good old scream can be beneficial in its own right. At least for the time being. The brain relaxes when a person lets out their tensions with a good old-fashioned howl, which may provide some much-needed immediate relief.

So if science says screaming is good for people, itâ€™s time to celebrate Scream Day!

Scream Day was developed to assist the millions of people who need to release their pent-up anger. Scream Day could raise awareness about the health benefits of screaming aloud. Letting out a scream, whether in the shower, in the car, in a closet, or into a pillow, can be therapeutic and stress-relieving. 

Scream Day just raises awareness of this issue and acts as a reminder to individuals who may need to let off steam with a scream. Scream Day has the potential to assist millions of people in releasing tension in a safe and controlled manner.
