Although new guidelines in favour of Boris  Johnson have been passed and he has told that he will not resign. The issue is no longer about his resignation, but his position as the party chief. His MPs lack confidence in him. Two more Tory MPs have disclosed they have submitted letters of no confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Former health minister Steve Brine and Newton Abbot MP Anne Marie Morris join the five backbenchers who have publicly named him to quit as party leader.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions, the Treasury minister John Glen said he had had a “very frank and very honest” meeting with Johnson to convey his and his constituents’ misgivings.

“I think we are in yellow card territory but as a member of the government I went to see him and let him know how I felt and my constituents felt, but he asked me to get on with the job of driving reforms in financial services,” he said.

For a vote of no confidence to be accelerated, the chair of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, must receive letters from at least 54 Conservative MPs – 15% of the parliamentary party.

Many leaders comprising Tory MPs have exhibited their dissatisfaction with the new guidelines.

Chris Bryant, the chair of the Commons standards committee, said the “loosening” of the ministerial code by Johnson was “bizarre” and indicated why there should be an independent system in place for judging the conduct of ministers.

A Labour MP told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he disagreed with suggestions made by the independent committee on standards in public life, which allow ministers to continue in their jobs for what could be considered minor breaches of the code. This will affect the elections and Boris Johnson's image.
