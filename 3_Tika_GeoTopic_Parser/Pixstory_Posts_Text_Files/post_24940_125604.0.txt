Chichhore, though the name sounds quite 'ajeeb' yet it has been one of the timeless classics which we as students can easily relate to. With some emotional scenes to some rom-com moments, this film takes on a ride of all sorts of feelings. Arshia has beautifully portrayed this friendship in her article. You may refer to the parent article. Cheers!
