Exfoliating your lips can help eliminate some dry, flaking skin that builds up and immediately restores some shine, softness, and smoothness.

Pour a small amount of your exfoliating ingredient into a small dish. A tablespoon or so should be adequate.

Use a cotton swab to dab into your emollient. How much you’ll need will vary depending on your chosen ingredient, but the swab should be fully coated.

Note that if you’re using a toothbrush or towel instead of a cotton swab, directly dip it into your emollient, so you have ample to apply to your lips. However, be careful not to brush or wipe too harshly. Doing so may overly strip your lips rather than provide the desired exfoliation.

Dip your coated cotton swab into your dish with the exfoliating ingredients, so it’s covered.

Wet your lip with water to soften, and gently rub the swab ingredients over your lips in small circles.

Wipe off any excess exfoliator with a clean tissue or soft cloth, then follow up with a moisturizing lip balm or lipstick.
