‌Republicans through their majority have brought out dramatic shifts in the laws of the state. The right-wing justices have tried out to rip off the precedents; from efforts to weaken abortion laws to abortion laws.
‌
‌Justice Jackson's statement during the confirmation hearing resurfaces how judges should make decisions — and how radical the current majority on the court has become. She says she doesn't believe in a living constitution. She says: “Although the Supreme Court is not bound in the sense of having to apply prior precedent, there is stare decisis in our system. There are now standards in the stare decisis world that the Supreme Court applies.” Judges should rule according to the precedent and if they tend to overturn it should have to meet certain criteria. 
‌
‌She makes a point when she says "Our obligation as judges are not to create policy. And if Congress has enacted a statute that establishes a cause of action or restricts causes of action, then as a general matter I don’t think that courts can oppose one.” 
‌
‌We cannot forget the history, the roots and causes of the laws; if the situation deems one then it is possible for a change. But it doesn't mean if you have the majority you can rule whatever is in your favour.
‌
‌While putting up so many laws and changes have even pondered that, by their logic, future justices can easily dispense with their decisions? Jackson’s confirmation hearing has implied beyond any doubt that she understands the role of the judiciary.
