International Community in Afghanistan continues...

Since it was unclear whether the “global reach” qualification applied to the president’s demands on other nations, the potential for US intrusion into what many countries had considered their own businesss was vast. Many regimes had managed to maintain a precarious hold over power by allowing groups, more militant than they could afford to be, to support terrorist activities in other venues. Familiar examples include terrorists operating from Pakistan or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir against India, and Arab support for Palestinian terrorism in Israel or the occupied territories. 

The Organization of the Islamic Conference revealed its concern with the potential reach of the New Bush Doctrine in an 11 October 2001 statement. It “strongly condemned the terrorist attacks that caused the deaths of a great number of innocent people,” and affirmed that “those acts are diametrically opposed to the religion and teachings of Islam, which prescribe the unjust taking of a human life,” but insisted on “the need to distinguish terrorism practiced by groups and individuals from the national resistance of peoples for liberation from occupation and colonialism.”

Although the Taleban was quick to react and Abdul Hai Mutmaen, a spokesman for the Taleban from Kandahar, denied Osama’s alleged involvement in masterminding the attacks. He vehemently argued that the Taleban did not have the resource to carry out such an operation and it could be the work of a government or internal enemies of the US.

However, such statements failed to convince the US and they believed that Osama had information and capabilities to acquire chemical, biological, radiological and even nuclear weapons to use on American targets. The US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, declared that the US was preparing for a protracted conflict and this would have a multi-faceted dimension – diplomatic, military, intelligence and law enforcement.
