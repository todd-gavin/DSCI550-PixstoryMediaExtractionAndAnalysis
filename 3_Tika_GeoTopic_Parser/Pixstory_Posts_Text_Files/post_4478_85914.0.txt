📍We spoke with three women there: 

-Savitri, who was 39 years old and had worked at the petrolpump for 15 years and was married; 

-Kuldeep Kaur, who was 24 years old and had worked at the petrolpump for four years and lives in Moti Bagh; and 

-Sonam, who was 25 years old and had worked at the petrolpump for four years and was married. 

📍We inquired as to how proud you are of your work. 
-"We are really pleased of what we do to feed our family," they remarked, expressing their enthusiasm for their work. 

📍How supportive is your family of your decision to work at the gas station? 
-"Our relatives never stood in our way; they always encouraged us to work here."

📍Does this petrolpump serve the women 24 hours a day, seven days a week? 
-“They said No”. They must work in shifts, with the last shift ending at 10 p.m., after which men manage the petrolpump. 

📍How do you celebrate International Women's Day? What are your plans for today? 
-"For us, every day is Women's Day." They don't wear their uniforms on duty on International Women's Day, the men do their work, celebrate it, and get to eat their favourite food. 

📍Have you ever felt insulted while working at a gas station? Have you ever been treated unfairly by a customer? 
-"No, everyone treats us equally, people respect us, and our customers are quite kind.

📍 Is it safe for women to work in this environment? 
"Yes, it is safe for us to work here; there hasn't been a single incident yet." We're completely protected here."
