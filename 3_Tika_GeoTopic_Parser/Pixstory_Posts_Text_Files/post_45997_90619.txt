We all struggle sometimes with our emotions Especially when it comes to our loved ones our protectiveness wins over our rational side We do or speak some things in this heat of the moment that we might later regret The same happened with Will Smith during Oscars However the emotions can explain his behaviour not justify it We all look upto celebrities as our role models and the way they conduct themselves in public especially in an event like Oscars sets an example for the common folks like us Furthermore the unfortunate incident adversely affected the reputation of both Chris and Will I believe there were certain other ways in which the situation could have been handled without any degree of violence But at the same time we forget that celebrities are just as human as us and they feel the same emotions as us when it comes to our loved ones Mr Smith is an impeccable gentleman and this was an unfortunate experience from which I am sure both parties will learn and set an example for creating a positive environment and kinder attitude towards our fellow human beings
