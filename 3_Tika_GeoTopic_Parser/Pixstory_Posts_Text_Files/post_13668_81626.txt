A study by the International Organization for Child Protection shows that one million children in Afghanistan have been forced to work due to declining family incomes According to the organization Afghanistan is not facing a food famine but families have lost the ability to buy food According to Al Jazeera a British survey of families in seven provinces in Afghanistan shows that of Afghans have experienced a sharp drop in income since the fall of the previous government One third of these families say they lost more than half of their income after the Taliban returned to power Eighteen percent told the agency they had no choice but to send their children to market In addition to declining incomes rising food prices due to the economic crisis have had a negative impact on these families the study said While percent said they borrowed to buy food percent said they relied on charities or had to beg for food Chris Nimandi director of the Afghanistan Child Protection Institute said he had never seen such a dire situation in Afghanistan before Every day we treat seriously ill children who may have eaten nothing but dry bread over the past few months he said Nimandi added The problem is not the lack of food The market is full of groceries But children are starving because their parents can not afford to buy food
