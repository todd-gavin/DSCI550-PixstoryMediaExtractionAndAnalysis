"Congress crossed all limits during the first wave of the infection. During the first wave of Covid-19, you (Congress) gave free train tickets to migrant workers to leave Mumbai.

As a result, Covid spread rapidly in Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand.‚Äù https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-modi-speech-lok-sabha-congress-covid-migrants-inflation-top-quotes-7761280/ 

That's a direct quote from the PM in Lok Sabha on Monday. Is it true? Cast your mind back to March 24, 2020, when a surprise lockdown of the nation was announced, with just four hours' notice. For migrant workers, who were hundreds of miles away from home (and subsisting from meal-to-meal), this announcement was devastating. There was no provision made for them.

But it is not only the Govt's neglect that we have to contend with, it is the fact that the Prime Minister is unabashedly lying about the role that he had to play in "spreading infection" as he puts it.
