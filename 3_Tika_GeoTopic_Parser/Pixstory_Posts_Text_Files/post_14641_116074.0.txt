Overeating plays a primary role in weight gain, and therefore is a central focus of obesity research. 

The unsustainability of behavioral weight loss therapy demands better understanding of the motives to overeat.

The view that overconsumption is the product of dysregulation of hedonic, metabolic/homeostatic, and inhibitory systems gives a fuller, more accurate portrayal of the behavior. 

While eating motivation for lean individuals can be considered largely under hypothalamic control, recent research shows that reward-related circuitry and vulnerability towards stress outside of homeostatic control play a key role in overeating. 

Early theories of appetite focused primarily on hypothalamic control of appetite, while more recent models incorporate incentive salience addiction-like mechanisms, the role of stress, and peripheral appetite related hormones.
