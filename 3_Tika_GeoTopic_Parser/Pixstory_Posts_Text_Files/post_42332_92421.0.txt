Just watched a new movie of Abhishek Bachchan “Dasvi” and I must say, the movie selection of the actor is getting stronger and stronger day by day.

“Dasvi” is a story of the Chief Minister of India’s fictional state Harit Pradesh and just after the scene we got to know that he has to go to jail because he was found guilty in a scam.

Here, Abhishek Bachchan is playing the role of Chief Minister, Ganga Ram Chaudhary, his wife’s role is played by Nimrat Kaur and her character name is Bimla Devi Chaudhary, and last but not the least, the character of the jail superintendent is played by Yami Gautam and her character name is Jyoti Deswal.

When Ganga Ram Chaudhary goes to jail, at first he is treated like a King in jail, he doesn’t have to do any work but one day when Jyoti Deswal comes to this jail after her transfer then everything changes for Ganga Ram Chaudhary.

Now his tantrums are not working in the jail and to live in the jail he has to work also. He tried every trick that can help him not to work but every time he got caught by Jyoti.

On the other hand, the wife of Ganga Ram Chaudhary starts enjoying her powers as the Chief Minister and in the jail, Ganga Ram Chaudhary decided to study and complete his 10th class because a person who is studying in the jail doesn’t have to work.

The rest of the story is focused on, Will Ganga Ram Chaudhary will complete his 10th class, Will he become the next Chief Minister and Will the relationship between Ganga and Jyoti be good or not?

The acting of all the actors is good, the story of the movie is brave but the first 30 minutes of the movie will test your patience but after that movie will flow and become likable.

You can watch the movie on Netflix and Jio Cinema. The runtime of the movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes.
