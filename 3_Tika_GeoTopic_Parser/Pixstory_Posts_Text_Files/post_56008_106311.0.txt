Angela Richardson said that she voted against the Prime Minister in this week's no-confidence vote no-confidence lives he has lost public trust.

Angela Richardson won at Guildford in 2019, beating her predecessor Anne Milton, who ran as an independent after resigning from the party over Brexit.

Ms Richardson told BBC Radio Surrey she thought Mr Johnson could be gone by autumn.

She said she voted against him because of "character, not policies".

"This has always been about what I see as standards in public life," she said.


"It's, about being honest with people, because you need to have people's trust to be able toward difficult things, and we are in difficult, choppy waters at the moment."

Ms Richardson said people will be said to do difficult things again in future, hence trust in government was significant. 

"I still feel very aggrieved that Allegra Stratton is the only person who has resigned and shown the sort of dignity that we expect in public life," she added.

Ms Richardson said regardless of his victory in the vote, the Prime Minister faces a risky future.
If he doesn't resign, this will go on and on and important things will not be addressed.
