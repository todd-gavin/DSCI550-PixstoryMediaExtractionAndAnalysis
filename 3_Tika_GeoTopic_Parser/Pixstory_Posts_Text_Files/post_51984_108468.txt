The Australian team insist they didn t err by going without a frontline leg spinner after weathering a six wicket defeat by a record breaking Sri Lanka stand in Colombo Australia looked in the box seat after Travis Head helped them to on a slow wicket before the hosts were barely troubled completing their pursuit with nine balls to spare on Sunday Pathum Nissanka hit his maiden ODI century with in the chase while Kusal Mendis managed in a run second wicket stand between the pair before retiring hurt with cramp That helped Sri Lanka to their biggest ever chase against Australia as they went up in the five match series with back to back wins over the tourists for the first time in years However beyond this bilateral series bigger questions continue to remain around Australia s bowling structure ahead of next year s World Cup in India With Adam Zampa back home on paternity leave Australia decided not to play Mitchell Swepson They were also not helped by a dewy surface at night after initially winning the toss and batting as the pitch sped up and turned less in the second innings Matthew Kuhnemann from overs and Glenn Maxwell were left as Australia s chief spinners with Cameron Green off five overs preferred as a pace bowling all rounder ahead of Swepson Where the Sri Lankans were able to get great purchase out of their wrist spinner Jeffrey Vanderlay and his return of the tourists were forced to turn to Marnus Labuschagne for seven overs of leg breaks You can always look back at a lot of decisions and wonder what was the right one captain Aaron Finch said We still felt that was the right combination to go for on this wicket with how slow it looked You saw in the first half of the game it was very stoppy and turned quite a bit We thought it would continue to do that but it played a bit better under lights
