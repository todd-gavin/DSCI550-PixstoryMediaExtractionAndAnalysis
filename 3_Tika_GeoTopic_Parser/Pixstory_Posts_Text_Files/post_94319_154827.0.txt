Team India have been off to a horrible start in the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup that kicked last night at the Kalinga Stadium when team India took on the USA. The mighty USA gave India a 8-0 thrashing and although fans had expected a defeat, this was an unbelievably huge margin. 
Despite winning the match by such a huge margin, team USA head coach Natalia Astrain was pretty humble in the Post-match conference. Upon being asked whether she had anticipated a big win in the opening match against India, she said “Well, the objective was the start the tournament strongly. It is important to send the message that we are here and we want to win the tournament. It was really important to start this way. But we had in front of us India, who are the hosts of the tournament.” 
Complimenting the Indian team, Natalia said, “I think the opponent was really organised. They really never gave up. It was very beautiful to play against them because they continued all the 90 minutes working and working. You can obviously see the score like 8-0, but it is important to recognise how good India played. This I think is the part that I take away from the game - not only the score, It is the good job that India did during the game as well. They challenged us in a good way”. 
The manager was also asked how she decided to keep her team motivated and focused after such a huge victory. 
To that, she replied, "Well, in this case the players that are in the roster are very humble. They wanted to win of course but always respect the opponent. We know that we have the next game. Our objective is to go little by little and step by step. They are very competitive but at the same time I believe that they are very humble. No one will think that this is easy and I can promise you that tomorrow in the recovery practice, some of them they will ask to continue playing."
USA will now face Brazil on 14th October in their next match.
