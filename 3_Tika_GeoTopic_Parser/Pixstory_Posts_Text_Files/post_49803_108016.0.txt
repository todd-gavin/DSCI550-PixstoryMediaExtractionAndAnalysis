Texas Senator John Cornyn, negotiator for what would be the US Senate's first gun control bill in a generation has walked out of talks with Democrats.

He had played a pivotal role in drafting the framework of a proposed firearms bill following mass shootings in Texas and New York.

Leaving Washington, he said: "I'm through talking." The plans include difficult checks for buyers under the age of 21 and cracking down on illegal gun purchases.

Recent attempts to tighten gun laws in the US - which has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's affluent nations - have failed to get the required backing in Congress.

But Mr. Cornyn's walk-out has placed a concern mark on the legislation's future. Axios, a political outlet, reported earlier on Thursday that conservative colleagues of the Texas senator are frustrated at his handling of the talks and want time to evaluate the text of any proposal before it is introduced to the chamber floor.

The legislative window to pass a new law is dwindling as November's mid-term elections loom, but the lead Democratic negotiator said he was still optimistic the bill could go to a vote next week.

A bipartisan group of senators has been struggling to draft the text of a bill for lawmakers to vote on before they leave for a two-week 4 July recess.

But they have become bogged down in recent days, as Democrats and Republicans disagree on provisions that would shred certain Americans of their guns.

Mr. Cornyn told reporters on Thursday that now is the time for action: "I don't know what they have in mind, but I'm through talking."

If both the Senate and House of Representatives can decide on a bill, it would go to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law.

President Biden has said the proposals are a step in the right direction but fall far short of what he called for.
