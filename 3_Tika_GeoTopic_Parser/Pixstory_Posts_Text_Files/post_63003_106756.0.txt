Gym, sports, TV, films and even religion.. take any of these interests. All of them come from a multi billion industry, all of them are addicting. People spend a significant amount of their time and money on these things. They're all the fruits of the same tree - capitalism. Then why is it only these self help books that are frowned upon.

There's no doubt in my mind that they're a capitalist scheme made to lure in customers, but so is every other thing. From a tooth paste to a car. The point is whether or not they help you. Whether spending all that money on that toothpaste is worth it.

Similar is the case with these self help books. What matters is if they work for you and they do work for some people. I don't see the problem there to be honest. Even reading any other genre of book is same. What's the difference between reading a self help book and reading a romance book? You're paying for the both of them and you're enjoying them too. People develop dependency on romance books, music, gym and even real people who they don't even know, like celebrities. I think self help books is a much better form of addiction than drugs or celebrity obsessions lol.
