As part of a new drive toward high-risk, high-impact science, NASA has announced that it will launch a study of UFOs, a topic that has long piqued the public's interest. 

AlJazeera reported that on Thursday, NASA announced that an independent team would investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), with a focus on identifying available data, gathering more data, and analysing the findings to increase scientific understanding of the sightings. 

Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's science mission commander, acknowledged that the traditional scientific community may view NASA's involvement in the contentious topic as "sort of selling out," but he strongly disagrees.

“We are not shying away from reputational risk,” Zurbuchen said during a National Academy of Sciences webcast. “Our strong belief is that the biggest challenge of these phenomena is that it’s a data-poor field.”

“Over the decades, NASA has answered the call to tackle some of the most perplexing mysteries we know of, and this is no different,” Daniel Evans, the NASA scientist responsible for coordinating the study, told reporters on a call.

The announcement comes as the field of UFO study, once a poorly-regarded research backwater, is gaining more mainstream traction.
