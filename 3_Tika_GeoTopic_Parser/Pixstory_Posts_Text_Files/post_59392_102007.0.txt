For those of who donâ€™t know Friends is an American Sitcom set in the late 1900s. It revolves around the lives of 6 friends living in Manhattan.
So why is Friends so popular?
Well for starters all the 6 characters in Friends have a different personality and no matter what you will be able to relate to at least one of them.
Not only this, but it connects to every other problem that is faced by person in their 20s.
