For the first time since Dwight Howard in 2004, the Orlando Magic won the NBA draught lottery Tuesday night, landing the No. 1 overall pick. 

US News reported that the Magic have now won the lottery four times, including in 1992 and 1993, when they took Shaquille O'Neal and subsequently traded Chris Webber's rights for Penny Hardaway. 

With a 22-60 record, Orlando finished last in the Eastern Conference and missed the playoffs for the eighth time in ten years. They did, however, win big in the lottery, where they had a 14% chance of winning.

The most likely prospects to be selected first are Duke's Paolo Banchero, Gonzaga's Chet Holmgren, Purdue's Jaden Ivey, and Auburn's Jabari Smith. The draught will take place in New York on June 23. 

Oklahoma City was selected second, ahead of Houston and Sacramento. 

Detroit is ranked fifth, followed by Indiana, Portland, New Orleans, and Washington. New York, Oklahoma City, Charlotte, and Cleveland are the remaining lottery winners.
