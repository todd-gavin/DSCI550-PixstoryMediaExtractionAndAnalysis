Manchester United played a goalless draw against Newcastle in the 11th matchday of Premier League.Eric Ten Hag's side were held aback by Newcastle at home in an intense match. The Red Devils are now placed 5th on the table with 16 points in 9 matches. Newcastle on the other hand also remain strong contenders to be within the top 5 as they're currently placed 6th just below United with 15 points in 10 matches. 
The match had several more significant moments than what shall be merely depicted by the scoreline alone.
Newcastle were the first to create chances with their arguably better attempts at goal than United. The visitors came close to opening the scoring when Kieran Trippier's free kick found Joelinton who hit the woodwork with vicious headers twice in succession. Earlier Wilson too had an appeal for a penalty being ignored by the referee after the Forward received a heavy challenge from Varane inside the box.
United however seemed to be brave as they were better on the ball right from the arly minutes of the first half. The home side found the back of the net 3 minutes into the first half which was chopped of by the referee. Ronaldo who recieved a pass from Antony scored from close range only to be flagged offside. Ronaldo was involved in another argument with the ref when he seemed to take the ball away from Pope after a mix up and scored to the objection of the referee and earned himself a yellow card. 
Sancho was brought down by Longstaff in the box making the United players appeal for a penalty which wasn't enough to convince the referee. The game ended in a goalless draw much to the disappointment of the home side who had put on a much improved display in the second half. Their next encounter in the premier league will be against Tottenham. Newcastle meanwhile will face  Everton next weekend.
