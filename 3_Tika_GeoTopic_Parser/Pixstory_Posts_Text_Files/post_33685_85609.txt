Speaking to Sky after the match in Genoa Empoli Aurelio Andreazzoli commented on the point earned in Marassi During the presentation there was the idea of playing this match we knew the opponents and only by putting ourselves on their level could we emerge unscathed The boys were good, yes they put yourself in the real condition Not a match that I like but I really liked it because it was a real battle without any improprieties it was good the referee used the same yardstick and went in favor of the match In some moments the boys exalted me I don&#39;t think we are already safe Ce we hope so but there are few points We have overcome a great obstacle but before claiming victory we must run for it We must not delude ourselves otherwise it would serve to say that the white hair I have was useless With the boys I used a term that I cannot repeat but it was aimed to enjoyment I really liked today&#39;s match football is played for the result Then the result if you achieve it with aesthetics is beautiful if you achieve it with a couple of tackles it&#39;s ok anyway I complimented the boys for attitude and point the comparison was with a team that I have to congratulate The coach has given a defined structure that is not aesthetic but substantial They are very difficult to deal with
