My Years in the Supreme Court continues During the period when there was no Vice Chancellor I acted as a de facto Vice Chancellor as desired by the members of the Executive Council The work was carried on for about seven months in this way when eventually Dr Mahajani was appointed to this post After some time I found it quite inconvenient to attend meetings of the Executive Council and requested the President to relieve me of this duty and to appoint Mr Justice Bhagwati of the Supreme Court in my place The President agreed and I ceased to be a member of the Executive Council of the Delhi University In I was able to improve my garden in Upper Dharamsala above the Cantonment The Zamindars of village Nadi agreed to let me dig a small channel connecting my motor pump with the water of the Nala running through the village I installed the pump and was given electric power by the Hydroelectric Department My house was also now electrified When I was spending the summer of in my Upper Dharamsala house I got a pathesic letter from Bakshi Tek Chand in whose house I resided during my school and college life in Lahore and who was not only a leading lawyer but also one of the ablest Judges of the Lahore High Court He later became a Member of Parlia Parliament and as a member of various sub Committees contributed largely to the making of the Constitution of India Owing to blood pressure his health had deteriorated He was now spending his summer in Dalhousie from where he wrote to me saying that whenever he met a friend he thought he would not meet him again After writing this letter he got a paralytic stroke In his condition became very much worse and he is confined to his bed in that condition for the last five years It is very sad to see him in the state of helplessness and misery To be continued
