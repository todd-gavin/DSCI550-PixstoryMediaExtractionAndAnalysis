Victoria's Secret is celebrating Mother's Day with a very special and adorable campaign. The photoshoot, which featured multiple sets of famous guardians, was especially noteworthy because Brooke Shields' 15-year-old daughter Grier Henchy is following in her mother's modelling footsteps.

The mother and daughter look so similar while posing in sleek pyjamas for a black-and-white photograph.

In one photograph, the couple sits close together, their heads touching.

Brooke wrote on Instagram, sharing a video from the photoshoot, "I am overjoyed to be a part of Victoria's Secret Mother's Day Campaign this year." It was a dream come true to be able to shoot this campaign with my daughter and highlight the beauty of our relationship. To be among such dynamic women and their families, and to represent the brand's commitment to celebrating all women, is a true honour."
