The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.

The Big Idea
Parents who travel with their kids to compete in regional sports tournaments tend to be too focused on the competition to turn them into family vacations and spend like tourists, according to our recently published research. This is bad news to the many communities that spend millions of dollars on state-of-the-art sports facilities to host such tournaments in hopes of recouping the costs in increased economic activity.

For our study, we conducted in-depth interviews with 33 parents of children who play youth sports, whether itâ€™s baseball, soccer or swimming. The parents lived in Florida and Indiana, and we found them by reaching out to local sports clubs and event venues. We asked them questions about how they planned for out-of-town sports competitions, the activities they engaged in while there and what drives those decisions.

Overall, we found that parents said they were just too busy with the sporting event and supporting their children to do anything else. In the interviews, the typical youth sports trip was described as within driving distance of home, one to two nights in duration and mostly spent at the athletic venue.
