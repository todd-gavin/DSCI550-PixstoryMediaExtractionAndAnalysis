Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James made some NBA history on Saturday night With his point production against the Washington Wizards James passed Karl Malone to move up to second on the league s all time scoring list Malone scored points over the course of his career Now the only player that has scored more points than James in league history is Kareem Abdul Jabbar Entering the evening James needed points to pass Malone and he recorded them all in the first half James finished the game with points rebounds and six assists Ultimately though his production wasn t enough as the Lakers fell to the Wizards Leading up to the feat James acknowledged some similarities between him and Malone especially in the way that they both took excellent care of their bodies over the course of their respective careers Guys that just took care of their bodies for the majority of their career and always wanted to be available to their teammates James said The most important leadership for you is to try to be available as much as possible on the floor I think myself and him we always just tried to be in uniform and make plays and stay in condition and try to stay healthy stay injury free as much as you can and also be productive on the floor so yeah absolutely This is the second time this month that James has rewritten the history books Earlier this week he became the first player in league history to notch career points rebounds and assists James now needs less than points to pass Abdul Jabbar to become the league s all time leading scorer As long as he remains relatively healthy and doesn t abruptly retire it s almost a certainty that he will indeed eventually claim the top spot In the meantime he doesn t plan to focus on it
