Jude Bellingham- The Golden Goose Amongst the Big Sharks
Jude Bellingham is a wanted man. Manchester United made a failed attempt to get the former ex-Birmingham City when Ole Gunnar Solskajer was at the helm. The versatile midfielder has been the talk of the town amongst big clubs like Man Utd, Liverpool, and Real Madrid - to name a few.
The reason he is most touted by other clubs is because, he can play in different positions in midfield, may it be as a defensive, attacking, right or left midfield position. He owns that position.
We have taken his 2021/22 season heatmap. We can see that he has been dominating in the left midfield. We can see that, where its bright yellow spot is where he had made most actions like passes, defensive contributions, and touches. However, he has been deployed on the right side of midfield too. 
We will see how big clubs can utilize him when his contract expires - i.e in June 2025.
Manchester United
Man Utd had a transfer window to forget. With them missing from the Champions League and seeing unrest in team spirit. The arrival of Erik Ten Hag didnâ€™t solve the issue as they missed on Erling Haland, who went to their cross-town rivals without even considering United.
Aurelien Tchouameni was recommended and he was on Erik Ten Hag's wishlist. But he went to Real Madrid in high profile transfer.
Darwin Nunez was courted by United but they backed off after Liverpool intervene and the prospect of playing in the Champions League turned his head.
Frenkie De Jong was one sought out man by ETH. ETH spent the whole summer trying to prise him away from Nou Camp. He missed out on very important targets to strengthen their other positions like striker, right-back, bringing another defender to partner Lisandro Martinez. It was in vain as he refused to play. 
Cody Gakpo was touted in the month-end of the transfer. It was either Antony or him. He was costing around 35-50 million. United went with Antony for 100 million.
