Barcelona's latest contract offers have been rejected by both midfielder Gavi and center-back Ronald Araujo, with the club growing increasingly anxious about the situation.

The teenage duo, who are regarded as present and future stars, have made it plain that they want to stay at Camp Nou and have already given Barcelona multiple opportunities to offer them adequate contracts.

In the instance of Araujo, the Uruguayan believes he is one of the team's most essential players, and he wants the money that comes with that position. He's willing to back down a little to help smooth things out, but Marca observes that a resolution remains a long way off.

Both players have now been offered new contracts three times, with Barcelona's suggested wage starting extremely low and gradually increasing as negotiations progressed, but neither player has accepted.

The bids have left the pair's agents unimpressed, given they come at a time when Barcelona has signed players in both of their positions - Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen.

Gavi and Araujo are adamant that they will not accept reduced salaries if Barcelona offers greater contracts to their new players, especially with so many clubs from throughout Europe showing interest.

Manchester United and Chelsea have both been linked with a move for Araujo, while Gavi has been linked with a move to Liverpool, however the young midfielder has rejected any negotiations with any other club, stating that his objective is to stay at Barcelona.

While this storey claims that Barcelona is confident about re-signing both, Catalunya Radio claims that there are serious concerns about Araujo's demands, which are considered excessive.

Barcelona is thought to have no plans to enhance their offer to Araujo at the moment, and a summer sale could be on the cards.
