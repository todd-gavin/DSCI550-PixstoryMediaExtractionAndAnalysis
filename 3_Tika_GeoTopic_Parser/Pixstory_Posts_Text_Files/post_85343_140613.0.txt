Kangana Ranaut declares Brahmastra a disaster.
The much anticipated film Brahmastra starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt in the lead roles, was released today. After the release Kanganu Ranaut took her Instagram story and slammed Karan Johar. The actor wrote," People like Karan Johar should be questioned for their conduct.He is more interested in everyone's sex life than in his films scripts. He self admittedly buys reviews, stars, qnd fake collection numbers and tickets. This time around he tried to ride Hinduism and south wave."
Kangana Ranaut did not even spare director Ayan Mukerji either and wrote," Everyone who called Ayan Mukerji a genuis should be jailed immediately..... He took 12 years to make this film,he replaced 14DOP's he shot for more than 400 days for this film and changed 85ADs and burnt 600 crores to ashes. Also tried to exploit religious sentiments by changing the film name from Jalaluddin Rumi to Shiva last minute, because of Bahubali success.... Such opportunists, such creativity deprived people, success starved greedy people if called genius then it's not manipulation but a well thought of strategy to call din ko raat and raat ko din..."
