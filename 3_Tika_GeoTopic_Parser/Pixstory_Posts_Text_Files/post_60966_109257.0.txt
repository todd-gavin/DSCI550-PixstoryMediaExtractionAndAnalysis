Weighing pomegranates, apples, mangos, and lemons in the swarming lanes of K.R market was hectic for this man. He seemed so focused on his work of picking, weighing, and packing fruits for the customers. Having small talks and bargaining with them to sell his produce for a good price. From far, it seems as though he is done with his work, but as he spots a camera, I see a wide,  genuine smile on his face. Something so small as clicking a picture could make someone's day so bright and jovial that it warms my soul.
