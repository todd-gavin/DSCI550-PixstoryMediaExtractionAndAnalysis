Who would not want to hear some words of praise for them?
Compliments always sparkle up one's mood and even evoke in people a sense of self-esteem and motivation.
But excess of anything could be harmful; whether it's your favourite food, hobby or anything, we need to balance everything we do.

And so is the case with praising children.
Parents are often imbued with love for their children, which makes them not think about the impact of the praise it can cause on their children's minds.
Putting in them a sense of narcissism which is futile.
In the USA, praising seems necessary; parents often think that complimenting their children would encourage them to do things with dedication and lead to a successful career. This is not entirely wrong, but self-esteem is not always about telling your kids that everything they do is perfect.
What would this do to your child?
Firstly, it will diminish their ability to think that they can make mistakes or do anything wrong; the notion that "I'm always right" would hover around their mind.
Moreover, children getting excessive praise would not take criticism positively. So instead of understanding one's point and bringing a change in their perception of work, they'll have a bad image for everyone who has not praised them.
Secondly, the notion of being always right and a perfect soul would make them highly narcissistic, which is definitely a bad trait to possess.

So parents should know what they choose to say in front of their children, even if it is about positively commending their work, it should have some constructed boundaries so that in pursuit of encouraging their children, parents don't forget to teach the role of criticism in their life.
