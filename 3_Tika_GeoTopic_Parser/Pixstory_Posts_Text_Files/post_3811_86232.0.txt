Parkash Singh Badal, the 94-year-old former Punjab Chief Minister and senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader, is the country's oldest contender in any election. He will run for the assembly seat in Lambi, his hometown. 

After 75 years in politics, Badal's lack of participation in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the announcement of his son, Sukhbir, as the face of the SAD-BSP alliance fueled suspicion that he would not run. The 94-year-old SAD patriarch, on the other hand, is contesting for the 13th time. He has only lost one election, in 1967, by a margin of 57 votes. Badal switched from Malout to Lambi on a SAD ticket in 1997, after previously contesting from Malout on a Congress ticket. He holds the record of being the CM five times, since 1997. In 2017, Badal defeated Amarinder Singh (Congress).
