Although schools are considered the stepping stone for success, honestly, they don't do much good for a child.
Education has become a business, focusing more on scaling that business for profit instead of looking at child growth.
There is not just a single reason to call the school a waste of time or money; there are many.
Though conventional believers won't accept it, it still makes sense.
Firstly, what schools teach is not the concrete skills a person would need when they leave school.
Moreover, no one actually remembers the battles of history and arithmetic problems when they leave school.
So, in the long run, school is not teaching students the skills to make their future.
Half of the things become futile once you're out of school.
Most importantly, students are compelled to read and learn things they aren't passionate about, which builds a sense of pressure in them, hindering their success.
If the school aims to provide education, then they definitely need to work on how they're delivering the education.
It shouldn't be the old, boring ways that eventually make the whole purpose useless; instead, it should be done more creatively.
