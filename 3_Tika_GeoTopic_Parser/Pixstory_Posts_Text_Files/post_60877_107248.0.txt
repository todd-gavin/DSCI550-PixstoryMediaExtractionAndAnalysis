I see advertisements related to Bali and Maldives after scrolling through a few travel accounts on my social media. Most (if not all) are aware that the digital footprints (user data) we leave on different social media platforms can be used to target us for advertisements and other purposes.

Privacy, cyberattacks, penetration of fake news have become major concerns of this digital era. That being said, we have more laws and regulations to install privacy safeguards and moderate user data on social media and the internet. However, government controls and laws can be misused because there's a thin line between regulation and censorship.

So, how do users express themselves freely without having to be concerned about privacy or censorship? How do users gain control of how their data is being used?

There's a lot of buzz about the revolutionary envisioned Web 3.0 that will supposedly decentralize the web and ensure that user data is owned only by the individuals and not businesses. There's also talks of emerging social media platforms and algorithms that would reduce digital footprints and ensure user privacy.

With the world becoming increasingly dependent on the internet and social media, privacy has become more and more of a concern now.

What's your opinion on this? Do you think it is really possible to be private on public platforms? Can emerging technology guarantee complete privacy?
