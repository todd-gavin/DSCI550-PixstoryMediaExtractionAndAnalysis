A legend in the Indian Premier League, veteran cricketer Suresh Raina went unsold during the two-dayÂ IPL auction 2022. It was a huge surprise for many fans, considering Raina's splendid performances for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) over the years.

CSK CEO Kasi Viswanath said, "Raina has been one of the most consistent performers for CSK for the last 12 years. Of course, it was very difficult for us, not to have Raina but at the same time, you should also understand that the team composition depends on the form and kind of team which any team would like to have".

During the IPL 2022 auction in Bengaluru, CSK purchased Deepak Chahar for a huge sum of Rs 14 crore, making him the most expensive Indian bowler in the tournament history.

The franchise also bought back the likes of Ambati Rayudu, Dwayne Bravo and Uthappa for Rs 6.75 crore, Rs 4.40 crore and Rs 2 crore, respectively.

The CSK CEO also seemed a bit disappointed at not being able to get back Faf du Plessis, who played a crucial role last season as Dhoni's team won the title. The South African was purchased by Royal Challengers Bangalore.
