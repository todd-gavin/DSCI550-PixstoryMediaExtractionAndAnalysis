Carlos Sainz is now the driver with the most points without winning a single race in F1.

Can this week’s race in Baku, Azerbaijan help him get rid of that unwanted statistic?
With the straight line speed of the Red Bulls and the 2km long main straight, it seems unlikely.
However, Baku is no stranger to unpredictable races and winners so there may be hope!

Let’s see!
