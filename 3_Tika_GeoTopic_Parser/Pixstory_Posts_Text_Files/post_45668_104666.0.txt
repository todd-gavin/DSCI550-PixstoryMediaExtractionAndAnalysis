The James Webb Space Telescope will give humanity its first peek at conditions on a "super-Earth" 50 light years away in the coming weeks, and NASA is ready for the worst. 

Phys said that the planet, known as 55 Cancri e, orbits so near to "its Sun-like star" that surface conditions could be akin to the biblical Hell: a realm that is constantly burning. 

According to NASA, 55 Cancri e is fewer than 1.5 million miles from its star, which is 1/25 the distance between very hot Mercury and our sun.

â€œWith surface temperatures far above the melting point of typical rock-forming minerals, the day side of the planet is thought to be covered in oceans of lava," NASA reported last week.

"Imagine if Earth were much, much closer to the Sun. So close that an entire year lasts only a few hours. So close that gravity has locked one hemisphere in permanent searing daylight and the other in endless darkness. So close that the oceans boil away, rocks begin to melt, and the clouds rain lava."

Nothing like it exists in our solar system, so this is a first for us!
