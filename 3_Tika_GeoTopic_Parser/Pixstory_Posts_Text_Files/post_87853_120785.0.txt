We have a lot of societal expectations
around being a mom-be the primary caregiver, the
nurturer, the feeder, the one to soothe and comfort

Dads, on the other hand, have historically been
conditioned to be providers and disciplinarians.
But family dynamics have changed since those norms were laid out.

And yet, we're still clinging to old roles in the home, as if all families consist of a primary caregiver (mom) and their partner, who takes a secondary role.

Here are a few practical tops to support your nursing partner!
