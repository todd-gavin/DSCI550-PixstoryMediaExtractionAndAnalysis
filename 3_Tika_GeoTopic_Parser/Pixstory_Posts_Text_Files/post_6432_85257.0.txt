I see a view of the world of which it once was. A world created to be of peace, love, and light towards each other. But now, itâ€™s became a world of greed and selfishness. People from ALL races are hurting from control and order. This world was created for second chances of being able to love one another on a higher frequency. Although, there is a war going on, continue to be light and love towards one another. 

Take a moment and look at this and ask yourself what do you see?
