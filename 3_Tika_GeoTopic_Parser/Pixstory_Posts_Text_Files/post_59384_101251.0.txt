Overthinking is a situation where one thinks about the uncertainty in future mostly something about which they can't do anything.
How to overcome it -
-> Try to understand that something you're overthinking about while not being able to do anything about it, that makes you go through that thing twice.
-> However, if it is something that you can do something about, then, make a plan of action and work on it.
-> You can also try to distract yourself. Something that works for me - I try to distract myself my making trendy instagram reels xD
-> Work on enhancing your self esteem. 
-> Do something nice for another person.
