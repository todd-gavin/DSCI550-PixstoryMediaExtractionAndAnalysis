Pregnancy is a beautiful process but it can only be the best of it when it is experienced wholeheartedly. 
Some pregnancies can be traumatising for the mother as it could be due to rape, abuse and violation of them and this definitely gives them a choice of abortion.Â  
But the accidential pregnancies sometimes forces women to become mothers half-hearted and even if she wouldn't want to keep the child, her external pressures makes her become a mother. 
Isn't that her choice as well?, when she isn't ready or is maybe at the peak of her career at that time she wouldn't want to keep the baby. 
It's her freedom of choice and maybe she would still want to or maybe don't prefer a child for her life, which is totally upto her. 
There would be opinions from one's support systems, but the final decision stands totally on her and no one has the right to intrude into it when she has made up her mind. 
But sadly, in most of the households some are forced to the accidential pregnancies and families wouldn't think or would not even ask her opinion on it, because it is presumed to be a happy news. But it's not a happy news for all and everyone should realize that and accept it. 
And as a quote says "Better be not a parent, than a bad parent".
