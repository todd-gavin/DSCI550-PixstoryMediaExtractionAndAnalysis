Cristiano Ronaldo

Cristiano came to Manchester with big expectations, which he revealed in an interview, that "i didn't come to finish 6th or 7th". United started the season as runners up in the Premier League, runners up in the Europa league, Semi finalists in league cup and quarter finalists in FA cup. In a disastrous season, they finished in the premier league at 6th, went out of Champions league in Round of 16, FA cup fourth round and League cup third round. Ronaldo finished the season without any trophies, with club or individually.

As Ronaldo was competing in a comparatively tougher league than Messi, he received more critical acclaim during the season. Also, we have seen unhappy images of Messi throughout the season, and Ronaldo thinking about leaving the club, we can conclude both stars had a disappointing season in sum.
