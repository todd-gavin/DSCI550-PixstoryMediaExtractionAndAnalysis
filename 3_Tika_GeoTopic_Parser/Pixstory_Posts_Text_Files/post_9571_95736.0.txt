External Actors in the Afghan Problem continues....

Shia Hizb-e-Wahdat was aligned with Rabbani. Hekhmatyar made the history by being the only Prime Minister in the world history who rather than coming to the capital to assume his post, preferred to encamp in the city suburb and periodically shell his capital with barrages of rockets resulting in much deaths and devastation. The former Communist Pashtun defence minister, General Shahnawaz Tanai had earlier defected to Hekhmatyar. Later, Pashtun supporters of Najibullah switched their allegiance to Hekhmatyar. 

The ethnic and regional polarization reached its culmination with the defection of Khalqi Sarandoy militia to Hekhmatyar ranks. In 1994, Hekhmatyar joined hands with Dostum to oust Masud from Kabul. Hizb-e-Wahdat conveniently dumped Rabbani-Masud government and jumped on to the Dostum-Hekhmatyar bandwagon. By that time, thoroughly disgusted by the fratricidal war, Pakistan was wooing the Taleban in the south. Hekhmatyar, furious of being unceremoniously dumped by Pakistan, did a somersault and joined Rabbani and came to Kabul in June 1996 to assume his post of Prime Minister. Later, when the Taleban came to the Kabul doors, he left for Iran. Nangarhar Shura led by Haji Abdul Qadeer, governed the three eastern provinces. In an ambush, 70 of the key commanders of Shura were killed and few hours later, the Taleban stormed Jalalabad. In the north, in September 1997, a four-way duel was going on between militias belonging to Dostum, Abdul Malik, Masud and Hizb-e-Wahdat in Mazar Sharif. The northern seesaw of battles ended when the Taleban pacified the region with only remnants of resistance in small pockets.
