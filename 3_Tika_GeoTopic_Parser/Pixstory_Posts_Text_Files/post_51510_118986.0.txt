The Sky Sports reporter moved onto asking Edu what interaction he had with the owners on last Wednesday.

He replied: "Not only with the spending because it's unfair to link the owners just with the spending. They are very much important and it is sometimes unfair if people have some doubts about our owners.

"They are really engaged, they're really supportive and they're really present in the club which makes us feel really comfortable."

How forward-thinking are you?


"We have a plan really in place, so we are probably in the middle of our project.

"We need to keep improving the quality in the squad. We have to make important decisions to make our squad better every year, so we have to improve, improve and improve.

"Here we have to always think about winning. I think the club was born to win things because of the size of this club and that we have to always think about winning. Every single year we have to be better, better and better."

The interview was concluded with Edu saying: "With all my respect, even being realistic, I cannot think less than winning things" 

Edu is set for a thrilling season for Arsenal after bolstering the squad massively from last season with the added excitement of targeting some kind silverware and achieving the feat in due course.
