Warm greetings!
This is Jiya Gahlot, a student of Bharati College, University of Delhi. I am an aspiring writer.
I reside in Delhi currently.
I contributed to the the Digital Nawabi event writing. Participating in these events is a pleasant experience and I hope that my writings would reach the most audience. These events move me to write everyday and I am able to produce better content out of my mind. This is so beneficial. 
About the team, SPC Media Official, they are absolutely amazing. They have been supportive and encouraging us since the day I started participating. I hope they continue doing the awesome work and supporting writers like me.
About my achievements, I have won three or four challenges held by SPC media. In my college, I have been participating in various writing competitions. Also I have secured the runner up positions in story writing competitions in my school.

Once again, thank you for the opportunity.
