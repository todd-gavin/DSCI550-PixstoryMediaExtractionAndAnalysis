Keeping houseplants doesn't only affect the home decor; it also sparkles the ambience and brings positive vibes.
There are many health benefits of keeping houseplants. 
There's no such place where houseplants can't be kept; from bedrooms to even bathrooms, houseplants can enliven the look of the house.

Many studies have shown that keeping indoor plants can have multiple health benefits; they offer psychological and physical well-being.

They can improve your mood by giving a natural look to the room and making you feel connected with nature.
Indoor plants improve air quality in other ways as well. For example, plants release water vapour into the air, increasing humidity, which can help improve respiratory and skin health by offsetting the drying effects of heating systems. This can significantly benefit those with respiratory issues, headaches, and allergies.

Plants also increase oxygen levels in the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen during photosynthesis.
Just having plants around you will offer psychological benefits, but caring for your plants can also help decrease stress and anxiety. So next time you're watering your plants, slow down, take a few deep breaths, and focus on what you're doing.
