#2 Dennis Bergkamp
His 10 years at Arsenal were full of goals, Bergkamp might not have an incredible pace, but the player had immense knowledge of scoring goals, his off-the-ball movements, and being in the right place. He was technically gifted and scored a plethora of goals. 
Dennis Bergkamp was one of the greatest players, Thierry Henry, in their history; his 10 years at the club saw him win 10 trophies and make 423 appearances, where he scored 120 goals for the Gunners. 
#1 Thierry Henry
And we conclude the list with one of the finest players in Arsenal history, Thierry Henry. He should be on top because of what he provided to the Gunners. Simply genius, he scored goals for fun; Henry might have played in the left wing, but when he was shifted to the false nine positions, Thierry Henry scored goals for fun and did not stop. 
Arsenal still searches for a striker like him, whose electrifying pace had defenders on the floor. He was quick and agile; Henry appeared in 370 games for Arsenal and struck 226 goals for them before leaving for Barcelona.
