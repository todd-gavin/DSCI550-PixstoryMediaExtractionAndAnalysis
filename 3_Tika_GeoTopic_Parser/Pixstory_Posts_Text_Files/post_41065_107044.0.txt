Another chapter has been added to Disney's saga with Gulf censors. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio's latest film, Buzz Lightyear, has been banned in a number of Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 

According to THR, the decision was influenced by Pixar's Toy Story prequel spinoff's inclusion of a same-gender kiss. 

The scene, which features the female character Hawthorne (voiced by Uzo Aduba) and her partner, was originally cut from the film but was reinstated after the uproar over a statement from Pixar employees alleging that Disney had been censoring "overtly gay affection" and Disney CEO Bob Chapek's handling of Florida's "Don't Say Gay" bill.

Due to "violation of the country's media content guidelines," the UAE's Media Regulatory Office said on June 13 that the film, which was set to be released on June 16, would not be licenced for public viewing. 

Lightyear joins a long list of famous Disney films that have experienced censorship in Gulf countries because of scenes including LGBTQ references or topics, which frequently fall foul of censors for theatrical release due to homosexuality being outlawed in the region.
