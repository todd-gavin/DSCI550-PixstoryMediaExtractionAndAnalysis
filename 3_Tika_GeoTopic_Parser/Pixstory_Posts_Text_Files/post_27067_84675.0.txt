Lindsay Lohan (Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) is expanding on her relationship with Netflix, with a deal for two more original films in which she’ll star, the streamer announced today.

Lohan’s deal comes following her attachment to Falling for Christmas, a holiday rom-com that is slated to debut on Netflix later this year. In it, she plays a newly engaged, spoiled hotel heiress who gets into a skiing accident, suffers from total amnesia and finds herself in the care of a handsome, blue-collar lodge owner (Chord Overstreet) and his precocious daughter in the days leading up to Christmas.
