Delusions and hallucinations are similar but also have some significant differences Both are often caused by the same mental illnesses like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder both involve distortions in reality A hallucination is anything that is sensed heard seen felt or even smelled that is not real The person experiencing a hallucination may believe that it is real and everything about the vision sound voice or other sensation seems very real and both can occur even in the absence of mental illness A delusion is a belief that is obviously false and yet the individual experiencing it thinks it is absolutely true A delusion is not a belief that is false because of a person s intelligence education culture religion or other similar factor instead it is false because it of some abnormality in the individual s thinking Sometimes a person will experience a recurring theme in their delusions over a period which makes them seem more convincing to the individual experiencing them Hallucinations are sometimes categorized as secondary delusions if they involve having a false belief in the voice they are hearing or other sensation they are experiencing
