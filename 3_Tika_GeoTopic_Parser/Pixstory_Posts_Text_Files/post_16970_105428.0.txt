Kartik Aaryan is often referred to as the king of the masses after his hits Pyaar Ka Punchnama, its sequel and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety. However, in a recent interview with RJ Siddharth Kannan, Kartik revealed that he feels he still has a long way to go in his career before he can justify any such title. When Siddharth said that before him only Shah Rukh Khan enjoyed such titles, Kartik revealed that whenever he gets these titles he feels good. But, he does not want to accept the term king as he feels that it is too early to say that. Jokingly, the actor added, “Maybe I’ll take prince. I think I’m just happy with all the love.” He mentioned the massive crowds waiting for him at the mall just to see him, and stated that that feeling was inexplicable. “This feeling is more than any title,” he said.
