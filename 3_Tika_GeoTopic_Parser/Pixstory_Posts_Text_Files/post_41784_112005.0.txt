As Australia advanced in their match against Sri Lanka in Galle, Usman Khawaja criticised the team's "bull crap" coaching in the past. 

Fox Sports reported that after a chaotic first day, Australia turned things around to set up their crushing 10-wicket victory. 

In his finest form of his career, Khawaja scored a quick 71 while rising all-rounder Cameron Green scored 77 to highlight his tremendous skill. 

While Alex Carey's unorthodox performance presented Australia's cricketers in a different light and at the same time demonstrated how things have evolved since the introduction of T20 cricket in the mid-2000s, he came just short of a half-century (45 off 47).

Speaking at stumps on day two, Khawaja described the bulk of the Australian coaching manual as outdated, calling it “bull crap”.

“The way the guys have played and how we talk about the game and playing in the subcontinent’s changed a lot since I started playing for the Australian cricket team,” he said.

In particular, Khawaja, who has been a revelation at the top of the order and has stunned observers with his plan and technique, highlighted Carey’s fine work and desire to sweep and also reflected on Matthew Hayden’s breakout campaign in 2001, where he swept India to death.
