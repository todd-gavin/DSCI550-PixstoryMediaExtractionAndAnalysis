Artist: Divyanan Singh

The painting in the middle, Fire And Smoke, caught my eye from the moment I saw it for the first time. Not entirely sure, why I was so attracted to it.

I found many more beautiful pieces by the artist at this exhibition but I still found myself coming back to stare at this work for longer.

Where there’s fire, there’s always smoke.
