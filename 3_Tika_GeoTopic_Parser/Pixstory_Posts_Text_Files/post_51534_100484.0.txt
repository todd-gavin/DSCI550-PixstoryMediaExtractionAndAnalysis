Carlo Ancelotti faced the press after Laliga Champions Real Madrid drew a 1-1 draw with relegation contenders Cadiz FC. 

We take a look at what the Italian manager said:

SUMMARISING THE GAME

Ancelotti made a fair summary of the game where he dropped a few key players while giving chance to some bench-warmers. Ancelotti said:"It was a very even match and intense for both the teams. We did what we needed to do and they didn't cause us any problems. Carvajal and Ceballos have returned. 

Cadiz's draw with Real Madrid sees them tumble down in a relegation spot and their uncertain fate will be discovered in the final matchday of the season, even in which they have to rely on other games for their survival in the top-flight for next season.

"In order to respect the opposition and the fans we had to play our game and that's what we did. We didn't have the focus and motivation they had, though we made it a competitive game. We need to back that up with another high-intensity game in our stadium. We've prepared everything well" the Italian said.

NACHO'S PURPLE PATCH

Ancelotti voiced his opinion on Nacho's good run of form being a second choice defender:

"There are always doubts about Nacho in every game because we have a squad with more than eleven players available. There're always doubts about the starting line-up.

ON VALVERDE AND RODRYGO IN THE UCL FINAL

In his last press conference after the 6-0 rout in Levante, Ancelotti informed that both Valverde and Rodrygo will play in the upcoming UCL Final, the press asked him for some more information on whether they will start the game or not.

Here's what Ancelotti said:" Yes, they could. Or maybe not. They'll definitely play at some point, though"
