Former Real Madrid and Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas says his Twitter account was hacked after facing huge backlash for posting a fake tweet of coming out.
In a now deleted post on his official Twitter account, Casillas wrote on Sunday: "I hope I'll be respected: I'm gay."
As his announcement gained huge attention, former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol also joined in the fake stunt and replied: "The time has come to tell our story, Iker." 
However, later both tweets were swiftly deleted. Casillas claimed his account had been hacked and offered an apology to the LGBTQ+ community, but Puyol admitted the interaction had been a “clumsy joke” with no bad intentions.
Adelaide United player Josh Cavallo, who came out as gay last October, says it was "disappointing" to see two icons of the game "joking" about the topic and disrespecting LGBTQ+ people.
