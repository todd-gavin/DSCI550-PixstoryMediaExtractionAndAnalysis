My journey as an MSW student started few months ago and we do have field works and internships happening all at a loop. 

So in each semester we have an internship to complete and we completed our first semester well and when we came to our second semester we were first given to complete the internship. 

As a group of 8 we decided to do our internship far away from our homes because when we get a chance to explore a new place we take it. 

This internship definitely did add many things into each one of our lives and it gave us so much of knowledge on many things and I'm so thankful to each of our mentors, physiotherapists, doctors, nurses and our patients who have helped us in this journey of learning. 

We had to do some case works where we had to focus on patients and get to know their case in detail. Through the process we could really relate to them and could understand the reality of life. The theories that were learned couldn't give us more better definitions if it was not for our field work.

In the process we could bond so much with our clients patients and the staffs as they were all so cooperative and was teaching us with their experiences and love. 

I was super excited when I got to learn on how to check the blood pressure for the first time. It was just that cloud nine moment. 

The most touching moments were when the patients and staffs expressed that they would miss us and what we do. It was really special to hear it from the people you do something for them. 

This internship was indeed a window of lessons that we all opened up. The lessons and the moments we gained in this internship do have a place in each of our hearts. 

This chart in the photo was a token of our love that we could give them. We really wanted to give them something more but we wanted to make it special by including something of ours so that's when we thought of this.
