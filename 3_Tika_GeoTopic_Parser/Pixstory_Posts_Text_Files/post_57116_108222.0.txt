-Myth is that Artists who have Bipolar disorder will lose their creativity if they get treatment; no, this is not true. Treatment would instead allow the person to understand things more clearly, which will improve their work and creativity.

-People think one with bipolar disorder is always either manic or depressed. But people with bipolar disorder can experience long periods of even, balanced mood called euthymia. Conversely, they may sometimes experience what’s referred to as a “mixed episode,” which has features of both mania and depression at the same time.

-Myth is that Bipolar can be cured through diet or exercise, but it is not the complete truth. However, the disorder can be managed by maintaining a routine, eating, sleeping, and exercising. These can only make the situation better but not treat the person with bipolar disorder.
