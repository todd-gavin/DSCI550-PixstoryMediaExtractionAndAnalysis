It is still early days of a Seattle spring The weather who knows what the next moment will bring Rain more rain or a sunshine break A parasol or not a wager would you take The sky is resplendent but gives no clue All manner of clouds in a sky so blue The wind is moist from the Puget Sound With chill abounding from mountains all around But the blooming tulips seem to read it all They close their petals before rain or squall So nature gives a clue for all its woes Just watch the way the wind might blow In Seattle
