Governments have delayed action on climate change for too long and incremental changes in energy and food production will no longer be enough to create a climate resilient future a new analysis from scientists around the world warns The world is already seeing harmful impacts from climate change including extreme storms heat waves and other changes that have pushed some natural and human systems to the limits of their ability to adapt As temperatures continue to rise transformational change is coming to how people live on Earth Countries can either plan their transformations or they can face the destructive often chaotic transformations that will be imposed by the changing climate I m one of the authors of the climate impacts and adaptation report released Feb as part of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s Sixth Assessment Report The increasing alarm in these reports which review the latest research every six or seven years echoes what I ve seen over years of work in international development and climate change Climate change is having damaging effects today Global temperatures have risen degrees Celsius F since This warming has already produced substantial environmental changes Heat waves and extreme downpours have become more severe in many areas These impacts have already contributed to water scarcity and complex food price spikes and they can exacerbate health risks for vulnerable populations such as low income communities that can t afford cooling when temperatures rise Climate models show these effects will worsen in a warming future as people continue releasing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use agriculture and other activities compromising humanity s ability to adapt Where people cannot adapt lives will be transformed in reactive expensive ways For example research shows that if warming increases beyond C F compared to preindustrial times some small island states will lose much of their area to rising seas Climate change will transform where their residents live what they do for a living and indeed the very way they live Read full story at The Conversation Image Courtesy
