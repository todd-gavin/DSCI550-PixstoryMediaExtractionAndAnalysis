Christian Eriksen has been re-inducted into the Denmark squad after suffering a heart episode at Euro 2020.

After overcoming a significant health scare, the 30-year-old playmaker has been granted the opportunity to add to his 109 caps for his country.

Eriksen's most recent international appearance was in a match against Finland in Copenhagen on June 12, 2021, during which he collapsed before embarking on a long road to recovery.

Eriksen was implanted with a defibrillator a few days after his heart stopped while on European Championship duty, and was discharged from hospital after a successful operation.

At the time, he was committed to Serie A champions Inter, but Italian player welfare restrictions prevented him from rejoining the fold at San Siro.

The Nerazzurri agreed to his contract being terminated, allowing the former Tottenham Hotspur player to train with former teams Odense and Ajax.

Brentford, a Premier League club with a fellow Dane at the helm in the form of Thomas Frank, offered him a chance to return to competitive football.

Eriksen has been gradually reintegrated into the Bees' squad, making an emotional comeback against Newcastle on February 26, 2022, in which he played 38 minutes off the bench.

On March 5, he made his first start for his new employers against Norwich, and he also played 90 minutes against Burnley.
Eriksen has done enough to persuade Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand that he should be recalled to the national team, and he might now play in future friendly against the Netherlands and Serbia.
When Eriksen joined Brentford, he only signed a six-month deal because both parties wanted to avoid committing to anything long-term during this moment of uncertainty.

In his three appearances in the Premier League, the gifted midfielder has looked at ease, guiding the relegation-threatened Bees earn six valuable points.
