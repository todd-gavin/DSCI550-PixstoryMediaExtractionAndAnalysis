I vividly remember this time, my parents had planned a 7-day trip to Ujjain and Indore and decided to go there just after my completion of my annual exam.It was like a tradition that we used to travel to different places every year. Now you all have got a clue about the time we travelled there, which was in March. 
So we boarded the train for Ujjain with my parents and siblings and reached there in the morning. We stayed at a lodge, which is nearby the Mahakal Temple. 
After reaching the hotel, we all got ready quickly and first went to Mahakal Temple.
The ancient temple gave a feeling of divinity, a feeling of being connected with all the souls who have prayed there. The temple was crowded and we had to stand in a long queue for more than 2 hours to have darshan of one of the 12th jyotirlinga named Mahakaleshwar. The temple was splendid. It's a magnificent view, especially the famous "bhasma aarti" was indescribable. We started walking through the streets of Ujjain. We had dal bafla, one of the famous dishes of Ujjain, for lunch. 

Then we travelled to Indore by road.....At that time, it was drizzling and the wind was melancholy. It not only concealed the hills, but blanketed them in silence too. 
Indore is known as the "food city" of India, where all the foodies can satisfy their cravings for a variety of foods. I'm so crazy in love with poha that without eating it, my trip would be incomplete. So we had the infamous Indori poha, with sev and pomegranate on top. When I took it's first bite, mmmm, the taste of vegetables in fusion with spices and lemon left a mesmerising taste. 
We went to the renowned Rajawada for shopping and also visited the sarafa bazar to try the street food. I do suggest that those who want to have the taste of a variety of flavours can plan to go there, especially during vacation.
