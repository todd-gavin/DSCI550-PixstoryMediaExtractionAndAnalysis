Even though I m not a big advocate for ageing slow I do respect women s choice to do so However sunscreen has more than just aesthetical benefits UV radiation is the type of light that can cause skin cancer Exposure to UV radiation over a long period of time can lead to melanoma the deadliest form of skin cancer In fact sunscreen is one of the most effective ways to prevent skin cancer There are main types of melanoma skin cancer superficial spreading nodular lentigo maligna and acral lentiginous The vast majority of skin cancer deaths are from melanoma Nearly Americans die from melanoma every day In it is estimated that deaths will be attributed to melanoma men and women Sunscreen also helps protect your eyes from damage caused by UV radiation This is because sunscreen filters out both UVA and UVB rays which are the types of rays that cause eye damage Moreover sunscreen reduces the amount of skin pigmentation in the area near your eyes which makes it less likely that you will be exposed to dangerous levels of UV radiation from the sun Unfortunately for us most of the world cannot afford to add this essential to their skincare routine and how will they when they can barely afford food There s not much we as an individual can do about it except trying to change the system
