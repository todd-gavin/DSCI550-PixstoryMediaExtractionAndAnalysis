The weekend of the Dutch Grand Prix of the world championship started under a pouring rain, conditions in which Jack Miller is very comfortable with the Ducati setting the best time in the FP. In the afternoon, the weather improved and on a fast-changing track, the best of all was Pecco Bagnaia with the other official Ducati ahead of Fabio Quartararo Yamaha and Aleix Espargaro Aprilia If tomorrow it were to rain, the top ten of today&#39;s FPs would go through Q in a carriage, out by thousandths of the unfortunate Enea Bastianini who took the checkered flag just like in the Q of the Sachsenring for a handful of cents
