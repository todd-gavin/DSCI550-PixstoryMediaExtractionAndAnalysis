Antoine Griezmann's loan from Barcelona to Atletico Madrid has taken a new shape as theformer club prepares a lawsuit against the latter club.
Griezmann, who rejoined Atletico in the summer of 2021 on a two-year loan, also had anobligatory purchase clause worth €40 million added to the contract.
Atletico Madrid believe that the buyout will only be triggered if Griezmann plays at least 45minutes in 50% or more of the games he is available across the two seasons. Thus, DiegoSimeone’s side has been introducing the forward only after the hour mark to manage hisminutes and avoid paying the buyout price to the Catalans.
However, the Camp Nou side are arguing that the conditions were only for the first season ofthe loan spell as the second year was a mere extension of the contract. Notably, the Frenchforward played for 81% of the minutes possible last season, which would trigger the buyoutclause.
The Blaugrana are confident that they should be paid €40 million as the transfer fee. Atletico,on the other hand, also stand firmly in their stance and believe that they are not violating anylegal terms of the contract.
What’s next for Antoine Griezmann?
Antoine Griezmann is the one who is going to suffer for sure no matter what happens next.Right now, he seems to have accepted the substitute role. However, it is not a great situationto be in as a player of his quality deserves to have more minutes.
Though the 31-year-old has been in great touch, he would like to play more to head into theWorld Cup 2022 in the best possible shape. If Atletico manage to neglect the buyout clause,the striker will return to Barcelona next season where he will draw €20 million salary perseason.
It is also quite possible that the two parties will reach an agreement to transfer Griezmannfor a lesser price mentioned in the contract.
