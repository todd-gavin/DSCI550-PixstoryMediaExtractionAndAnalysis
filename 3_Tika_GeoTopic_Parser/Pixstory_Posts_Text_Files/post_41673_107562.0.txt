An international gymnastics body has sanctioned Kitty Chiller, the former chief executive of Gymnastics Australia and now deputy CEO of the National Sports Tribunal. 

ABC News reported that following "judging irregularities" at the 2021 Oceania Continental Championships in rhythmic gymnastics, Chiller, who stood down from her job in gymnastics earlier this year, has been barred from representing the International Gymnastics Federation for two years. 

As part of the decision by the Disciplinary Commission of the Gymnastics Ethics Foundation, a body that adjudicates conflicts in worldwide gymnastics, Gymnastics Australia (GA) must also pay a fine of 5,000 Swiss francs ($7,200). 

GA and Chiller, as well as two other judges and a technical director who were sanctioned, have 21 days to file an appeal.

When contacted by the ABC through her employment, Chiller — who is also a member of the Australian Olympic Committee executive — refused to provide more details on the irregularities or say whether she would accept the consequences. 

The alleged violations stem from the Oceania Championships, which also served as a selection trial for the 2021 Olympics, which took place in May of last year.
