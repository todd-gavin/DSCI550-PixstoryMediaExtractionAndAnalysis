According to the UN Observatory, the candidacy of Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban to the UN Human Rights Council is still valid. Afghanistan was nominated for this seat from the Asia-Pacific area during the previous government. 7 countries from this area are competing for 3 seats.

Also, in October this year, 18 countries are going to compete for 14 seats in a three-year term of the UN Human Rights Council.

From the Asia-Pacific region, the countries of South Korea, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Maldives are competing for three seats.

Meanwhile, Afghanistan is still a candidate for a seat in the United Nations Human Rights Council, and with the domination of the Taliban, widespread human rights violations are taking place in this country.

The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, recently published its first human rights report and said: "Our monitoring shows that despite the improvement in the security situation, the people of Afghanistan, especially women and girls, are deprived of the full enjoyment of their human rights."

In October 2017, Afghanistan became a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term.
