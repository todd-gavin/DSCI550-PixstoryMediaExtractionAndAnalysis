At the end of a season that will certainly not be remembered as the best but which brought Bayern Munich to the title and the fifth consecutive prize as top scorer in the Bundesliga for Lewandowski, there is the risk of getting to very close loggerheads between the Polish player and the Bavarian team Lewandowski he made it a secret that he no longer had stimuli in Bayern and for some time in public has been declaring that he no longer wants to stay He has also reiterated this since the national team&#39;s retirement where he is preparing for the four Nations League matches against Wales Belgium twice and Holland My experience at Bayern finished he said I see no chance of wearing this club&#39;s shirt again Bayern are a serious club and I hope they won&#39;t stop me A transfer is the best solution In reality the Bayern Munich management doesn&#39;t seem that intent on pleasing what was no doubt the best striker in Europe in recent seasons Losing such a valuable piece a year after the expiry of the contract could be complicated above all because to replace him the Germans would have to put their hands on their wallets and spend a lot But the alternative is not much more attractive which is to keep a player against his will So where could Lewandowski go Spain seems to be his next destination Barcelona first of all but Real Madrid should also be the two alternatives he could consider As long as they don&#39;t get in the way in Monaco
