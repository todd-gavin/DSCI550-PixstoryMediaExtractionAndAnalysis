Memphis Depay could be headed to Juventus in the summer! The Barcelona forward has been underutilized by Xavi and with the signing of Aubameyang and Lewandowski, the Dutch striker would find it hard to break into the Barcelona starting XI.

As per reports, Massimiliano Allegri is looking to add another forward to his squad. Owing to this Juventus have now opened talks with Memphis Depay. The report states that the player has offered himself to the Italian giants. 

Alvaro Morata returned to Atletico Madrid this summer as Juventus decided not to make his loan move permanent. The Bianconneri currently have Dusan Vlahovic and Moise Kean as the two options in their centre forward role. But with the departures of Morata and Dybala in the summer, Allegri reportedly wants to strengthen Juve's attack before the 2022/23 season officially kicks off. 

Depay joined Barcelona in July 2021. The Dutch forward has played 38 games for Barcelona till now. In this, he has scored 13 goals for his side. But with the Spanish giants signing reinforcements in attack, Depay wants to move out as his chances of getting in the starting XI have drastically reduced. 

Barcelona are reportedly open to selling the striker in the summer as they are looking to manage their salary bill and register the newer players heading into the next season.
