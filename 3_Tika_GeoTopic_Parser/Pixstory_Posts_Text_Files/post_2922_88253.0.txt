After the virtual summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, a short White House readout said that during the meeting, Biden "described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians." The readout says that both leaders "also agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, to manage the competition between our two countries."

China is miffed with the statement, and the state-controlled media is accusing the U.S. of pushing a "harsh narrative" against China through the media. Chinese analysts say that Biden is trying to "hype isolation" of Russia and show U.S. "toughness" against China.

Headlines in the U.S. media like "Biden warns Xi Jinping against aiding Russia," "Biden warns Xi of global backlash if China helps Russia" have not gone down with the Chinese.

According to the Chinese government, Xi "encouraged" the U.S. and NATO to have "conversations" with Russia to solve the problems behind the Ukraine crisis, and expressed opposition to "indiscriminate sanctions." ( https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1255263.shtml?id=11 )

In a sharply worded editorial, Global Times, a state-controlled English paper, accused the U.S. of being "eager to exploit the Russia-Ukraine conflict to drive a wedge between Beijing and Moscow." China says that attempts by the U.S. to make China "uncomfortable" will not succeed. Using Russia's term for war in Ukraine, China has accused NATO's eastward expansion "as the root cause of Russia's anger and military operation in Ukraine." ( https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1255251.shtml )

Although China and Russia have stood together on many issues, Ukraine invasion has meant that Beijing has been forced to weigh his options. For instance, on 25 February, China abstained from voting on a UN security council resolution that deplored Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Russia anyway vetoed the resolution.
