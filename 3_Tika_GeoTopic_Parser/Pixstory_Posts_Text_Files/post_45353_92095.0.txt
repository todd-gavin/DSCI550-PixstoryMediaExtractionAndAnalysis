England host this summer's Women's European Championships, and today brought some
big news for supporters of the Lionesses. Boss Sarina Wiegman confirmed Arsenal women's
defender Leah Williamson as the team's captain ahead of this summer's tournament.

“This is an incredibly proud moment for me and my family and I am honoured to be asked to
lead us at the Euros.

“Steph Houghton is one of this country’s all-time greats and to follow in her footsteps – and
all of those special names who have led the team in the past - means so much.

“Although I will be wearing the armband, I know we have a squad full of leaders who share
my pride and passion in playing for our country. Whether I am captain or not, I will never take
anything for granted and will always do my best for England every time I pull on the shirt.”remarked Leah, praising her team's support.

Leah played the role of fill-in captain during England's recent Arnold Clark Cup, where they
remained unbeaten. Their last world Cup qualifiers in October 2021 also came under
Williamson's leadership, ending 10-0 and 4-0 against Latvia and Nothern Ireland
respectively.

“This decision gives us continuity at this important final period as we build towards the
tournament. It is important we give everyone clarity at this stage,” said Wiegman, who took
charge mid-way through last year. Without Houghton, Leah has shown great determination
and promise — even filling in to play an unusual midfield role at one point.

Houghton's layoff with an achilles tendon problem may well come to an end before the
tournament itself. She is likely to return ahead of the Euros but Wiedman's urge to reform
consistency and clarity goes hand in hand with this move. It is for the greater good of the
English team ahead of a major tournament on home soil.
