The Gujarat quartet of Aryan Nehra, Anshul Kothari, Aryan Panchal and Devansh Parmar made a valiant effort to go for glory in the Men’s 4x200m Freestyle relay of the 36th National Games here on Wednesday but faded out as the race progressed and settled for a creditable silver medal. Swimming powerhouses Karnataka, powered by the quartet of Sambhavv R, Shivank Vishwanath, Siva S and Aneesh Gowda, simply swam with a vengeance to overtake the hosts and win the race in a new meet record timing of 7.41.10 mins.

Taking the silver was Vaishnav Hegde of Karnataka in 29.00 and the bronze medal winner was Shwejal Mankar of Maharashtra in 29.18, five seconds off the pace he had set in winning the heats. The Women’s 50m Breaststroke gold was grabbed by Chahat Arora of Punjab in 33.31 secs, well outside the meet record she had set in the morning. Coming in second was Aarti Patil (Maharashtra) in 34.77 and third was Manavi Varma (Karnataka) in 35.08. In the last race of the day, the Women’s 4x200m Freestyle final, Hashika Ramachandra anchored the Karnataka quartet of Dhindhi D, Shalini D and Rujula S to a new meet record of 8:51.59 minutes, obliterating the old mark of 8:54.73 set by Maharashtra in Kerala.
