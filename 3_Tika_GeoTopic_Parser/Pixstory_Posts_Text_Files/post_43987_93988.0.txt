On Thursday, there was a sizable foreign contingent at the Spanish stadium.

After his team's Europa League quarter-final defeat on Thursday, Barcelona manager Xavi 
claimed that there were too many Frankfurt fans in attendance at Camp Nou, and the club is looking into it.

The Blaugrana were defeated 3-2 (4-3 on aggregate) and were eliminated from the tournament, ending a great run of form.

White-shirted Frankfurt supporters remained long after the final whistle to support their team.

So, what did Xavi have to say about it?

Xavi told reporters, "I was anticipating 70,000 to 80,000 cules here, but it wasn't like that." "What 
happened is being investigated by the club."

Ronald Araujo has joined Movistar+ as a participant: "I'm shocked the stadium has so many German supporters. That is something that the club will need to consider. "

Joan Laporta, the club's president, later stated, "We are concerned about today's major 
embarrassment, which must not occur again.

We have a lot of information about what 
happened; we just need some time to review it and then we'll take the necessary steps, but it's a tragedy that what happened. "

To the stadium, march Frankfurt fans made their presence felt even before the game, as they marched through the streets of Barcelona in unison.

They were then treated to a strong display by Frankfurt, who led 3-0 before the Blaugrana scored a couple of late consolation goals.

Frankfurt will now attempt a similar invasion of London when they face West Ham in the semi-final.
