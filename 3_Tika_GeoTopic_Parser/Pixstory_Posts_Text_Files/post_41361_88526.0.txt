On Saturday, former President Donald Trump complimented himself, stating that during his four years in office, he kept the US out of war. 

"It was my personality that kept us out of war," he told a gathering of rallygoers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during the American Freedom Tour. "I was the only president in four decades who did not involve the United States in any hostilities, with the exception of completely defeating ISIS." 

He continued, "Other countries should not confuse Joe Biden's vulnerability with America's. American might, American force, and American leadership will return shortly, bigger and stronger than ever before."

Business Insider reported that Trump claimed in 2018 that his administration had defeated ISIS, while his own agencies were hesitant to make such a claim at the time. For example, the State Department stated that the United States has "made tremendous progress," but that "the task is not yet done." 

During his public spat with Kim Jong Un in 2017 over the country's nuclear weapons tests, Trump also warned that North Korea "would be greeted with fire and fury like the world has never seen."

Trump's comments on Saturday come just days after he continued to criticise Vice President Joe Biden's handling of the Ukraine-Russia crisis. 

Trump stated on Saturday night that the war between Russia and Ukraine must end. Trump told an audience in South Carolina that if he were still in office, Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have initiated a war. Since the commencement of the Ukraine-Russia war, Trump has made similar claims.
