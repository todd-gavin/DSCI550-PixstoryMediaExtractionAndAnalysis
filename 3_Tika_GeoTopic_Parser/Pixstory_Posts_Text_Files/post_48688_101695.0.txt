The necessity for radical liberalisation of sex education curricula is evident. It's not surprising but extremely disappointing that teens, especially those that are assigned female at birth, are using the internet to learn about their own sexuality. If sex education is part of the curriculum, information about female sexual satisfaction should be easily available in the classroom. But most sex education is male centric and ignores the effects sex has on women. The only effect that it talks about is usually just pregnancy â€“ which, let's be honest, is not the point of sex majority of the time.

Female pleasure is considered a taboo and the lack of such approach in education just furthers that notion. While male masturbation is considered a natural activity, female masturbation is linked with morality terming any female teenager engaging in it as "sl*t" or a "wh*re". 

There's more to be taught to students than just putting a condom on a banana. Contraception's adverse effects, the importance of consent, and the normalisation of sexual exploration should all be taught and prioritised as essential components of your total sexual well-being.

We need to do more than simply tell students that their sexual impulses are natural: we need to tell them that being in touch with their sexuality is not only healthy and fun, but also empowered. If we want girls to grow up to be completely independent individuals, sexual education schools must change their attitudes about sex and work to embrace rather than stigmatise female sexuality.
