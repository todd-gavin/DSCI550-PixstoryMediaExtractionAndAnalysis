Recently Disney released a Star Wars prequel novel titled Star Wars Padawan which focuses on Obi Wan Kenobi training as a Padawan under his master Qui Gon Jinn The whole development has caused quite a ruckus among the Star Wars community In the latest example of Disney going bottom low it seems that they have almost a burning fetish to both retcon Star Wars continuity and basically borderline violate the numerous classic pop culture icons that have come under their ownership in recent years to push forward their own twisted socio political agenda In the novel written by Kiersten White there comes a brief moment where he is surrounded by a bunch of other male Force apprentices and briefly questions his own sexuality after being hit upon by one of them For those who do not know Jedi according to the Jedi Code are not supposed to form attachments Canonically the person Obi Wan ever truly came to love as a genuine romance interest was Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore During his Padawan years the Jedi Master had spent a year on Mandalore protecting the Duchess during this time he fell in love with Satine but had to leave her due to the Jedi Code But he always seemed to struggle with his complex feelings for her Using his love for the Duchess as bait to draw him in later his archnemesis Darth Maul tragically murders the Duchess in front of Obi Wan to spite him as part of his revenge Now given all these factors and how Obi Wan upheld the Jedi Code always leaving the person he actually loved and never consummating his love it should be made clear that Obi Wan Kenobi s sexuality is not in doubt and neither should it be made a question or topic of debate Star Wars is a massive universe and there is enough space for everyone including people of different sexualities If Disney wants to push forward their message then they ought to do it with new Disney Star Wars characters like Rey or Poe not a legend like Obi Wan Kenobi
