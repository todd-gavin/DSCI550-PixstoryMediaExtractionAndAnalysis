This masjid has been magnificently built with an impressive structural design. It was built in 1623 by Empress Nur Jahan and unlike any other mosque, this one is built with grey limestone. Pathar Masjid has been built with a distinctive Mughal style. Grey limestone was used because it was found locally and the Empress thought it would reduce the transportation of marble from far away. The mosque has nine arches and unlike Mughal architecture, has a sloping roof instead.
