In New York, with the start of Covid 19 where people got affected with the virus in the initial period of the pandemic is said to have experienced certain peripheral neuropathy, pain and numbness in their hands and feet while they were affected with the virus and post that period. 

Co -author, Simon Haroutounian from the Washington University, said that "Several viral infections, such as HIV and shingles, are associated with peripheral neuropathy because viruses can damage nerves." 

He added that, "We found that nearly 30 per cent of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 also reported neuropathy problems at the time of their diagnosis and that for 6 per cent to 7 per cent of them, the symptoms persisted for at least two weeks, and up to three months, suggesting this virus may have lingering effects on peripheral nerves." 

The team had collected the data through various surveys from the patients who tested positive for the virus during the period from March 16, 2020 to January 12, 2021. A total of 1,556 participants attended the survey, out of which 542 of them had tested positive for the virus and 1,014 tested negative. 

Those who had tested negative was undergoing some surgery or was already under hospitalisation with cancer, diabetes or other health issues. And because of those problems the patients who had tested negative underwent the chronic pain and neuropathy that's not related to Covid 19. 

Patients who were tested positive were more healthier and younger and 29 per cent of them were reported to have symptoms of neuropathy, during the diagnosis.
