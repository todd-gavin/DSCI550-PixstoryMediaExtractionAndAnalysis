Dussehra or Vijayadashami is one of the most celebrated and pleasant festivals in India . It happens immediately after Navratri , a nine-day long celebration performed in the honour of the goddess Durga and twenty days prior to Diwali , the festival of lights . The day mark the victory of good over evil , when Lord Ram , the King of Ayodhya , kills Ravana, the King of Lanka ! ✨
May the celebrations of Vijaya Dashami be full of high spirits and vibrant colours for you and your loved ones ✨
Wishing everyone Happy Dussehra . ✨❤️
