Afghanistan’s Robotics Girls Team came second out of 88 countries in the “PCB the Change” world competition.

The competition started online two months ago among European and American countries, as well as Asian countries, and the results were announced yesterday after a review.

“We achieved this position by making an intelligent traffic system and by displaying it in the world competition,” Somaya Faruqi, the captain of the country’s robotics team.

According to Ms. Faruqi, an intelligent traffic system in the country, in addition to controlling traffic congestion, can also intelligently record speeding and traffic violations and transfer them to the central system.

“Due to the acute traffic problems in the country, we wanted to make such a robot,” she said.

Meanwhile, nearly ten members of the national robotics team have fled the country since the Taliban took control, but their efforts to launch more initiatives are ongoing.
