The weightlifter Bindyarani Devi received congratulations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday after earning a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
The Prime Minister stated that this success is a result of her dedication and has made every Indian very happy.

"Congratulations to Bindyarani Devi for her silver medal in the CWG in Birmingham. Her tenacity is evident in this accomplishment, which has brought immense joy to all Indians. I wish her the best of luck in all of her future endeavours "On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Modi tweeted.

India now has four medals after Bindyarani Devi's victory in the women's 55 kg weightlifting event at the Commonwealth Games 2022. When she failed in her second 114-kilogram clean and jerk attempt, she appeared to be headed for a bronze medal.

She did, however, attempt 116 kilos with her final lift, manage to move up to second place, and finished with just 1 kilo less than Nigeria's Adijat Olarinoye, who won the gold medal. The 23-year-old lifted 202 kg in total. She set a Commonwealth Games record lift of 116 kilos in the clean and jerk round after lifting 86 kilos in the snatch round.

Adijat Adenike Olarinoye of Nigeria won the gold medal by breaking the Games records for the snatch and total effort with an overall weight of 203 kg (92 kg 111 kg).

The first gold medal for India was won earlier by Mirabai Chanu, while Sanket Sargar and Gururaja Poojary earned silver and bronze, respectively.
