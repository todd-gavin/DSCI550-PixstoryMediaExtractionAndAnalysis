Nishant - End of Night!✨
Hey there! Nishant Gupta this side ,  I'm very mysterious fellow, who's hard to understand. I'm interested in many things such as sports like Badminton Cricket nd so on . My other hobbies including being with my friends, I'm of a very friendly nature and love to be with people who aren't egoistic.
Every END OF NIGHT  has beautiful morning as same the course of Life is full of ups and downs. If today is not good for us, then we must keep hope that everything will be good very soon. We must never discourage ourselves during tough times. Therefore, In life always try to appreciate your living. Find your purpose and strive to be more helpful each day.
Life is a jar of both happiness as well as sadness. Getting always what we want, is not the nature of life. Thus, one needs to keep oneself always motivated to the highest level. Follow the footprints of the great men to never be discouraged and keep yourself focused on your goal.
As for now I'm only focusing my attention on enjoyment. I'm being my true self with the values, dreams and goals that I have.
So this is 'Me and my thought ' infront of all of you
Thank you...✨
