Surinsar Lake, which is located 42 kilometres from Jammu city, is renowned for both its natural beauty and some mythological significance. It is a well-liked picnic location and surrounded by mountain ranges that are heavily forested. Surinsar Lake's beauty and natural brilliance can be compared to the grandeur of Srinagar's Dal Lake and Nagin Lake. Mansar Lake, which is 30 km away from Surinsar Lake, is regarded as one of the twin lakes. The Surinsar Mansar Wildlife Sanctuary, which lies tucked between the two lakes, is home to three animal species and fifteen bird species, including the crane. Hindu mythological tales state that Arjun, the legendary warrior from the Mahabharata, is closely related to the origin of the lake. A spring that is today known as Surinsar Lake is claimed to have been created when Arjun shot an arrow into the Mansar.
