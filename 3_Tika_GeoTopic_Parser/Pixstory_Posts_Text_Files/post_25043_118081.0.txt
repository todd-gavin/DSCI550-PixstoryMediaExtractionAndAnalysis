Arsenal secured a 3-1 win over Orlando in their latest pre-season fixture. The Gunners have been flying high in the pre-season campaign, which sends a strong message to domestic rivals before the start of the regular season.

However, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta does not want to get too ahead of himself. He acknowledged that things have been going in the right direction, but pointed out that there are several things to improve. Arsenal have made some good signings in the transfer window, and it is going to take time for the stars to settle into the North London side.

“It’s going well but there are a lot of things to improve,” the boss said after the game.In terms of the consistency, the level that we play from minute zero to 95, has to still improve,” said Arteta, as quoted by the official Arsenal website.

Mikel Arteta believes that the players have still not reached their peak physical levels, due to the lack of playing time over the summer break. However, he expects them to catch up as the season approaches.

“Physically still we are not there because we haven’t loaded the players with 90 minutes yet, but there a lot of positive signs at the same time,” he added.

Arsenal got off to a horrific start in the Premier League last season, losing their first three games, and conceding as many as 9 goals without a response. Mikel Arteta will look to bury the ghosts of last season, as the Gunners travel to Selhurst Park in the first week of the domestic season.
