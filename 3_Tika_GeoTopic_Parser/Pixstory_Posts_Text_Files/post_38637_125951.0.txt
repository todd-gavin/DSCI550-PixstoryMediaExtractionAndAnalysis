We can see that Cristiano ranks head and shoulder above him in goals and shots on target. While Cody ranks high in assists,interception and tackles won. 


Marcus Rashford- The Englishman had a season to forget, where he could register only 4 goals to his name. Scoring at every 308.2 per minute. He registered only 2 assists. Under ETH he registered a few goals, Rashford will be looking to rejuvinate himself under the Dutch manager.

Maybe the only thing he was good at was intercepting the balls. While Cody overpowers him in every aspect. Rashford will be looking to redeem himself.


Jadon Sancho- The Englishman’s exploits in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund made ex-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to get him. They had to wait one year before they got their man for 70 million. But what we saw was beyond understanding. 


The forward who terrorized defenders in the Bundesliga was struggling in the Premier League. He could register a mere 3 goals, scoring at every 643.6 minutes, which was eyebrow raising in itself. He could also register only 3 assists. This season he’ll be looking to justify the price tag which made United go after him.

Jadon ranks high on the defensive side, while again he falters on the offensive part. 


Anthony Elanga- The youngster was promoted to first team. He scored only 2 goals,scoring at every 608.5 minutes. He could register 2 assists to his name. This season will be vital for him.

Anthony, like Jadon excels on the defensive part,while he falters on the offensive part. 




Anthony Martial - Martial had a season to forget. He scored 0 goals. He was loaned to Sevilla, there also he could score only 1 goal. He will be looking to redeem himself.

In offensive and defensive aspects he ranked very poor. He’ll be looking to redeem himself this season, having scored in the pre-season.
