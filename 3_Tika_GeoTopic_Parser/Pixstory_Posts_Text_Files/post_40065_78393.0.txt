A study published in the journal SCIENCE ADVANCES, scientists at Tufts University and Harvard University's Wyss Institute have brought us a step closer to goal of regenerative medicine.
The adult frogs are naturally unable to regenerate their limbs, but researchers triggered the regeneration process using five-drug cocktail applied in silicon wearable bio reactor dome sealing the elixir over the stump for 24 hours.
Many creatures have the capability to regenerate their organs like lizards can regrow their tails, but loss of structurally complex limb cannot regrow through natural process.
The strategy used here is focused on triggering dormant, inherent anatomical patterning programs, not micromanaging complex growth, since adult animals still have the information needed to make their body structures.
