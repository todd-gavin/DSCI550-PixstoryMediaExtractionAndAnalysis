At the end of the season, I thought of creating a graph that positioned the teams based on the number of pressing actions on the opponent and the number of progressive passes, both ratios for two values that I think show the teams&#39; approach to the match well. The data I took from fbref which in turn takes them from StatsBomb Milan champion for pressing actions on the opponents to which it combines pass prog given the latter in which Atalanta excels with It surprises Genoa relegated for pressing but among the last with pass prog Empoli is excellent settles in the medium-high position of the graph with pressing actions and progressive passes Inter produced an average number of pressing actions but resulted in progressive passes with Juventus instead is in the group of teams with little pressure on and an average pass value progr respectively with Cagliari inferior to Spezia and progressive passes in line with Empoli and Fiorentina and inferior to Hellas and Sassuolo Personally I think that the market that Juve is planning directs them towards a team capable of quickly overturning the situation In the next season I expect a Juve in high positions compared to the value of the progr passes
