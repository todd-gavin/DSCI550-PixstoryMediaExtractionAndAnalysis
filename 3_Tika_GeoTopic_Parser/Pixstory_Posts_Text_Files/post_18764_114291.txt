Bayern Munich will start preparations in July but the Lewandowski case still needs to be resolved The player has said several times that he no longer wants to be in the team and wants to move on He promised to Barcelona and all this one year after his contract expired Bayern Munich opposed the player&#39;s decision but the close expiry of the contract would have convinced them to monetize a possible negotiation. Indeed, there&#39;s more. The offer from Barcelona has already arrived at Bayern, as stated by president Laporta. You already know that we have made an offer and we are waiting for Bayern&#39;s answer I want to thank the player for everything he is doing to come here They have to evaluate the offer and we are waiting for the answer hoping it will be positive The offer would be millions of euros plus bonus Far from Bayern Munich&#39;s request for millions but however fillable The only uncertain thing is the timing The player doesn&#39;t want to be in Germany when he starts training but at this point it seems inevitable
