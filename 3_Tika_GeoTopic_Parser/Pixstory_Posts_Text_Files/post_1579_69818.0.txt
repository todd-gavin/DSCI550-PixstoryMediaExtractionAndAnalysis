26 points and 13 rebounds. Kings beat the Rockets and Bagley dominates. 

Bagley had his best game of the season and was strong down the stretch, scoring 10 points in the fourth quarter while helping Sacramento to its second straight win.

The second overall pick in 2018, whose minutes have gone up significantly since interim coach Alvin Gentry took over when Luke Walton was fired in November, was 12 of 20 from the floor.

Coach Gentry has clearly shown and communicated to have the most confidence in Bagleyâ€™s rebounding abilities which is the Kings biggest Achilles heal. This confidence has paid off and Bagley has now done a complete 180 from not playing at all for the first part of the season.
