Silencers are the tubes that attach to the barrel of a firearm and contain baffles that make the gun quieter and dampen its kickback — generally cost about $350 to $1,600 when bought legally in the United States. Buying one legally requires a special registration process that can take weeks or months and includes submitting fingerprints and paying a $200 tax. It’s illegal to own a silencer if you can’t legally own a gun.

There has been a federal operation going on since 2019, which has seized tens of thousands of illegal gun silencers smuggled into the United States from China, leading to the arrests of felons and domestic extremists.

Federal authorities have also shut down the websites that sell them and helped officials in China to stop the manufacturing of illegal silencers, according to federal law enforcement officials.

Officials continue to monitor shipments from China, but as the supply of foreign silencers has largely slowed down Law enforcement is now also searching for unlicensed U.S. manufacturers that step in to take the place of Chinese sellers, and authorities are interested in 3D-printed silencers as well, according to officials.
