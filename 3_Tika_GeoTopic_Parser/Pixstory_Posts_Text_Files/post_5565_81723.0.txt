Writing with Fire, a documentary on the lives and work of Khabar Lahariya journalists and made by Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh, is going to the OSCARS! 

The documentary has already received 30 international awards and received critical acclaim  from around the world. It follows the lives and work of three Khabar Lahariya journalists, women who come from rural and marginalised backgrounds, as they courageously negotiate patriarchy, power, politics and the state. 

We are particularly thrilled because our very own Meera Jatav not only co-founded Khabar Lahariya in 2002 but also served as its editor until 2019 before starting Chitrakoot Collective, leading multiple generations of fearless feminist journalists!
