Dan Lin won't be taking the DC throne in exchange for the keys. Hollywood Reporter said that talks between the producer and the comic book brand to take on the broad job involving film and television fell down recently. 

According to sources, discussions with Warner Bros. Discovery were complicated by a number of issues, with Lin's obligations to Rideback, his successful production company, and Rideback Rise, his new nonprofit project, being the main one. Salary and vision were negotiated, but Rideback remained a problem. One option had WBD purchasing stock in the business, albeit the exact amount was never specified. 

Lin is renowned for producing both It films for Warners as well as The Lego Movie. Having worked on the disastrous George Miller Justice League, which was abandoned during the writers' strike of 2007–2008, he also has a fondness for DC. 

David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, has pledged to overhaul the comic book brand with a 10-year plan in an effort to make it competitive with Kevin Feige's Marvel Studios.

Let’s see what happens next!
