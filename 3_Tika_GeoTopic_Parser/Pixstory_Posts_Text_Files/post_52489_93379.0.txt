Veg mayo Sandwich is always my go to evening snack whenever i feel hungry. This sandwich is made with grated carrot, finely chopped capsicum,onion and chilli.In a bowl 2 tablespoon of mayo is taken in which 1 teaspoon of black salt and 1 teaspoon of powder spice mix is added. Then this mayo mix is spread over 2 piece of bread and between this 2 pieces of bread finely chopped vegetables as mentioned above is filled and then some cheese inside the sandwich. The sandwich is then grilled and we can have it with sauce. This sandwich recipe is easy to make and also tastes fantastic.
