Nostalgia is a feeling of consciousness
An awakened piece of Art!!!
All people in the world are seeking for love and compassion...
Some dwells on money and some on pleasure....
Both does not provide solace as well...
Happiness comes out of organic selflessÂ  words and actions...
Being humane is the ultimate goal...
Death will only ruin our body....
It can't vanishes our deeds...
We can create memories out of our life..
These memories will reside inside the heart of our loved ones...
Be a reason for the joy of others....
Be a man of small things....
As these smaller things add charm to our life caricature!!!
