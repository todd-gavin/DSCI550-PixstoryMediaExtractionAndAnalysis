Laura, is an Oneida leader, author, orator, activist and visionary. Kellogg, a descendant of distinguished Oneida leaders, was a founder of the Society of American Indians. 

Kellogg was a proponent of the renaissance and sovereignty of the Six Nations of the Iroquois and fought for communal tribal lands, tribal autonomy and self-government.

 She was called Indian Princess Wynnogene," Kellogg was the voice of the Oneidas and Haudenosaunee people in national and international forums.

 She and her husband pursued land claims in New York on behalf of the Six Nations people.
 
While touring Europe, Kellogg had a particular interest in the Garden city movement of urban planning in England, Germany and France, and visioned the model modified to reservations to generate Oneida financial self-sufficiency and tribal self-governance. Kellogg would pursue these goals for the rest of her life.

Early newspapers called Kellogg "Princess Neoskalita" and "The Indian Joan of Arc." Later press articles billed Kellogg as "Indian Princess Wynnogene." "Wynnogene, a real Indian princess, has gone to Washington to be the Joan of Arc for her people. 

With the Lolomi movement, of which she is the founder, she proposes to lead 300,000 Indians out of what she calls "the bondage of bureaucracy into the self-respect of complete self-government."

Kellogg's Lolomi vision took the form of success of the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. Landholdings by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin have increased since the mid-1980s from approximately 200 acres to more than 18,000 acres.
