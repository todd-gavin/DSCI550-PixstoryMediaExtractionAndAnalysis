Torreira spent the previous season on loan at Fiorentina, but the Italian club decided not to exercise their option on him because of a dispute over the player's salary. Other Serie A teams are eager to sign him, but his future is unclear at the moment despite their interest.

He is no longer with the group on their preseason tour of the United States, and Arsenal is willing to sell him. Additionally, Serie A powerhouse Roma are reportedly showing renewed interest in the 26-year-old, according to the Italian publication Calciomercato.it.

Roma has been interested in him all summer and has enquired further about the prospect of signing him. The Giallorossi and Torreira's team have made contact over a prospective transfer.

Arsenal is willing to trade him this summer for a price of about €10 million because he only has one year left on his contract. It is unknown if Roma would be willing to pay such a sum for Torreira right now.

Clubs interested in Lucas Torreira have received a direct contact from Mikel Arteta, the manager of Arsenal. The Uruguayan midfielder, who spent last season with Fiorentina, appeared to be leaving Arsenal.

Valencia has made a strong bid for the 26-year-old, but Arteta won't let him go. Torreira missed Arsenal's victory over Orlando City on Wednesday because, according to rumours, he is en route to Italy to join Juventus.

Even though Arteta chose him for the team's preseason trip to the United States, it is obvious that he has other plans for the future. According to rumours, Arsenal might make Torreira an offer in addition to money to sign Arthur, who signed with Juve for a staggering £66 million in the summer of 2020.

Torreira is our player, Arteta stated when asked about the future of the player. Torreira has reportedly departed Arsenal's training camp in Florida for personal reasons, according to the Gunners.
