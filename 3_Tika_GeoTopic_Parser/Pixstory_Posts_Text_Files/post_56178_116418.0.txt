‌The opposition party and the PM are not friends and often have a very mutual relationship. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says his party does not "fear any of the candidates” for the Tory leadership because the change the UK needs is not at the top of the Conservative Party, which he says has provided the country “twelve years of failure”, but a change of government.

Speaking in Berlin after meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, he says the past few days have drawn a contrast between Tory MPs “squabbling like cats in a bag” and a Labour Party “united and ready for an election”.

Starmer adds that while he “completely understands” why people are “frustrated” about the cost of living crisis, he doesn’t want planned rail strikes to go ahead. He indicts Transport Secretary Grant Shapps of spending “more time on his leadership campaign” than on stopping them. 

People are suffering from the heat and in addition, they have a cost of living crisis and rail strikes.
