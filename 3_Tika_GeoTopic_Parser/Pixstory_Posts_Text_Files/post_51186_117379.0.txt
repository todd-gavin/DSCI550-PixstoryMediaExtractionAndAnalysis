Vegan Sticky Sesame Chickpeas
2 cans Chickpeas
3 large cloves Garlic
1/2 tsp Ginger, ground
3 tbsp Maple syrup
1/3 cup Tamari or soy sauce
1 tbsp Arrowroot powder
1/2 tsp Red pepper flakes
1 tbsp Avocado or olive oil
2 tsp Rice vinegar
1 1/2 tbsp Sesame oil, toasted
4 tbsp Vegetable broth water

Instructions

Drain and rinse the chickpeas. 

Mince the garlic and add to a saute pan with 1 tbsp avocado oil. Saute until the garlic is slightly golden brown. 

Whisk together the arrowroot powder and 2 tbsp vegetable broth in a bowl and set aside. We’ll be using this in a minute to help thicken the sesame sauce. You can also use chicken stock or water instead.

To the pan with the garlic, add the sesame oil tamari , maple syrup, ginger, rice vinegar, and the remaining vegetable broth. Whisk together. Re-whisk the arrowroot mixture to make sure no clumps formed at the bottom and add to the saute pan with the rest of the sauce. Whisk together.

Cook over medium/low heat until the mixture starts to bubble Once it is bubbling around the edges, give it a quick stir and add in the chickpeas and carefully fold the sauce over the chickpeas until they are well coated.

The sauce will start to thicken, keep stirring so the sauce covers the chickpeas. Let the chickpeas cook until the sauce is nice and thick. The chickpeas will also darken as they absorb the sauce, this is good since it yields major flavor!

After 5 or so minutes or once the sauce is thick, turn off the heat and allow all of the flavors to blend together for an additional 5 minutes.

Serve it with steamed rice and the veggies you like !
