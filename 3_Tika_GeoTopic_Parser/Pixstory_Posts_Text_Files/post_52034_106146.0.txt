A US body positive influencer has hit back at trolls who urged her to “cover” her body when she’s wearing a bikini.

Emily Bispo, 23, regularly shares inspiring videos about loving your body, no matter what size it is.

Many of her TikTok videos show her flaunting her size 12 – an Australian size 16 – figure in an array of colourful bikinis, beside messages that include “love your love handles” and “life is too precious to waste time worrying that I don’t have the ‘perfect’ body”.

However, her motivational videos have sadly caught the eye of internet trolls who claim she needs to “cover up” and that bikinis are “not very flattering” on her body.

Emily, however, has no time for keyboard warriors, responding with a short video.

In the clip, Emily can be seen wearing a black and red micro two piece as she relaxes on a sun lounger by the pool.

She then lifts up her sunglasses, and her unimpressed expression suggests she’s totally unphased by the cruel remark.

“It’s hot chubby girl summer, mind ur business,” she captioned the defiant clip.

The post has had more than 320,000 views to date and has been inundated with comments – many grateful to Emily for helping boost their confidence.

“I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THANK U FOR INSPIRING ME TO LOVE MY BODY,” one woman declared.

“Convince me that there is beauty like this girl in the world,” another said.

“You rocking it gurl, haters gonna hate,” someone else wrote.

While one said: “You literally don’t know how much affect u have on me! Like my big sister ILY.”

Others were angry she was subjected to abuse, writing they “love every inch” of her.

“She don’t look bad at all. Are you jealous?” one raged.

“Don’t cover up anything, they’re idiots,” another wrote.

Emily has long used her social media platform to help make women feel good in their bodies – no matter what shape or size.
