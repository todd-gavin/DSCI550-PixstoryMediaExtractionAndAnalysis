Dhadkaie-nestled high in himalyan mountains is home tp to roughly 2800 people.   A baby's first moments in this tranquil community are dominated by the sound of drums. Family members gather nervously around, watching for any indication that the baby is responding to the beat, like crying or a little head shift. 

In Dhadkaie, often known as the "silent town," where it is common to be born deaf, mute, or even both, this strange childbirth custom is crucial. 

According to Bhalessa Block Development Council chairman Mohammed Hanief, a resident of Dhadkaie, if a baby cries loudly and doesn't open its eyes within the first two days, that child is deaf.

Additionally, it is believed to have the highest rate of deaf-mutism without a known syndrome in the entire world. 

Nevertheless, doctors think that inter-marriage through many generations in this small, largely Muslim population is to blame for the cases.

“Birth of a child is a celebration in every family but here it brings horror. We anxiously want to see that new born is not deaf and dumb,” he says. “It feels awful when you have a family where most people can’t speak. This silence is killing, painful.”

The Army has stepped forward and adopted the village in order to address the problems of its residents, one month after providing cutting-edge customised hearing aids to the deaf and mute villages of Dhadkaie in Doda district. 
The Army has started door-to-door individualised teaching classes for the mute children as first step. The Army has done this by deploying sign language experts who have been specially trained in Telangana. 

Mohammed Haneef praised the Army for its ongoing efforts to improve welfare. 

Haneef stated that "The Army has taken practical efforts that will undoubtedly go a long way to minimise the suffering due to the impairment." 

The Army began teaching 10 kids sign language in addition to providing them with hearing aids in January that cost Rs 17,000 each.
