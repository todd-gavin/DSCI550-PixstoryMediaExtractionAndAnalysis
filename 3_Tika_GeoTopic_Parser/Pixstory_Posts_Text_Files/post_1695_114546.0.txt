Suniti Choudhury was known as the youngest female revolutionary in India. Born to a middle-class Bengali family, she allowed her patriotism to lead her in her endeavours. She was often influenced by the talks by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and other leaders of the freedom struggle.

Her motive was simple — “What good is our current dagger-and-stick play if we shy away from real action?”

So when she was 14, she undertook the dangerous and risky task of shooting a tyrannical British magistrate and bureacrat, Charles Geoffrey Buckland Stevens, alongwith her companion Santi Ghose.

The girls were taken into custody and imprisoned in the local British jail. In February 1932, Ghose and Chowdhury appeared in court in Calcutta. Being a minor, both of them were sentenced to jail for 10 years. In an interview, they stated, "It is better to die than live in a horse's stable."

She was held captive in Hijli Detention Camp as a "third class prisoner". The effects of her activities were also faced by her family, with her father's government pension being stopped, and her two elder brothers being held in custody without trial. Her younger brother died from consumption, exacerbated by years of malnutrition.

She was released with Santi Ghose in 1939, after having served seven years of her sentence, because of the amnesty negotiations between Gandhiji and the British colonial authorities.



After being released from jail, she went to Calcutta Medical College where she completed her MBBS and became a doctor.

Salute madam!
