The 13th of July is National French Fry Day. And what better way to enjoy the occasion than with a pile of hot, crispy fries? There is no shortage of ways to enjoy these delectable appetisers, whether you prefer the traditional beef fry or something more inventive (like bacon-wrapped fries).

Deep-fried potato strips or slices are referred to as "French fries." Although the exact origins are uncertain, the dish first appeared on the culinary scene in the 1700s. Potatoes, which were introduced to Europe in the 1600s, took a century to gain widespread acceptance as a food.

The origin of the French fry is an eye - catching folk tale, just like most famous meals. The development of French fries is credited to the Belgians, who claim ownership of the recipe. Since they lived close to the river, the people of the Meuse Valley, a region of Belgium near Dinant, eat a lot of fish, according to a text by Joseph Gerard. The concept of cutting potatoes into thin, fish-like fillet-shaped pieces and frying them in hot fat originated during the winter, when rivers would freeze and fishing would become challenging.

However, the French deserve all the credit for bringing street food carts known as "frites" to the public's attention in the middle of the eighteenth century. Eventually, potatoes were fried and sliced into a variety of forms. There are two stories of the history of how French fries got to America. It is a more widely known and acknowledged truth that Thomas Jefferson introduced the dish to the United States. Jefferson spent a lot of time in France while serving as an ambassador, and in 1802 he served "potatoes prepared in the French way" at a White House supper.
