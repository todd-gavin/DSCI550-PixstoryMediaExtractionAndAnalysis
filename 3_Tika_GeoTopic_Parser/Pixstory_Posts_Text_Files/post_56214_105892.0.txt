Boris Johnson is coming under pressure from his MPs to cut taxes after surviving a vote of confidence.

Pressure increases on Boris Johnson from his MPs to cut taxes after a vote of confidence. The prime minister's backers believe this move would help refurbish unity in the Conservative Party and help people tackle the cost of living.

But ex-cabinet minister David Davis accused Mr Johnson of "letting things slide" and instructed him to "get his act together" quickly or leave office.

Mr Johnson is facing MPs in the House of Commons in Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since four in 10 of his MPs backed overthrowing him in a confidence vote on Monday.

The government has recently increased the  National Insurance to help deal with NHS backlogs and social care funding is now facing difficulty to announce policies that would appeal to MPs from across his party.

He is said to have hinted at deductions to the tax burden - currently at its highest level. And at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, he said: "We will have the scope, by delivering tax cuts, I think, to deliver considerable growth in employment and economic progress."

Taxpayers will get some solace next month when a National Insurance threshold increase comes into effect, giving rise to the amount people can earn before they start paying it up to £12,570.
