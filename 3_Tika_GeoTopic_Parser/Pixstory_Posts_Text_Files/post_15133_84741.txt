Genomic know-how is a strategic asset of agriculture because agriculture can exist without chemistry but there is no agriculture without genetics and the most pressing challenge today is that of climate change. We will have to think of plants suitable for tomorrow&#39;s climate. Crea Bioinformatics framed the future role of science in agriculture by speaking yesterday afternoon at the International Summit to celebrate the first years of the Common Agricultural Policy inaugural events of the Fieragricola If today is hotter than yesterday and tomorrow will be hotter than today, we will have to predict climate change through simulation systems capable of predicting the growth of the plant by interpreting the climate and studying the genes that will serve the plant in years time. Thus we pass from an empirical type selection to a genomic selection carried out almost at the table based on knowledge. The director of the Research Center Genomics and Bioinformatics of Crea Luigi Cattivelli warned of the consequences of climate change because we must not think only of the hurricane in New York the impact also affects agriculture and not only with drought excessive rainfall or increase in winter temperatures The new climate means new breeds of pathogens and new diseases The rice blast made a leap of species towards cereals ten years ago in Bangladesh by attacking a plant that was not prepared for the new pathogen Science is not enough to be effective Crea is already ready for field testing many of the varieties obtained with genome editing but the current legislation prevents us from doing so because it stops at a national level while the European legislation on the subject dates back to We have to fill a regulatory gap otherwise researchers will not be able to supply varieties resistant to climate change and pathogens sustainability and resilience to climate change will increasingly be the variables that the agriculture of the future will have to keep in mind
