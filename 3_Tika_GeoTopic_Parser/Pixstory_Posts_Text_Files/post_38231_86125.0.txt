Owen Coyle is the name that is doing the rounds in Indian football as of now. The former Republic of Ireland player led the Jamshedpur FC side to the Hero Indian Super League Winner Shield 2021/22. 

But the story could have been very different if Chennaiyin FC would have wanted it to be in 2020. Owen Coyle first came to India after the Marina Machans brought him in as John Gregory's replacement in the 2019/20 ISL season. 

Chennaiyin FC were struggling near the bottom of the ISL table but Owen Coyle orchestrated a fairy tale for the South Indian club. The manager won over the fans as he led CFC all the way to the Finals of the 2019/20 season, just falling short of a well-deserved title! 

But at the end of the season, Owen Coyle left Chennaiyin! Why? Because of contractual issues. 
The manager demanded an improved contract with reportedly double the amount of what he was earning. But the Chennaiyin FC management felt that it was too much and allowed him to leave. 


Chennaiyin FC eventually replaced Owen Coyle with Csaba Lazlo in the 2020/21 season and Bozidar Bandovic in the 2021/22 season. But both the managers failed to ignite the team. As a result, the Marina Machans failed to even qualify for the playoffs on both occasions!...


Two years down the line, the question remains the same in the mind of all the Chennaiyin FC fans! What would have happened if Chennaiyin had agreed to extend the contract of Owen Coyle?

Was it Chennaiyin FC's biggest mistake in their short history?
