After enjoying power in Congress for decades, Ghulam Nabi Azad finally bid goodbye to the grand old party on Friday. 
Except in terms of perception, his exit is no way going to hurt the Congress. He has never been a mass leader and always remained on the winning side. 
For the past over five decades, he has held top posts in government and the Congress party. 
It is well-known in political circles in Jammu and Kashmir how he became close to the Gandhis. He first courted Sanjay Gandhi who introduced him to Indira Gandhi. She in turn made him a minister in 1980. 
After Sanjay Gandhi's death, came to close to Rajiv Gandhi who elevated him after his stupendous victory in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections held after the assassination of Indira Gandhi. 
Following Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, joined the group led by PV Narasimha Rao and eventually helped in ousting him as the Congress president. After installing Sitaram Kesri in his place, he was the first to dump him when Sonia Gandhi took a plunge in politics. 
Stayed with her till he was denied re-nomination to the Rajya Sabha that entailed him a house in Lutyens Delhi. He revolted against the party and formed a ginger group of dissenters, which came to be known as G-23.
Now, the main question is where he is headed to? It seems that the BJP is not going to be his destination given the resentment against the party in the Kashmir valley. Since he comes from the Muslim-dominated Chenab valley in the Jammu region, that option seems impossible unless he has decided to go against the wind.
It appears that the feasible option for him is to form a regional party and ensure it gets a good number of seats in the assembly elections whenever these are held. If he is able to do so, he could be in a position to stake claim to the chief minister’s post with the help of other regional parties. The BJP might play ball since Prime Minister Narendra Modi holds him in high regard.
The last could be to join one of the existing parties.
