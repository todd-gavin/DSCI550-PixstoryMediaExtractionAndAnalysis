Although Norwich knocked Wolves out of the FA Cup on Saturday, Bruno Lage's men are in a good position in the Premier League having dropped just two points from their last five league games.

Boss Lage said: "Before the FA Cup, I put both scenarios: we have 34 points, we are doing well, are we comfortable or are we going to work for more? That will define us.

"Now we are in this position we must continue to focus in the same way. I don’t relax. We have a lot of things to do before the end of the season. When you don’t have some players on the pitch, we have to continue to work.
