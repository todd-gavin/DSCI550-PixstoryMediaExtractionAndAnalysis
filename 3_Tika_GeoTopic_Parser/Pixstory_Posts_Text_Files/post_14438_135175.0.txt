Those who drink black tea have a possibility to outlive their non tea drinking peers. 
As per new studies conducted by National Institute of Health. 
The researchers says that all cause mortality risk was 9 to 13 percent lower between people, who were drinking at least two cups of tea per day. 
The study looked upon the data on half a million men and women who were aged between 40 to 69 years, they completed a baseline questionnaire between 2006 and 2010 for the Biobank. 
Around 85 percent of the participants reported that they were regular tea drinkers. And among them, 89 percent reported of drinking black tea. Tea's strength and portion size were not assessed in the process. 
The researchers listed down the benefits of daily tea drinking as observed regardless of if the participants drank coffee  if they added milk or sugar to their tea, or if they preferred tea temperature or genetic variants that's related to caffeine metabolism. 
The experts had explained about the research as follows: 
Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, an inclusive plant-based dietitian in Stamford, Connecticut, and owner of “Plant Based with Amy", says that, “This study brings home how beneficial black tea can be to our health and mortality". 
Amy Bragagnini, MS, RD, CSO, an oncology nutrition specialist at Trinity Health Lacks Cancer Center in Michigan and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, adds to the statement that the new research is in line with the findings done previously. 
“Many studies have found that polyphenols found in tea (polyphenols are compounds that we get from certain plant-based foods) can act as antioxidants in our body,” Bragagnini told Healthline. 
“These can help reduce oxidative damage in our cells and may help lower the risk of several chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases and diabetes). The polyphenols may also act as anti-inflammatory agents, which could help lessen joint pain and arthritis,” she said.
