So in the evening Coming from Somewhere to reach my PG, I booked a bike cab on Rapido. 
The Driver took a lot of time teaching the pickup location.
Then I called him, he said it will take not more than 2 minutes and hung up.

Then My Phone's Battery Died because I watched YT videos & Browse things that drain my battery. 
I thought it's have enough but then I realised that " When in Battery Saver mode use as less as possible ".
I had no Cash, And not enough money in my bank account so that I can withdraw. 

I walked, there's no sign board so I walked in the wrong road. 
I went to a Cafe. Ordered a Cold coffee of 
Rs. 240. And ask them to please Charge my phone.
So not having a Powerbank cost me 240.

Then I booked another rapido, I didn't used my phone while in the bike. Because I learnt a lesson.
Power hona jaroori hai.
- In the form of Energy
- In the form of Device
- In the form of Money

I wish you never have to face these type of issue.

Thanks
Stay Khush!
