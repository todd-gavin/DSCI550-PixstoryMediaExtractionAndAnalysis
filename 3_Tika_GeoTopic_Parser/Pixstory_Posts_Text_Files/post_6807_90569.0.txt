A portion of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s March 24 address during the ongoing budget session where he referred to the controversial film ‘The Kashmir Files’ has lately made headlines. In the clip, CM Kejriwal can be heard saying, “They are saying make The Kashmir Files tax-free. Well, put it on YouTube and it shall be free.” It is noteworthy that the film has been made tax-free in most BJP-ruled states, including Uttar Pradesh, Tripura, Goa, Haryana, Gujarat, and Uttarakhand.

In the backdrop of this, several BJP members have targeted CM Kejriwal, claiming that he denied atrocities faced by Kashmiri Hindus.

BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared a 15-second clip. In the first eight seconds, we see AAP members laughing, following which Kejriwal says, “Won’t even install posters of films based on lies…” Malviya claimed that the Delhi CM denied the atrocities faced by Kashmiri Pandits by terming ‘The Kashmiri Files’ a lie.

BJP leader Kapil Mishra posted a screengrab from CM Kejriwal’s address along with images of injured children. He tweeted, “Calling the massacre of Kashmiri Hindus false is equivalent to questioning your mother’s character. Shame on you Kejriwal. Kejriwal has abused every martyr and army personnel of the country by defending terrorists.”

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Goel tweeted, “Stop making fun of Kashmiri Pandit, Kejriwal. Have some shame.”

Amish Devgan, managing editor of News18 Hindi, also inferred that terming ‘The Kashmir Files’ fake meant denying the atrocities faced by Kashmiri Pandits. His tweet gained over 12,000 likes as of this writing. 

Clipped video, misleading context
Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s full video is available on AAP’s YouTube channel. In the 20-minute address, he speaks about the upcoming Delhi Municipal Corporation election. Nowhere in the video Kejriwal has refuted the 1990 Kashmir violence.

It must be noted that both Amit Malviya and Kapil Mishra have misrepresented his speech to make it appear that Kejriwal and AAP members mocked the plight of Kashmiri Pandits.
