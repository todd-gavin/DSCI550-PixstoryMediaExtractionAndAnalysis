Recently I conducted a workshop in a school in Delhi on ‘Menstruation’ on behalf of CRY LSR. We interacted with 300+ girls, explaining to them about menstruation, hygiene measures they should take and busting the myths. 
While busting the myths, I was really amused with the stereotypes everyone has related to a normal body process. A girl said “my mother does not allow me to go near my brother to talk to him during this time of the year”. WHAT? My reply to her was that until the time you do not go and talk to your brother , it can not be normalised.

In a similar incident, we asked a girl if the session should have happened with boys as audience, she told us that it was better if it was just for girls since it is something related to girls so they can understand it better. 

These two incidents throw light on the fact that PERIODS ARE STILL A TABOO in India. There are many misconceptions related to periods and they need to be cleared at an early age. 
PERIODS ARE NORMAL. Let’s work together to create a safe space where girls can talk about periods in front of boys without hesitation. Let’s be the change!
