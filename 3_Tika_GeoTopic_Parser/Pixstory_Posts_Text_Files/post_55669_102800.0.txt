Scott Morrison has reaffirmed that he has no plans to exit politics following the Coalition's landslide election victory on May 21, and that he intends to give the new Liberal leadership "every support." 

The Guardian reported that given Saturday night's stunning election outcome, the former prime minister was asked on 2GB on Thursday how long he wanted to "hang about" in politics. He stated that he was looking forward to continuing as Cook's member. 

“I’ve got no plans to go anywhere, I am going back to the Shire and re-establishing our life back there and getting the girls back into their routine,” Morrison told the 2GB presenter Ben Fordham.

Morrison downplayed the significance of the Liberal Party's defeat in their metropolitan stronghold, saying it would be up to the incoming leadership to decide whether the party would shift to the centre or to the right.

“Of course I’m disappointed by the result, very disappointed for colleagues who won’t be coming back to the parliament – and there are many issues there,” Morrison said. “But I know the new leadership of the party will get around that and the party will come together.”

He claimed that Barnaby Joyce, the Nationals' leader, informed him that occasionally leaders lose elections because people want to change the curtains. Morrison stated, "This isn't the first time the Liberal Party has lost an election." "This happens in cycles, and the party will reassemble."
