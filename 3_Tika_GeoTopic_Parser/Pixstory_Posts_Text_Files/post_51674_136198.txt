Midfielders are are the back bone of the team as they are responsible for doing both attack and defence for the team There main role is to feed the strikers by passing the ball to them but there are some things which are killing your game as a midfielder and you should try to avoid them All the midfielders need to eliminate these things from their game in order to become an ideal midfielder BODY POSITION Players need to position their body in reference to the game the ball the opponents and their teammates They need to constantly reposition themselves to be ready for the next play This will allow the midfielder to make better decisions SCANNING If you don t scan before you receive the ball you will more often that not return towards crowded areas and make the wrong decisions Your vision will be restricted to where your body is facing resulting in turnovers which can put your team in a difficult situations HEAD UP Players in the middle of the field always need to raise their head to analyse the game to make the best possible decision Midfielder should be photographing the field and constantly taking in various aspect including where the space is And how much time they have and where their opponents and teammates are present Let me know in the notes if this helped you Thankyou
