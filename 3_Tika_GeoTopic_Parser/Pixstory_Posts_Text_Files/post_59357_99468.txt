Covid has exacerbated pre existing inequalities and threatened to halt or even reverse the gains of decades of collective effort As much is still at stake with much has been lost and threatened when it comes to our rights and equality and it even blurred the lines between the workplace and home life essentially overnight Research shows it s affecting women and their role in the workforce As women are experiencing significant impacts from the pandemic when it comes to leaving the workforce or job loss Child care remote learning theses are the responsibilities that all parents bear But is there research out there that s showing women are disproportionately impacted This burden is borne by all parents but we are seeing a disproportionate impact on women Different surveys reveal that on average more hours than fathers of either educating their children or household chores during the pandemic In another survey on the responsibilities of the house reveals that around of men said that the work was shared whereas less than of women said that household work was shared equally The International Labor Organisation ILO states that across the world on average women spend about hours and minutes in household work whereas men spend only an hour and minutes This isn t good especially during times like these When a pandemic strikes all the extra work like the household work as well as the work involved in taking care of family members falls on women So how can the numbers regarding women s employment impact the economy because it is the people who are our most vital resource in the economy So when we underutilized them we re not reaching our full potential as an economy Because many women are highly skilland they are not getting the opportunity they should which could impact the growth in the long run the way you grow an economy in the long run is either you help people be more productive by improving their tools or you increase the size of the workforce And with women dropping out permanently that does put a constraint on labor supply
