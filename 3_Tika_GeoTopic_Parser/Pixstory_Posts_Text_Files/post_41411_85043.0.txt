Faced with threats of boycotts and rising tensions in the Athletes Village, the Winter Paralympics organisers changed direction on Thursday and dismissed athletes from Russia and Belarus. 

U.S News reported that the U-turn came less than 24 hours after the International Paralympic Committee announced that Russians and Belarusians would be allowed to compete in the Games when they begin on Friday, but only as neutral athletes, without their national colours, flags, or other symbols, due to the invasion of Ukraine. 

The Beijing Paralympics, which follow the Winter Olympics, will end on March 13.

“The war has now come to these Games and behind the scenes many governments are having an influence on our cherished event,” IPC President Andrew Parsons said Thursday after announcing the ban. “We were trying to protect the Games from war.”

The IPC, according to Parsons, misjudged the backlash to allowing Russians and Belarusians to compete, even as neutral athletes. The Athletes Village, which Parsons had believed would be a haven for peace, had become a tinderbox. 

The Russian and Belarusian participation was resented not only by Ukrainians, but by everyone.
“We don’t have reports of any specific incidents of aggression or anything like that," Parsons said. 

But it was a very, very volatile environment in the (Athletes) Village. It was a pretty quick escalation that we didn't expect to happen. We didn't expect entire delegations, or even teams within delegations, to pull out, boycott, or refuse to participate.
