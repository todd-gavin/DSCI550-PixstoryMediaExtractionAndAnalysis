Yes, agoraphobia can be overwhelming; having an anxiety disorder can make you avoid places and situations.
Most people avoid certain feelings like the feeling of being trapped, helpless, panicked, embarrassed or scared.
The most common symptom is panic; people with agoraphobia tend to get panic attacks such as rapid heartbeat and nausea whenever they're in a stressful situation.
The bizarre part about it is that you're not always present in the situation when the panic attack begins. Instead, just a thought of it can intimidate you. 
It can reach heights when people start to avoid regular activities like going to the bank or grocery store and staying at homes where they feel most shielded.
According to a National Institute of Mental Health report, "0.8 per cent of American adults have agoraphobia. About 40 per cent of cases are considered severe. When the condition is more advanced, agoraphobia can be very disabling. People with agoraphobia often realize their fear is irrational, but they cannot do anything about it. This can interfere with their relationships and performance at work or school."
