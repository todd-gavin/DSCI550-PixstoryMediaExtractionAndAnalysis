Any defender's major goal in any football team is to make the first break against the opponent's attack. They mostly prevent the opponent's striker from entering their goal box and scoring. A defender can play in a variety of positions, including center-back, wing-back, and side-back. The center-back position, on the other hand, is the most important position in any defensive system.

Ruben Dias (Manchester City)
Ruben Dias swept the awards season of 2020/21, taking up the Football Writers' Association and Premier League Player of the Season honours following a stellar first season at Manchester City. Before the start of the season, he was named to City's captaincy, and he has continued to be a striker's worst nightmare throughout the Sky Blues' first 11 Premier League games.

Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City)
While some players may be disappointed by the lack of relaxation and recovery time provided by a summer competition, Aymeric Laporte is overjoyed. While he was dropped from Manchester City's starting lineup in 2020, he was selected for Euro 21 after switching his international allegiance from France to Spain through his great-grandparents. Regular football was just what the doctor ordered, and he's already displacing John Stones with Ruben Dias in the Premier League.
