Father's Day is here and love this celebration of all the different kind of dads! This is the sweetest ode to fathers and their different, but all equally lovable qualities. It shows daddies of all kinds that have one main thing in coming: daddies that love their kids and spend time showing kids they care.

This book is so fun. It is such a celebration of diversity of modern dads. Dads are DIVERSE. They aren't all one race, all bread winners, or any one, single image. This book is so cool because it depicts a two dad fam, single dad fam, stay at home dad, and shows dads from all over. I. Am. Here. For. It.
