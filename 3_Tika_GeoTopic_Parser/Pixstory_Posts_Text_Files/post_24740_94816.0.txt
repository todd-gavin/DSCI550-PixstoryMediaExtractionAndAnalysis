"My team played very a great game tonight, they grew as the match went on. But I had the feeling that it was very difficult, almost impossible to come away with a positive result.”Mourinho reflected after the match against Napoli at Diego Armando Maradona Stadium in Naples. 



In a clash of top teams in Serie A, Napoli failed to capitalise and earn maximum points to a dazzling AS Roma, who also might be feeling disappointed about not able to win the match. With the draw Roma moved to 5th position, with 58 points from 33 matches while Napoli, who were fighting for top position, are now at 3rd with 67 points from equal games. They are behind Inter Milan, who have 69 points from 32 matches and AC Milan leading the table with 71 points from 33 matches. 


Napoli came up in the match with a goal from penalty by Insigne in the 11th min. Penalty was awarded for a foul on Lozano by  Ibanez. But, after that it was all Roma. They were good in build up and were creative but lacked the finishing. In the first half, Pellegrini's deflected free kick hit the cross bar. 


Tammy Abraham couldn't connect a great deliver from Karsdorp to goal, which should have been n equaliser. Also, Mancini's header from free kick was off target. Zaniolo was brought down by Napoli keeper Meret, but penalty was denied. 


Much awaited equaliser came in the extra time, when a cross from Pellegrini in the right wing, which Abraham left as was marked and El Shaarawy hammered into the net. 


With the draw, Roma improved their unbeaten run to 12 matches. Napoli and Roma have drawn both their Serie A matches for the first time since 1994/95. Roma is the top points collected team in the second half of the season.  In the next two matches, Roma faces tough challenges- Inter and Leicester City in Europa Conference league semi final, both away matches.
