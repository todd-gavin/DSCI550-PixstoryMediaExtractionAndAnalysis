Seth Rollins has been great for WWE. He is one of the best performers of this generation, who will likely go down in the history as the most underrated WWE superstar of all time. 

But he has carved such a niche character for himself that, I don't think he needs to win the Money in the Bank briefcase. Sure he has been great and he put on all time great performances consistently, but just look at how he hasn't lost his spot or credibility as a main eventer.

Rollins doesn't need to win the MITB briefcase, because he can just walk onto smackdown tomorrow to challenge Reigns and it would be believable, as you don't have to build him up. 

WWE should rather take a different route and try to build an up and coming superstar to make sure that they have another legitimate main eventer ready.
