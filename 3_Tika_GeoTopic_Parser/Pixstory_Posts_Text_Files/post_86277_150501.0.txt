Kdrama - GOBLIN Review 
Goblin gives out a serious vibe, yet manages to give us a really sweet wholesome comedic story, without it becoming too cheesy. All of the actors did a splendid job with their characters. We get to see two love stories, heartwarming moments, a hilarious bromance and mysterious characters leading us to unexpected surprises! Watching this drama is like taking a smooth rollercoaster with a fantastic view.
