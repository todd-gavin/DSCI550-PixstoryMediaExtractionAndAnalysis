Second Half


The second half began with Alexander-Arnold sending a cross in Diaz’s direction but he couldn’t reach it in time. It went out for a goal kick. In the 59th minute, there was a quick break by the Los Blancos with Fredrico Valverde running down the wings, he let out a scrumptious assist to Vinicius Junior to slot it past Allison who was standing still.

At this point, Liverpool were getting frustrated with their inability to score goals. Klopp made a quick substitution, he brought Diego Jota on for Luis Diaz, Roberto Firmino for  Thiago Alcantara and Naby Keita for Jordan Henderson. At the 80th minute mark, Liverpool had 21 attempts with 7 on target while Real had measly 2 attempts out of which one was a goal.


In the 82nd minute Salah wiggled past Eder Militao and David Alaba and let out a venomous shot, but Courtois was equal to it as he parried away for a corner kick. It was his 8th save in this match.


Real Madrid brought on Eduardo Camavinga for Valverde, Rodrygo for Vinicius Junior and Dani Ceballos for Luka Modric. Liverpool was doing everything to draw level and take the game to extra time and most probably penalty shootouts. But Real Madrid was the eventual winner. Carlo Ancelloti became the first manager to win the title 4 times, overtaking Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane. 

Luka Modric and Toni Kroos had the most passes with 49 and 77 each. These two players kept the flow of the game going. Kroos had a pass completion of 92.8% and he made 3 progressive passes for his team.
