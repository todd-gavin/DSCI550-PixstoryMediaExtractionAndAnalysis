Anna Syreeni Abstract Aims We aimed to determine how white blood cell WBC telomeres and telomere length change over time are associated with health status in type diabetes Methods Relative telomere length rTL was measured in WBC DNA from two time points median years apart in individuals from the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study by quantitative PCR with interassay CV Results Baseline rTL correlated inversely with age and was shorter in men Individuals in the shortest vs longest rTL tertile had adverse cardiometabolic profiles worse renal function and were prescribed more antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs While overall rTL tended to decrease during the median years of follow up telomeres shortened in of subjects lengthened in and did not change in Baseline rTL correlated inversely with rTL change Telomere lengthening was associated with higher HDL Cholesterol HDL C HDL C ApoA and with antihypertensive drug and inversely with lipid lowering drug commencement during follow up Correlates of rTL percentage change per annum adjusted model were baseline BMI eGFR previous retinal laser treatment HDL C and HDL C ApoA Conclusions Telomere length measurements may facilitate the treatment and monitoring of the health status of individuals with type diabetes Sources
