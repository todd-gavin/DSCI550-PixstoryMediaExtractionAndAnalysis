 Summary Background Diabetes is a major public health issue Because lifetime risk life expectancy and years of life lost are meaningful metrics for clinical decision making we aimed to estimate these measures for type diabetes in the high income setting Methods For this multinational population based study we sourced data from databases for jurisdictions either whole countries or regions of a country Australia Austria Canada Denmark Finland France Germany Hong Kong Hungary Israel Italy Japan Latvia Lithuania the Netherlands Norway Scotland Singapore South Korea Spain Taiwan the UK and the USA Our main outcomes were lifetime risk of type diabetes life expectancy in people with and without type diabetes and years of life lost to type diabetes We modelled the incidence and mortality of type diabetes in people with and without type diabetes in sex stratified age adjusted and calendar year adjusted Poisson models for each jurisdiction Using incidence and mortality we constructed life tables for people of both sexes aged years for each jurisdiction and at two timepoints years apart in the period where possible Life expectancy from a given age was computed as the area under the survival curves and lifetime lost was calculated as the difference between the expected lifetime of people with versus without type diabetes at a given age Lifetime risk was calculated as the proportion of each cohort who developed type diabetes between the ages of years and years We estimated CIs using parametric bootstrapping Interpretation Despite declining lifetime risk and improvements in life expectancy for those with type diabetes in many high income jurisdictions the burden of type diabetes remains substantial Public health strategies might benefit from tailored approaches to continue to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes Sources
