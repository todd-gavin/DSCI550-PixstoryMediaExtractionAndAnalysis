Americans collective student loan burden has nearly doubled in the past decade topping trillion Now a major reason for people choosing Biden for President was his promise to forgive student debt But unfortunately nothing of substance has happened yet in this case Criticisers of Biden are saying that he is just trying to evade the issue by saying that the Biden administration is looking into whether this could be done without Congress s approval They are constantly pressuring Biden to use executive authority to forgive for every borrower But is forgiving the student debt really the way to go According to me yes Firstly we have to keep in mind that education should not be a privilege but a right Unfortunately in our country many students are unable to afford to go to college because of financial reasons This creates a ripple effect wherein because of lack of good education they are unable to get a good job unemployed rates rise and ultimately the economy of the country is affected Even people who are able to somehow make it through student loans spend the majority of their youth trying to pay back the loans and are unable to afford a comfortable life despite working so hard They are unable to acquire wealth buy a house afford insurance and save for their retirement Secondly forgiving student debt will help lessen the racial divide in our country Data on the disparities in the effects of student debt on white and black students has been accumulating for years Here s one of the more eye catching figures The average white borrower has paid off around percent of their original sum after years whereas the average black borrower has paid off only percent As a result student debt is widening the racial wealth gap among younger borrowers and eliminating a significant portion of it would help to close it
