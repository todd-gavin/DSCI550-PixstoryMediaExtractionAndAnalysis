Queen Victoria by Thomas Sully (1783 - 1872)

Red velvet waterfalls, golden tassel sunbeam, rose blush heat — last glance back at yesterday met with witnesses of a thrown crowned youth.

English-born American artist Thomas Sully interprets a young Queen Victoria’s moment of coronation before it takes place, based on five sittings at Buckingham Palace.

[One of my favorite creative writing courses taught me how to use writing as living – to document the experience of a moment rather than attempting to interpret it. I am always faltering to follow this way of living in the ways I hope, but thought I’ll try an altered format with thoughts and details I gathered at the Wallace Collection.]
