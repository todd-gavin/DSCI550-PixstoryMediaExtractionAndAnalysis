Situated in the Shravanabelagola town of Karnataka, Gomateshwara temple is dedicated to Lord Bahubali also known as Gomateshwara. Built in the 10th century, it is one of the most important pilgrimage places for the Jain community.

The statue leaves people around the world in awe because of its unique structure. Standing at an enormous height of 58.8 ft the idol is carved out of a single granite rock. This monolithic structure stands at such a great height without any external support.

The base of the Bahubali idol is decorated with inscriptions written in three different languages – Marathi, Kannada and Tamil. The most important event that is celebrated in the temple once every 12 years is called Mahamastakabhisheka.

It is a very important festival for the Jain community during which Lord Bahubali is bathed and smeared with various ceremonial things like saffron paste, sugarcane, turmeric, milk and vermillion and offered various precious stones and coins of gold and silver.
