India drinks 837,000 tonnes of tea annually, making it the nation's most popular beverage. Chai is served boiled with spices, sugar, and milk by chai wallahs along roadsides because it is a ritual that crosses all boundaries.

There are countless versions available for masala chai, possibly the most popular and commonly drank type of Indian tea. In reality, various regions of the nation are renowned for their distinctive brews; among the most well-liked choices are the cutting chai of Mumbai, the luxurious Irani chai of Hyderabad, and the delicate pink Kashmiri chai.

Cardamom, cloves, ginger, and fennel are common additions to masala chai, however the exact spices used can vary depending on the region and the time of year.

Of course, the preparation process also has a significant impact on the final product's quality. The art of thickening chai to the perfect consistency and boiling it for an adequate amount of time to allow the flavours to fully steep can be seen in great detail at roadside stalls.

Masala chai and filter coffee have just been added to Starbucks' menu, making it the largest coffee chain in the world. The business has been busily updating its menu in recent weeks to better suit Indian tastes. Milkshakes and street-style sandwiches have already been added by Starbucks.

Chole paneer kulcha and turmeric latte are among items offered by the well-known starbucks coffee chain. Four markets—Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Bhopal, and Indore—are currently testing the new products in the menu. Based on the comments received from these cities, the products will be released across the entire country.

The purpose is to get knowledge, observe customer acceptance across markets, pick up on subtleties, check and adjust, and then watch where it goes.

In terms of pricing, the Starbucks chain in India occupies a premium level. Competitors like Costa and Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) sell similar beverages for a much less money.

Like cafes, most chai stalls are also places where people gather to socialise. Here, people of all ages and backgrounds can be heard talking about a wide range of topics, including the weather, politics, sports, current events, and almost anything else.
