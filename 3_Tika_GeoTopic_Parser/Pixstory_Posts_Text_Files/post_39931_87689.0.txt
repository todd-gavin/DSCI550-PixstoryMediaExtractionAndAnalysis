The growing global interest in foraging has prompted Indian chefs to seek out wild delicacies in the country's forested areas and include them into their sophisticated dishes. The blossom of the mahua (Madhuca longifolia) or Indian Butter Tree, which is well known as the main ingredient in the namesake liquor manufactured by Adivasis, has received renewed interest as a result of these discoveries.
Mahua flowers were found by Prateek Sadhu, one of India's hottest new chefs, a few years ago. "The dried mahua reminded me of dates with its pronounced caramel aromas - great for desserts," Sadhu added. He produced an exquisite dessert with mahua-infused ice cream and luscious Pondicherry chocolate, adorned with whisky-soaked mahua blossoms, while experimenting with mahua. He also offered exquisite pork glazed with a sweet and spicy mahua flower and sweet wine glaze. "Right now, I'm working on manufacturing mahua vinegar," he explained.
While mahua's newfound culinary alchemy is intriguing, its history as an edible extends beyond the intricacies of flavor, texture, and scent, as well as its nutritional worth (it is rich in fibre, natural sugars and trace minerals). The mahua tree has long been a cultural touchstone for India's indigenous and rural inhabitants, providing a rich supply of food and medicine that is prayed to, sung about, and ritually protected.
Mahua, whether as a liquor or a food, has long been a part of many cultures' feasts and celebrations, serving as a symbol of both abundance and tenacity. 'Alaai illaatha ooril iluppai poo sarkarai' is a Tamil adage that translates to 'Where there is no sugar factory, Iluppai (mahua flowers in Tamil) is the sugar'. The sugary mahua naturally lends itself to the creation of sweets and festive delicacies by creative cooks. "Give my husband a leaf-cup of mahua spirit, but make the mahua into small sweets for my lover," says a traditional song from central India's forests.
