Animal waste is not the only source of dangerous emissions in the meat industry Our food system relies on energy from fossil fuels to grow prepare and transport food Globally burning fossil fuels is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions accounting for of emissions worldwide Meat requires a lot of processing before it is suitable for human consumption and meat processing requires a lot of energy It takes about kilowatt hours of energy to produce one pound of beef a little under the amount of energy your fridge uses to run for a whole month Plant based sources of protein like beans and nuts require much less processing and are therefore much more energy efficient than meat Making the switch to plant based saves energy consumption and reduces fossil fuel emissions
