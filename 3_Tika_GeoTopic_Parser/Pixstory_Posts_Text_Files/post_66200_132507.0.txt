The Greens are urging the Albanese government to impose a nationwide rent freeze for two years, saying the issue of rental affordability should be elevated to national cabinet ahead of next week’s jobs
Nationally, rents have been rising at the fastest rate in 14 years, up 9.1% in capital cities and 10.8% in regional areas compared to June 2021.
While tenancy laws are different in each state and territory, the Greens are calling for a national approach that would put in place a two-year emergency rent freeze as well as future rental rise caps of 2% for every 24 months, an end to no-grounds evictions, and minimum standards for rent
The idea is not without precedent. The Australian government froze national rents in 1941 as a result of inflation linked to wartime shortages, while the Victorian government put in place a six-month rent freeze during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said “With more and more people renting long term, we desperately need legislated protections against unfair, arbitrary evictions and skyrocketing rents,” he said.
“The rental affordability crisis is destroying regional communities and impacting the broader economy. A rent freeze will help those communities rebuild, tackle the skills shortage and protect livelihoods.
“If the government is serious about cost of living relief, if they’re serious about affordable housing, then it’s a no-brainer to freeze rent rises.”
The Albanese government has promised to build 30,000 social and affordable houses as part of its $10bn social housing fund, which is on top of state forecasts of an extra 15,000 home
“Rents are out of control, millions of Australian renters are struggling to pay the rent, and unless the government wants to see more families sleeping in their cars they need to do their job and act now to stop this crisis boiling over into a national tragedy,” Chandler-Mather said.
The housing minister, Julie Collins, has acknowledged there is a “national housing crisis”
Last month Collins held the first meeting of state and territory housing ministers in five years, and has accused the former government of “a decade of no federal leadership when it comes to housing and homelessness”.
