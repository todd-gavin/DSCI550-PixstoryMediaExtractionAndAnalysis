Lionel Messi joined French side Paris Saint Germain in the summer of 2021. He left his boyhood club of FC Barcelona, where he stayed for more than 16 years. After lackluster management from Barca administration, Messi's contract was left to run out as PSG signed the star-studded player for free.
A signing of that magnitude meant Messi was going to attract the riches from the foreign owners at PSG. He signed a two-year contract that runs through to 2023. L'Equipe had reported initially that Messi's contract is supposed to be earning between $41 to $47 million. After tax reduction, his annual salary was confirmed to be $41 million (£30 million).
It was also reported that if the Argentine chooses to extend his contract in 2023, he would earn an additional £10 million. Currently, he is the second highest earner in the salary list for PSG after his friend Neymar. It may come as a surprise to some that PSG's no.30 earns more than Kylian Mbappe. 
No transfer bonus was included in the contract for Messi but reports suggest that a royalty fee amounting to £15 million will be paid on an annual basis. As a historic measure for European football transfers, it was announced that a small part of his salary would also be paid via cryptocurrency fan tokens.
PSG deal in comparison to Barcelona
Even though his initial contract's bases are huge, PSG's deal with Messi still falls short of what he was earning at FC Barcelona. In a 2017 contract extension, the icon was supposed to receive £486 million over the course of 4 years. 
There is no hiding that Barca want to rehire his services in 2021. The new Laporta administration were keen on keeping him at the club but financial restrictions forced Messi to leave. It remains to be seen if Messi agrees to a contract extension at Paris.
