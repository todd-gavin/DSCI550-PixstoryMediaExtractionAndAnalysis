As we celebrate the world whisky day, let's check out some sides that goes well with the drink. 

Dark Chocolate 

Chocolates and whiskey really go hand in hand with each other. Going for some good dark chocolates are a better option than the sugary chocolates. Dark orange flavoured chocolate is a good go with Scotch. 

Cheese
Cheese accompanied with whisky is very common. Cheddar, blue cheese, soft cheese like goat cheese are fit for the drink. 

Dried Fruits and nuts 

We can never go wrong with dried fruits and nuts. Just be careful while adding the flavours of nuts and whiskey. 

Grilled Steaks 

Steaks go well sit medium bodied whiskies. The dri n have deep and smoky flavor and this really works with beef. 

Meatloaf 

Healthy meatloaf served with some barbecue sauce pairs really well with during whiskies. 

Smoked Salmon 

Smoked Salmon with whiskies with high rye content complement each other really well. 

Apple Crumble or Apple pie 

The dessert with light fragrant whiskies that have a touch of sweetness is really a good combo. The caramel flavours in the bourbon and the apple pie creates an amazing combo.
