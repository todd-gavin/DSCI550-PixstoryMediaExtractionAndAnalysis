Time travel makes regular appearances in popular culture with innumerable time travel storylines in movies television and literature The simplest answer is that time travel cannot be possible because if it was we would already be doing it One can argue that it is forbidden by the laws of physics like the second law of thermodynamics or relativity There are also technical challenges it might be possible but would involve vast amounts of energy We can actually design time machines but most of these in principle successful proposals require negative energy or negative mass which does not seem to exist in our universe If you drop a tennis ball of negative mass it will fall upwards This argument is rather unsatisfactory since it explains why we cannot time travel in practice only by involving another idea that of negative energy or mass that we do not really understand
