One of the most endearing fictional characters of all time is also undoubtedly one of the most tragic It is really hard to imagine one as tragic as Gollum in JRR Tolkien s The Lord Of The Rings Smeagol was a Stoor an ancestral variety of Hobbit who rather than being some kind of tragic hero or villain was simply the unfortunate victim of a power far beyond him and bad luck being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time Ever since Smeagol first laid eyes on the One Ring he was corrupted first in mind and then in body It turned him into a murderer who was then ostracized cast out and isolated He then took the Ring deep into Misty Mountains where he began deteriorating The Ring gave him unnaturally long life prolonging his misery as he lived out most of his life in a dark hole and ultimately morphed into the creature called Gollum His own relationship with the Ring is a complicated one though as put best by Gandalf Smeagol s life is a sad story He hates and loves the Ring as he hates and loves himself this is because the Ring is both his greatest love his precious and his greatest curse Gollum is essentially a corrupted version of Smeagol s personality Smeagol was a small being of decent character who became a murderer He was manipulated corrupted turned into a weak coward whose spirit and life slowly waned into this slimy pitiful creature Gollum Smeagol lost everything his family friends home identity And just when he couldn t lose more his only friend the Ring abandoned him He is later captured and tortured While guiding Frodo and Sam for a brief time his Smeagol persona seems to resurface again only for The Ring to exert its will again causing him to revert to Gollum betray Frodo and ultimately destroy himself Gollum was essentially the reflection of Frodo s ultimate future were he to succumb to the corruption of the Ring Though it is ironic that Smeagol being the one who was most corrupted by The Ring was also the one to destroy it
