 Subh e Banaras must not just be a thing of lore a divine experience must ve touched hearts for sure The thriving expanse of waves of the Ganges and the fresh light rays shimmering on them The sandbanks far away and beaming from behind the clouds the God of Light Morning prayers and temple bells dissolved in the surroundings free birds diving on their tune and a few standstill moments These are the moments in the wake of which numerous centuries have forgotten themselves The moments whose magic engulfs the entire world in itself The subtle sounds of whose arrival came to be known as Subah e Banaras Although every place s morning dawns in its style but Banaras is blessed with two mornings One which occurs in the eastern sky and the Second which happens in the expanse of consciousness That s why it s not just the sun which rises in Banaras but there also ascends within true realisation and knowledge This dawn of realisation gets a new dimension through the north flowing Ganga the testimonials of Ganga s eternal flow the ancient ghats situated alongside the ghats the Pakka Mahal the distinct lifestyle of its residents in every speck of which our culture and traditions are reflected Subh e Banaras is the natural splendour of morning and the Banarasi way of life coming together in a splendid coincidence People don t come here expecting pleasures but they come in the hope of finding bliss That infinite bliss which the Goddess of morning distributes here every day takes one on the journey of the Sun s glorious light from the east to the south the light that colours the Ganga colours the tall structures enlivens the ghats illuminates the lives and the spirit of Benaras and by doing so welcomes the new day
