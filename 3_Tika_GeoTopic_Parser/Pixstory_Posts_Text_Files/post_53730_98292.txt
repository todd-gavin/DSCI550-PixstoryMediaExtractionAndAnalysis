It s hard to survive in bitterly cold Antarctica But the ice continent is home to more than species who have adapted to life on land and in its lakes Penguins are the most well known but Antarctica s diversity lies in its microbes and species like mosses lichens and tardigrades water bears Most of these survive in the few ice free areas on the continent Our new research provides a comprehensive inventory of Antarctic species We believe it will help the nations who are party to the Antarctic Treaty fulfil one of its major conservation goals the continent wide protection of Antarctic species Despite their toughness climate change introduced species and human activities pose growing threats for these species We need rapid and widespread protection for Antarctica s biodiversity if these species are to survive How can so many species live in Antarctica Our inventory found land and lake dwelling species currently known to live on the Antarctic continent This list is dominated by extraordinarily resilient groups such as lichens mosses and invertebrates which have evolved to thrive under extreme conditions The number of species within each taxonomic group that live in Antarctica Groups like bacteria with poorly resolved species lists are excluded Laura M Phillips These species have developed unique adaptations to live in this frozen desert where sub zero temperatures are the norm and life sustaining water is often locked up as ice Read more
