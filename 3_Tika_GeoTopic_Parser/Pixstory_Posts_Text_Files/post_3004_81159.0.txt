First the bad news: A device that puts together all estimates into a number to show how close humankind is to the doomsday has been closest ever to the endpoint. Now for the good news: it has been steady there for the third year now. Is that good news at all?

The latest announcement:
https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/ 

The Doomsday Clock is a project of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded in 1945 by Albert Einstein and University of Chicago scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The clock, launched in 1947, seeks to underline the urgency of preventing the ‘doomsday’ by projecting it over a 24-hour cycle. We are less like to bother about something that may happen several decades later, but on a scale of few seconds, it sounds far more alarming. It has become a well-known indicator of the planet’s vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons, climate change, and other threats. 

The Bulletin’s Science and Security Board ‘sets’ the clock every year in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 11 Nobel laureates. Over 75 years, there were times when we were even as much as 17 minutes away (1991) from the apocalypse but in 2020 for the first time the gap went below two minutes – to 100 seconds. For third year now, there’s no change in the scientists’ estimates of the time left in our hands to do something about saving the earth. 

It could’ve been worse, yes, but there’s no improvement either. Steady is not good news, as a ‘Bulletin’ scientist put it. It seems, in the words of an expert, that “we are stuck in a perilous moment that brings neither stability nor security”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2022/01/20/doomsday-clock-100-seconds/ 

The pandemic, by the way, is not on a major factor. The Bulletin considers it more a wake-up call than an existential threat. The real danger is from climate change and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the global leadership’s failure to find mechanisms to reduce it – as seen in the lack of progress in the negotiations over the Iran nuclear deal.
