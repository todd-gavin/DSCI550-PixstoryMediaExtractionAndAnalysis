It is the voice that remains to command the disturbed spirit of the world and to awaken the dead hearted living from the sleep of perdition Music penetrates the roots of a person like water awakens your innermost feelings to enchant the night to combine the enchantment with the night I am lost with the sound of Leta I have gone to places I had not gone Wherever I knew my soul I met my inner desires My dreams appeared on stage like a romantic movie This is an unforgettable sound a sound that never leaves your heart He walks with the themes of existence exploring you like a termite
