Federico Bernardeschi has scored only 2 goals in 3 years for Juventus, while getting only a very limited amount of assists.

The Italian is now 28 and for a Juventus side that is looking to bring in young and dynamic players, keeping Bernardeschi would be an anti-thesis to the club's direction.

While the ex-Fiorentina man did have a decent spell recently, there are limited guarantees about his fitness as well. Federico Chiesa is yet to return from his injury and ideally, he would be a regular over Bernardeschi. 

In a situation like this, Juve should sign a younger player of a similar profile and let go of a Bernardeschi who offers no guarantee of success or fitness anymore.
