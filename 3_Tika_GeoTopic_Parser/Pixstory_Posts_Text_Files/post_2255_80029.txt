Day It wasn t the first time I was going on a road trip with my family But this time dad took the wheels after a long time We were all thrilled but a bit sceptical of him driving for a hour journey to Manali I was very excited about this one because I have never been to Manali before Mom and dad have been there twice or thrice and they never stopped talking about their experiences and how much fun they had The drive to Manali was a blessing to the eyes The view the experience and the fun we had is unforgettable Before reaching Manali we stopped by a cute little cafe called Suket Cafe located in Sundar Nagar Himachal Pradesh The owner made the best coffee I have ever had Next to the cafe were endless lichee trees so we plucked some of them They tasted so much better than the lichees we have in Delhi sweet and juicy I wish you all could taste them too After the mini food break we decided to drive to Manali without stopping It took us more hours to reach the beautiful property we were planning to stay in We booked a homestay in Manali called Pehlingpa Home Pehlingpa Home is located km from Manali near the National Highway The land is surrounded by apple plum and walnut trees Not just that the majestic Himalayas can be seen via the windows The chirping of birds and the burbles of the holy river Beas signal the start of the day The fact that we could see both the river Beas and the Himalayas was what attracted us to stay at the true beautiful property We reached there around pm after taking some wrong routes some halts some food and water breaks It was getting dark so we decided to rest and have dinner on the property The owner of the property was very kind and humble She gave us some fresh fruits from the garden along with a cup of tea and rajma rice for dinner After a long journey and delicious dinner we doze off
