Even if we have progressed from handwritten letters to sending online texts, there are still a few things that Indian society does not tolerate, one of which is "same sex marriage." Why is it that society does not accept it? What's the issue here? Why is it such a big concern in our society?

In my opinion, if you are uncomfortable with the opposite sex and want to be with someone of the same sex, it is entirely up to you and your decision. No one has the authority to push you into a relationship with which you are not happy. According to the usual Indian mindset, same-sex marriage is an act that goes against Indian culture and customs, and if a family allows their child to live according to their wishes, even if it is legal, society will laugh at them. Every Indian's thinking has been damaged by the remark "what will people say." They are unconcerned about what will happen to them, but they are concerned about everything else.

Just because their families forbid same-sex marriage, there have been numerous incidents of couples contemplating suicide or fleeing their homes to start a new life. It is entirely up to the parents to decide whether they want to prioritise society above their own children or go against the grain and support what is right.
