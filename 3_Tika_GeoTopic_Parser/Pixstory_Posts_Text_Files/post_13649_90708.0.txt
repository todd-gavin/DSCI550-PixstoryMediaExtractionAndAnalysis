Amnesty International: 
In response to the Taliban's decision not to reopen secondary schools, Amnesty International called on countries around the world to set the right to education for women and girls as the red line in their negotiations with Taliban officials. The organization says Afghan women and girls should not be left at this "critical juncture".

 "Amnesty International calls on the international community to redirect the rights of women and girls to education during negotiations with Taliban officials," Amnesty International's South Asia director said Monday.

 He added that the Taliban should allow girls to go to school without further delay and give up "negative excuses to advance their discriminatory program".

The Taliban have said that girls' secondary schools will not be reopened until the school uniform is designed "in accordance with Afghan law, customs and culture."

But Amnesty International calls the Taliban's reason a "trick." "The Taliban's reliance on Afghan law and culture is an old trick to deprive women and girls of their rights," Mishra said.

According to the organization, depriving girls of their right to education will have a far-reaching impact on Afghanistan's prospects for social reconstruction and economic growth.

 Praising the "courage of girls and women who continue to protest and demand the right to education and a better future," he stressed that "the international community should not abandon them at this critical juncture."
