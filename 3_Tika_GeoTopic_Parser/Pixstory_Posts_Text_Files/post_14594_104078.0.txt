Viral infection is a major contributor to the global cancer burden. Recent advances have revealed that six known oncogenic viruses promote tumorigenesis through shared host cell targets and pathways.

Hepatitis Band C Viruses: The hepatitis Band C viruses cause liver cancer in humans.

SV40 and Polyomavirus: Although neither SV40 nor polyomavirus causes human cancer, they are important models for studying the molecular biology of cell transformation. SV40 T antigen induces transformation by interacting with the cellular Rb and p53 tumor suppressor proteins.

Papillomaviruses: Papillomaviruses induce tumors in a variety of animals, including cervical carcinoma in humans. Like SV40 T antigen, the transforming proteins of papilloma viruses interact with Rb and p53.

Adenoviruses: The adenoviruses do not cause naturally occurring cancers in either humans or other species but are important models in cancer research. Their transforming proteins also interact with Rb and p53. 

Herpesviruses: The herpesviruses, which are among the most complex animal viruses, cause cancer in several species, including humans.

Retroviruses: Retroviruses cause cancer in humans and a variety of other animals. Some retroviruses contain specific genes responsible for inducing cell transformation, and studies of these highly oncogenic retroviruses have led to the characterization of both viral and cellular oncogenes.
