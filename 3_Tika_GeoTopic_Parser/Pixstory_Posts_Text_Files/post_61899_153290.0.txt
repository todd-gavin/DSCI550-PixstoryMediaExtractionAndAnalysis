There are a plethora of reasons why Swifties think that "Karma" is a missing album. 
One is that there is an airplane with TS6 on it in her music video for "Look What You Made Me Do," which Taylor spray-paints her "Reputation" over, hinting that there may have been a different plan for TS6, aka her sixth album.
Not to mention in her video for her song "The Man," a subway wall is shown with the titles of all of her albums. "Karma" is included on the wall, despite her never releasing an album with that title. There's a "MISSING" sign next to the word "Karma," as if she was trying to tell fans that "Karma" was missing from her album lineup. 
But is "Karma" missing? We definitely know that it's a track name on "Midnights," but could it also be a secret album that Taylor recorded and never released? And if so, will there be Kanye references? We're stumped on that one. 
There's another theory circulating that Taylor teamed up with Drake for a diss track about Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.
Per The Sun, sources claim that Taylor and Drake previously record a diss track about the former husband-and-wife for Taylor's "Reputation" album. However, the song was never released.
Given that Taylor is currently re-recording all of her albums so she owns the masters to them, some Swifties believe she will include the track on her re-release of "Reputation," which hasn't even been announced yet.
But other Swifties believe that "Karma," the 11th track on her upcoming release "Midnights," might actually be her iconic diss track with the Toronto rapper â€” which makes us even more stoked about this upcoming release.
