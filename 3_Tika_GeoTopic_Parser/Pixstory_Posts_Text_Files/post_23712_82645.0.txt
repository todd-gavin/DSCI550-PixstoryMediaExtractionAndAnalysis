Located in the hilly town of Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, the temple is also known as Tirumala Venkateswara temple. The temple is devoted to Lord Venkateshwara, who is popularly called ‘Balaji’ and is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu.

Venkateshwara Tirupati Balaji is the second richest temple in India. The ancient temple was visited by many rulers of great South-Indian dynasties. The temple celebrates many festivals, most famous of them being Brahmotsavam (also known as ‘Salakatla brahmotsavam’), which goes on for 9 days and witnesses thousands of devotees.

The prasadam offered in the shrine is famous all around the world for its unique delectable taste. As a religious ritual, people get their heads tonsured in large numbers here, so much so that every year about 6 million US dollars are earned through the auction of hairs.
