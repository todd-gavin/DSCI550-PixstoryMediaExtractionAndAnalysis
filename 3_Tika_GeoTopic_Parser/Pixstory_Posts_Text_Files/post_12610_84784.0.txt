To begin to define self-compassion, we must first define compassion. They are, in fact, one and the same. Compassion is a state of mind that includes a set of emotions, thoughts, intentions, wants, drives, and behaviors directed toward any living being (e.g., ourselves, another person, a group of people, a society, animals, the environment). As a result, when we talk about self-compassion, we're referring to an attitude that is directed solely at ourselves.
Self-compassion is acknowledging our own sorrow and suffering and accepting that, while unpleasant, it is a typical human experience. Self-compassion also includes directing feelings of kindness and caring toward oneself, as well as concentrating our attention and energy on ways to ease our discomfort.
Self-compassion can have a huge impact on our mental health and happiness. Self-compassion, in particular, can engage our soothe system, which relaxes both our threat system (which detects possible threats in order to defend ourselves) and our drive system (the system that spurs us on to get things done and be active in life). Our danger and drive systems become overactive without our soothe system, which can lead to challenging feelings like anxiety, rage, and sadness.
Self-criticism is the polar opposite of compassion. Any problem we confront can trigger our danger system, which leads to nervous, angry, or sad responses. When we use self-criticism as a coping mechanism for whatever we're going through, we're just keeping the danger system alive, which keeps us caught in the problem and our emotional pain. Developing the ability to relate to oneself with compassion is especially beneficial for those who are extremely critical of themselves.
