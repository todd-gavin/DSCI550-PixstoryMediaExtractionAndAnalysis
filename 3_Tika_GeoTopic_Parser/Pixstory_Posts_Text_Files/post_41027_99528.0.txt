In a new ad for Vital Proteins launched on Monday, May 9, Jennifer Aniston addresses the question, "What keeps me vital?" According to Hollywood Life, the commercial featured the 53-year-old actress doing a variety of tasks in her multimillion-dollar house, including playing with her dogs, cleaning the bed, making smoothies, and working out. It also shows her munching on some Vital Proteins bars that appear to be delicious. 

Jennifer describes numerous things that make her feel "alive" during the narration, which is interspersed with video of her around the house and images of her with friends. "It's very important to have meaningful work, something to be enthusiastic about, something to improve at, time to contemplate, and play as well. Friendship is essential. Connection and community. When strong emotions occur, activity is essential."

In an Instagram post, Jennifer called making the ad “fun,” and she seems to be very excited to work with the company. “I spent the last year collaborating closely with the Vital Proteins team on this new bar collection, helping to handpick the ingredients and flavors that I love. I can’t wait for people to try them out,” she said in a press release.
