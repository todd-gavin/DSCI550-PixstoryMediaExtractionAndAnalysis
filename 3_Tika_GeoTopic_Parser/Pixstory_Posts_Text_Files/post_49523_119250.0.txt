This is such an ignorant take. Considering what our gender has done for ages and still continue to do, women asking us to be feminists is the kindest thing they can do. And it's the bare minimum we can. As people who hold this kind of power in the structure, we should be loud about it.

All men benefit from patriarchy so all men have to make conscious efforts in bringing equal rights for women. We cannot sit back, we have to participate.

Men, we must be feminists.

We must learn how to be feminists. We must learn how to treat women with respect and kindness. We must learn how not to abuse them or use them as objects for our pleasure or sexual gratification. We must learn how not to attack them when they speak out against injustice or inequality or when they try to address issues that affect us as men first before women.

We need to stop blaming women for their own oppression and be accountable for our own part in it as well as our role in maintaining patriarchy by ignoring feminism and other forms of activism geared towards equality between genders.

And it sounds so bizarre that I am having to say it out loud. That we don't understand by ourselves that women are humans.

There is no fair way to exist other than being a feminist. You're either a feminist, or a bad person.
