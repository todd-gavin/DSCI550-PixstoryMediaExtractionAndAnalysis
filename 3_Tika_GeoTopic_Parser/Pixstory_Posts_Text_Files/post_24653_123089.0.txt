Mohamed Salah kept up his incredible record on the opening day, scoring for the sixth-straight year. 


After helping Fulham to promote scoring 43 goals in previous season in championship, Aleksander Mitrovic scored twice in the opening match against Liverpool. Liverpool came from behind to save the point and match with the help of goals from debutant Darwin Núñez and Mo Salah.

"The best thing about the game was that we got the point from a really bad performance on our side.


From the start the attitude was not right and we played all their cards, then it was difficult to come back. When we did find some direction, we had probably the better chances. 


There is massive room for improvement. We started the game completely the opposite of how we wanted to start it. We could have won but that would have been a bit too much today." Klopp reflected after the match. 



Earlier, Mitrovic connected a long cross from right wing past Alisson. Alex Arnold couldn't prevent serbian striker at far post. Diaz hit the post in the 39th minute. Score remained 1-0 during the halftime break. Klopp replaced Thiago and Fabinho in the midfield and Firmino in the attack soon after half-time.  Nunez found the net in just 13 minutes after coming in. Salah moved through the right flank and sent the ball for Nunez in front of goal, who backheeled the ball into the net. 


Mitrovic was fouled by Van Dijk in the box and was awarded a penalty, which he converted to give Fulham lead again. The ball went to bottom-right corner away from the dive of Alisson.


Alexander-Arnold floats a ball over the top for Nunez and Salah to attack. It hits Nunez and falls for Salah to poke past Rodak and into the back of the net.


Fulham were unbeaten across both Premier League games against Liverpool in 2020-21, drawing 1-1 at home and winning 1-0 at Anfield. Despite suffering relegation that season.
