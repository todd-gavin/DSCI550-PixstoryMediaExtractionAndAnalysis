Zits are small, red, inflamed spots that often appear on the skin in clusters. They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the face, neck, and chest.
Zits are usually caused by an increase in oil production on the skin's surface. This oil is made up of sebum (a fatty substance) and dead skin cells. When these two substances mix together, they form a thick mixture that clogs your pores and causes your zit to form.
There are a few factors that can contribute to zits:
- genetics: Some people are more prone to them than others.
- hormones: Zits can also be affected by fluctuations in your hormone levels during puberty, pregnancy or menopause.
- environmental factors: Stress, pollution and extreme temperatures all play a role in causing them. 
- diet: Certain foods and drinks can aggravate zits, including high sugar levels and unhealthy fats.
There are a few things you can do to help prevent zits from forming: 
- Keep your skin clean and moisturized. This will help keep it free from oils and reduse the amount of sebum produced. 
- Use a acne treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. These chemicals break down the oils and reduce inflammation in the area. 
- Avoid wearing too much makeup or pulling your hair too tight when you have zits â€“ both of which can cause them to become bigger and more difficult to treat.
