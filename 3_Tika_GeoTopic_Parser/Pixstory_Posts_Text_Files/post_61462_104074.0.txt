Summer has a flavor like no other. Always fresh and simmered in sunshine.🌞
There is something about summer that just brings the life out of us..💫 When I figured out how to work my grill, it was quite a moment. I discovered that summer is a completely different experience when you know how to grill. 
Summer is the annual permission slip to be lazy to just lay down on the bed and watch web series..😂 It is a grave error to assume that ice cream consumption requires hot weather🍦😜
