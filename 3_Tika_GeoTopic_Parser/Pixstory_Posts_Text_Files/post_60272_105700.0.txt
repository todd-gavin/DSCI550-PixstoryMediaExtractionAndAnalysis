Avani Lekhara of the Tokyo Paralympics won gold in the Para Shooting World Cup on Tuesday in Chateauroux, France, with a world record score of 250.6 in the women's 10m air rifle standing SH1. The 20-year-old shooter shattered her own world record of 249.6 to qualify for the 2024 Paralympics in Paris. Emilia Babska of Poland took second place with a score of 247.6, while Anna Normann of Sweden took third place with a score of 225.6. Athletes in the SH1 category compete in rifle events despite having lower limb limitation.

Lekhara won the championship three days after her coach and escort were first denied visas, putting her at risk of missing the event.

After the Sports Authority of India and the Ministry of Sports intervened, the problem was remedied.

"Proud to win gold in the R2 10M Air Rifle SH1 event at the Chateauroux2022, with a WR score and India's first Paris2024 Quota." Since the paralympics, this is my 1st international event. "I'd like to express my gratitude to everyone who has helped me!" she wrote on Twitter.
