Some women uphold patriarchy some men are against patriarchy They are time and again tried to be pulled down So are they the victims of patriarchy too In a way Men are not the victims of patriarchy They are the perpetrators They are the leaders patriarchy by definition means male dominance Patriarchy is a system a full system built to end the identity of women reducing them to objects of desire and lust taking away their freedom from them clipping apart their wings It s a system as old as time which has been used to not only kill us but also to celebrate that kill We often undermine just how much damage patriarchy has done to women of the past and the present From the witch hunts to honor killings Women have been stoned to death for wanting to make a choice Men don t have a system trying to kill them for their gender So no men are not the victim of it and there s no in a way here Do not take away from the plight of the real victims of patriarchy by mistaking your flawed privilege with victimhood Do not make it about yourself You have not seen even the tip of what patriarchy is about Victims of toxic masculinity however Men probably are But then again it was men who decided that it was collateral damage Women have NOTHING to do with it so we shouldn t be expected to bear the responsibility of what we didn t create another thing while the victims of a system can uphold that system it again is birthed by the privilege of her oppressor who turned her against her own kind That is our fight however we will fight it We need men to stop the men we will take care of educating the women
