If Manchester United reached the top four in the English Premier League table, this Spanish goalkeeper is the main reason behind it. 31 year old David de Gea is making amazing saves this season, most of them saving the team from losses. That is one reason for a team who scored 40 goals and conceded 32, with just 8 goal difference, is at 4th place. 

De Gea was the player of the month in January, first goalkeeper to win the award after 6 years. He is topping the saves table with 92 saves, 12 more than second placed Meslier of Leeds. Alison is at 16th and Ederson at 17th with 47 and 42 saves respectively. We have seen him very frustrated in the matches, when he wasn't getting enough support from defending players. In the last match against Brighton, he made a magical save to deny Jakub Moder, which was important in the match. It is said that, without De Gea, United is now a mid table team. 

De Gea is at the top of most minutes played so far in the season with2250.From 25 matches, he has got 6 clean sheets. Last season, he was at 19th, with 60 saves from 26 matches, 9 clean sheets.

De Gea is approaching the club record of most clean sheets now- being the top 12th player to feature for a single club in English premier league with 364 matches. He has won the Premier league, FA Cup, EFL and UEFA Europa league with United. He was also awarded the Premier league Golden Glove in 2017-18. He has also won UEFA U21, U17 championships with Spain, and was part of the team which became runner up in U17 World Cup (2007) and Nations League (2021). 

Madrid born De Gea joined United in 2010-11 season as a replacement for legendary keeper Edwin Van Der sar. De Gea was just 20 then, but already giving incredible performances at Atletico Madrid and winning UEFA Europa league and UEFA Super cup. He will be having some nostalgic moments when he returns to Estadia Wanda Metropolitano on Feb 24 to play against Atletico Madrid in UCL.
