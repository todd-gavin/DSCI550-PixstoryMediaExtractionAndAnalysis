To mark the auspicious beginning of 43-days long celebration of Amarnath pilgrimage, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Thursday performed the Puja of Baba Barfani and prayed for peace, happiness and prosperity of all.

I have full faith that the devotees traveling from all over the country to seek the divine blessings of shri Amarnathji will have a safe and memorable pilgrimage, the Lt Governor said.

Expecting a heavy footfall of yatris, the UT government and SASB have made extensive arrangements for Shri Amarnathji Yatra this year.

The devotees can have ‘Darshan’ of the Holy Ice Lingam at the Holy Cave Shrine through live telecast of Morning and Evening Arti through Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board's website link: http://www.shriamarnathjishrine.com/AartiLive.html  or through Shrine Board’s Android based Application which may be downloaded through the link: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ncog.shriamarnath
