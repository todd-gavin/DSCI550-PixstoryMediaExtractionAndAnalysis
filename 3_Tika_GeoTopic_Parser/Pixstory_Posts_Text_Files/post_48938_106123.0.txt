Arla Foods, the UK's largest dairy producer, began a campaign in April based on their own data, claiming that the rise of veganism among young people is to blame for the dairy industry's precarious state. 

According to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA), dairy milk sales in the United States fell by $1.1 billion in 2018, from $14.7 billion in 2017 to $13.6 billion in 2018.

The last two years have been hard on dairy industry too. The Arla campaign titled "Don't Cancel The Cow" portrays an industry that "feels under siege." Rather than blaming the government or the vagaries of capitalism, Alwx Heffron, a british dairy farmer, claims that dairy producers "scapegoat" vegans as "this sort of radical lobby [that] is going to lead to the downfall of the dairy business."

In reaction to the rise of Veganuary, the dairy industry has pushed "Februdairy" since February 2018.

However, even after these numerous attempts, the dairy industry continues to fall as the world grows more aware of Climate Change, Human Rights, Animal Abuse and how the animal agriculture industry exploits all of them.

As far as blaming vegans is concerned - where the animal agriculture industry keep saying that vegans are responsible for the decline in their sales â€“ um, yeah, that's the plan.
