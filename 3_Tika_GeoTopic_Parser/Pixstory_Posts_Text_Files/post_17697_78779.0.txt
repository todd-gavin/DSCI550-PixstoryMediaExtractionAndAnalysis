In 2021, cybercriminals laundered $8.6 billion in cryptocurrency. 

Money laundering is the process of transforming money obtained from illicit activity, such as smuggling firearms, drug trafficking, and so on, into money that appears to have come from a legitimate economic operation. Although cryptocurrencies provide a high rate of return, they are also vulnerable to cyber threats. 

In the year 2021, cybercriminals laundered $8.6 billion in cryptocurrencies, up 30% from 2020 according to Chainalysis. It should be emphasised that more than $33 billion in bitcoin has been laundered since 2017. 

According to the '2022 Crypto Crime Report,' more than $33 billion in bitcoin has been laundered since 2017, with the majority of the money travelling through cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Chainalysis, at least 17% of the $8.6 billion laundered went to decentralised finance applications. 

In addition, according to recent research by Chainalysis, scammers took over $14 billion in bitcoin from victims in 2021, up from $7.8 billion in 2020. According to Chainalysis, illegitimate addresses possess approximately $10 billion in cryptocurrencies as of early 2022, with the majority of this held by wallets linked to cryptocurrency theft. 

In a December analysis, Chainalysis indicated that at least 36% of victims lost over $2.8 billion (about Rs 280 crores) due to 'rug pull' crimes. In the cryptocurrency sector, a rug pull is a hostile manoeuvre in which crypto engineers abandon a project and flee with investors' assets. Crypto frauds increased by 81 per cent this year compared to 2020, with rug pulls leading the way.
