Far beyond these worldly stars of pleasure,
I feel a presence of a beautiful light;
For far more than just leisure,
Beyond the view of my ordinary sight.
Straight from the gardens so tranquil,
That even Adam couldn't resist.
Never seen someone so effortlessly beautiful,
When will she care to pay my heart a visit.
Present in my every thought,
A prisoner to her reign;
To my knees I've been brought,
With love flowing in every vein.
When I saw her pristine eyes I realised,
She is everything my heart ever desired.

                                                                   - Mir
