Supporters of a government-run national health-care system frequently urge the US to learn from other countries' experiences, and they are correct. However, this does not always stand true. 

Universal health insurance does not always imply universal health care access. In actuality, several countries claim to provide universal coverage but ration care or have extremely long treatment wait lists. Waiting lists, rationing, restrictions on physician choice, and other impediments to care are particularly common in nations with single payer systems or systems substantially weighted toward government control.

Furthermore, Cato tells us that rising health care spending is not a uniquely American phenomenon. While other countries spend considerably less than the U.S. on health care both as a percentage of GDP and per capita, it is often because they begin with a lower base of expenditures. But their costs are still rising, leading to budget deficits, tax increases, and/​or benefit cuts. In 2004, the last year for which data is available, the average annual increase for per capita health spending in European countries was 5.55 percent, only slightly lower than the United States’ 6.21 percent. As the Wall Street Journal notes, Europeans face steeper medical bills in the future in their cash‐​strapped governments. 

Moreover, universal healthcare just CANNOT work in US where the system is ideal. While no country with universal coverage is considering abandoning it, countries with national health-care systems are increasingly moving away from centralised government control and introducing more market-oriented elements. 

As a result, even as the United States discusses whether to adopt a government-run system, countries that already have one are arguing how to make theirs appear more like the United States.
