The Greenland ice sheet is a vast body of ice covering about per cent of the island of Greenland It is considered the second largest ice mass after the Antarctic ice sheet It lies from N northwards between the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean The ice sheet covers almost of Greenland s landmass expanding an area of over million km The ice from the centre flows through a series of drainage networks with both outlet glaciers and ice streams all flowing towards the ocean with some ending in glacial ice tongues Ice sheets are present from million to million years ago nbsp On the ice sheet temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland The lowest mean annual temperatures about C F occur on the north central part of the north dome and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about C F On December a temperature of C F was recorded at an automatic weather station near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet making it the lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere The record went unnoticed for more than years and was finally recognized in Knowing about the Greenland ice sheet is important because it plays an integral role in the global climate system and directly impacts the sea levels
