Right then. The winning streak is over. 3-1 United. A game that I think everyone will admit we were the better team in for 70 minutes, but ultimately our opposition were clinical. Terrible defending. As always, let’s do some player ratings…

Ramsdale - 6 - Not the reason we lost, but conceded three. One nice save from his mistake.

Zinchenko - 6 - Not bad. Could have done a lot better for the first goal.

Gabriel - 5 - Seems to struggle in the big occasions. 

Saliba - 5 - First game against the ‘Big 6’, and he struggled. Poor for the goals.

White - 6 - Not a terrible performance but ultimately he was part of a back 4 that conceded 3.

Lokonga - 5 - Unfortunately, our fears were right. Just looked out of place today.

Xhaka - 6 - Didn’t have his finest game but was far from bad.

Ødegaard - 6 - Thought he was good today, but my god. Please shoot when you can.

Martinelli - 7 - Always bright, one of our best players. l

Jesus - 7 - Kept getting fouled, referee gave him no help. He was good, I thought.

Saka - 7 - Happy that he got his goal. He was pretty good today. Unlucky to be on the losing team.

As for the substitutes, I don’t have much to say. I thought Arteta was naive for his first three, they were always going to score against that midfield we had. Vieira looked up for the occasion - it’s good to finally see him.

We have to go again…
