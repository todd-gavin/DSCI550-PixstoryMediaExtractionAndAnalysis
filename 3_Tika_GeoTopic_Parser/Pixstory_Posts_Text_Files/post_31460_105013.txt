just these days the publication of the Report of the World Meteorological Organization WMO on the state of health of the global climate referring to the data collected from the previous year which describes a worrying situation due to Climate Change in the rise of sea level the concentrations of greenhouse gases and ocean acidification and warming have set new alarming records As far as food is concerned, we know that its production as a whole contributes to generating approximately 1 of the total greenhouse gas emissions with a large responsibility of food of animal origin which alone accounts for almost of these emissions It is therefore increasingly clear that none of us can avoid adopting conscious choices that also involve a change in eating habits. Catering businesses, where water energy waste and the production of waste are often disproportionate and unsustainable, must place themselves at the forefront of adopting of virtuous behavior Feeding means drawing from precious natural resources What we call sustainable is a responsible food choice that is concerned with consuming only those resources that can be regenerated without incurring debts with nature that future generations will not be able to repay, declares Barbara Meggetto, president of Legambiente Lombardia In recent decades, in countries like ours, food choices have not been inspired by this fundamental criterion. For this reason, it is necessary to rethink wrong and unhealthy habits, for example by abolishing waste and reducing the consumption of meat and dairy products so that they return to being an enrichment and not a replacement of a healthy diet we are happy to welcome an event in which the world of haute cuisine presents itself as a spokesman for the ecological transition
