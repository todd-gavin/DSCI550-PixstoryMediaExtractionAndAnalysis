Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said ahead of her visit to India that countries should show "magnanimity" when asked about incidents of attacks on the Hindu community in her country, asserting that Bangladesh is a secular country and that her government takes immediate action when such incidents occur.
Several media outlets have reported on attacks and hostility directed at Bangladesh's minority Hindu population. Vandalism was also reported at Durga Puja pandals, or Hindu temples.
Hasina stated that her government strongly supports secularism and that any attempt to disrupt communal harmony will be dealt with immediately.
