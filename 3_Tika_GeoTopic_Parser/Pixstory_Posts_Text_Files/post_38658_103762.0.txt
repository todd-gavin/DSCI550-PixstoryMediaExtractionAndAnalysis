So the Champions final involving one of the heavyweights in Spain and England was played. Real Madrid, 13 times Champions League Winner, were chasing the 14th. While Liverpool, 6 times UCL winners, were looking to make it 7th. Carlo Ancelotti was looking to make history by winning the title 4 times - more than any other manager in history. Liverpool were looking to take revenge from Real Madrid after they lost the 2018 final courtesy of Loris Karius's 2 howlers and Gareth Baleâ€™s magical overhead kick. It was also big for Sadio Mane as he was going to decide his future on how the match finished.


The match was already delayed for about 45 minutes as some 2000 Liverpool fans were barred from entering the venue as they were carrying fake tickets. As per the news, tear gas and pepper gas were used to disperse the crowd.


The match referee was Clement Turpin. Both sides had opted to go with the conventional formation of 4-3-3, which can be easily transitioned to 4-2-3-1.
Liverpool pressed Real Madrid from the start after a quick kickoff. Salah forced Courtois to make the first save of the night with a sharp shot. Liverpool were playing fluid football, stitching up passes and moving forward, which was putting Real Madrid on the back foot. In the 21st minute, Sadio Mane let out a venomous strike which Courtois palmed towards the post before running and recovering the ball from further damage. In the first 25th minute, Liverpool enjoyed 60% possession. But as we know in football, possession looks good only on paper. If you are not winning then possession means nothing.


Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior put in an aerial cross for Karim Benzema, but it was collected by Allison. Liverpool had 8 shots on goal with 6 on target but there was no goal, and yet the first half was not done yet.
