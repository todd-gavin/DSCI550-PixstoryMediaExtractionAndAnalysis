In India's jungles, about 200 years ago, there were 58,000 tigers roaming around freely. By the 1970s, the numbers have fallen down to 2,000. 

In 1973, India designated the tiger as its national animal and subsequently launched 'Project Tiger' aimed at increasing the population of the striped jungle cat.

According to a report by the National Tiger Conservation Authority ( NTCA), only 1411 jungle cats are left in the country. Experts fear that the species is now moving towards extinction. In almost 3 decades, the population of tigers has dropped by 30 percent.

The causes of the drop are hunting, loss of habitat, environmental degradation & human-wildlife conflict.

However, India has achieved great success in the conservation of its tiger population by doubling its numbers to almost 3,000 as per the 2021 census.

The efforts of conservation began on a global level when 13 countries united to save their tigers & double their numbers by 2022. This included India, Nepal, and Bhutan

India achieved its goal by investing billions. These funds were used to study the animal's behavior, researching & exploring the areas to provide them with a suitable environment.

Crackdowns on organized poaching gangs were conducted by agencies and it has almost died with only individual poachers remaining.

We might have been a tad successful in the last decade but the danger isn't over as the loss of natural green habitats and environmental degradation is still a reality, and will continue to be unless more efforts are made for its conservation.
