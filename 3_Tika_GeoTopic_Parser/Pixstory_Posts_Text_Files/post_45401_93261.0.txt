The countdown for the quadrennial football festival, FIFA World Cup 2022, has begun with the allotment of groups to the teams through a recent draw. According to a few fans, the strong teams have got an easy pass to the next stage whereas, for the other section of fans, it is as competitive as it was. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are on the swansong of their career and will look to cap it off with a World Cup to their name. 

Group A

Teams: Qatar, Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal

Qatar being the host nation are presented in Group A alongside Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal. The Netherlands are in great form at the moment and Louis van Gaal will hope to redeem himself. On the other hand, Senegal would not be an easy side to tackle as they pipped Egypt twice in recent times. They are the AFCON winners and were able to go past Egypt again in the play-offs as well. 

Ecuador have struggled to qualify for the World Cup and Enner Valencia managed to take the team past the line to qualify for the WC. They are the dark horses of the group and are not the favorites to go past the group stage. 

Expected Group Winner: Netherlands
Surprise Element: Ecuador...........
