Fernando Torres joined Liverpool during the summer transfer window of 2007, and stayed for
nearly four years. Liverpool signed Fernando Torres in one of the best transfers of the Premier
League history during the summer transfer window ten years ago.

The Spaniard scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League games for the Reds before joining
Chelsea for £50 million in January 2011 - about £30 million more than the Reds had paid,
according to BBC Sport – when the Spaniard's displays of magic became less and less
frequent.

Let's take a look at the players that were on the field with Torres on his Liverpool debut and see
where they are now.

Pepe Reina would continue at Liverpool until 2014, however he would spend the previous
season on loan at Napoli before joining Bayern Munich for a year. Since 2015, he has been
back at Napoli.
