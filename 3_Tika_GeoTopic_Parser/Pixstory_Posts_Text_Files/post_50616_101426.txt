Exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for many chronic diseases including chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases There is wide recognition that people with such conditions are at increased vulnerability from COVID and may thus be prone to a more severe course of the disease The World Health Organization and a number of national public health authorities have also issued warnings for citizens with these pre existing conditions of greater risks of complications from COVID WHO Like it has been estimated that long term exposure to air pollution from PM contributed to about of COVID mortality in Europe through its effect in increasing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases but the confidence intervals around this estimate are wide reflecting high levels of uncertainties In addition some studies suggest that air pollution PM in particular may increase the risk of infection by acting as a vehicle spreading the virus While there are some concerns that air pollution could carry the virus over longer distances at this stage it is not known whether the virus remains viable on pollution particles Further research is needed to verify this hypothesis On the other hand the confinement measures that have been put in place to reduce the spread of the coronavirus have led to at least a temporary reduction in air pollution Reductions in economic and social activities led to significant decreases in certain types of pollution notably in nitrogen dioxide NO largely due to reduced traffic and other activities especially in major cities
