Yahoo News reporter Kate Murphy interviewed Derek Black professor of law at the University of South Carolina about the potential of change from the upcoming ruling When asked how the new makeup of supreme court can affect the decision he says The composition has changed quite a bit since the last time the Supreme Court took up these issues Fisher v Texas in and Justice Kennedy was still on the court In two cases he voted to uphold diversity and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was still on the court then So both of those yes votes for diversity are gone and both of them have been replaced with more conservative members of the court In the Harvard case you potentially lost a third of the vote Justice Breyer retired and was replaced by Justice Jackson who based upon past writings could be sympathetic to a diversity hearing but because she serves on the board of overseers at Harvard she recused herself from the Harvard case So there s only eight justices hearing the Harvard case and two of the previous yes votes are gone Three if you consider there s only eight people So there s a pretty narrow path to victory in the Harvard case but Justice Jackson is hearing the North Carolina case So even though she s not on the Harvard case they can t render cases that are constitutionally inconsistent with one another
