Tottenham Hotspur 

Grade - D

The January transfer window was frustrating for Spurs as they ended up signing two players but missed out on several top targets.

Antonio Conte wanted Adama Traore and Luis Diaz, and he ended up with neither.

Traore moved to Barcelona, and Diaz joined Liverpool. This left Spurs in an awful position, but they moved quickly to add Dejan Kulusveski and Rodrigo Bentancur before the window closed.

Tottenham also managed to offload the likes of Tanguy Ndombele, Bryan Gil, Dele Alli and Giovani Lo Celso.

All were clearly not in Conte's plans.

So, you have to credit Tottenham for getting rid of them and potentially bagging £40million for Alli (Sky Sports).

However, Alli, Lo Celso, Ndombele and Gil cost Spurs over £100million to sign, which is a poor reflection on their recruitment in the past.

Hopefully, all four can rediscover form because they all have talent.

I have graded Spurs so low because they really needed more than two additions, and you wouldn't say that Bentancur or Kuluveski are guaranteed to start.

Bentancur will have to compete with the likes of Oliver Skipp and Harry Winks, while Kuluveski will have to compete with Lucas Moura or hope that Conte changes formation to accommodate him.

Hopefully, both prove to be good signings, but I can't help feel like Spurs should have strengthened the squad further to show Conte that they are committed to him and his style.

Conte has the skills to get Spurs into the top four, but if they suffer an injury to Harry Kane or Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, you worry about the strength in depth.

Overall, Spurs should have done much better in this window, and Conte has every right to be frustrated.
