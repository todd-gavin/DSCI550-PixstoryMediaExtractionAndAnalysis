The Portuguese superstar's contract at Old Trafford has one year left on it, but the club's troubles may force him to go. 

According to Dimitar Berbatov, Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Manchester United this summer due to a lack of Champions League play, with the Portuguese superstar facing some major career decisions.

When making an emotional return to Old Trafford in 2021, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner signed a two-year contract. 

He has scored 23 goals in his first season back in England, but his exploits have not been enough to secure a top-four finish or major silverware, leading to speculation that the all-time great may decide to pursue his dreams elsewhere at the age of 37, with a possible return to Real Madrid being discussed.

former Red Devils striker Berbatov said of a man he spent the 2008-09 season playing alongside at United: "Ronaldo is doing remarkably well for his age with the way he plays and the goals he scores.

" At his age, scoring so many Premier League goals in a season is a remarkable achievement. He's doing exactly what he should be doing, which is scoring goals.

â€œHis game is different now than it was before, but one thing is a constant, the goals. He still produces and scores which is so important.

Every season of Ronaldo's senior career has included some form of Champions League action.

 He hasn't always been a part of the competition's group stage and beyond, but he did appear in a qualification match against Inter during his 2002-03 season with Sporting.

Since then, he has gone on to become the all-time leading striker on the premier European stage, scoring 140 times in 183 games and winning five continental titles. 

The first occurred during a first term with United in 2008, with the remaining four coming during a record-breaking stint at Real Madrid from 2013-14 to 2017-18
