But my nephew did not give up he proposed for three more years until my father threatened him and his family with death and threatened me that I would give you to an old man He said to me You are a stain of shame I was willing to gamble with my life But he did not show up pulled out his needle again and struck the reed He was singing strangely The song of homelessness and misery Ni ash sang a song of separation Sing My Ruin He wanted to say goodbye to me I wanted to not let him go but my father stopped me He left and never looked behind her her last words were I will become a martyr a nomadic girl Delberi is a nomad Then this word went and never came again I never saw him again I did not know where he was and what he was doing I had nothing from him I felt my house was destroyed I had no memories of him when he left So I went and put my hand on the ground I caught a handful of dirt on the ground he had stepped on This map is the soil My whole being And the signs of my seventy years of love I grew old but this love never grew old
