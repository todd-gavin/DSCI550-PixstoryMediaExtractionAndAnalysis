Has healing been a rollercoaster ride for you?🎢
When you are on your healing journey it is always so exciting to see the fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, and other symptoms improving!💫
While this is a wonderful thing, it's always important to stay in tune with your body as the healing journey continues to monitor if these symptoms end up creeping back in.
Asking yourself questions like "why am I feeling fatigued? Why is this happening? Why do I feel anxious? When did this start occuring?"🤥
The main reason for your healing journey taking a step back in progress is... S T R E S S.😐
Stress is something at the day we don't always have control over. It can come out of nowhere, very suddenly.😶‍🌫
This can cause us to have some of those symptoms come back even when we have been very diligent with our positive habitual changes.😥
A really important thing to do is to always make sure you are receiving the care and support that you need on a daily basis.💕
This means being consistent with your self-care balance which includes getting optimal sleep each night, balancing your blood sugar at every meal, moving your body in a more intuitive way, and finding those pockets in the day that allow you to rest and recover.💖
