German coach Markus Gisdol has left his post at Lokomotiv Moscow The Russian top-flight club is trying to disguise his decision with a note which speaks of an exemption and not a voluntary resignation However, the 52-year-old Gisdol clarified to Bild that he really is resigned of his own free will due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine These are his words Coaching football is the best job in the world for me But I cannot practice my profession in a country whose leader is responsible for an attack in the middle of Europe This is not it corresponds to my values I cannot stay in Moscow on the training ground where the players train and ask him for professionalism when orders are given a few kilometers away that bring misery on an entire population This is my personal decision and I am firmly convinced of it
