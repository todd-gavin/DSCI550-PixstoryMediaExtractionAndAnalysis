Rational emotive behavioural therapy (REBT)
REBT is an action-oriented form of CBT that focuses on the present. REBT addresses unhealthy attitudes, emotions, and behaviours and includes disputing irrational beliefs to help people develop realistic and healthy alternatives.
Relaxation and visualization
Therapists will offer different relaxation and visualization techniques when you’re in a claustrophobic situation. Courses may include exercises like counting down from 10 or picturing a safe space. These techniques may help calm your nerves and ease your panic.
Exposure therapy
Exposure therapy is commonly used to treat anxiety conditions and phobias. In this therapy, you’ll be placed in a non-dangerous situation that triggers your claustrophobia to confront and overcome your fear. The idea is that the more you’re exposed to what scares you, the less you’ll fear it.
Medication
Your doctor may also prescribe antidepressants or an anti-anxiety medication to help treat your panic and physical symptoms. When specified, drugs are usually used in addition to therapy.
