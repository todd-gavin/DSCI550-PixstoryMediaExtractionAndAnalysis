Life in Retirement continues...
I have had a number of requests from commercial houses to become their director, or chairman which I refused because I have no taste for this kind of work. I could not however refuse my old 
friend Shri Ram and on his request I became a Director of the Delhi Cloth and General Mills, Delhi, I was also asked to sit on the Camp College Enquiry Committee along with Dr. Krishnan and Dr. C. V. Rao, Vice Chancellor of Delhi University. We produced a unanimous report suggesting steps for winding up this institution 
originally set up to meet the needs of Punjab refugees. I have been 
taking interest as a trustee in the affairs of Sir Ganga Ram Trust Hospital in New Delhi, I am serving as a trustee and Chairman of Dewan Bishan Das Trust which helps widows and students of the Kangra District and Lala Barru Shah Trust which runs an 
Ayurvedics Aushidhalaya in Dharmshala. Occasionally, I have given 
legal advice to persons seeking my help and doing one or two 
arbitrations.
 I am now busy in building a D. A. V. College at Chandigarh and a Higher Secondary School for Girls on Reading Road 
in Delhi and in rebuilding the Arya Samaj Mandir of Lahore at 
Reading Road near Birla Mandir. My election as the President of 
the Dayanand Memorial Trust, Tankara (Gujrat), the birth place 
of Swami Dayanand, threw a new, though not unwelcome, responsibility on my shoulders to develop at Tankara a great seat of Vedic learning. 

At the request of the Punjab Government and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs I worked as a chairman of Punjab Police Commission set up to study various aspects of police work in Punjab and make recommendations to bring it up-to-date and in conformity 
With the setting of a democratic republic in the country. The commission submitted its report to the Government in May, 1962
within a year of its appointment. 
Looking Back Concluded!
