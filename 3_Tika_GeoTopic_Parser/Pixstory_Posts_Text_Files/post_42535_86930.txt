For the last years social media is like a second newspaper to people all over the world People have to wait for the next day to read a newspaper but if you have a phone in your hand you can see whatever is happening in the world in just one click The difference between newspaper and social media is in the newspaper you only read the news but in the social media you can also read the public s point of view and you can share your view too and if more people are talking on that particular topic then that topic becomes a trending news People start sharing about it by using a particular hashtag which will help that particular topic to get spread around the world Some people share their views before even knowing about the topic and because of that people can become a part of negative speech or agenda based issues Sometimes people use social media for a very good cause but sometimes it s just hate or to distract innocent people Sometimes Public relations PR companies who work for any politician sportsperson or any content creating app deliberately start floating the controversial news which will become a new trend on social media and people will start talking about it Some people will agree with the trend and some people will disagree with the trend but they are responding which is the only thing that the PR team wants There is only one tip that I want to give to you all that share anything you want say anything you want but you should write something before doing a little bit of research on the particular topic otherwise your one view can become the next trend on social media and you don t know how people will respond to it negative or positive
