The similarity between "The Good Doctor" and "Extra Attorney Woo" Leads. 
The medical drama The Good Doctor, based on a Korean drama of the same name, exploded onto American television in 2017. 
The story of Shaun Murphy, a young  brilliant surgeon with autism and Savant syndrome. In the show we see his eidetic memory combine with his Intuition to know that something’s not right—and subsequently save someone’s life. He also tends to be very aware when someone’s upset, but struggles to know why, which puts him at Thinking over Feeling.
Taking away Dr. Aaron Glassman’s license when he starts to lose his memory is a good example of this. Sometimes Shaun hurts people’s feelings because his Judging traits means he’s rule-oriented, but his compassion helps him make up for it. 
The Good Doctor has been getting rave reviews ever since the first season was released. Now into fifth season, the series, based on a Korean TV series, has helped to dispel the notion that people with mental disabilities cannot excel in life. Now another Korean drama is getting praise for sensitive treatment of a lead character who is autistic. Extraordinary attorney woo is a law-based South Korean drama. Woo young woo played by (Park Eun-bin) a female rookie but genius attorney with autism spectrum disorder. She has an incredible photographic memory and a high IQ. Thanks to these attributes, she has managed to excel in many areas of her law career as well as education. Unfortunately, she struggles to create a real connection with people. This is simply because she has a low social IQ, and she has autism.
For example, in one scene of this drama, we see her memorizing a book when she was young. This scene showcased her abilities. Furthermore, how she makes decisions as a lawyer is based more on thinking rather than feeling. This is why she shows no emotional reaction when dealing with any case.
