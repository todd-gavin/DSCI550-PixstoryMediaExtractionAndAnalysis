A few years back PETA has exposed the true nature of the so called game of "Elephant Polo"
They stated that "elephants are being abused during the training as well as repeatedly beaten and gouged with sharp, metal tipped bullhooks during the polo game."
After PETA delivered a string of distressing videos showing the cruelty to elephants at the 2018 Kingâ€™s Cup Elephant Polo Tournament, major sponsors have withdrawn their support of this abusive event.
Similar events have been discontinued in many countries but concomitantly elephant abuse is still unbridled.
It will be virtuous if we get together and work for the cessation of these kind of entertainment  by not encouring or cooperating to it.
