Denying white privilege in the same breath as derailing the conversation is the biggest proof of your privilege, sir. How easily you changed the conversation from people, majorly black people, dying in a racially motivated mass shooting to how your feelings are hurt is incredibly concerning.

Like do you even hear yourself? People died! And you're here trying to justify yourself. Wow! Nobody said every white man is a killer, you picked that up from nowhere. And this is exactly why you're a part of the problem.

Our culture has distorted the term "racism" so much that we only perceive it in its most extreme form. Racism is not always these extreme aggressive acts of violence, it is also the subtle micro-agressions. It is also silence of those who aren't affected by it. And most importantly, it is speaking over the victimsâ€”which you have quite frequently engaged in. And all of it ends up costing those innocent their lives when it takes a more extreme form.

White people are not the victims, and they need to stop acting like one. You are a privileged member of a very white inclined society and have no idea of what BIPoC people go through, and definitely do not understand the threat they live under. So the least you can do is not make an incident so sensitive about yourselves.
