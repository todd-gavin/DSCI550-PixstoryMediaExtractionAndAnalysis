There is something about comedy movies. If done right, you can watch them over and over again without getting bored. It can come across as crass or cringe if done over the top. But there's another section of comedy movies. Those that were box office disasters when they were released. But as time passed the audience warmed up to these films and saw what fun they were to watch.

1. Andaz Apna Apna (1994) With Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karisma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal & Shakti Kapoor as the lead cast, the movie was declared a massive flop when it was released. But slowly, the movie went on to become the cult classic it is today.

2. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983) The movie is one of the best satires to ever be produced in Hindi cinema. It told the tale of two photographers who come face to face with rampant corruption. 

3. Khatta Meetha (2010) Another movie from the times when Akshay Kumar used to do good films. The movie took a very real concept and added bits of humour to it. The movie was criticized for being too long (three hours running time) and for the bits of unnecessary drama. But the audience, now, loves the film for some of its most funny scenes.

4. Do Dooni Chaar (2010) This family comedy-drama film was not received well at the box office. With bits of comedy, it is also slice-of-life film. It has instances of situational humour and clean comedy - with some scenes being highly relatable for middle class families. With Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor in lead roles, the movie makes for a great watch with family on a movie night.

5. Go Goa Gone (2013) The zombie comedy did not work well when it was released initially. However, it slowly rose to the cult status it has now. With Kunal Khemu, Vir Das, Anand Tiwari and Saif Ali Khan as a wannabe Russian, the movie is experimental yet manages to tickle your funny bones. And now, there's a sequel in development.
