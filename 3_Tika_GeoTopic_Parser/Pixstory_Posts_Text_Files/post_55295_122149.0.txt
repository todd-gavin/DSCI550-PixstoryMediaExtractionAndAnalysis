A special environmental morning assembly was conducted in the school premises of Mount Carmel School, Anand Niketan, New Delhi, which conveyed the message to protect our precious Earth and its valuable resources. After the prayer, a speech followed on ‘Save Earth’, a Hindi poem to plant trees ‘Pedh Lagao’, a foot taping choreography on the song ‘Earth we are in together’ and a melodious song ‘He’s got the whole world in his hands’ by the school choir. The entire school took the pledge to plant more trees. The little ones performed with great zeal and confidence.
