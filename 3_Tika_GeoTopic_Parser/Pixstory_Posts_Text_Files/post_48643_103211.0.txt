It's no news that Trump's ideologies are screwed up. But it's extremely uncomfortable and disgusting how he talks and behaves whenever he talks about people who've been victimized. It is shameful to even think there was a time we elected him as our president.

Trump read, and mispronounced, the names of the 19 children that were slaughtered in their school â€“ rather disrespectfully, one could even say mockingly, then did a little dance.

This man is all kinds of sick. He's the most despicable politician I've ever seen, and that's saying something. In his NRA speech, Donald Trump cites "broken families" as a cause of mass shootings, "because no law can cure the effects of a broken home," he says. Which is pretty much an ironic hyperbole considering he's been divorced twice.
