Lazy Mom's Day can be totally up your alley whether you already are a lazy mom or just wish you could take the day off and be one. Mothers all across the world put in a lot of effort to maintain their homes, including on Mother's Day. Moms are urged to unwind, take a backseat, and just be lazy on Lazy Mom's Day. 

How are mothers capable of being sluggish? As DOY suggests, instead of making toast and oatmeal in the morning, ask the kids to bring you breakfast in bed. Make the kids take the bus to school rather than dropping them off at the gates, or ask your husband to drive you to work. The best option is to order pizza and take the night off.

So what are you waiting for moms? Go enjoy your day off!
