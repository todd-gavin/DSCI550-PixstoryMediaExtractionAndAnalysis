In its recommendations sent to Department of Telecom (DoT), Telecom regulator TRAI on Monday went ahead with suggesting the auction of the C-band spectrum between 3300-3670 MHz as prescribed by the ministry.

TRAI had, in 2018, recommended auctioning 3300-3600 MHz band for 5G services which was later increased to 3300-3670 MHz by DoT.

During the consultation process initiated by the regulator, the broadcasters had objected the addition of 70 MHz. The satellite broadcasters’ reservation was to maintain 100 MHz guard band between IMT/5G and broadcasting services to avoid any interference.

In its recommendation, the regulator has suggested that there is a need to make use of high-quality bandpass filters operating in 3700-4200 MHz range.

“Therefore, DoT should ask the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) to take appropriate action and sensitize the MSOs, DTH operators, and other users to ensure the use of high-quality bandpass filters operating in 3700-4200 MHz range to avoid interference from IMT stations.

In order to avoid unwanted out of band emissions of the IMT stations falling within the FSS operating band 3700-4200 MHz, DoT should prescribe for having a sharp Spectrum Mask for IMT transmitters with an out-of-band PFD limit, the regulator said,

Acknowledging the broadcasters’ concerns, TRAI said that some of the stakeholders having interest in broadcasting and satellite have raised their concerns regarding possible interference due to reduction of guard band between IMT and satellite services from 100 MHz to 30 MHz.

Submissions made by these stakeholders are:

a) This allocation of frequencies to 5G services beyond the current NFAP-18 upper limit of 3600 MHz will lead to serious disruption of Satellite services for media and broadcast in the 3700-4000 MHz band. Today over 600 licensed satellite channels over India operate in this band. The disruption occurs due to the following reasons:

(i) The power received from satellite at receiver LNB (Low Noise Block) is much lower (~60 dB lower) than that of 5G Terrestrial signals which operate at a very heavy power level. This leads to the overloading of the LNBs of satellite Antennas and no signal can then be received.
