Isn’t it so mesmerizing how all rituals of Durga Puja reminds one of how Maa Durga resides in everything and everywhere? That one needs to respect and love all the small things like for example plants and 
shrubs, because it represents Devi Durga. Another ritual that emphasizes on this belief is the Kumari Puja.
On Ashtami, young girls who haven’t attained puberty are worshipped as Divine Mother. The place most famous for Kumari Puja is Belur Math, headquarters of Ramkrishna Mission Ashrams all around the globes. Swami Vivekananda started this practice after being inspired by Sri Ramakrishna’s devotion to the Divine Mother. Sri Ramkrishna believed that young girls are manifestation of Divine Mother as they are innocent and unswayed by the negative influences of materialistic world. 
The young girls are decked in red sarees and gold jewellery much like Maa Durga and worshipped by monks. Monks and devotees offer her flowers and invoke her blessings through prayers. It is very 
popular among devotees and every year a huge crowd gathers to witness this event.
