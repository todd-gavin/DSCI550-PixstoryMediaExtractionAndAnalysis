Back in 2007/08, Man Utd was in the UCL top 8. To go to the final they had to face FC Barcelona. Paul Scholes scored a curling 25-yard shot that went past Victor Valdes to make the score 1-0 which took United to the final to face their English Rivals Chelsea, who boasted players like Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, Petr Cech, and so on.

I jumped out of my seat when United won and I remember I hardly got a wink of sleep as I was awake the whole night in excitement. 


Meanwhile, United before conquering Europe was conquering England when they won the Premier League title and won their 17th title getting closer to eternal rivals Liverpool.

So the tide was set for an English Final between Manchester United and Chelsea, which took place in Moscow. 


The game boasted hard-hitting players like Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Nemanja Vidic, Didier Drogba, Petr Cech, Michael Ballack, and so on.

Both teams got to a fiery encounter at the get-go. Cristiano Ronaldo in the 25th minute rose ahead to score past gawking Cech. United was 1 goal up. After so many attempts at goal from Michael Ballack, Didier Drogba, and so on, Chelsea finally got a breakthrough in the 45th minute. It was heart-breaking for me.


The second half was intense with both teams coming close. The team finished 1-1 and it took them to a penalty shootout. United won 6-5 courtesy of John Terry's slip-up and Edwin Van Der Sar jumping to his right to thwart out Nikolas Anelka to win their 3rd UCL.

In 2013/14 Man United courtesy of Robin Van Persie pipped Liverpool to win 20th Premier League. It was a good and bad thing because it was Sir Alex’s last tenure. The man decided to step-down. Im not afraid to reveal that I cried like a baby during Sir Alex Retirement speech. I bet people who follow United share the same sentiment.
