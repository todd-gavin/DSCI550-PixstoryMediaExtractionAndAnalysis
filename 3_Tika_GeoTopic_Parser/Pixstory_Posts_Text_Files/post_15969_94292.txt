Danni Gao Huiping Yuan Abstract Type diabetes mellitus T DM is a classic metaflammatory disease and the inflammatory states of the pancreatic islet and insulin target organs have been well confirmed However abundant evidence demonstrates that there are countless connections between these organs in the presence of a low degree of inflammation In this review we focus on cell cell crosstalk among local cells in the islet and organ organ crosstalk among insulin related organs In contrast to that in acute inflammation macrophages are the dominant immune cells causing inflammation in the islets and insulin target organs in T DM In the inflammatory microenvironment IME of the islet cell cell crosstalk involving local macrophage polarization and proinflammatory cytokine production impair insulin secretion by cells Furthermore organ organ crosstalk including the gut brain pancreas axis and interactions among insulin related organs during inflammation reduces insulin sensitivity and induces endocrine dysfunction Therefore this crosstalk ultimately results in a cascade leading to cell dysfunction These findings could have broad implications for therapies aimed at treating T DM Sources
