Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri will be a happy man this evening as his Bianconeri side made the most of their chances to win 3-0 against Sassuolo at the Allianz Stadium. Goals from Angel Di Maria and Dusan Vlahovic were enough to prove the difference between the two sides.
Speaking to DAZN after the game, Allegri said:
“I am not worried. We’ll see what the tests say tomorrow. Unfortunately, these things happen in football. He had this adductor issue a week ago too, perhaps I should’ve taken him off when we were 3-0 up, but he was enjoying himself out there. Zakaria just had a cramp, nothing more.
“The important thing is that we won a game that we really wanted to win, which was by no means simple.
“We started strong, then lost the ball two or three times playing out from the back and you could see we were fragile at that moment. We couldn’t get hold of the game. I put Di Maria wide and Juan Cuadrado on the other flank, that’s all. After the break we threw the ball away too many times, we needed to finish the moves better.
“I am honestly amazed by how well Bremer has settled in. He is very calm, I only had to tell him off once in the second half when he tracked Domenico Berardi to midfield, in those situations, you need to let it go.”
