On August 1, 2022, Dr Nishikant Dubey, BJP MP from Jharkhand’s Godda made a statement in Parliament. He alleged that in the last eight years, the opposition did not discuss farmers’ suicide because farmers were not dying by suicide. Dubey stated in Hindi, “Did the opposition ever have a single discussion about farmers’ suicides in the last eight years? If they didn’t, it means farmers are not dying by suicide. We (BJP) have given so much power to farmers that today the farmers’ are agitating. And what is the condition of the farmer? Modi’s government was in power for the whole year and the same amount of funds was provided to the farmers. And that’s how we strengthened farmers enough to continue agitating for over a year, but no farmer died by suicide.”

Did no farmers die by suicide in the last eight years?
Alt News performed a Google search to investigate the statement made by MP Nishikant Dubey in the Lok Sabha. In October 2021, NDTV India published a report about farmers’ suicide in 2020. Quoting a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, the article states that a total of 1,53,052 cases of suicide were reported in 2020. Out of these, a total of 10,677 cases of suicide were reported in the agriculture sector. Of which 5,579 suicides were of farmers and 5,098 suicides were of agricultural labourers. It is worth noting that these figures represent just 2020 alone.

In his statement, Dubey referred to the eight years under the rule of Narendra Modi, i.e. from 2014 to 2021. We examined the data from 2014 to 2020. (The data for 2021 is not yet available on the NCRB website.)

A total of 1,31,666 people died by suicide in 2014. As per the data, 5,650 farmers died by suicide in 2014. There is not much of a difference between these and the 2015 figures. That year, 8,007 farmers took their own lives, out of a total of 1,33,623 deaths.
