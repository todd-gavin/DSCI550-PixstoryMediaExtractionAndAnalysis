‌This Sharpshooter from Ohio stunned the audience in Buffalo Bill's show by shooting out a cigar from her husband's (Frank E Butler)lips or slicing playing-card edge-on at 30 paces. 
‌
‌Poverty struck her family after death and she couldn't attend school. She did all kinds of jobs to an infirmary superintendent and his wife and yet she was tortured and abused mentally and physically. In her autobiography, she calls them wolves for throwing out her into the freezing for falling asleep during work.
‌
‌She did hunting to support her family at a very young age. She used to supply hunted entities to the hotels and restaurants in Ohio. She married Frank E Butler whom she won against in a bet.
‌
‌She and her husband began touring and performing soon after and in 1885 They joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West(an outdoor show that toured yearly including wild animals, trick performances, and theatrical reenactments.)
She displayed her prowess in the  Paris Exposition of 1889 which made her America's Sharpshooting Superstar.
‌In 1901, she faced a terrible train accident and was paralysed temporarily after which she quit Buffalo Bills' Wild West and did only enactments in the plays written for her.
‌
‌She believed in the self-defence of women and hence is reported to have taught almost 15000 women gun shootings during her career. 
‌
‌She is praised for her quote: "I would like to see every woman know how to handle guns, as naturally as they know how to handle babies."
