The LA Lakers are expected to make some changes to their coaching staff in the offseason if Frank Vogel fails to lead the team to a successful playoff run. Based on the latest NBA rumors, the Lakers already have a coach in mind and he's from a Western Conference team.

According to Marc Stein on SubStack, current Utah Jazz head coach Quin Snyder could be a possible replacement for Vogel if the Lakers part ways with him in the offseason. Snyder still has a contract with the Jazz until next season, but the length of it is currently unknown to the public.

"In discussions with numerous officials from rival teams in recent weeks, I’ve heard questions raised repeatedly about how much longer Snyder, now in his eighth season in Utah, will remain there," Stein wrote.

"Snyder has been increasingly mentioned as a potential target for San Antonio to succeed Gregg Popovich. I’ve likewise heard Snyder’s name posed as a probable Los Angeles Lakers candidate should the Lakers and Frank Vogel part ways after what has been a nightmare season in Hollywood."

Snyder has been the head coach of the Utah Jazz since 2014, with a 58.3% winning percentage. He has also led the Jazz to the playoffs in the last five seasons, but the team have failed to make it past the second round.

With Danny Ainge now the CEO of the team, there's plenty of speculation about Snyder's future.

It's also worth pointing out that Snyder has history with both the LA Lakers and San Antonio Spurs. The 55-year-old was an assistant for the Lakers from 2011 to 2012 and served as head coach for the Spurs' G League team, the Austin Toros, from 2007 to 2010.
