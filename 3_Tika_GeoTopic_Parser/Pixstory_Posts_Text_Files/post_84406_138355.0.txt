Philosophy is an intriguing branch of studies that deal with the existential questions of why, when and many more. In the initial years of philosophy, there were many great thinkers from all over the world that shook the foundations of thought and compelled people to think in new perspectives and derive interpretations in regards to our mortality. While philosophy is not that famous anymore, there have been many schools of philosophy whose ideals and teachings often clashed or contradicted one another. 
A famous comparison is that of eastern and western philosophy. 
Eastern philosophy mainly focused on the essence of awareness of oneself, taking a spiritual ans holistic approach it focuses on introspection. Some eastern philosophies are Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism. Philosophers like Lao-Tzu, Gautama buddha, Confucius preached eastern philosophy. 
Western philosophy is focused on understanding the universe around us, taking a practical and egalitarian approach it focuses on logic. Some western philosophies are Stoicism, Cynacism, Nihilism. Socrates, Marcus Aurelius and Diogenes are some who preached western philosophy. 
Eastern philosophy considers 'self' as an illusion while western philosophy considers 'self' as a n entity seperate from others. 
Over the years both schools influenced and adopted some teachings of one another to enhance the train if thought. Though they may differ in teachings, there is no correct or superior school, they are merely two ways to try and understand the truth.
