How secure are we online?
Is my information safe with the applications I use ?
Yes! as long as you have the strongest password that is hard to hack. 
How will I know that my password is strong or difficult to hack ?

Follow the following tips:-

1. Your password should include a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols rather than a phrase. 

2. Your password should have 16-20 characters, to make it hard to hack. As the number of characters increases in a password the probability of its getting hacked reduces.

3. Your password shouldnâ€™t be repetitive in terms of its characters, with unique combinations instead.
