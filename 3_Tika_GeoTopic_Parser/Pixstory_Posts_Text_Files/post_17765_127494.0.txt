Kim Kardashian‘s shapewear and clothing brand SKIMS courted new controversy after it was recently accused of ‘greenwashing’.

Greenwashing, sometimes known as 'green sheen,' is a marketing phrase that describes how firms fool consumers into believing that their products and organisational practises are ecologically benign.

SKIMS has been accused of this technique because their packaging was seen to be inconsistent with the environmental efforts it professes to make, particularly with relation to plastic.
According to The Independent, an audit by the Changing Markets Foundation found "no evidence" to substantiate the popular brand's ecologically aware claims, which focuses on body acceptance and diversity and employs inclusive sizing.

I am compostable, made from plants. I will biodegrade in your home compost and in an industrial compost facility,” it adds. According to Changing Markets Foundation, however, the packaging lists an additional number ‘4’ logo, which contradicts its claims.
*What does it mean?*

According to the Changing Markets Foundation, a non-profit organisation with the "mission to expose irresponsible corporate practises and drive change towards a more sustainable economy," the triangular logo — a recycling symbol — within which the number '4' appears indicates that the packaging is made from type-4 plastic, or low-density polyethylene (LDPE).

The foundation stated, as quoted in the Independent story, "While this packaging might dissolve in practise, as claimed, it is absolutely false to assert that it is not plastic.

Interestingly, SKIMS received the 'We Avoid' rating from Good On You, a platform that assesses ethical and sustainable practises of firms, with the explanation that the company failed to "disclose information regarding its commitment to sustainability throughout its supply chain."
