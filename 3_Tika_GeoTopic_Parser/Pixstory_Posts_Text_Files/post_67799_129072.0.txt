Australia has won the maximum of five ODI world cups, West Indies has won the most number of T20Is world cup yet, because of humongous fanbase, Indian cricket has been the most successful and rich council all over the world. Indians follow cricket as a religion and treat their favorite cricketers as God. That is one reason why we are the superpower in the cricket world. Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) is the body that controls cricket in India. The BCCI is an autonomous organization and does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India. As we speak, Saurav Ganguly is the current president of the council since the year 2019 whereas Jay Shah is the secretary.

The Beginning

The BCCI was established in the year 1928 and India played its first match against England in the year 1932 which they lost. Post-independence, India did win some series overseas but that was not enough to bring the popularity to Indian cricket or to the BCCI. India became a cricket-mad nation after we won the World Cup 1983 in England. Players became stars overnight and the BCCI was able to take in huge amounts of money subsequently. India, along with Pakistan, hosted the next world cup in the year 1987. This was the first time ever that cricket world cup was hosted outside England, and that too not in other powerful nations under ICC.

The Wake of BCCI

In the year 1992, BCCI faced a huge loss of Rs. 62 Lakhs. That was the time when the BCCI had to pay 5 lakh Rs. per match to DD National to broadcast the matches. 1993 came as a landmark year for the council as they sold off the television rights to a private broadcaster. Star Sports now pays Rs. 65 Crore per international game played in India for broadcasting in India whereas it pays Rs 55 Crore per IPL match.
