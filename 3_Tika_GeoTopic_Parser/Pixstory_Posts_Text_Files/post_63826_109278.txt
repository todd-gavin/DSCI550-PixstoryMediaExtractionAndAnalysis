Part The Reva and Leia ending Obi Wan Kenobi finally had its finale premiere on June and despite the show s overall flaws I am happy to say that I am more than satisfied with the finale Far from the mess I was expecting the finale to be it was a very pleasant surprise If by the fifth episode things had begun getting back on track Disney had the Force with them for this one This episode too had its blunders and mistakes but it managed to do far more right than it could do wrong Since the episode was divided into three arcs I feel it only right to divide my review into three arcs As expected Reva was alive and somehow kicking even though she was stabbed with a lightsaber maybe human organs are even stronger than adamantium in this universe but whatever Even though she was the most annoying thing in the whole show and her getting humiliated and stabbed was one of the best things about episode then her redemption arc and her face off with Owen Beru and Luke while not the best part of the episode was at least handled well and ended on a satisfactory note The adventure of Kenobi and Leia is a major part of the show and ends on a good if a bit of an unsatisfactory note considering how much Leia was played off as being so essential to the future which she no doubt is given her role in the original trilogy But nonetheless the Obi Wan Leia dynamic is one of the best parts of the show and even though it does tend to mess with the cannon and overall continuity it personally for me takes almost nothing away
