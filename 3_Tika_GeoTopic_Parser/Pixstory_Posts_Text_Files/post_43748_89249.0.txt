Brazil has been one of the best international sides in the world. They have produced some of the greatest players in the world and have done that consistently. Some of the all-time greats include Pele, Ronaldinho, Neymar and many more. 

Brazil houses the greatest football fans throughout the globe and their team has given them a reason to celebrate their success. The Brazil team has won the World Cup 5 times in history which is greater than any other team in the world, with Germany and Italy following at 4 times each. Now, let's gander upon some of the greatest players of Seleção Canarinho in 2022. 

#5. Neymar Jr.

At number 5 we have one of the greatest footballers of our time Neymar Jr. The 30-year-old is often compared with the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. His skilful play and some moments of magic make him one of the greatest assets. In the past few months, Neymar has been out of action due to his ankle injury. The Brazilian hasn’t been able to live up to the sky-high standards that he has set through his unbelievable performances in the past few years. However, sometimes you could see unreal ability to score beautiful goals, which makes him the fifth-best Brazilian footballer today. 

#4. Thiago Silva

Thiago Silva deserves to be at number four or even higher for his unreal performances at the age of 37. When Silva was transferred to Chelsea in 2020 as a free agent the pundit predicted it to be an overpriced transfer which would be disastrous for the club. But in the last two years, the veteran has performed magnificently and played a critical role in Chelsea winning the Champions League last season. He is a brutal defensive force for the blues and has played a crucial role in keeping 9 clean sheets for Chelsea this season.
