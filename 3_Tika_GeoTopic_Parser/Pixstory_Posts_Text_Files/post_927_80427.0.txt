Perhaps the most famous of the Wild West boomtowns of the late 19th century, Bodie's population grew from a handful of prospectors to 10,000 people in the late 1870s.

With rich seams of gold to be found, people flocked to the Californian town, positioned near the Nevada border, to make their fortune, with an incredible 65 saloons, a Wells Fargo bank and even a Chinatown replete with Taoist temple.

But Bodie's appeal had faded by the early 20th century, as other boomtowns rose to prominence, and its population fell to just 120 in 1920.

The deserted town's well-preserved buildings make it a memorable stop off on Wild West tours today, reports CNN travel.
