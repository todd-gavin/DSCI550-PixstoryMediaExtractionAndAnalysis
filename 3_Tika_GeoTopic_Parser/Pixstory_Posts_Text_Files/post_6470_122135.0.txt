And one day you realize that it wasn’t the game, it was who you watched it with.

It wasn’t about the house you owned. It was the people in it.

It wasn’t about the best coffee ever, but who you made it for.

It wasn’t all the work you put in, but who was in the trenches with you.

It wasn’t the great dinner prepared for you. It was who brought you your plate.

It wasn’t your status, position or your salary, it was who were you able to help and impact with your work.

You have to learn how to value the time that someone gives you because that’s something they will never get back. It’s priceless.
