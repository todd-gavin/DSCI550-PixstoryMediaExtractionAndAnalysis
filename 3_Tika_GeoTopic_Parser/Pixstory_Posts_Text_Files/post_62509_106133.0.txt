Judy was a purebred English pointer that served as the Royal Navy's mascot. Judy and her crew were seized by the Japanese and imprisoned as prisoners of war after their ship, HMS Grasshopper, was torpedoed during WWII (POWs). Leading Aircraftsman Frank Williams adopted Judy and shared his meagre rations with her throughout their captivity. Judy was even officially registered as a POW by Williams in an attempt to protect her life. Judy was fiercely protective of the other inmates. She would snarl and growl to distract guards from abusing POWs, and she would frequently leave the camp to bring food back to the starved inmates. In 1945, Judy and Williams were freed. Judy received the Dickin Medal the next year for her "her bravery and perseverance in Japanese prison camps, which helped to sustain morale among her fellow inmates, as well as for saving many lives via her intellect and watchfulness." Judy rescued numerous lives, survived sinking ships, and spent years in internment camps, so it's little surprise she became one of WWII's most well-known and unusual heroes.
