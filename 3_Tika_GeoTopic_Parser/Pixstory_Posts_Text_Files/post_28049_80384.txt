Everything seemed to be going swimmingly for Michela Moioli and instead the Beijing Winter Olympics soon turned into a real nightmare for the gold snowboard champion in PyeongChang The Italian standard-bearer was in fact eliminated in the semifinals just as she seemed to be in great shape launched towards a podium encore Out in the semifinal Michela wrote on Instagram my nightmare This is sport there is always someone who wins and someone who loses But I won&#39;t give up I have two days to put the pieces back together Saturday there will be a team competition and I will give it my all Good luck Instagram photo michela moioli
