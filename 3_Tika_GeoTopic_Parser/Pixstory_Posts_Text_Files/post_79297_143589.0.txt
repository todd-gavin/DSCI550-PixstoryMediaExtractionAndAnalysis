Who else as my first CB but Mr. Arsenal himself?Tony Adams was made Arsenal captain at just 21 years old and it remained that way for the next 14 years until his retirement. During this time he made 669 appearances for Arsenal and won 10 major trophies, including league titles in 3 different decades. A stalwart in the famous ‘1-0 to the Arsenal’ George Graham defence and one of the greatest leaders the league has ever seen.Adams read the game excellently, had a knack for timing his tackles well and was incredibly dominant in the air. He scored 48 goals during his time at Arsenal but none are more iconic than the crowing goal in a 4-0 victory against Everton at Highbury, confirming Arsenal the title.There was never any doubt that Adams would be included in my team and comes straight in as my captain, one of Arsenal’s greatest ever legends.#PixstoryArsenal #Arsenal
