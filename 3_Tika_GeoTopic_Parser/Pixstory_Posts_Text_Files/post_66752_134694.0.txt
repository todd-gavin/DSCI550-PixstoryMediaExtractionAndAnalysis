Book 2 in the King & Maxwell series published in 2004 
This proved to be an excellent mystery/Thriller/whodunit.
King and Maxwell get themselves involved in a series of bizarre and highly staged murders.
At first it all looks like the same killer but it soon becomes clear that there is more than one killer at work.
The family who the killing seemed to be focused on were themselves a very bizarre lot.
They had more money and eccentricities that you could poke a stick at.
As each victim is discovered with a watch on their wrist stopped exactly on the hour. First victim at 1 o’clock, second at 2 o’clock so on in this style right up the victim 7.
The significance of this eludes everybody and finding the answer to this riddle was a priority plus.
Sean King, the thinking mans detective, goes at it like a terrier with a bone until a chink of light appears in the dark.
What started out being bizarre is about to become even more so.
Was this story far fetched? Of course it was.
Did it keep me entertained right to the end? You bet your sweet cheeks it did.
