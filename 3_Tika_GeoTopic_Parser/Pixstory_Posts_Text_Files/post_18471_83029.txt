Novak Djokovic is approaching his seasonal debut Lo far in Dubai first match against the Italian Lorenzo Musetti after having to miss the Australian Open and the vaccine-related mess Back home he rested and then returned to the field to train also because with the victory in Australia his rival Nadal climbed to Grand Slam won in his career by overcoming Djokovic and Federer stopped in There were many emotions after my return from Australia I needed some time to reflect and to mentally rest Djokovic told the tournament website of Dubai Then once I resumed I was looking forward to playing tennis and competing How other players have welcomed me here in Dubai So far here most of the ones I&#39;ve seen haven&#39;t seen many have been positive and welcoming I can&#39;t say that it was like that in Australia. It was a bit strange. But it&#39;s good here so far
