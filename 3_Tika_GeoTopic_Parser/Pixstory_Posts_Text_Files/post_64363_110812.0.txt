   It is not a cliché but a fact that giving is the greatest act of grace. I believe that when we give, we make a ‘life’ and hence the measure of life is not its DURATION but its DONATION. Thus, organ donation is one of the greatest gifts we can give to someone as ‘it is not a tragedy, but it can be a beautiful life in the midst of one.’
The sanctity of human life is unparalleled. Human life is far too precious to be lost to organ failure. But due to a huge gap between the demand and availability of donors, it is seldom given emphasis.  All of us are aware of eye donation for the past several decades but skin donation is fairly unheard of. In a human body, there are various tissues and organs which are donated either post brain death or natural death and skin can be donated after natural death. With the recent advancements in transplant immunology, everyone has the privilege of donating their skin as there’s no age and blood matching. The only exception here is people suffering from HIV, hepatitis, skin infections and skin cancer who cannot donate. Skin donated, further minimises the loss of life via diseases that cause irreversible skin damage and gives the patient enough time to regenerate their skin cells.
Thus pledging to donate our skin is a sure way of ensuring that we, even in our death, have made a big difference. After all, what we leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments or burnt down but what is woven into the lives of others.
