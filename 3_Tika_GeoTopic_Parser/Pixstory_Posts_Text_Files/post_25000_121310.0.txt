Preseason travels provide fans from other countries the chance to watch their club live, maybe for the first time.This was an opportunity for American Arsenal supporters to see the Gunners perform.With nine goals scored and just one goal allowed, Arsenal won all three games.

A terrific few weeks were had by everybody as the club signed Marquinhos, Fabio Vieira, Matt Turner, and Oleksandr Zinchenko and welcomed Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko throughout the trip.We witnessed both brilliant and less-than-brilliant performance from Mikel Arteta's team, but preseason is all about getting the team's match fitness up to par, fostering team unity, and giving some of the younger players a chance to play.

We had many reasons to be thrilled about the American tour. Here are my top three Positives from their American preseason.

#1 Jesus is already the Gunners' guardian angel

We were all aware that Arsenal wanted a fresh number nine starting in January. A very good one at that. Mikel Arteta and Edu criticized the signing of Gabriel Jesus and how successful he has been thus far.The 25-year-old came out of the gate strong and destroyed teams in the process. He scored twice against FC Nurnberg, which was unusual, and then scored again against Everton.

Jesus was once again outspoken about Chelsea performing that particular action. He had a stunning ability to take a pass from deep, turn his opponent, and then throw the ball to Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka, or Martin Odegaard.The Blues' backline was unable to contain him because of his incredible speed, agility, and football IQ.Arsenal is entering the league season with a number nine who will terrorize any defenses in the league.
