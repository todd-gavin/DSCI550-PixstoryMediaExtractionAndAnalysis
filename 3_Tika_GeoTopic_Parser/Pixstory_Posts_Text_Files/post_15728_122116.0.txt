The Geirangerfjord is often considered Norway’s jewel in the crown. Surrounded by majestic mountain peaks, steep cliffs and cascading waterfalls, the fjord extends more than 100 kilometres inland from Ålesund on the west coast.
The UNESCO-listed fjord boasts 800-metre high cliffs and impressive waterfalls, such as the Seven Sisters, the Suitor and the Bridal Veil. With its steep mountains and glittering lake, it’s an impressive 15 kilometres long while the fjord itself is 260 metres deep.
