For me Independence is all about , standing united and fighting against  all other existing  evil and anti-social elements. And in the process we extricate ourselves from such evil enclosures .💪🤝
According to me , "Unity" is not about forcing others to follow the ideals that you follow. Instead it's all about standing united and embracing each other's uniqueness in midst of diversities  . 🤝❤🤝
India reaching it's 76th  Independence(memorializing 75 years of Independence ) ! and the sort of progress that we the citizens of India have embarked upon is indeed regretful .  💔 

The main beauty of our tricolor Indian flag is the mix of those three colors. The subtle mix of three different shades make the flag look much more vibrant. It wouldn't have been this vibrant if it just had a single shade.🇮🇳🤍
Likewise , the immense diversities in all sphere that exist in our nation , are the main factors behind its distinctiveness. 🇮🇳🤍 

Independence was never a  reward for a particular section of the Indian society . Instead it is meant to be cherished by each and every ctiizen of India. 🤍 

Thanks for reading .❤
Wishing you all good health , happiness and prosperity. ❤
