I get all your points, I do. But it's another truth that our school system is flawed. But just because of that, we can't simply stop participating in the society, can we?

Homework in today's education system is necessary, otherwise the kid will stay behind. And while that sounds cruel, it is true that a kid needs to learn to survive. They need to learn to walk with the world.

While we can't fix it, we surely can improve it. Teachers, as a community, can help kids work better instead of harder. They can decide to give them homework that is essential crucial for their survival instead of making them behave like cattle and just following one behind the other.

We can make it easier for kids to survive. I agree, too much homework not only discourage children but give them innumerable mental health issues. The world is, in fact, capitalist and individuals can't really do much about it.

We have to teach our kids survival, whether they like it or not. We can't just not send them to schools or not make them participate in things the whole world is participating in.
