Many menstruating people have no choice but to use the same pad every month Vaginal infections and bad odour might occur if you don t change your pad several times a day UTIs Urinary Tract Infections are easily acquired by females who have poor reproductive hygiene When a kidney is damaged as a result of a UTI one can even die Essential has nothing to do with the number of people using something Essential means essential a requirement It s not dependent on how many people need it it s dependent on how much they need it Just because a lot of people are not diabetic does not mean those who are insulin isn t an essential for them What kind of absurd logic is that Saying that the majority of the population is men so women should suck it up and stay in pain and diseases proves nothing more than your sick mentality that reeks of misogyny You straight away said men deserve privileges over women just because they re more in number And it s like you almost get it but refuse to admit Since we cannot exist without food water or shelter is it moral to charge people for those things Just because you re able to afford it does not mean those who cannot should die Whether it is attainable or not is another question but to oppose the basic rights of those less privileged than yourselves is very telling And finally like Rachel Green says no uterus no opinion Considering you don t know what it s like to be a menstruator I would say you either amplify the voices of those who menstruate or just stay out of it When the government doesn t care about women why should women care about the government We are expected to be patriots when our nation is so strongly against our basic rights from access to menstrual products to reproductive choices Women will not be silenced anymore
