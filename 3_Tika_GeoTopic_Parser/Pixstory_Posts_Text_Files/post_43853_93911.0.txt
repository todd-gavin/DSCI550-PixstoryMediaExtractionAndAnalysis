Liverpool has requested that the kickoff time for their forthcoming Premier League match
against Newcastle be pushed back. The Reds will face Newcastle at St James' Park in a midday
kick-off on April 30 - a game that will be aired live on BT Sport as the title battle nears its finale.

The encounter, however, is sandwiched between the first and second legs of Liverpool's
Champions League semi-final against Villarreal, and manager Jurgen Klopp has expressed his
displeasure with the timing.

Liverpool has filed a formal request to the Premier League to move the start time back,
according to The Athletic. In a press conference before Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Man
City, Klopp expressed his displeasure with the schedule once more.

“If you want to cause us problems you send us to 12:30 at Newcastle," he said.

“I don’t understand it. I can understand that people want to see a football match between
Liverpool and Newcastle but I don’t see why any team should have an advantage or a disadvantage.

“The league and the broadcaster really have to try at least to help. We will see. I haven’t heard
anything yet. Nobody from BT contacted me yet. But I’d say common sense would tell you that
it's probably the right thing to do to move the game slightly backwards.”

The starting lineups for Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final versus Man City this weekend may alter
from those selected in the league last week. Part of it will be due to managers seeking an edge
and a change from the draw from the previous match, but it will also be due to injuries, at least
for City.

Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker are both "already out" of the last-four match at Wembley,
according to RMC Sport, after suffering injuries against Atletico Madrid in the Champions
League. More tests are needed for the right-back, while the Belgian midfielder will be absent for
roughly ten days, but might return against Real Madrid.
