As usual, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s entry made many heads turn at the event tonight. Deepika looked quite the boss babe as she was seen dressed in a lime green pantsuit, which she wore with a stunning, lacy, white bralette. She styled the outfit with a pair of matching white heels. Her hair was left open with a middle parting. While her makeup looked flawless, it’s her bold red lip that accentuated her look even further. 🔥❤️‍🔥

Talking about Ranveer Singh, the actor was seen opting for a classic all-black look, as he donned a long black sherwani with matching trousers and shoes. He styled his hair in a sleek ponytail, and also wore a pair of chic shades to accessorize his outfit. ❤️❤️
