Liz truss gave her first major interview and here is all you need to know: 

'20 years of economic policy haven't delivered growth'

The main point we should consider is that Truss claimed her calculated tax cuts won't be inflationary - and said they'll help grow the economy.

She also admitted the UK has had an economic policy for 20 years that hasn't provided, which she wants to resolve. That involves 12 years of Tory rule. She has openly admitted this.

'Good under pressure'

She was good under pressure considering her part in supporting Ukraine through the war.

She has more experience than Rishi Sunak.

'I'm my own person'

The foreign secretary was keen to avoid comparisons with Margaret Thatcher, stating she's "her own person" and from a "very varied background" than the former PM 

'I was wrong on Brexit'

Truss said she got it wrong by voting Remain in the 2016 referendum, saying "some of the portents of doom didn't happen"

But she said she embraced the result and has fought to take advantage of the opportunities.

'I wanted Boris to carry on as PM'.

Truss remained loyal to her current boss and said she wanted Boris Johnson to stay on as PM - but respected the decision of the parliamentary party to overthrow him.

Asked if this loyalty brought her judgment into question, Truss said she judged that the positive side of Johnson's balance sheet "was very positive".
