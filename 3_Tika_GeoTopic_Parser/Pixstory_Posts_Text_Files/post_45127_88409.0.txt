The forthcoming World Cup qualifier between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, which was supposed to take place in Baghdad for the first time since the US-led invasion in 2003, has been moved to Saudi Arabia.

Following a missile assault on Erbil in northern Iraq on Sunday, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation announced on Saturday that the game would be moved to Riyadh on Thursday.

"Following the latest incidents in Iraq as well as the broader shifts in global security in recent weeks, a reassessment of the safety and security situation in Iraq was performed jointly by FIFA and the AFC," the statement said.

“Based on the assessment and to ensure the highest standards of safety and security for all the stakeholders involved, it was decided that the match should be moved to a neutral venue."

The decision comes less than a month after the Iraq Football Association declared that FIFA, which had prohibited Baghdad from hosting international games for much of the previous 19 years due to security concerns, had given the green light to the vital match.

Since 2003, Iraq has only hosted two World Cup qualifiers: one against Jordan in Erbil in 2011 and another against Hong Kong in Basra in 2019. All of the national team's previous competitive games have been held in neutral countries such as Qatar, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates.

However, there have been friendly games in Baghdad, such as Iraq's 3-1 triumph over Zambia at the Al-Madina Stadium on Friday.

Aljosa Asanovic, the coach of Zambia, has urged for Iraq to be permitted to host their games, as the country seeks a second appearance at the World Cup after its debut in 1986.

“We found the situation to be perfect, and the streets of the capital are filled with security and peace,” Asanovic said. “Iraq deserves to play at its own stadiums.
