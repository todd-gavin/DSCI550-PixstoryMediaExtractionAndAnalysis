The Los Angeles Lakers are expected to be patient and take their time in their head coaching search this offseason Even still some names are already emerging and the first name the team was granted permission to interview was Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach Darvin Ham A long time assistant in the NBA Ham has been viewed as a future head coach for some time now and it looks as if this could finally be his time to land his first job But someone like Ham will get attention from other teams as well and the Charlotte Hornets are eyeing the Lakers target too Shams Charania of The Athletic made an appearance on The Rally and revealed that Ham is one of two frontrunners for the Hornets head coaching position along with former Lakers head coach Mike D Antoni I m told two frontrunners for the Hornets head coaching position are Milwaukee Bucks assistant Darvin Ham and two time head coach of the year Mike D Antoni D Antoni has already interviewed for the position I m told and Darvin Ham will conduct his in person interview with the Hornets later this week So this is a process that will be a little bit slower Just like the Lakers they ll be deliberate they ll make sure that they get this decision right But it s obvious that they re prioritizing bringing in someone that can provide some more authority on defense some more discipline on defense and also some overall structure on both ends of the floor for a young team building obviously around LaMelo Ball As Charania noted the Hornets like the Lakers are expected to take their time with their head coaching search But what is clear is that Ham has many interested suitors so if the Lakers take too long they could miss out on someone they view as the right person for the job if they believe Ham is that person of course In addition to Ham the Lakers have also requested permission to interview Toronto Raptors assistant Adrian Griffin but there will surely be other names that pop up for the Lakers as time goes on as well
