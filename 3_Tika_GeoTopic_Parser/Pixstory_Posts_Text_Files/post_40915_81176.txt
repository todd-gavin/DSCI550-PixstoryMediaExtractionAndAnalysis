Burning When you see my eyes Do you also find the mazes Do you see woods and bats and wolves Do you feel the storm Do you see the moon When you reach out for my voice Do you hear a squeak of madness My heart giving a war cry My lips though solemn But when you hear me speaking Do you notice my wry When you feel my skin Do you also feel stories running like pulse with my veins Do you feel the cracks of lost faith Do you feel the imprints of every heart I touched and shooed away They say my eyes are deeper than the sea They mistake its anxiety for mystery They say my voice sounds better husky Well they also I write too much melancholy They say my hands feel warm loving softest probably Though I find them a misfit Too big too chubby My love maybe the perfect cure My heart beats pain and misery I may seem still and stable girl But inside my mazes I keep wondering I keep lighting I keep burning HD Image source Google
