-	The belief that it’s better to stay married than to be divorced : it’s not better to stay in a toxic abusive marriage. It’s not better for the children. It’s not better.period.
-	The expectation that you have to marry someone you had any physical or sexual contact with even if it was non- consensual: There are still so many cases in India where the rape victims have to marry and live with their rapists their whole life. The guilt and shame of feeling “impure” causes many girls to marry their abusers.
-	The idea that marriage can fix someone or make them into a better person suddenly: marriage is not a solution to someone’s bad behaviour , it only shifts the bad behaviour to their spouses and children and the burden of ‘fixing’ falls on their spouses in the end.
-	The idea that tells women to settle rather then be single by a certain age: The pressure to be married by a certain age pushes people into relationships that are unhealthy. 
-	The belief that even in abuse you have to try harder for the relationship to work: It’s not necessarily husbands and wives who can be toxic to each other, sometimes it can be other family members as well. We are told to respect our elders no matter how disrespectful they have been to us.
-	The notion that divorce means you have failed as a person: the stigma surrounding divorce is so toxic that some individuals would rather die than be divorced. This stigma keeps people in unhealthy relationships for a long time that ultimately affects them and their children.
-	Mothers are the care takers of their children: When two people have kids it’s both of their duties to take care of the child. Unfortunately in some places people tend to make it the mother’s duty to raise the child. And if they think the mother is failing to do so , it’s the mother who faces all kinds of abuse.
