Ukraine's president invoked the horror of the 2001 terror attacks on the US as he pleaded for more military aid in a historic address to the US Congress.

Volodymyr Zelensky said via video link that Ukraine was enduring a 9/11 every day as it battled Russian forces.

He again urged the US and Nato allies to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying: "I need to protect the sky."

US President Joe Biden is later set to sign off an extra $800m (Â£612m) in military aid to Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky urged the assembled US politicians to remember coming under attack in the past - at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and on 11 September 2001 - saying Ukrainians were experiencing the same thing every day. 

So far so good. But will US help the poor country?
