#5 Jimmy Brain
Jimmy Brain was tied with Ted Drake as Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 139 goals, despite the fact that Brain took 232 games to reach this mark, while Drake had scored in fewer. Brain, on the other hand, was as prolific as Drake. 
The former player was one of the best in the North London derby, as his debut came against them, and what a way to start, as he scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Tottenham. Truely one of the greatest strikers in Arsenal history.
 
#4 John Radford
Radford was a youth player whose rapid rise saw him called up to the senior team, and the player would go on to become one of the youngest players to score a held high against Wolves, at the age of 17 years and 315 days, a record that has yet to be broken. Since then, he has been a relentless goal-scorer, cementing his place in Arsenal history.
He was a regular scorer, and he was never off the scoresheet. Despite his age, Radford kept scoring in double figures and went on to score 149 goals in 481 games for Arsenal.
 
#3 Cliff Bastin
Bastin's performance at his local club made him a prominent player, and his talent was observed by then-Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman, and the rest is history; under him, he matured into one of the finest strikers in Arsenal history. Bastin became a regular starter in his first season, appearing in 21 games.
He was given over 30 games at such a young age, and his coolness and deadly precision in front of goal earned him the nickname "Boy Bastin." What made him an even more impressive player was that he played on the wings rather than as a forward. In 396 appearances, the player scored 178 goals.
