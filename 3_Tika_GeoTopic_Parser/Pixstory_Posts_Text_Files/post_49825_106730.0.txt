A bipartisan group of Senate negotiators is all set to make some amendments regarding gun control and they have reached a tentative agreement on legislation that would pair fair new gun regulations with adherence to mental health and school security investments. If enacted this would be a path-breaking step from Congress regarding the gun issues over decades.
‌
‌The deal was confirmed by three people who were involved in the negotiation according to the Washington Post. While substantially weaker than the assault weapons ban, high-capacity ammunition magazine restrictions and broad background check expansions that most Democrats support, the gun requirements set out in the framework could, if legislated, represent the most crucial new federal firearms restrictions enacted since the mid-1990s.

This deal highlight includes the reg flag laws that would allow authorities to keep guns away from people found by a judge to represent a potential threat to themselves or others, while federal criminal background checks for gun buyers under 21 would include a mandatory search of juvenile justice records for the first time.

However, It does not include a provision supported by President Biden, congressional Democrats and a few Republicans that would raise the minimum age for the purchase of at least some rifles from 18 to 21. Handguns already have a federal 21-and-over age limit.
