I know in situations as desperate as this, it becomes hard not to look around for any way we can to help us but here's the deal : Religion will not protect us. No religion would. The whole point of the Roe ban is that people want religion to be at the top. And in a situation like that, trying to find reasoning in religion would do exactly what they want us to do.

They do not care about other religions either. They care about christianity. This is christian fascism. So no amount of argument about the equality between religions will make any more difference than an argument about logic does.

We need people to see the wrongs in the religion, we need them to see science. We don't need them to go deeper into this endless dark pit which often births people like those who're against women's rights. It's like using misogyny against misogynist â€“ you can't do it to protect women. In the end, it will harm us. We don't need temporary change. We demand a systemic change.
