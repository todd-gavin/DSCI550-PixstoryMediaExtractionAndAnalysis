For those watching Amazon Prime’s ‘The Lord Of The Rings: Rings of Power’, they must already be familiar with the character of Galadriel in the show portrayed by Welsh actress Morfydd Clark and why she is such a headache to watch.
One of the key protagonists of the show, Galadriel here is nothing like the wise, mysterious, refined and beautiful elvish sorceress we saw in Peter Jackson’s The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, but a hardcore warrior who is rash, manipulative, angry, rude and immature beyond compare, particularly for someone who is already more than a thousand years old by now.
In J.R.R Tolkien’s books, Galadriel has a very complex and fascinating story, mostly told in The Silmarillion, though suffice it to say that this Galadriel has nothing going for her. While in the book and the movies she possesses a great level of wisdom, care and grace, in the Rings of Power Galadriel is a completely insufferable migraine who acts like a 10 year old kid who is just pure evil.
She is completely uncaring and selfish leaving literally one of her own company to die out in the snow even if it serves no purpose, she is manipulative to a great degree, using a man who is emotionally damaged just to fulfill her own ends while caring little for his own troubles.
She is the worst example of woke media creating ‘strong independent female lead’ by constantly portraying her as tough and angry and that she has basically no flaws, that she is the only ‘competent’ authority around while none of the men are of any help.
It is hard to imagine what the writers of the show were smoking when they ruined Galadriel’s character, but if you want to make her the lead then she has to have some kind of likeable trait and compelling story that makes me want to invest in her. She is the character we are supposed to root for and yet every second with her makes you root for the opposite.
