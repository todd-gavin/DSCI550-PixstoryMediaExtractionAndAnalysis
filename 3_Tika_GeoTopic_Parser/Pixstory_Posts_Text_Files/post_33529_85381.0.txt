Rule of the Ancient Naga Dynasty :- Narwar was indeed ruled by the Naga rulers, as numerous coins of various Naga rulers have been found at Narwar, Gwalior and Mathura, which have been described in the Journal of the Asiatic Society by Cunningham. The Naga rule is further supported by the 18th line of the Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudra Gupta, which enumerates Ganapati Naga as one of the tributary princes of Aryavarta. Indeed, Ganapati Naga is a common king inscribed on the coins found in Narwar. He thus seems to be a contemporary of Samudra Gupta. Thus the Nagas have been placed in the time of the Guptas, when their power was declining.  The rule of the Nagas has thus been placed from 0 to 225 AD. The kings of the dynasty have been identified from the coins as 1. Bhima Naga (0-25AD), 2. Kharpara Naga (25-50 AD), 3. Va Naga (50-75 AD), 4. Skanda Naga(75 to 100), 5. Brihaspati Naga(100 to 125), 6.Ganapati Naga(125 to 150), 7. Vyaghra Naga(150 to 175), 8. Vasu Naga (175 to 200), and 9. Deva Naga (200-225) in which the timings seem to be an approximation.

Reign of Toramana 

From this time there are no coins or inscriptions to illustrate the history of Narwar for the next eight centuries. Cunningham has suggested that the dynasty of the Nagas must have remained till AD 275 when the sovereignty to the south of the Yamuna fell to the dynasty of Toramana. Two inscriptions of Toramana are found at Eran to the south of Narwar, and of his son Pasupati at Gwalior to the north of Narwar. From the location of these inscriptions it can be inferred that the intermediate country of Narwar must also have belonged to the Toramana dynasty. Toramana is believed to have reigned from 260 to 285 AD, and his son Pasupati from 285 to 310 AD.
