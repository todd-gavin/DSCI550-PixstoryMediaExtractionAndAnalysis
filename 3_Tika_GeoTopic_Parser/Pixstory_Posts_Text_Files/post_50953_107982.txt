We all dwell on success We are thrilled when we succeed and we love to hear or read about stories of sucess or of successful people But we usually forget that behind every story of success there are hundreds of instances of failure stories of stumbling falling and bouncing back Joy is only the epitome of a long process of pain sadness and frustration Those who do it those who know the secret of success have had to suffer through the toil of harsh defeat again and again But failure only makes us if we accept it as part of life Failure breaks only those who see it as absolute loss as an end in itself Successful entrepreneurs are experts in failure Behind the happy face of achievement time lost wishes unachieved and goals missed The characteristics of those who fail only to succeed are diverse but I summarize them in the form of tips and advice as follows Don t be afraid to fail Fear of failure is also a hidden fear of success Great success is built on great failures Robert Kennedy once said that only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly Failure is the mother of inventiveness Thomas Edison said that he had not failed but had found thousands ways what he had invented did not work Experimenting and failing again and again is common to the great inventors who have changed our lives for ever Failure is success suspended until the moment is ripe Sometimes we fail because we are ahead of our time or because we are getting there but we need to think harder work harder and be more persistent You can know success only if you have experienced failure The best perspective on sucess is through failure It s failure that gives you the proper perspective on success as Success is built on held assumptions and found solutions Some assumptions work and others don t It s okay to make mistakes it s NOT okay not to learn from them Mistakes are the imperfections that push us to aspire to perfection
