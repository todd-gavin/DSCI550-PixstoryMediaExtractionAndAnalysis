Transgenders in Afghanistan have never been able to find their gender identity due to gender bias and continue their lives with relative freedom like other citizens. They live in constant fear; The fear that casts a shadow on all corners of their lives and does not allow them to breathe easily for an hour a day.
When they realize the gender difference between themselves and others and these differences show themselves in their daily behavior, they are openly criticized and unloved by the family and become lonely. Traditional Afghan families cannot accept the existence of a child with a different gender identity due to the beliefs they have carried with them for centuries.
An Afghan family considers having a child with a different gender identity or having no identity as a great shame for itself. This bubble of shame and Afghan zeal has caused LGBT people in Afghanistan to be kept in isolation without any human value.
Upon reaching the growing age, most of them are pushed out by their families and take refuge in the cities, where they make a living by dancing in wedding parties or other private parties.
They dance to earn money. Of course, among these gays, some of them, who are older than them and no longer have a place in the dance arenas, take the responsibility of organizing and sending young gays to parties for dancing.
