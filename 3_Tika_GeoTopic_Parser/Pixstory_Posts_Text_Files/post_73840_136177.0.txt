Meena kumari popularly know as the tragedy queen was an extraordinary actress . Known for her ability to  effortlessly pull of tragic roles and convey expressions through her eyes.  This song picturised on Meena Kumari is one of my favourites. 
Yunhi koi mil gaya tha from the film Pakeezah(1972) sung by lata mangeshkar, music by Ghulam Mohammad and lyrics by kaifi aazmi . Aside from brilliant music, vocals  and lyrics the cinematography of this song is beautiful as well . It simply transports you to another world. It perfect to listen on calm nights .
