Election day in Australia produces a carnival atmosphere in polling booths, but underlying the goodwill comes a serious decision, and Saturday's vote has the potential to usher in huge change. 

CNN reported that after a three-year period marked by the pandemic, climate calamities, and accusations of dishonesty, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is asking voters to re-elect his center-right Liberal-National coalition government. 

Since defying polls to achieve a "miracle" victory against Labor in 2019, Morrison's popularity has dropped, and this election is considered as a referendum on his self-described "bulldozer" leadership style. 

Morrison's major opponent is Anthony Albanese, a Labor Party veteran who inherited the leadership after his shell-shocked predecessor stepped aside after the party's election loss in 2019.

This time, Labor has pared down its policy offerings to close the gap with the coalition, despite the fact that both parties are facing unprecedented opposition from "teal" Independents fighting for more climate action and political integrity. 

Teal is a colour that combines their "blue" Liberal ideas with their "green" convictions, according to the millionaire founder of "Climate 200." 

The big parties need 76 seats to form a majority government; if they don't, they'll have to negotiate with smaller parties and Independents to form a minority government.

Letâ€™s see what happens next!
