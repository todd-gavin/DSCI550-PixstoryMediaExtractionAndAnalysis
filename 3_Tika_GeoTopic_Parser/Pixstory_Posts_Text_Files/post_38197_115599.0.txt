Cristiano Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has reportedly offered the striker's services to Paris Saint Germain. The Portuguese striker reportedly wants to leave Manchester United. Hence is agent is working on possible deals for the superstar. 

The 5-time Ballon d'Or winner shocked the Manchester United board last week after he informed them that he is open to moving in the summer. However, not a lot of options are available for Cristiano Ronaldo at the moment. 

Chelsea have emerged as the early favourites for the striker. But Bayern Munich, Roma, and now even PSG are said to be his potential options according to football experts and pundits alike. 

Manchester United on the other hand have stated that they have no intentions of selling Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. The Red Devils' new manager Erik Ten Hag also confirmed in a recent press conference that Ronaldo is a part of his plans for next season.

However, this has not stopped Jorge Mendes from offering the services of his client to other European giants. PSG were approached by Ronaldo's agent however, early reports suggest that the deal is unlikely to happen. 

More clarity on this news is expected to arrive in a few hour's time.
