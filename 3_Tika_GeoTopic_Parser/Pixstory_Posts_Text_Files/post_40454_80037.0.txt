I support your statement because of many reasons, as we are normalizing, we are stepping in the situations we have faced earlier but this time we aware what is in our hands and what's not.
By this what I mean is, as we stepout from homes, we will be facing more pollution, dust which affects our health. We cannot reduce it all but one of the major step we can do is start planting trees around us as much as possible.
We all know, trees/plants take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which is present in large amount due to excessive presence of carbon, nitrogen and other gases present. 

With this, start planting from your home to thr areas around you and see how positively it impacts not only you but everyone around you!
