An estimated 45 million Americans diet each year and spend $33 billion annually on weight loss products. This is result of a toxic culture where society has set certain standards about what beauty is and people literally starve themselves to fit that standards. Gone are the days where it was about being fit. Now, it’s just about getting thin and getting thin, fast! 

There is a fad of “healthy diets” but most of them are lies. According to Linder Center, regardless of their nature, most diets result in temporary weight loss that is not permanent. For both healthy and overweight people, weight cycling, or recurrent weight loss through dieting and subsequent weight gain (yo-yo effect), can be hazardous to mental and physical health. Weight swings have also been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.

Moreover, the mental and psychological side effects are no less. Reports show that guilt and self-blame, anger, anxiety and despair, difficulty concentrating, and weariness are all common symptoms of chronic dieters. Continuous feelings of failure connected to "messing up my diet again" lower their self-esteem, leading to feelings of loss of control over food choices and, ultimately, life in general. Dieting is a crucial antecedent to disordered eating in adolescents, with moderate dieters five times more likely to develop an eating disorder than those who do not diet at all.

If one really needs to lose weight to be fit, there is always the option of sustainable and healthy eating along with proper exercises. This should be always preferred over dieting!
