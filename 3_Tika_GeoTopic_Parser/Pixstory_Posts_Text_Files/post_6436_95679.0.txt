I’ve been wondering more about this love I have within. I wonder if this love that I have can really be matched. Not everyone is capable of having this love because some are simply blinded by hurt and pain….which blocks love that one has to give, blocked off.

Don’t rush giving your love away, though. (Something I say to self)

Just like material items that people feel are valuable , the love that you have within, it is just as valuable as any item in this world. Continue to carry patience and be kinda of selfish with who you give your love to. It’s ok to question who is allowed to have it. 

I love you and happy 420✨
