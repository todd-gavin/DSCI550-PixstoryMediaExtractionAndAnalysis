On tax collection week, the Taliban deputy prime minister stressed that the country’s revenue should not be wasted.

The tax collection week was celebrated today (Saturday, January 15), and Abdul Salam Hanafi, the second deputy prime minister of the Taliban, said at the meeting that an afghani would not be wasted from the steady income.

“People should be sure that not an afghani is wasted from the country’s revenues and that the government will do its utmost to boost the country’s economic growth,” he added.

On the other hand, the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid stated that the people of rich countries are committed to their economic progress in paying taxes.
