Well, I am gonna share about few apps that I believe it will simplify everyone's life regardless of their domain. 

1. Brain FM 
It's an app that would calm your mind and help you in achieving your goals of a focused and attentive mind. Music relieves you, right? 

2. Krisp
Krisp is need of the hour. The most irritating thing while speaking over call or during meetings is the unwanted background noise. So it helps you to cancel background noise. 

3. MindMeister
Mindmaps are helpful for planning, brainstorming ideas and executing. MindMeister can be used to analyze, design and choose the best among various alternatives

4. Google Sheets
Google sheets offer an easy interface with great features. One can easily organize their data, offers almost all the arithmetical calculations to do in the cell etc. It feels like a lite version of excel to me.
