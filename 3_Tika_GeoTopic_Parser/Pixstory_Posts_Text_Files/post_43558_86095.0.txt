Netflix K-drama series Hellbound starts with the arrival of supernatural beings in a dystopian world — but it’s nothing angelic. Instead, they’re there to condemn and send people to hell, creating chaos.

Taking advantage of the chaos, a religious group named The New Truth thrives as people search for answers. Yoo Ah-in plays the protagonist, with Park Jung-min and Kim Hyun-joo in supporting roles.

It’s directed by filmmaker Yeon Sang-ho, who is also behind zombie thriller Train To Busan, so you’ll be in for a ride. It will also be aired at the 46th Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), making it the first Korean television series to be invited
