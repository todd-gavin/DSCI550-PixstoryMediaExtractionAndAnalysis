Kerala Cuisine 😋
Ate Kerala food after 2 loooooong weeks. Missed this even at Onam. But now I feel a great satisfaction 😇. The pothichoru was nice, had a flavour of banana leaves, as the rice was packed in it and was hot. Eating boiled red rice after ages really felt like feeding my soul🧚‍♀️. Especially the omelette🍳.
