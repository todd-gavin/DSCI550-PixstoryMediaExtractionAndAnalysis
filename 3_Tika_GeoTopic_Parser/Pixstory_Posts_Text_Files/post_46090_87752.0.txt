Gun control laws give too much power to the government and may result in government tyranny and the government taking away all guns from citizens. And this is not just my view but the view of 57% of Americans. 

In fact, history is testimony to the fact that our Founding Fathers put the Second Amendment there when they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny. 

We maybe be not living under tha tyranny now but jan 6 tells us that we should be ready for anything. How will the government which was not able to safeguard the Capitol Hill will protect me?

Moreover, what is the guarantee that gun control laws will prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws. Criminals find a way to prevent crime one way or another and I haven’t met a shooter who is a law abiding citizen. A Guide to Mass Shooting in America tells us that of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012, 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively, 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75% obtained legally.

So how exactly gun control laws are supposed to make citizens safe? These laws would only take away guns from law abiding citizens who have their and everyone’s best interest at their heart while homociders will continue to obtain them illegally and carry out mass shooting.
