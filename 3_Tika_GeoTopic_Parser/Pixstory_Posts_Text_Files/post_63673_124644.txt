 Comic book author Frank Miller has given us some of the best and worst of Batman For the unversed Frank Miller wrote the s acclaimed comic The Dark Knight Returns and all its sequels where he turned Batman into an aged sociopath Miller s Batman to this day has been a divisive figure among comic book fans which is both lauded and hated Miller s Batman unlike the more traditional comics features a far more grizzled up hero who in many ways is a villain He is cruel hypocritical amoral selfish uncaring and possibly evil This may also be a very realistic mental depiction of a man who goes out into the night dressing up as a bat to beat the crap out of criminals anyone doing something like that is clearly not right in the head Miller s Dark Knight was a soldier in the garb of a vigilante but also an old man mired in failure and misery for regardless of his accomplishments it seemed he was always a step behind the evil he spent his life fighting As an artist his art is a hit or complete miss for example in The Dark Knight Returns he had a pretty decent art style but in The Dark Knight Strikes Again his art became complete and utter garbage It had a decent storyline and one hell of an ending and sad twist which only makes you hate Batman more as a person While his art style is a mixed affair a storyteller the man has a vivid imagination Creating a more dreary noir style world his own world feels like a far more hopeless and dark world with little scope for redemption and Batman is just that guy who is willing to do anything to change this world even if he must embrace the evil he has been fighting to win over it Miller drove home the reality of the violence of Batman s world and in the process drove home the human element thus making him more powerful and real Batman is as much a frail and breakable man who is simultaneously far more than just a man
