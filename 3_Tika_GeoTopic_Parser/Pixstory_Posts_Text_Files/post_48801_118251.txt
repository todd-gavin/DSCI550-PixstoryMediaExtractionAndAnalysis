I believe most of us have heard this sentence coming from our parents But how exactly healthy it is to tell your kids that Making your kids count the favors you did on them everytime they want to set boundaries is gaslighting It is a sign of being a narcissistic parent There s a difference between protecting your children and hurting them in the name of protection And the difference is just that superiority complex People have forgotten that being a parent is a responsibility not a favour While it is great and admirable to do all that for your kids it does not nullify the fact that you CHOSE it Your kids didn t ask to be born It was your choice to bring them into the world and it s your duty to take care of them They owe you nothing It is not to be ungrateful Just like every parent wants the best for their kids every child wants to think the best of their parents Not one kid grows up thinking okay I want so desperately to hate my parents And most don t Even after the toxicity they were put through they do love and respect their parents However this doesn t mean it shouldn t be changed Listing down everything a parent does for their child a child who doesn t have any wisdom to deal with the world is often a successful attempt to make them feel guilt ridden for being their own person Everytime a kid has any disagreements discomfort or wants to make a choice of their own this never missing bullet is shot through their chest successfully killing that child s blooming personality Honestly this cycle of generational trauma needs to end Being strict sometimes and being controlling are two different things
