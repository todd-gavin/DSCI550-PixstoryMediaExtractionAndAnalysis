‘Operation LEGHORN’ and the
Battle of the Namka Chu continues....
Diplomatically, Mao acknowledged possible diplomatic isolation as 
the Soviet Union, the United States, the Republic of China and other ‘misinformed countries would oppose China’s actions. India led the Non Aligned Movement, Nehru enjoyed international prestige, and China, with a larger military would be portrayed as an aggressor. However, he said that a well-fought war ‘will guarantee at least thirty years of peace’ withIndia, and determined the benefits to offset the costs.
On 8th October, China’s CMC ordered additional veteran and high-quality divisions to prepare to move into Tibet from the Chengdu and Lanzhou military regions.‘Op LEGHORN’ began with the move of a platoon of ‘D’ Company 
(Coy) 9th Punjab, to Tseng-jong (or Sinjang), a position across the Namka Chu, which had been occupied as a bridge-head for Lt. Gen. Kaul’s so-called ‘positional warfare’ tactics to evict the Chinese. Personally taken there by the Company Commander, Major M. S. Chaudhary, The platoon had occupied the position at 1500 hours on 8th October, and a section was detached the next morning to occupy the height behind them (Karpola II). 
The position was reinforced the next day by a platoon of ‘A’ Coy of the same battalion. This resulted in a major engagement on 10th October, the first-ever between the armies of China and India. After a heavy bombardment by heavy mortars, this weak, barely-prepared position was attacked by a full Chinese battalion (approximately 800 men)at 0800 hours on 10th October, which was repulsed after a heavy exchange of fire for about 45 minutes. A second attack came in at 0930 hours, with the Punjabis already low on ammunition, having been hastily 
sent out with only pouch ammunition.
