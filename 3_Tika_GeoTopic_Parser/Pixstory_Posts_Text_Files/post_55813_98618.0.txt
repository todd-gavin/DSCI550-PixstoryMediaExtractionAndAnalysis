Most literary novels are about the middle class, so much so that we don’t often think about class when we read them. Being middle class—like being white and male—is read as the universal human experience. 

One of the most important novel in this domain is Bunch of Ratbags by William Dick. This novel was about a young boy who lived in any neighborhood.

The novel is set in Sydney in the late 1950s and tells the story of several women working in the Jumbuck spinning mills. The women are underpaid and overworked. Hewitt was not working class herself. She came from a rich rural family but she was a Marxist and a member of the Communist Party. In the late 1940s she took a job in a Sydney spinning mill because she wanted to help the working class, a move that might appear patronizing and naive now, but an experience that inspired Bobbin Up. 

The novel focused on working women’s lives, not only their lives at work but their relationships with lovers, family, and other male members of the left who were often dismissive of the women and their rights. It was the first novel many read about working class women. It was political and poetic and women were at its center.

Therefore, it is an imperative novel for Australians!
