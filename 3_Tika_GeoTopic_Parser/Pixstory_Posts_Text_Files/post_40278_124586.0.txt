I know You might be full of fear , feeling insecure , unsure of your emotions ... I know you might be judging the unknown and losing faith in your emotions . Falling in love again might seem scary . However , love is not painful and should not seem frightening . Love is the most beautiful feeling in the world . If you did not get it right the first time , do not close your doors... You will get more opportunities... It is all part of your learning and growth until you get the love you wish to make eternal . There is no right or wrong love . It is about what is best for you and what makes your heart beat faster . ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è

Do not stop loving or giving the best in yourself . You are stuffed with love and you will never get over it, trust me . Do not start with fear . Do not think it will not be forever . Do not anticipate the pain... Give a chance to the new romance . Trust , trust yourself , your love and the universe . Getting the opportunity to love and feel loved is the most precious gift . Cherish the moment and enjoy the journey . ‚ù§Ô∏è

Let go of all the emotions that stop you from feeling the love... ‚ù§Ô∏è
