The Bharatiya Janata Party today announced several high-level appointments across the country. Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary, a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government and a member of the Legislative Council, has been appointed as the state's President. Mr Chaudhary is from the Jat community in Western Uttar Pradesh and has reportedly been appointed to consolidate Jat votes for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, as the traditional BJP voter base may be slipping away from the ruling party following last year's massive protests against the contentious and now-revoked farm bills.
Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary, the state cabinet's Minister of Panchayati Raj, replaces Swatantra Dev Singh, an OBC leader from southern Uttar Pradesh.
The appointment of Chaudhary could erode the influence of the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance in west UP, where the Jat community holds around 20 Lok Sabha seats.
Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister, congratulated Mr Chaudhary on his appointment, saying his "energetic leadership" will set new standards for the party's success
