The series was excellent, everyone had a unique role. It's like we can't predict who will do what in the next part, it's filled with surprises. The actors portraying the villanous characters had also done a great job, the way a boss should be and how they are running there bussines and also controlling things going in mirzapur where all well done. My favourite character is munna's wife. Waiting for season 3 desperately!
