The world’s oldest tree located in the Chilean Andes may be mute but is witness to history of thousands of years. The ancient alerce is called “Gran Abuelo” or great grandfather whose age has been calculated to be 5,400 years by a new computer model, states a report in sciencealert.com.

On the confirmation of its age, this coniferous tree will be 600 years older to the one which is the official record holder – the Great Basin bristlecone pine called “Methuselah” in California.

The real age of the tree is disputed since its dendrochronology is incomplete. This method analyses the rings of the tree and is considered as the gold standard for determining the age. The data for the model has neither been given to a peer-reviewed journal nor released in the public domain.
