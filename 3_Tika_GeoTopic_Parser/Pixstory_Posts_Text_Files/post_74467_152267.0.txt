Hanuman never wears leather belt, it is wearing earrings with curly hairs, holding thunder and flags in hand.”😱💯Earlier, on teaser release, VFX of film attracted criticism. The CGI-heavy teaser drew criticism for its poor quality visual effects, which included portraying Saif Ali’s character as having ten heads like Ravana. 😱A user tweeted, Ramayan or any Marvel film? This movie needs to be banned from release just not boycott as it’s tampering our greatest ancient culture.😱😱✅A user wrote, “Even the shoes worn by Ram in Adipurush are an insult to Bhagwan Shree Ram. Shree Ram wore paduka not these type of leather Spartacus sandals. Everything about this movie is demeaning to Hinduism.”
