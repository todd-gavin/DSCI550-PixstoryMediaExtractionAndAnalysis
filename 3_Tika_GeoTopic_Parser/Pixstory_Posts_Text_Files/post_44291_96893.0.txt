Ex-City defender Micah Richards had some words to say about the Man City's selection of 
personal. The now-Pundit believes Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus are in some form and that Guardiola must put that into full effect as both stars near the end of their contracts.

"Like Gabriel Jesus, Sterling is out of contract in 2023 and, until either of them sign an extension, they are going to be linked with other clubs," Richards told BBC Sport. "But for me it's simple - City have to try to keep them both if they can.

Both of them are versatile and hard-working, and can play on both wings or down the middle. They also don't just know how to play in Pep Guardiola's system, they excel at it."

Jesus was of course linked with a summer move to Arsenal before he bagged four goals against Watford last week.

"Sterling has these moments where his form is up and down but he always comes back strongly. He was basically written off before last summer's European Championship but ended up being one of the stars of the tournament.

"I wouldn't be surprised if he plays against Real - and whether he scores or not, for me it would be typical Sterling if he plays a big part in helping City win."

Richards' claims aren't unanimous. Many City fans think Jesus should be let go if a good 
enough offer comes through. The Brazilian has seen his playtime cut short significantly as City no longer play with an out and out striker in their lineup.

Sterling on the other hand, creates moments of magic in the final third. His experience is vital but Guardiola's preference for the likes of Phil Foden and Jack Grealish has often forced Sterling to the bench as of late.
