Farahnaz Forotan (Persian: فرحناز فروتن, born 1992[1]) is an Afghan journalist and women's rights activist.[2][3] She moved to Iran together with her family during the Mujahideen regime. Farahnaz returned to Afghanistan in 2001, but took refuge in France in 2020 after being included on a Taliban hit list. 

Farahnaz Forotan worked at three of the main television broadcasting stations in Afghanistan between 2012 and 2020,[7] including Ariana Television Network.[8] She has hosted major talk shows including Purso Pal for TOLOnews and Goft-i Go-i Wehza (Special talk) and the weekly program Kabul Debate for 1TV.

Farahnaz has traveled throughout the country and abroad to report on Afghanistan related stories, including reporting from the Sangin District of Helmand when it was a dangerous war zone held by the Taliban. Her courage was commended by the team's leader, Bismillah Mohammadi, after he unsuccessfully ordered her to stay behind.

She rose to prominence with an investigative documentary on the lives of Taliban prisoners, which dissected their thought-process and rationale for targeting not only Afghan and international forces, but also the general public in Afghanistan.

As of 2019, Farahnaz was a student at a private university in Kabul as well as a practising journalist. In 2019 and 2020, Farahnaz conducted a social media campaign and travelled the country collecting testimonies from women, in an attempt to prevent the Taliban from using the Afghan peace process to roll back freedoms for women that were acquired since the fall of the Taliban.[4][12][13][14] The testimonies were used to lobby Afghan leaders, foreign diplomats and civil society groups, and Farahnaz's campaign had the backing of UN Women Afghanistan.[4][15][5] In 2019, The New York Times reported that her social media campaign, known as #myredline, "implores women to stand up for their rights."[16] On April 4, 2019, Reuters reported she "launched the movement by declaring that her pen, symbolic of her profession, was her red line."[17] On April 21, 2019, Farahnaz told AFP that President Ashraf Ghani had tweeted that women's rights were a "red line" in the peace process.
