Sunday plans not sorted? I recommend you to try Exposed: The Ghost Train Fire! 

As The Guardian says, Critics typically associate the term "white knuckle" with thrillers and action films, but this startlingly excellent investigative series serves as a reminder that it can also be used to describe documentaries. 

The trilogy of three feature-length episodes centres on an almost unimaginably awful real-life tragedy: a fire that destroyed the titular ride in Sydney's Luna Park in 1979, killing seven peopleâ€”six boys and a man. 

One of the most electrifying scenes I've seen in any Australian documentary is a protracted nerve-wracking period in the first episode that weaves together witness testimony and dramatic reconstruction. 

The great reporting of Caro Meldrum-Hanna and her colleagues, who treat a stale old issue with a renewed urgency, is essential to the show's legitimacy.

So, does this sound like your cup of tea?
