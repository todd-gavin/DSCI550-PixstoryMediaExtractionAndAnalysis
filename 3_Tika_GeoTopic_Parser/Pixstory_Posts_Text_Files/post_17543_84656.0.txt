Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis has officially been ruled out for tonight's game against the Dallas Mavericks. The superstar forward is currently dealing with a foot injury that has been described as a mid-foot sprain. It was announced that Davis would be re-evaluated in four weeks on February 17th and basketball fans will be anticipating an update from the organization in the coming weeks.

When Davis returns to the lineup, the Lakers are going to have to be ready to make a final push towards making a run in the playoffs. As of now, it would seem as if Los Angeles is set to find a spot in a potential play-in game in the Western Conference. There's still a chance that the team could defy the odds and put together a couple of strong performances to secure a spot in the playoffs, but that potential outcome could become problematic as teams such as the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors would be the "prize" for winning the play-in games.

Los Angeles will continue to battle their way to try to create some momentum in the Western Conference. With one of the toughest remaining schedules in the NBA, it's not going to be easy for the Lakers. If the team is going to want to have a fighting chance, they know they are going to need their other superstar forward back in the mix. Davis, when healthy, has been a productive force for the team this year. In 37 games this season, Davis has gone on to post averages of 23.1 points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.3 blocks per game while shooting 53.7% from the field.
