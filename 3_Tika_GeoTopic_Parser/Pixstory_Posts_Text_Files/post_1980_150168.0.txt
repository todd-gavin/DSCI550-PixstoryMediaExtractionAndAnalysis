Salvator Mundi is regarded as one of the most controversial and expensive art pieces to have ever been sold. At an auction in 2017, the paining sold for $450 million to the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman.The reason for the controversy is that, despite the hefty price tag, its authenticity is still in dispute. Many experts believe that a student of Leonardo Da Vinci painted it, while Da Vinci merely added a few elements.Following the Crown Princeâ€™s massive purchase, he attempted to persuade the Louvre to authenticate the painting as genuine ik exchange for them displaying it. However, experts at the Louvre reportedly concluded that it was not painted by Da Vinci, and instead by one of his students. Thus, the Crown Prince refused to loan it for display. Because they are restricted from commenting on the authenticity of pieces not in their collection, they did not release the report.As of 2019, the painting is said to be hanging on the yacht if the Crown Prince.
