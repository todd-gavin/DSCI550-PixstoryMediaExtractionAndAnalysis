‌An Indian student gets killed during shelling in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Tuesday, the ministry of external affairs has confirmed the incident. 
‌
‌Naveen Shekharappa G, from Chalagere village in Karnataka's Haveri district, was a fourth-year medical student at the Kharkiv National Medical University. He was living in a bunker below his flat.
‌
‌According to students there, Naveen went out to buy food when the blast happened at the city centre around 8:50am. “One of his friends received a call from Naveen's mobile. At the other end was a Ukrainian who said there has been a blast and that Naveen was taken to the morgue. The students are inconsolable,” said a student coordinator at the university.
‌
‌Naveen's friends said they have been striving help from the embassy on safe evacuation but have not received any response yet.
‌
"The foreign secretary is calling in Ambassadors of Russia and Ukraine to reiterate our demand for urgent safe passage for Indian nationals who are still in Kharkiv and cities in other conflict zones," ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said on Twitter.

3 Malayali girls in Mykolaiv also made a video on Instagram as they are running out of food and hearing explosions nearby.  PLEASE HELP OUT IF POSSIBLE.
