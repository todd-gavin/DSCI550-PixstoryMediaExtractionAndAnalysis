Elizabeth Jolley’s most famous novel ‘The Well’ is a classic when it comes to  Australian Gothic. 

The Well is a deeply unsettling book about two women living together out in the country who accidentally kill a man one evening and drop his body down a well.  

The books, fragmented and disorienting, move us back and forth through time and cover much of Jolley’s own autobiography: a Quaker childhood, nursing in London during the war, giving birth out of wedlock. The books anticipate the work of writers like Rachel Cusk, and share similarities with Tove Ditlevsen and Renata Adler. 

Her works are also very feminist in nature so they are something every woman would enjoy!
