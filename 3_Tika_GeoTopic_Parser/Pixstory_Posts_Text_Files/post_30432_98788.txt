Very important result for Genoa who beat a comeback at Marassi against Juventus with no more goals in the league The first half ended on the second half and then in the second half the black and whites immediately took the lead with Dybala with a right footed shot from outside the area after just minutes The Argentine playmaker then came close to scoring twice by hitting the post at the post. Subsequently Sirigu good at keeping Genoa&#39;s hopes alive with important interventions on Kean and Vlahovic&#39;s attempts. consulted the video images Genoa believed in it and equalized with Gudmundsson then went for the winning goal and risked being punished on the counterattack by Kean who wasted yet another chance in his game In the end, in the last minute of added time De Sciglio lands Yeboah in the area and Criscito does not get carried away by emotion by scoring a very heavy goal for the hopes of salvation of the rossoblu who thus rise to points from Salernitana
