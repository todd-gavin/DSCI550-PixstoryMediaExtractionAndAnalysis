Photo & Editing Apps

1. Lightroom - I love Lightroom for editing my photos, but it's also how I get photos from my computer onto my phone .

2. Snapseed - I sometimes use Snapseed to edit my photos some! They have a selection tool which allows you to brighten up (etc.) specific areas of your photo without editing the entire photo.

3. VSCO - This app is great if you want to add specific filters to your photos and create a cohesive feed. It's just like having a preset for your photos.

4. PicTapGo I use it to intensify colors, but it also has some fun filters as well!

5. Facetune - Facetune definitely gets a bad rap, but it's really great for brightening/whitening up your photos

6.Unfold - Unfold is similar to Canva in the way that you can easily upload your photos and text into already created collages and you're ready to upload them to your story.

7. Lightroom- To edit the colours in the photo and applying presets
