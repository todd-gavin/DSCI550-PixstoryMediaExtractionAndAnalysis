In HINDUSTAN TIMES INTERVIEW 🎤

Janhvi said that she thinks people need to accept that she is a different person from her mother. 
There’s a section of society that has been able to do that with Dhadak, but there are people who couldn’t make that differentiation and they still look for Sridevi in Janhvi. Maybe after more of her work comes out, they’ll understand she is a different type of actor and she will make different choices. On acting in any remake of Sridevi's movie, Janhvi said, "I don’t think that anyone can recreate that magic. No one can. Also, when something has been done so well, I don’t know if it’s right to try to attempt to do it again."❤️❤️ 

In my pov every person has different nature and there own personalities.🙏🏻
