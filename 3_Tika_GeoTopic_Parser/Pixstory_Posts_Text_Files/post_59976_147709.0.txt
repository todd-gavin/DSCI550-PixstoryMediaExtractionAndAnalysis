Dilip Tirkey, a former captain of India, was the front-runner to become Hockey India's president and was chosen without opposition on Friday.
The elections for Hockey India were supposed to take place on October 1 but were called off because no one ran for any of the positions, allowing the incumbents to be elected without a challenge in accordance with the federation's Constitution.
Rakesh Katyal, the president of Uttar Pradesh Hockey, and Bhola Nath Singh, the candidate for Hockey Jharkhand, both withdrew their names from consideration for the position on Friday.
The election for secretary general went without a challenger, Bhola Nath.
Tirkey and his team's appointments have been accepted by the International Hockey Federation (FIH).
According to election bylaws on the Hockey India website, candidates for any position shall be assumed to have been elected without opposition where the number of contesting candidates is equal to or fewer than the number of posts.
In light of this, it remarked, "We are glad to see that the Executive Board of Hockey India stands elected as has been placed on the Hockey India website and that the posts election was unanimous for all positions."
