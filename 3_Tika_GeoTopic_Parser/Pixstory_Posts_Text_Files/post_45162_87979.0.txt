Following manager Garth Southgate's selection on Thursday afternoon, England will face Switzerland and Cote D'Ivoire in March with a 25-man squad.

Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho of Manchester United have been left out of Southgate's England team, but Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi has received his first call-up.

The Three Lions will begin their 2022 campaign with an international doubleheader at Wembley Stadium, beginning on March 26 with a match against Switzerland.

Three days later, on March 29, England will play their first senior international against Cote D'lvoire as part of their preparations for a busy year that will include a new UEFA Nations League campaign in June and the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar in November and December.

Marc Guehi, a Crystal Palace defender who captained the MU21s earlier this season and was strangely born in the Ivorian capital of Abidjan before relocating to England with his family as a youngster, has received his first senior call-up.

Conor Gallagher, a Palace teammate, is also in the group after joining the adults from the MU21s during the November international window and making his debut against San Marino.

Arsenal's Ben White and Burley's Nick Pope have also been recalled to the team.
Following this weekend's domestic games, Southgate and his squad will reassemble at St. George's Park to begin their preparations, and the manager will talk to the media about his selections from 2pm.
