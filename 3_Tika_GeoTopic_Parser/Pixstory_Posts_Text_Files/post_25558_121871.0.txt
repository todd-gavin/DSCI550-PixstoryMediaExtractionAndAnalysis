Recently, Kylie Jenner was at the receiving end of backlash for flaunting her private jets as she took a 12-minute flight, showing absolute disregard towards the environment. Soon after, her sister Khloe Kardashian, too, shared a picture of her daughter, True, posing inside a private jet.

These incidents triggered a debate over the severe damage private jets cause to the environment, further putting an increasing number of celebrities using them in the spotlight. Marketing firm Yard recently published a report ranking the “worst celeb private jet CO2 emission offenders”.

If you look at the last line correctly, the news was published by a marketing firm, not a news agency, but a marketing firm. That should tell you the credibility and the intention of the report. It is no secret that the Kardashians have always had beef with Taylor and this seems to be nothing more than another blatant attempt at harassing and misrepresenting Taylor Swift.
