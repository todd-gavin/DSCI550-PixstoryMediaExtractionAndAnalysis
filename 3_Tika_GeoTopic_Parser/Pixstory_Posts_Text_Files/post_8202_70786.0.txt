Many women in Kabul have protested against the killing of Zainab Abdulhai and the disappearance of Alia Azizi and demanded her release.

Women marched today (Saturday, January 15) against the killing of Zainab Abdulhai and the disappearance of Alia Azizi, criticizing the Taliban and asking, “Where is the general amnesty?”.

Protesters in Kabul told Hasht-e Subh that Taliban forces had prevented them from marching; however, they had not stopped protesting and reacted in a closed location for the murder of Zainab Abdulhai and the disappearance of Alia Azizi.

They marched against the Taliban under the slogans “Terror is enough, what crime did you kill Zainab for?” And called on human rights organizations to show a reaction to the Taliban’s widespread human rights abuses.

Zainab Abdulhai is said to have been killed by the Taliban two days ago in the Dasht-e-Barchi, and Alia Azizi, the manager of the Herat Women’s Prison, has been detained by the Taliban for four months; however, the Taliban have so far said nothing about how Zainab was killed and Alia was detained.
