Tomorrow Arsenal will travel to Switzerland to face FC Zurich who currently sit th in the Swiss first division With two Premier League fixtures last week and a home game against Everton this Sunday there fixtures are piling up and this Europa League tie provides Mikel Arteta with an opportunity to rest some of our key players and give opportunities to some of the squad players Here s how I think Arsenal should line up against Zurich GK Matt Turner LB Kieran Tierney CB Rob Holding CB Ben White RB Takehiro Tomiyasu DM Sambi Lokonga CM Granit Xhaka c CM Fabio Vieira LW Gabriel Martinelli ST Eddie Nketiah RW Marquinhos FC Zurich have started the season poorly After games they have just points losing times and drawing twice They are yet to win in the league this season Therefore I expect even a heavily rotated Arsenal side to be able to beat our opposition comfortably The game kicks off at London time live on BT Sport Arsenal travelled to Switzerland yesterday with a strong squad on the flight Mikel Arteta hinted that Fabio Vieira who impressed fans during his cameo against Manchester United could be in line to start It s a shame that we detected an injury when we were doing the medical He had no pre season everything has been delayed but hopefully you re going to see a lot more of him in the next few weeks I m sure that you ll enjoy it He did add that we can expect a fairly strong lineup highlighting that this is a competition that we want to take very seriously against an opponent that is going to make life difficult for us We want to start the competition the right way and maintain our momentum Hopefully we see a rotated side as we really should have enough firepower in our depth to win the game It s hard to predict without a lineup but I m expecting a confident win COYG
