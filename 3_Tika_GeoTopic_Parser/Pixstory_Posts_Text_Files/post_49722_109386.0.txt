The US has struck down the sale of all products by country one of the top e-cigarette companies-Juul.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the company’s products did not prove to be ”appropriate for the protection of public health". Juul has announced its decision to challenge the move.

Recently FDA has come up with anti-smoking efforts like reducing the nicotine allowed in cigars. The agency had already banned the fruity flavors that enabled make Juul a phenomenon among teenagers a few years ago.

"Today's action is further progress on the FDA's commitment to ensuring that all e-cigarette and electronic nicotine delivery system products currently being marketed to consumers meet our public health standards," FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement.

Juul, founded in California in 2015 by a pair of former smokers- promoted its vaping pods as a healthier alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes.

 But on the contrary, the products, which contain high concentrations of nicotine, raised warnings as use among teens exploded, with more than a quarter of high schoolers using e-cigarettes in 2019, according to a federal survey.


In 2020 the FDA said it would require companies to submit their e-cigarette products for authorization. 

In its statement, the FDA said it had not received any evidence to suggest an "immediate hazard".

But it also noted the major role Juul, whose products under review had nicotine levels of 3% and 5%, still plays in the market.

"We recognize these make up a significant part of the available products and many have played a disproportionate role in the rise in youth vaping," Mr. Califf said.

Juul said it would seek a stay of the ruling, which would enable it to keep selling as it examines options including an appeal.
