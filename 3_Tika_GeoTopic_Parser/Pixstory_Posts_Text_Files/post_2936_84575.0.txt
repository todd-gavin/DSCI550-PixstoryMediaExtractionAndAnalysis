Yet another climate report, yet another warning of time running out. And the world continues as before. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published this week a report that says global warming is making an impact faster than expected. But the leaders who should take note were busy playing war games with nuclear threats.

As part of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, the Working Group II here assessed the impacts of climate change, looking at ecosystems, biodiversity, and human communities at global and regional levels. It also reviewed vulnerabilities and the capacities and limits of the natural world and human societies to adapt to climate change.

Released Monday, this is the most detailed scientific study so far on the dangers of global warming. Its conclusion, in summary, is: 

Human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature and affecting the lives of billions of people around the world, despite efforts to reduce the risks. People and ecosystems least able to cope are being hardest hit: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release

Its five key takeaways are: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/climate/climate-change-ipcc-report-takeaways.html

*Climate hazards have worsened significantly in the past decade.
*If warming isn’t slowed, the dangers will multiply.
*Societies have not done enough to adapt and stay safe.
*As warming continues, it will become harder and harder to cope.
*Poor countries face much bigger challenges than rich ones.

The scientists from around the world who teamed up to write the massive report say the climate threat is mounting so rapidly that it could soon overwhelm the capacity of both nature and humanity to adapt. We are moving fast to a future in which floods, fires and famine would displace millions. Yet, they say, world leaders are not doing what needs to be done to protect people, flora and fauna, farms and coastlines: 

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described it as “an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.” The world leadership, it seems, is still busy with other agendas, instead of worrying about the state of the planet. Is it the mindset, a matter of old habits?
