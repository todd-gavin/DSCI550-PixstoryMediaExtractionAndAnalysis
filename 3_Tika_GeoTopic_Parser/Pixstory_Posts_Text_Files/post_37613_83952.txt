India won the second T and seal the T series against Sri Lanka Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to bowl first in the second T against Sri Lanka Sri Lankan openers were not doing good before this match and it was their middle order taking care of the runs This time The Sri Lankan openers laid a solid foundation with Pathum Nissanka scoring off balls but it was the middle order that failed to score big after that impressive start Even though the middle order failed the Sri Lankan captain Shanaka hit a quick off just balls scoring sixes and boundaries which helped Sri Lanka put on the board All five of the Indian bowlers managed to pick up a wicket each but it was Harshal Patel who was the most expensive conceding a whopping runs in his over spell India s batting started in a scary fashion as Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan got out early It was yet another mammoth performance from Shreyas Iyer as he steadied the ship along with Sanju Samson Iyer stayed not out at and Sir Ravindra Jadeja sealed the victory in his usual style as he hit a beautiful boundary straight down the pitch Lahiru Kumar was impressive with the ball he picked up Ishan Kishan early on and was brought on to break the partnership brewing between Iyer and Samson and succeeded in doing so He was the quickest bowler today bowling at an average speed of kmph but his efforts were just not enough since he did not have any support on the other end With this victory India goes in the match series winning the series already The last match may see a few changes since both teams are using these matches to try out strategies before the upcoming T World Cup
