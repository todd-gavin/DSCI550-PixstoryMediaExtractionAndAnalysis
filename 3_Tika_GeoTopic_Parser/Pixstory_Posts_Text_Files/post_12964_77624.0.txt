There's no truth to the rumours surrounding his wedding to fashion designer and influencer Tania Shroff, says Actor Ahan Shetty. 

Addressing the rumours the actor replied "Right now, my main focus is my work, and I'm working towards my second film. When I feel like I need to say something about my personal life, I'm not going to hide it."

Adding to it he also said that such speculative news stories have never harmed their relationship, and he also discusses the praise he received from industry for his debut performance in Tadap.
