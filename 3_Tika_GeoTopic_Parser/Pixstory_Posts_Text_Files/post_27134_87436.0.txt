According to The Hollywood Reporter, Darth Maul was originally set to be the primary antagonist for the upcoming "Obi-Wan Kenobi" Disney+ series, with
actor Ray Park set to return. However, a creative overhaul at LucasFilm ultimately changed this plan.

Hossein Amini was the original writer who worked with
director Deborah Chow on the show. And while it was
reported that preproduction paused in early 2020 because Lucasfilm was unhappy with the scripts, the reasoning behind the pause was a little more layered. 

According to sources, Chow showed the scripts to Star Wars stewards Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau, who were coming off the success of The Mandalorian, freshly launched in November 2019, and deep into work on season 2 Sources claim that Filoni and Favreau were concerned about Obi-Wan covering similar ground as Mandalorian the Lone Wolf and Cub-like story of Kenobi coming out of hiding to protect a child-aged Luke Skywalker. 

Maul was one of the villains who would participate in the hunt for the pair, whereas Vader was nowhere to be found. Filoni and Favreau also reportedly pushed Chow and the show to "go bigger". 

These concerns ultimately made their way to Lucasfilm
head Kathleen Kennedy, who then halted the show's
production and eventually hired Joby Harold as the show's new writer.
