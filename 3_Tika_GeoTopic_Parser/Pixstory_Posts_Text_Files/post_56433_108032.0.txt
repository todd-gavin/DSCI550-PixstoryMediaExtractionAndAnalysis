How can you be in a relationship when you both are or one person is completely dependent on the other? The majority of problems are caused by this dependency. 

One factor that every human values are their freedom and space. We always don't want someone to intrude on our freedom or privacy. That is not what the relationship is all about. All the other person could give you is support. The other person should not be responsible for taking care of you. Both the partners should support each other. You are looking for an equal and not a project to work on. 

Someone who respects you as an individual, your space is whom you want. Make sure you have the same towards them. Does this reduce love between you? In fact no! Majority of the problems are caused when one can't handle themselves and responsibility of another individual. This makes them anxious, tensed, and frustrated leading to problems. You can share everything from emotional load to physical work so that you will be equals and not dependents or owners of one another.
