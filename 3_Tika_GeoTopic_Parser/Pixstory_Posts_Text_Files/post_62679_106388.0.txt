Benzoyl peroxide is an excellent acne treatment. It's used to dry up pimples that have already formed and prevent new ones from forming.

Sulfur is a naturally occurring ingredient that aids in the regulation of excess oil production and the removal of dead skin cells.

Salicylic acid is another excellent element to search for in anti-acne solutions. It exfoliates the skin gently and unclogs the pores, resulting in less outbreaks. It's also effective on blackheads and whiteheads.

Tea tree oil is a natural antibacterial that aids in the elimination of acne-causing germs.

Acnes can be stubborn, but that doesn't mean you'll be too harsh on your skin. Find a mild face wash and an oil-free moisturizer (no skipping the moisturizing!) to go with your skincare routine.
