Black Americans continue to be among President Biden's strongest supporters, with two-thirds approving of his job performance. But as with the public overall, the president's approval ratings among Black Americans fell over the course of 2021 and have not returned to the heights seen at the start of his term. 

It's inflation weighing on his ratings now: most Black Americans disapprove of Mr. Biden's handling of inflation, specifically — as do Americans overall. Nor do most think he's focused enough on inflation. 

This is even as they give him net positive marks for other issues, for handling the pandemic, and for the economy more generally.

Black Americans who disapprove of his overall job performance overall also disapprove of his handling of inflation, in particular, among other issues.

Black Americans still give Mr. Biden very positive marks for handling coronavirus, even though that measure dipped over the last year too. And it's an important measure because they feel Black communities have been hard-hit by the virus, citing "a lot" of impact. 

For context: compared to other recent Democratic presidents one year into their terms, Mr. Biden's approval rating from Black Americans today is a little lower than it was  for Bill Clinton in 1994 (72%) and quite a bit lower than for Barack Obama in 2010 (87%.)

The president has also lost ground on his ratings of empathy. Among Americans overall — including Democrats, both White and Black — the percentage who describe Mr. Biden as caring about people like them is down over the year.
