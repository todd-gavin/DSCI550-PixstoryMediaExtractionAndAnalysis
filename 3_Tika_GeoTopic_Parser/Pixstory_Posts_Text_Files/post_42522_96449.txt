After beating Borussia Dortmund by a scoreline Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga title and this is their tenth straight league title win that s why Bundesliga is known as the farmers league because there is only one team who can fight for the title and other teams are just there to fight for remaining top spots in the league Bayern Munich wins the Bundesliga title with three games in hand but because of their bad performance in UEFA Champions League they are not fighting for any other title right now So Bayern Munich just has three games remaining for this season and the manager of the Bayern Munich Julian Nagelsmann can try something new in his starting But whatever is said and done winning ten straight league titles isn t easy and hats off to the board of Bayern Munich to maintain the quality of team players and managers of the team Congratulations to Bayern Munich but I wish in the upcoming season any other team should give a tough fight to Bayern Munich and win the title because someone has to break the monopoly of Bayern Munich So till then all the fans of football just have to WAIT and WATCH
