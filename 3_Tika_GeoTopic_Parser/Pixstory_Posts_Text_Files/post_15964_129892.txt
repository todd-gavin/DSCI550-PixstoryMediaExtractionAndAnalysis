Abstract Diabetes is one of the top non communicable diseases that occur worldwide according to the World Health Organization Despite not being a fatal disease a late diagnosis as well as poor control can cause a fatal outcome because of that several studies have been carried out with the aim of proposing additional techniques to the gold standard to assist in the diagnosis and control of this disease in a non invasive way Considering the above and in order to provide a solid starting point for future researches we share a primary research dataset with saliva samples obtained by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy considering the Attenuated Total Reflectance method Database include gender age individuals patients with without diabetes the glucose value and the result to the A C test for the diabetic population We believe that sharing dataset as is could increase experimentation research and analysis of spectra through different strategies broaden its range of applicability by chemists doctors physicists computer scientists among others to identify the effects that the virus causes in the body and to propose possible clinical treatments as well as to develop devices that allow us to assist in the characterization of possible carriers Sources
