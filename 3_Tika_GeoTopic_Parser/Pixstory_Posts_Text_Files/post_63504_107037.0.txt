Australia national team have secured a place in the World Cup 2022 as they rode their luck in a 5-4 penalty win over Peru following a 120 minute stalemate draw.

The victory earned the Socceroos their fifth consecutive World Cup ticket and sixth in total as the team have featured in every World Cup edition since 2006. 

However, in spite of their frequent participation in the football global tournament, Australia is not known for having a stellar record in the competition with their best stint so far coming in 2006 when they saw qualification through to the round-of-16 stage. 

With 4 points obtained from the group stage, Australia progressed through to the round-of-16 of the 2006 World Cup only to be beaten 1-0 by the eventual champions Italy after conceding a controversial penalty in the 93rd minute of the encounter. 

The 2006 World Cup campaign proved to be their best performance as they have consistently failed to make it beyond the group stage in subsequent World Cup participations. 

A shambolic spell in the 2010 World Cup where they were heavily humiliated 4-0 by Germany continued in 2014 as they were not only unable to see through to the next phase, but also remained winless in the three group stage fixtures, failing to secure a win against opponents Chile, Netherlands and Spain.

These underwhelming performance peaked in the 2018 World Cup in Russia when the Socceroos became the only team without a win in the competition having suffered a 2-1 and 2-0 loss to France and Peru respectively and a 1-1 draw at the hands of Denmark.

With qualification to the 2022 World Cup in the bag, the question as to whether they can redeem their World Cup fortune remains hanging in the air. But we wait to see as the events unfolds in Qatar.
