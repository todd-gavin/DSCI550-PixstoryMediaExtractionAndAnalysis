Completely agree with this whole point of technological hindrance and privacy.
There has to be a balanced which is lacking between technology and individual autonomy.
Privacy is the right to be left alone and free from personal intrusions.
But to the extent, our personal information is left to be seen and accessed by anyone worldwide is unimaginable.

A variety of information on individuals is kept in databases. These databases house information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, medical histories, family histories, and more. Every organization has a database full of information on everyone they do business with. 

The concern with this is whether or not they should be collecting this information, what they will do with it, how secure it is, how accurate it is, and to whom it can be sold. In addition, personal data is increasingly made available in online databases, which search engines can access.

The government and corporations can track our digital footprint in different ways. To some extent, it could be acceptable if it is necessary for official purposes, but the way it is being misused is insane.
We are trapped in the circle of choosing the new technologies for our ease while protecting our autonomy from surveillance, but the truth is it is impossible.
