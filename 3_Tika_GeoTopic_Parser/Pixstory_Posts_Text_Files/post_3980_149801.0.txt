Following me, where I am
I jump, you too 
With you I feel loved 
You heal me with your reflection
Sometimes, dear shadow 
You look the most beautiful
In the dark or light 
You are with me like a partner in crime 
You pave thoughts of self reflection in me 
You dive deep into my soul 
You show me why and for what I chase for
You show me the reason of my walk
