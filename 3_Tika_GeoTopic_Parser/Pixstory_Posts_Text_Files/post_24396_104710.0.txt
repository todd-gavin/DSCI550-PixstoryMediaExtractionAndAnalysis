UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday condemned the killing of two Egyptian members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali, a UN spokesman said.

Two other peacekeepers were injured when their armoured personnel carrier hit an improvised explosive device outside of the town of Douentza, in the Mopti region, said Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for Guterres. "They were going from Douentza to Timbuktu. They were escorting ... from what I understand ... civilian trucks," the spokesman said as quoted by Xinhua News Agency.
