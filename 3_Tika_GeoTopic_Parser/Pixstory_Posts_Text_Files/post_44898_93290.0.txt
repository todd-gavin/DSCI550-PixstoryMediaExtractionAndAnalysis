During the last international break, the Dutchman disclosed he was suffering with a life-threatening disease. After "25 radiation treatments," Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal has offered an encouraging update on his cancer battle.
Following Frank De Boer's decision to step down following the country's dismal performance at Euro 2020, Van Gaal assumed leadership of the Netherlands for the third time in his career.

 The Oranjes had gone nine games without losing since the 70-year-comeback, old but his future in the post has been called into question after he revealed during the March international break that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Since his revelation on Dutch television, Van Gaal has received messages of support from all around the football world, even from certain members of the Netherlands side, as he had previously kept his sickness a secret.

The seasoned manager, who has previously worked for Ajax, Barcelona, and Manchester United, also stated that his disease was not terminal and that he is currently in the final phases of his recovery.
"I've been through everything," Van Gaal has told Dutch news agency ANP.

 "I had 25 radiation treatments. Then I had to wait five or six months to see if it had done its job. It did."

Van Gaal's prognosis was revealed to the Dutch football organisation (KNVB) at the start of the year, prompting the search for a replacement. The former Manchester United manager will lead the Netherlands to the World Cup in Qatar this winter, but will step down after the competition.

Ronaldo Koeman has been selected to take Van Gaal's place in the dugout, with the 59-year-old set to coach his country for the second time in his first post since being fired by Barcelona, beginning in 2023.
