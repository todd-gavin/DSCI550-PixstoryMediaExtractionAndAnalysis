“That Sucks Day” is a day majorly celebrated in the USA on 15th April 2022 where people of the USA talk about the thing, people, or anything that sucks in their individual life.

Taking this topic ahead, “Slow Internet” sucks me the most. I think we can all agree on this topic that right now our life is hugely dependent on the internet and Wi-Fi and if that stopped working then most of our work will get delayed.

A few days back, my Wifi stopped working, and oh man, my life became hell for two days because my entertainment source Smart T.V., and my work source laptop stopped working for two days then I realized that humanity is relying on Wi-Fi and this is not good.

So, yeah this is my “That Sucks Day” story, and please note down your stories and tell me something that sucks for you.
