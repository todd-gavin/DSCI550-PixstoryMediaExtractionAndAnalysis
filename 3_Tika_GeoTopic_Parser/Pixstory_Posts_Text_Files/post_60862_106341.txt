The Japanese Art of broken pieces I have loved the concept of kintsugi when I first read about it Especially the meaning it represented in spiritual and mental well being For those who are not aware kintsugi is the art of fixing broken pottery pieces with a mixture of lacquer mixed with gold dust The idea is to create something new and beautiful using the broken pieces instead of just discarding them The metaphor that this art represents is to convey that anything broken can be fixed and flaws can be embraced The pretty golden cracks show that scars are not necessarily bad and conveys the gravity of experience I personally love how damaged pottery is transformed into something totally new instead of attempting to return it to its original state Afterall not all changes are necessarily bad
