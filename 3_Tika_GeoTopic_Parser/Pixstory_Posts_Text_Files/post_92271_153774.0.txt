Infosys asked🧐 HR executive not to hire 'Indian-origin candidates', 'women with children': Complainant to US court👨‍⚖️ :-
Jill Prejean, a former Vice President👔 of talent acquisition at Infosys told a US court that she was asked by the Bengaluru-headquartered IT company to avoid hiring people of Indian origin, women with children at home and candidates aged 50 or above.
👉This is the second time that the Indian IT company faces allegations of discrimination in hiring practices in the US.
👉The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on Friday rejected Infosys' motion to dismiss the suit filed by Prejean for retaliatory termination and a hostile work environment. Prejean filed the suit against Infosys, former senior VP and head of consulting Mark Livingston, and former partners Dan Albright and Jerry Kurtz.
👉Alleging unjust termination, the former Infosys V-P in her suit said that company partners Kurtz and Albright "turned hostile" towards her when she objected to comply with illegal demands for hiring senior executives for the company.
