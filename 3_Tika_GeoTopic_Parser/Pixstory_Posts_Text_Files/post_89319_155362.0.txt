WHY FOREIGNERS SHOULD INVEST IN INDIA
Every now and then we come across news articles hearing our honourable PM claiming that India will become a global superpower and whatnot. Recently he claimed that India will become a developed country within 25 years. Let's examine the reality behind these statements.
India is expected to be the third largest economy in the world by 2027-28 according to IMF and will experience a GDP growth of an estimated 7.1 percent in 2023-24 while many other countries are expected to experience an economic slowdown.
India's performance in various global indices has improved drastically inÂ  recent years. India jumped 41 positions in 7 years to reach Rank 40 in the global innovation index in 2022. This improvement has been experienced in several other indices as well.
Added to all this is the young population in India. India has the largest youth population in the world and it will continue to have it until 2030. It has the third largest group of scientists and technicians in the world.
All these facts prove that the government claims about growth are not baseless but actually true and backed by several studies and facts. All this proves that India is a great investment destination for foreigners.
