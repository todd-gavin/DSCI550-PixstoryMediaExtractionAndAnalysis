A school in Ohio sent a letter to their teachers informing them that they were under no obligation to inform parents of the fact that a child transitioned to a new gender and requested to use different pronouns Predictably this caused uproar in the local community and created an extremely heated atmosphere during the where it was discussed Part of the email sent to teachers said That teacher can just use those preferred pronouns name with the student and there is no need to share the info with any other staff member or family member unless the student would like additional support with this throughout the year It is a sad fact that far left individuals have infiltrated the highest levels of our educational system and to impose their political views at the expense of the children that they serve and at the expense of the fundamental right of a parent to raise their child
