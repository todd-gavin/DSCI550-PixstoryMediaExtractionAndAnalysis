Stunning advances have happened in medicine since President Richard Nixon declared the war on cancer just over a half century ago But that progress is only the beginning More is expected in the coming years and decades particularly following President Biden s recent announcement of a new cancer moonshot initiative coupled with a pledge to end cancer as we know it One way to help make that happen is through the study of cats and dogs As a professor of oncology and doctor of veterinary medicine who has been researching cancer in dogs for more than years I learned long ago that companion animals can teach us an enormous amount about how to prevent and treat cancer in people There are many reasons why this is true Domesticated cats and dogs share approximately of the same DNA as humans And because both have been intimately associated with people for more than years they have become susceptible to some of the same diseases Remarkable similarities in cats dogs and people Over decades researchers have accumulated what is now a treasure trove of cancer data on companion animals This data holds clues and perhaps answers to how and why pets can get cancer and how to keep it in check or get rid of it But because of the remarkable similarities in the biology and habitats of cats dogs and people it s possible researchers can also extract this data on pets and extrapolate it to humans Therein lies the opportunity to discover biomedical innovations that benefit not only your pet but you as well This approach cuts by decades the amount of time it takes for data to come in Consider that veterinarians observe and care for cats and dogs as they age and die over a life span of roughly to years In comparison gathering similar data from humans over a lifetime takes from to years Read full story at The Conversation Image Credits
