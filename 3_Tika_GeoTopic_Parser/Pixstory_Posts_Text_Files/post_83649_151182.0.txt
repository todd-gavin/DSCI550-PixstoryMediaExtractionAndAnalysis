Most philosophers believe that happiness is irrelevant or unnecessary...but does that mean that people who are depressed should not read philosophy?
Philosophy is not a form of therapy. It all depends on how you understand the philosopher. Philosophy teaches us about the fallacy of happiness and the purity of joy. It leads to joy rather than happiness. Happiness is defined as the persistence of a satisfied state. Joy encompasses sadness and depression. According to Spinoza, joy is the PASSAGE from a lower to a higher state... Philosophy can help you create a harmonious relationship with the harshness of your life. Reading philosophy will help you understand the importance of sadness in order to achieve not happiness but joy! Joy cannot exist without sadness, and happiness is incompatible with existence....
As a result, my friends' philosophy provides you with insight and shares the experiences of people who have lived life.
