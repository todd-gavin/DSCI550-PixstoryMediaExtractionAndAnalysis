Harry Styles released a new single, “As It Was”, on April 1, the first track from his forthcoming third album, Harry’s House.  As It Was” has officially hit the internet with a predictably ecstatic splash though lyrics are as cryptic as ever; leave it to fans to work out the song’s meaning. Fans believe the song is about his relationship with fame and how his life isn’t “the same as it was” since he’s entered the public eye. The song also references Harry’s loneliness and concern for others as he isolates himself. Some fans guessed that the child speaking at the beginning of “As It Was” could be one of Wilde's children, but Harry revealed that the voice in the intro is his goddaughter, Ruby Winston, the daughter of filmmaker Ben Winston. quoted: “it’s my goddaughter at the start of the song,” he said in an interview on “Hearty Breakfast” in 2022. “That streak of calling me every night before bed, and I missed it once, and she wanted to let me know that she was quite angry with me about it. And then I dug it up in the studio one day and added it to the song's start, and it just stuck. I loved it.”
