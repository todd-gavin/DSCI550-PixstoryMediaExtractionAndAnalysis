Juventus will face Paris Saint Germain, Benfica and Maccabi Haifa in their Champions League group A group that includes a squadron and two clubs that have gone through the qualifiers Vice-President Pavel Nedved comments on the draw They are all tough but the Champions League There touches a rather complicated group PSG needs no introduction We are happy to face teams of this level in this period We are also happy to go to Israel since we missed the summer friendly Benfica let us remember that we don&#39;t have great European precedents so we have to stay very careful With regard to market movements after the signing of Milik, Juventus could close the signing of Paredes with PSG In this regard, Nedved said I can&#39;t say anything about Paredes because he is not one of our players Potential players who could complete our squad there are some they are still the market not closed and we will work on it
