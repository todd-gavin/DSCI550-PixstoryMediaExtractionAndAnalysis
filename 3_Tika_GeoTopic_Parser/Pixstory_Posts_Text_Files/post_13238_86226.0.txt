Your lost Joseph will return to Canaan, do not grieve
This house of sorrows will become a garden, do not grieve 

Oh grieving heart, you will mend, do not despair
This frenzied mind will return to calm, do not grieve 

When the spring of life sets again in the meadows
A crown of flowers you will bear, singing bird, do not grieve 

If these turning epochs do not move with our will today
The spheres of time are not constant, do not grieve 

Don’t lose hope, for awareness cannot perceive the unseen
Behind the curtains hidden scenes play, do not grieve 

Oh heart, should a flood of destruction engulf the world
If Noah is at your helm, do not grieve 

As you step through the desert longing for the Ka’aba
The thorns may reproach you, do not grieve 

Home may be perilous and the destination out of reach
But there are no paths without an end, do not grieve 
Our state in separation from friends and with demands of foes
The God who spins fate knows all, do not grieve 

Hafez, in the corner of poverty and loneliness of dark nights
As long as your words are prayers and lessons of Quran, do not grieve.

Pray for this childrens 🙏🙏
