Almost a few back, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had said that Mali’s military junta, which usurped power last May, was “out of control” and “illegitimate.” That was enough for the military junta to warn its former colonial masters and ask the French ambassador to leave the country.

As the deadline was to end on Thursday, the French ambassador, Joel Meyer. had no other option but to leave the country. 

Drian had also alleged that mercenaries from the Russian private security group Wagner were already deployed on the ground in Mali. He had said that Russian government was fully supporting these developments. Russia may have pushed the Mali government to take action after this.

France had been helping the Mali military to fight the Jihadists, but after the country’s military took over the reins of power, there have been differences between France and Mali. It reached a breaking point after the foreign minister of France criticised Mali. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-60202343)

Last year, tensions rose sharply at the UN when Mali’s prime minister, Choguel Maïga, accused France of “abandoning Mali in mid-air” in the fight against terrorism. Mali’s military has quickly reacted to France abandoning the fight against terrorists. Mali quickly approached Russia and Vladimir Putin sent soldiers to train the Mali soldiers to fight the terrorists. In fact, in the northern city of Timbuktu, the Russian troops are in the base that was vacated by the French troops.

According to some reports, Russian mercenaries are also operating in Mali. 

In the meantime, thousands of anti-French demonstrators have poured into the street of the Malian capital, Bamako, against France after the ambassador's expulsion. What is sure to rile the West is that protesters were carrying Russian flags. (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/5/thousands-in-mali-celebrate-expulsion-of-french-ambassador)
