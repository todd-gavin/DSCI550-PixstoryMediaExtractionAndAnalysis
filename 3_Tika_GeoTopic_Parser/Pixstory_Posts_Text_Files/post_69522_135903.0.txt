In 1969, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Botanical Garden was established. Nevertheless, it was finished in 1987. The garden, which is situated at the foothills of the Zabarwan Mountains, spans an expansive 80 acres. The garden is organised into four sections: the botanical garden, the research section garden, and the centre for plant introduction. There are various gardens inside the botanical garden. The garden contains a few waterfalls. It also has a lovely lake that occupies 17 acres of space. Using the paddleboats that are available, you can take in the beautiful splendour of the garden. There are more than 1.5 lakh attractive plants in the garden. Here, kids can ride on little rides including swings, merry-go-rounds, and seesaw games.
