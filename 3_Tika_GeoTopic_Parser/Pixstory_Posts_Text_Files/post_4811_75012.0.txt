When the UK was placed into its first COVID lockdown in March 2020, many of us may have been tempted to reach for a drink. The country was about to enter an extraordinary period, with no idea of what would happen next, how bad things might get or when it might end. It was unheard of. It was worrying. It was huge.

And as part of that first lockdown, pubs, restaurants and bars closed completely, remaining closed until July. As a team of researchers, we were keen to find out what happened to UK drinking habits during that period. What impact did pub closures have on drinking and therefore our health? Did people drink more or less at home as a result? And were these trends the same across society?

We used information from Kantar’s WorldPanel shopping survey to map out drinking habits over time, analysing around 5 million purchases of alcohol from almost 80,000 households between 2015 and 2020.

Our first look at the data showed us that alcohol buying in England, Scotland and Wales didn’t increase significantly overall between March and July 2020, once missing sales from pubs and restaurants were taken into account. However, public health surveys reported that many of us felt we had drunk more during lockdown, and official government statistics showed a sharp rise in deaths directly linked to alcohol misuse in 2020 – an 18.6% increase compared to 2019 and the highest year-on-year rise in 20 years.
