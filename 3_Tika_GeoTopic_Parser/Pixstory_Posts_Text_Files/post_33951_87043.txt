At the end of the match against Udinese, Roma&#39;s coach Jose Mourinho spoke to the microphones of DAZN. I thought two or three more minutes to play. The match was no different from what I expected. I understood that I had not made a mistake in my analysis and I think we entered the game with energy changes I saw some players having difficulty entering the game Foti also noticed the difficulty that exists against a team that prepared the game in just one week Difficult game if we scored earlier we would have had more time unfortunately it was at the end They played unbeaten in Serie A with draws A point in Udine a point in Sassuolo but when we score at the last minute not a defeat A bit of everything Just look at the body language of some player for a minute or two and you immediately understand that it is not there was neither intensity nor mental strength This match if there had been thirty minutes of real play would have been played until midnight They are strong in this lack even the pace of the ball Easy slow passing We had more ball possession without aggression and without intensity It was a match to its fullest potential against a team in a bit of difficulty We can&#39;t choose the matches Thursday is important Sunday is important and the one after that too We know it&#39;s not easy to play away from home on Sunday after playing on Thursday We lost in Verona and in Venice and drew today but we have to have a different spirit I&#39;m tired too but I feel tired after the game
