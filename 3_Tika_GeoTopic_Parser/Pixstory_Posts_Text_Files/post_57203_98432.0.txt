What would it mean to change a 50 years legislation? Repercussions can bring the unprecedented.

Abortion is a matter of choice, and it should not be confined or restricted using any legislation.
On 22 January 1973, in a 7-2 majority, the court decided that the constitutional right to privacy be applied to abortion.
Overturning the legislation would mean they deny the right to privacy.
Pregnancy is just transcendental. It transforms women into warriors. Giving a new life brings many challenges with it, and it is on a woman to decide and comprehend whether she is willing to endure and accept all of them. Unwanted pregnancy has its consequences. It can also lead to a phase where both woman and the child get affected.

Denying women their right to choose what they want to do with their bodies is another insinuation that gender disparity still exists. It is just a way of saying equal rights don't exist for women. For example, suppose there is an unwillingness to allow women to make decisions about their bodies. In that case, it can anytime also mean that they can be restricted from making other decisions in their lives, whether social, political or economic.

Abortion is a personal choice, and I feel any woman has the right to choose their reproductive health.
However, overturning such legislation that legalised abortion when women's rights and their position in society were meant to be protected and shielded is ironic.
