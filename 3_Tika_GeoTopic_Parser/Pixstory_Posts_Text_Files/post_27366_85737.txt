Dark Season Exploring World Cinema is not exactly an easy job there are many hiccups along the way as we never really realize how a particular movie or tv series accommodates our style of viewing and there are very little series that turn out to be really universal in a sense that who so ever watches them is made to appreciate the amount of brilliance of it I first started watching Dark out of peer pressure as I only heard the greatest things about it with people comparing it to the likes of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones calling it criminally under rated and hailing it as one of the greatest Tv shows ever made Un like the real Dark fans I did not have to wait for years for the further two seasons to come as I binged it on Netflix and I am so glad I did because the cliffhangers of this show would have made me slam my head Dark is without a doubt one of greatest Tv shows I have ever watched it has an extremely engrossing first season which keeps you hooked to the screen waiting to see what happens next Dark is one of those Sci fi series who does their best to justify their super natural elements and for a person whose favorite movie is Interstellar I would say they did more than a commendable job The twists and turns are way more to handle and comprehend by the human brain it is like watching Arrival except every episode has an arrival like twist The first season of Dark is a major winner in the list of greatest tv shows ever made and the show only goes up Anything further I say might result in a spoiler so I would just say that if you have been on fence about this show just jump take a leap of faith Dark will not disappoint you and remember that What we know is a drop what we do not know is an ocean
