The BJP launched a smear campaign against former vice president Hamid Ansari on Wednesday after media reports quoted "Pakistani journalist" Nusrat Mirza as claiming Ansari had invited him to India and that he had given the ISI of Pakistan the information he gathered while on these trips.

It's not the first time the BJP has targeted Hamid Ansari or brought up his purported ties to Pakistan; the relationship between the Modi administration and the former vice president was tense even when the latter was in office.

Hamid Ansari responded to the allegations made by the BJP by calling them a "litany of untruth" and said, "I am obligated by the commitment to national security in such matters and refrain from commenting on them. The information is all in the hands of the Indian government, which is also the only source of truth.
