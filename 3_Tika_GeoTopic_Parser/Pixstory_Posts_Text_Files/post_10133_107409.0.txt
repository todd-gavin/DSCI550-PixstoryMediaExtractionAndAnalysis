These might be just doors for you, but I see these doors as our lives.....lives of every Afghan women after the Taliban took over Afghanistan. We have been restricted to four walls only to satisfy Talibans forced idea of Islam and women in Islam. 

Just like these doors, our lives are also chained and dark inside. 

We all deserve and desire to be free and to realize our unfulfilled dreams. 

Adghanistan is not an issue, Taliban is! We would love to be in our homeland and live with our loved ones, and enjoy every second of life. But we are far from our country and live as refugees. We are too far from our country, dreams and freedom and live like birds in a cage.
