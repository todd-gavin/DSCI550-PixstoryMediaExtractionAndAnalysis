In the new 55 seconds  Koffee with Karan teaser, Karan Johar the biggest filmmaker in Bollywood begins the teaser by saying that he knows everyone is waiting for the new season of Koffee With Karan. 
This is followed by some examples of the kind of mean remarks he and the show receive online. Following this, Karan says ‘maybe not everyone’, but he is sure his friends from Bollywood are excited to be on his show.
This follows a hilarious section where Karan is seen on the phone, pleading and begging several celebs to appear on the show. He even offers bribe in the form of the show’s famous Koffee hampers and a role in his films, but apparently, nobody is in the mood to relent. Reacting to the video, one fan commented on the video Karan shared, “Hilarious, love the humour.” Another said, “This is the most honest ever promo.”

Let's seen how will this season be taken by the audience.... And I m very much Excited about Samantha also being on the show 💪😀😆
