As per Hollywood Reporter, Marvel and Disney’s Thor: Love and Thunder added further fuel to the summer box office rally with a domestic opening of $143 million, the best showing of the standalone franchise starring Chris Hemsworth as the hammer-wielding superhero.

The pic opened in line with expectations in North America, where it scored the third-best opening of the pandemic era behind Spider-Man: No Way Home ($260 million) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($187.4 million).

Thor: Love and Thunder also did well overseas, earning $159 million from the international box office for a global start of $302 million.

The Disney and Marvel movie is a direct sequel to Thor: Ragnarok — both were directed by the maverick filmmaker Taika Waititi — and is the fourth entry in the Thor standalone franchise. It’s also the 29th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe empire of titles.

The Thor films have never been known for mega-openings. Ragnorok fared the best at $122.7 million in 2017. The first Thor debuted to $65.7 million in 2011, followed by $85.7 million for Thor: The Dark World in 2013.
