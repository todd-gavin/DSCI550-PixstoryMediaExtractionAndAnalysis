January rd Utpal Parrikar Late Manohar Parrikar s son I am not happy that I had to take this decision but sometimes you have to take tough decisions But I am ready to withdraw the decision if the party fields a good candidate from Panaji January th Sadanand Shet Tanavade BJP Goa President If we have learnt anything in the party about ethics and compromises it is from Manohar Parrikar If you recollect when Manohar Parrikar became the CM in Monserrate was part of his cabinet Later in when again the government under Parrikar was formed Monserrate was made the PDA chairman It took one blunt rebuttal BJP s defence of Late Parrikar s legacy of questionable ethics or compromises the party did what was taught to them by Parrikar that gave a reality check to young Utpal that the man Babush Monserrate that he seeks to replace was brought into the Party s umbrella by his father But there is more to capital Panaji s seat that was led by Jack Sequeira the Father of Goa s much cherished Opinion Poll and even Parrikar for over years The electorate voted for Atanasio Babush Monserrate in the by polls of after Parrikar s death Ironically there was no sympathy for its longest serving MLA as there was a massive swing of votes in Congress Babush s favour Interestingly BJP with or without Parrikar has been unable to cross more than of vote swing in its favour and despite winning has been losing base in Panaji registering negative swings before The heart of the matter is Congress voters that have stood rock solid with the party despite Senior Parrikar being the MLA The only man in BJP who could harness those votes was Babush BJP s current chosen one But then he was a Congress candidate Babush went to BJP as a migrant MLA not an elected one A gamble that the BJP wants to take The only hitch Young Utpal who is rallying disgruntled former Parrikar loyalists sidelined BJP workers to usurp Babush s position in Panaji For BJP it s like the nursery rhyme Ring a Ring Roses All fall down
