Audio misrepresented
We noticed that one of the viral videos has a logo of ‘Headlines India’.

Alt News rummaged the Facebook page of ‘Headlines India’ and found that the viral video is a clipped version of a longer video that was uploaded on January 2. The viral video is clipped from the 58-second mark.

If one listens carefully, Yadav says, “हम आपसे निवेदन करना चाहते हैं, अगर उत्तर प्रदेश को ख़ुशहाली के रास्ते पर ले जाना है तो योग्य सरकार बनेगी.” (We would like to request you that if you want to take Uttar Pradesh to the road of prosperity then a worthy government should be elected.)

Readers should note that in the viral video the word ‘yogya’ [योग्य, English translation: worthy] has been mispresented as ‘Yogi’.

The phrase ‘yogya sarkar’ is a wordplay by Yadav and he has used it on multiple occasions.

To sum it up, a clipped video of SP president Akhilesh Yadav’s speech was shared with the misleading claim that he admitted Uttar Pradesh will see prosperity if the Yogi government is elected.
