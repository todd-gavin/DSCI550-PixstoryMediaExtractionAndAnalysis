By Deepna Chauhan If the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC latest report on climate mitigation is to be taken into consideration India s coal fired power plants do not have a long life The IPCC in its report said that pathways likely limiting global warming to C or C involve substantial reductions in fossil fuel consumption and a near elimination of coal use without CCS Carbon Capture and Sequestration The CCS is a high cost technology to prevent carbon emissions from plants going into the atmosphere It was said to be a technology that could allow the running of coal fired power plants without harming the environment Despite being there for more than years there are only operational CCS plants in the power sector and most of them are in the oil and gas sector According to IPCC the CCS technology for capturing carbon dioxide from power plants remain stagnant and costly and there is also a mismatch between available geological formation for storage and water availability further constrains the availability of CCS as a solution for existing fossil fuel assets In absence of CCS which is a viable option to reduce emissions from coal fired plants the IPCC said countries will require substantial energy system changes over the next years in order to limit warming to C or C And it would mean wiping out the coal consumption and replacing it with very less emitting substitutes of renewables the IPCC said Net zero energy systems will share common characteristics but the approach in every country will depend on national circumstances the IPCC report said Common characteristics of net zero energy systems will include electricity systems that produce no net CO or remove CO from the atmosphere widespread electrification of end uses including light duty transport space heating and cooking substantially lower use of fossil fuels than today use of alternative energy carriers such as hydrogen bioenergy and ammonia to substitute for fossil fuels in sectors less amenable to electrification more efficient use of energy than today Read the full story here
