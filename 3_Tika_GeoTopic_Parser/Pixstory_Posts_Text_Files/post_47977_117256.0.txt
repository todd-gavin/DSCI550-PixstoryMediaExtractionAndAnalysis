New Delhi: The break in the opposition ranks over electing the next President and Vice President may not be restricted to just these polls. The warming up of some non-BJP parties towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi's choice of Droupadi Murmu to succeed Ram Nath Kovind for the post of President and Jagdeep Dhankar to succeed Venkaiah Naidu as the next Vice President, perhaps, could pave the way for expansion of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

Of course, the non-NDA parties like the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSR Congress Party, Telugu Desam, Akali Dal, Mayawati-led BSP and allies of the Samajwadi Party like Om Prakash Rajbhar would not admit that their decision to back Murmu or Dhankar is a step towards eventually embracing the NDA.

But, one does see signs of thaw provided by these elections. The stage appears to be set for aligning with Modi on an issue-by-issue basis though a formal handshake may be put off for a later date.

These parties are seeing the BJP as the dominant pole in the national politics in the run-up to the 2024 parliamentary elections. The BJP too sees them as electorally strong parties in their respective states.

The Congress and other Opposition parties, which are upset by the behaviour of these regional groups, believe that Modi has managed to bring them over to their side by twisting their arms with the help of Central agencies. But these regional groups say they do not see any political advantage in opposing the BJP blindly when Modi's decisions are politically correct as far as they are concerned.

In this context, the going-ons in the Shiv Sena is a separate episode altogether. First, ahead of the July 18 Presidential polls, the Eknath Shinde-led revolt caused a change of government with the help of the BJP.
