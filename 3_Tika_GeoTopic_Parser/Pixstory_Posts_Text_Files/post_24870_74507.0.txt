Time to bring back ‘gladiator sportsmen’


Until 1970s, Indian armed forces allowed units to spare military training for some men to help them focus only on sports. Then came the outcry to ban sports competitions.
 
The Duke of Wellington, while watching a cricket match at Eton College 10 years after the Battle of Waterloo, metaphorically said, “The Battle of Waterloo was won here.” Most sports and games require similar leadership skills and character qualities that are seen in military battles, and empirically too, they have been an intrinsic part of soldiering. General Patton represented the US in the Modern Pentathlon at the 1912 Olympics.
 
Most modern sports and games were introduced in India by the British Indian Army and continue to remain an essential part of the armed force’s culture and leadership development. As a result, the armed forces also dominated most competitive sports in the country until the 1970s, when their prowess started seeing a steady decline.
 
 
Sadly, as a nation too, our performance in the international sports arenas – one of the facets of national power – is well below par. In the 2021 Olympics, China won 38 Gold, 32 Silver and 18 Bronze medals compared to our 1 Gold, 2 Silver and 4 Bronze medals. Pakistan won no medal, but that is no solace.
