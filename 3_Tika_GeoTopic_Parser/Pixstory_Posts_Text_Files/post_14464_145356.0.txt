👉You Have Energy Throughout the Day.
One of the most obvious signs that you’re doing metabolically well is that you have stable energy levels all day and are able to focus on your day-to-day tasks with ease. 
Conversely, if you’re feeling sluggish and run down, it’s a good indication that your metabolism isn’t running optimally.
👉You Have an Optimal Waist-Hip Ratio.
A much better test for metabolic health than BMI is the waist-hip ratio (WHR) equation. This metric is based on the science that those with more weight around their midsection come with higher health risks.
👉You Don’t Get Sick that Often.
For example, if you follow the   same lifestyle habits like regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a healthy diet all help boost your immune system. So if you find that you don’t get sick often, it’s a good sign that your metabolism is working well.
👉You Rarely Have the Urge to Snack.
One aspect of metabolic health is its ability to shift from burning carbs to burning fat. 
For instance, I used to have a hard time making it from lunch to dinner without snacking. But since improving my metabolic flexibility, I can easily make it from one meal to the next without binging on chips
👉You sleep soundly
Sleep and metabolism are also closely interlinked. A lack of sleep can throw your hormones out of whack, which can lead to weight gain.
👉Your Baseline Mood is Relatively Happy
It’s probably not a surprise that mood can be an indicator of your overall health. Your mood will typically be more balanced and positive when your metabolism is running smoothly.
