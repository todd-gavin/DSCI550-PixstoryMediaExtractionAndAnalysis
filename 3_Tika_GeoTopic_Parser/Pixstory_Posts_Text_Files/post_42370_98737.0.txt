Just watched Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness and one thing that I want to say about this movie is, that this movie is more about Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen) as compared to Doctor Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch.

The movie started with a scene where we see that Doctor Strange wakes up in the morning just after he saw a dream but later he realised that it wasn’t a dream as it is all happening in the multiverse.

Because of some incidents in the multiverse, the Character of America Chavez (played by Xochitl Gomez) entered this universe and after a few scenes, Doctor Strange, Wong, and America Chavez realized that all these things are happening because of one person which is Scarlet Witch.

When Doctor Strange meets Scarlet Witch then she tells Doctor Strange that even if she has to manipulate every reality, she will bring back her kids (who don’t exist) and this one wish of her becomes the conflict of the movie.

To stop Scarlet Witch, Doctor Strange traveled to many multiverses where he got to know about his variants.

Will Doctor Strange be able to stop Scarlet Witch or Scarlet Witch will be successful to live with her kids and killing Doctor Strange?
To get the answers to the above questions you have to watch the movie!!

Things I liked about the movie are its visual effects and how impactful 3D effects are.
Elizabeth Olsen stole the show for me, her character was overpowered as compared to other characters of the movie and that’s why this positive is also the negative of the movie because you will feel like you pay the money to see Scarlet Witch and not Doctor Strange.

The Story of the movie didn’t take Marvel Cinematic Universe ahead and because of that only you will feel that Marvel made this money for making money and nothing else.

But if you are a true Marvel fan then this movie will not disappoint you at all.
