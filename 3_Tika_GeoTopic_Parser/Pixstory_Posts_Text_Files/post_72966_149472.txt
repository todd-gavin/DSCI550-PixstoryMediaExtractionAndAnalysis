Raj Kapoor was one of the boldest actors and filmmakers of his time Working within the limited resources and scope that a nascent film industry could offer and an incipient society would allow he pushed the boundaries of mainstream Hindi films that few of his time dared By the time he directed Ram Teri Ganga Maili in he was already one of the most celebrated honoured and revered film personalities of his time Ram Teri Ganga Maili was everything that Kapoor s films stood for an epic narrative a blend of mythology and subtle socio political commentary and of course unabashedly sensual which quite expectedly didn t sit too well with strait laced officials at censor boards Not that Raj Kapoor cared too much about it He had his way of eluding the censor board s intrusion Raj Kapoor was ahead of his time Layered narratives gave way to more striking commentary on social hierarchy in his earlier films such as Awaara and Prem Rog nbsp Ram Teri Ganga Maili too was no different The allusion to the river Ganges or rather the goddess Ganga in the title is not gimmicky neither was it intended to beguile the audience Rather the film is rich with symbolism and metaphors alluding to Indian mythology and referring to environmental movements The story essentially parallels nbsp Shakuntala s doomed relationship with Dusyanta in Mahabharata The film itself opens with a protest rally against water pollution in the Ganges in Calcutta where our protagonist will eventually arrive was also the year that witnessed Narmada Bachao Andolon which started as a protest against Sardar Sarovar Dam project Randhir Kapoor s film Ek Radha Ek Meera is based on a song that hasn t been used in any film Raj Kapoor bought the rights intending to use it in his next film He then composed nine songs within four days and decided the title of the film In an era of superficial charm and vainglorious aura blessed is the filmmaker whose ideas don t get lost between words Randhir There will never be another one like him
