I am Durga Boro, and I will be introducing myself on this platform. 

I began my professional football debut a long time back and have played in the Indian Super League. I remember the exhilarating feeling I experienced while playing for Oil India against Mohun Bagan in 2009. I scored a goal, and that’s how my professional journey began. 

It is always thrilling to be on the ground, watching the audience cheer for you and receive love and respect from the people of your country. Playing for the Indian Super League gave me purpose and motivated me to turn my passion into my profession. I went on to play for many other teams after my debut during the Federation Cup in Kolkata in 2009. At that time, I was also working for Oil India, and although it was challenging to balance my work life while pursuing what I love, the journey was rewarding.

In the following few years, I signed my first professional contract with the Churchill Brothers, and this was a huge opportunity because I could focus all my attention and efforts on the game. My journey as a footballer only became more fulfilling as I moved on to different clubs like Mumbai Tigers, Shillong Lajong and NorthEast United. I learned so much from each season I played with the different teams, and it also gave me the opportunity to interact with various national and international footballers.

Right now, I am focusing my efforts on giving back to the community that has shown me endless love and support throughout my journey as a footballer. 

I will continue to share my story on this platform and the community developmental initiatives I am currently undertaking in NorthEast India. Follow and stay tuned for the upcoming stories.
