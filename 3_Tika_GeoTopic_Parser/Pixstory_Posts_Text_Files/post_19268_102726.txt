Jose Mourinho in itself can be put into a book let alone an article for whatever he has done throughout his career yesterday being an example and addition to his stellar blockbuster contribution to managerial role in football Just like Cristiano and Messi we fans are blessed to watch this entity is how much I hold him high in regard He won his fifth European final with AS Roma yesterday as a coach out of five yes he has never lost one Again has won a trophy everywhere he has gone except Spurs where he could have had the hierarchy did not decide to go all bonkers and sack him six days before the league cup final And lost only one of the finals he has coached a simply brilliant record The media never give it a rest when it comes to the Portuguese and have determined him as a finished personal many a times only for them to fall on their face for he never fails to show how he still has it in him but they never learn Surely he will get the stick after few days and forget the silverware Jose has just won and would even go on to determine how the conference league isn t a top competition but only him Roma fans know the importance and beauty of winning a European cup especially when it s your club s first one and a trophy coming Rome after long years Jose Mourinho will always be in contention when the people at the table discuss about top coaches to ever manage this beautiful game for he has made a place for himself through whatever it maybe His antics his personnel or his style Jose is the special one and will always be so a winner in every way
