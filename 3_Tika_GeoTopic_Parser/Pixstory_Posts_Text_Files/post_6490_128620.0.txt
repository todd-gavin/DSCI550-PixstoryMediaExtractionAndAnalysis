According to the researchers, the current research proves that COVID-19 severity was connected to the distorting of B cell traits and shows for the first time that this distorting was altered by simultaneous HIV infection.

Collectively, utilizing longitudinal samples from the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in South Africa, the study demonstrated that HIV co-infection had a massive effect on the B cell reaction to SARS-CoV-2. 

In addition, the investigators noted that the B cell reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH was markedly distinct in the present group of individuals with primarily mild to moderate COVID-19 with lower GC function and a contrasted rise in EF activity. These findings indicate that the B cell reaction in PLWH was oriented toward the EF pathway rather than GC maturation.

Additionally, it was pointed out that it was necessary to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on COVID-19 immunity, especially in light of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
 
Besides, understanding the influence of COVID-19 vaccination on the B cell memory compartment will also be critical.
