Its too early to determine if the Kings will make any more moves this off season but it is starting to look more and more like the current roster is who the Kings will start the season with The most likely trade piece is Harrison Barnes but Keegan Murray seems to be the perfect forward to play alongside Barnes and it doesn t seem like the Kings will be able to add another small forward that will be an upgrade in talent or upside than Barnes Since the team s top priority is to improve their chances to make the playoffs a Barnes trade seems less and less likely So who will start and get major rotational minutes Experts tend to agree that Fox Huerter Barnes Murray and Sabonas will start There have been some discussions about Holmes starting to bring along Murray slowly but Holmes fit alongside Sabonis doesn t make sense since they both can t stretch the floor So who will get major minutes off the bench Of course Monk will get good minutes off the bench as a volume scorer but the bet here is that the defensive stand outs will also get good minutes under Mike Brown to help the team become better defensively Mitchell is the team s best back court defender and Holmes is the teams best big defender and they will get around minutes a game Brown also added two players he coached on the Nigerian team Moneke and Okpala who are long and should cause problems guarding I recommend watching highlights of these two guarding the US team when they beat them several years ago and you ll see why the Brown wanted them My bet is they will see minutes a game Good teams need players willing to do the dirty work without acclaim in order to win Most of this second unit fits that mold and should see decent rotational minutes to ensure there are solid defensive pieces on the floor at all times
