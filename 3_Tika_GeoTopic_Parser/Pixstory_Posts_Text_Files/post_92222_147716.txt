In I had a kid at that time he was I was in the Bhutan camp there was no future training or education I thought if my child doesn t get education his future will be ruined This was again troublesome We couldn t stay in Assam and were constantly on the move as police used to track us People at home used to tell me that don t come back here as my life would ve been in danger and I might get killed So they used to tell me to stay away only At that time I wanted to surrender but ULFA had got some information that if I went to jail I would ve gotten the death sentence The financial conditions were not good at all and I was in a small city in Bhutan So somehow I managed to contact my friends back home who had surrendered and through them I managed to talk to the chief minister of thattime In August I managed to surrender when the terms were agreed When I joined militant ranks I had just passed class th I was around when I came back When we joined we had no doubts about the mission but after coming out into the real world we got to know about how there are complications as we talked to many politicians and historians We used to think how much further can we get through on this path that we were on and what will we get ultimately This thinking came to us much down the road and not at the beginning when we had joined We used to train people at the camp I was mostly in the office management I used to handle how many men and women are in the group and I also used to handle the network we had I used to maintain these records and where the weapons are where the different people are supposed to go and when they have to come back This is what I used to doTo be continued
