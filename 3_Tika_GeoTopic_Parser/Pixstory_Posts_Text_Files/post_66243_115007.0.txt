It took a while but I guess the general public finally realised that superhero movies aren't that great and are generally repetative. 

Love and thunder was an amazing example of how marvel is nothing more than a nostalgia merchant or a team up merchant, as their movies post endgame haven't had nothing but that. 

Love and Thunder just seemed so off-putting that I didn't know if this movie was worse than the first two installments of the movie.
