Yesterday google had its offline event for developers & announced some upcoming products by Google.

Products to be launched 
- Pixel Buds
- Pixel 7 & 7 pro
- Pixel 6a
- Pixel Tab

And Android 13 as upgraded OS.

Google reveals these products before launch because they want to build hype for the product & software, on the other hand, companies like Apple, Samsung & Sony try to keep their products secret before the launch of that product to grow curiosity in the mind of customers.

These two are Marketing tactics followed by brands, but as a consumer pleasetake decision rationally.

Thanks
Stay Khush!
