Nora Fatehi to rock the FIFA World Cup 2022 opening ceremony
Nora, who is famous for her breathtaking dance moves, is all set to rock her moves on the global stage. The Canadian-born Bollywood actress enjoys a massive fan following in India courtesy of her bold dance moves.

Nora Fatehi recently shared glimpses of the song on her Instagram alongside the caption, “This time for @fifaworldcup, the official world cup anthem with a touch of diversity Light the Sky…”
In the latest FIFA soundtrack single ‘Light The Sky,’ Nora has joined hands with the likes of Moroccan songwriter Manal, Emirati singer Balqees and Iraqi singer Rahma Riad. As per reports, the song has been produced by the globally recognized record label RedOne. The label has previously worked on FIFA anthems, including Shakira’s Waka Waka and La La La.
Nora Fatehi’s song was released on 7th October but it hasn’t received the expected reaction from the fans. The fans have given an underwhelming response to the song. Meanwhile, the song sends the message of coming together while celebrating FIFA’s historical decision of involving female referees in the World Cup matches with a message of gender inclusivity.
