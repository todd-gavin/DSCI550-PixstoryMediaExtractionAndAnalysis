1. Speak Loudly in Public:
This sounds like something you already know, but we just want to remind you again! This applies especially if you are using public transport as it is considered rude when you speak too loudly.

2. Sit Randomly When Using Public Transportation:
If you sit at certain spots at public transportations, you might get some harsh looks or even worst, yelled at. Whether it is on the bus or subway, there are seats marked for the elderly, disable and pregnant women. Just plopping on one of these seats can be seen as offensive and rude.

3. Leave Your Chopsticks Stuck in Rice:
We know that this sounds odd because you’ve probably heard about this. Chopsticks that are placed upright resembles the incense burnt at funerals and it is also said to bring bad luck. Bringing up death at the dinner table is definitely not a good idea.

4. Use One Hand to Receive or Give Things:
Whether you are giving out a gift or receiving a business card or even shaking hands, you should not use one but two hands. This gesture is done as a sign to show respect.

5. Don’t Drink While Front-Facing The Elders:
Besides waiting for an elderly person to start drinking, you are also not allowed to drink directly in front of them. You should turn your face away while drinking. This is again done as a form of respect.

6. Don’t Start Eating Before the Elders:
Just like drinking, eating before the elderly is also considered rude. It is a sign of respect to wait for the elders to eat before you do. Even if your stomach is rumbling, you have to resist the temptation! You are also not allowed to leave the table before your elders finish eating.
