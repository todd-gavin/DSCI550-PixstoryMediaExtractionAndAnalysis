Chelsea have signed French centre-back Wesley Fofana from Leicester City on a seven-year deal for a fee of £70m. 
France Under - 21 international Fofana has played 37 English Premier League matches since signing Leicester from French side Saint-Etienne in 2020.
He was restricted to just 7 league games during the 2021-22 season after breaking his leg in pre-season.
He is the third most expensive Premier League defender behind Manchester United's £80m purchase of Harry Maguire which is also from Leicester and Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk, who joined the Reds for £75m.
Fofana's initial fee makes him the 12th most expensive Premier League signing, but he will drop to 13th when Manchester United complete the £81.3m signing of Antony.
The Fofana deal takes Premier League clubs' record summer transfer window expenditure to almost £1.7bn going into Thursday's deadline day - and that is set to rise even further. The previous record for summer spending had been the £1.43bn spent in 2017.
This summer Chelsea have brought in England forward Raheem Sterling from Manchester City for £50m, Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli for £34m, English midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa for £20m, Spain left-back Marc Cucurella from Brighton for £60m and Italian midfielder Cesare Casadei from Inter Milan.
Thomas Tuchel's side are eighth in the Premier League after Tuesday's 2-1 defeat. 
Are all these signings worth it ? Can chelsea win the English premiere league ? 
Tell me in the notes..
Thankyou ⚽
