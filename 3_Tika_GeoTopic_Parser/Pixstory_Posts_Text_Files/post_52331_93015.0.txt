Paul Kelly, an Australian music legend, makes his Vivid LIVE debut, performing four career-spanning nights on the Northern Broadwalk, drawing from his catalogue with time as the muse.

Paul Kelly is a national treasure, more than one of the country's greatest singer-songwriters: his music has provided the soundtrack to multiple generations, from his early years on the Melbourne band scene and his breakthrough '80s hits to his evergreen '90s classics and generous collaborations with the new guard of Australian music. He made his Sydney Opera House debut in 2006 before returning in 2013 for a record-breaking five sellout shows with Neil Finn, and in 2017 he captivated our nation with an unforgettable two-hour set on the Forecourt.
Kelly is set to perform at Vivid LIVE for the first time this year. Time and Tide: Four Decades of Song is a once-in-a-lifetime celebration of Kelly's music career, featuring a catalogue of 'timely' songs that defined a culture: 'To Her Door,' 'Before Too Long,' 'When I First Met Your Ma,' 'How to Make Gravy,' and many, many more. Along with Vika & Linda Bull and his dependable band – Bill McDonald, Peter Luscombe, Ash Naylor, Cameron Bruce, and Dan Kelly – Paul Kelly will be joined by special guest Thelma Plum, the Indigenous singer-songwriter behind the Top 10 smash Better In Blak.
