England international and Arsenal’s winger, Bukayo Saka has heaped praise over manager Mikel Arteta for positively impacting on his game ahead of Super Sunday clash with Manchester United.

The 20-year-old forward stated that Arteta facilitated the development of his game style as a player, describing the Arsenal’s coach as someone who is an “honor” to work with.

Speaking with Sky Sport reporter ahead of Arsenal’s blockbuster contest with Manchester United, Saka admitted that the 40-year-old manager has a strong influence on his progress. 

“He’s a big influence, yeah. Every day is an honor to work with him. So smart and he is always doing everything he can to make us better players.”

In a further conversation, the Euro 2020 finalist expressed view about Arsenal’s title aspiration. He’s only focused on the next game as he believes that will add to their confidence and boost the team’s morale going forward.

“I’m just focused on the next game, its Manchester United and that’s a real big game. If we can win that game, it will give us a big boost and a lot of confidence going into the next one. So as you can see, we are enjoying every day.

And if you come into the training ground and around the training ground, you can see how happy everyone is and how much everyone wants to come in every day and make the contribution they can, to make the team, the club better. So it’s a real good vibe right now.”

The Gunners kick-started the new campaign in red-hot form, securing back-to-back victories in their previous five matches that led them to the top of the Premier League table. 

They will be looking to continue asserting their dominance when they lock horns with the Red Devils on Sunday. While the Erik Ten-Hag’s side are also on a run of three successive victories following a lethargic start to the season, it foretells the magnitude of Sunday’s encounter between both sides.
