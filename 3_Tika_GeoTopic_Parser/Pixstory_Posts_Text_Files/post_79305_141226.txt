After the tragic news of the Queen s passing R I P yesterday as a sign of respect the Premier League decided to postpone this weekend s fixtures In addition to this with the funeral happening next Monday it s looking very possible that the following round of fixtures won t be able to be played due to the lack of police available for the games As a result we are left without English football for weeks and due to the international break won t be seeing domestic football until October assuming next weekends games are cancelled So what are we supposed to do Well I ve decided to keep the content flowing and everybody entertained that during this time I will create my all time Arsenal XI releasing a new player every days So starting from tomorrow where I will be releasing my goalkeeper you will receive a player each day in what we will call the afcjxmes ultimate Arsenal XI You re more than welcome to get involved and respond in the comments or by supporting the post as I d love to hear your opinions PixstoryArsenal Arsenal
