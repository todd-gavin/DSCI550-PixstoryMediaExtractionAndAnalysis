Netflix has revealed that it lost 200,000 subscribers in less than 100 days.

Its shares tanked 25% on the disclosure.

But the news is not really shocking. It's been apparent for some time (see parent story) that there is just nothing worth watching on Netflix anymore.

Why will anyone pay for a service if there is nothing worth consuming?

In its earnings report, the company blamed password sharing for its woes, but the real problem is content. 

During its heydays, it had so many great shows that Netflix claimed that its only competition was sleep. 

Users flock to wherever they are entertained. The latest numbers show that place is no longer Netflix.

Its time Netflix woke up!
