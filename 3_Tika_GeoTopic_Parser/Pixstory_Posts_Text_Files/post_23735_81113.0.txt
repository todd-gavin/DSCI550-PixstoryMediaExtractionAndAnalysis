Located in the oldest surviving city of the world- Varanasi, Kashi Vishwanath Temple is one of the most visited temples in India. It is the most revered of the twelve jyotirlingas located in India.

The temple stands in all-might at the western bank of River Ganges and teaches mankind the true meaning of life and death. A one-time visit to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is equivalent to the visit to other eleven jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva.

This heavenly abode is visited by many distinguished personalities such as Adi Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda, Goswami Tulsidas, Gurunanak among others.

A visit to this sacred temple is believed to be one of the ways to attain ‘moksha’ (ultimate liberation of the soul).
