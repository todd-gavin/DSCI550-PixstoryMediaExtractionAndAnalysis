When I was young Independence day was just a cultural activists day or a holiday for me But as I grew I acknowledge that Independence Day is one of the most important day of the year for our country Remember it s not just a holiday August is the day when we achieved our freedom and our rights to rule our own country Each year on August we celebrate Independence Day because on this date India became an independent nation which means we were free to rule ourselves and were not ruled by anyone else For hundreds of years India was ruled by the United Kingdom and our nation was a part of the British Empire The British dominated a lot of the world and India was one of its many colonies Before they came India was made up of many kingdoms After being ruled by them for years the mutual feelings toward foreign rule brought the country together United the people of the nation struggled to free itself from British rule for many years We officially became independent on August To mark this historic event we celebrate our independence on th August every year So it s not just a holiday it s the day where we Honour every single soul who fought for this homeland and gave our freedom back to us Jai Hind
