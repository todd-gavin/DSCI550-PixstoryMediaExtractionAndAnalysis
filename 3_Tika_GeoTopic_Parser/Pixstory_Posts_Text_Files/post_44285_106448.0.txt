The UEFA Nations League returns this weekend with a new set of fixtures, beginning with
Portugal's encounter against Switzerland on Sunday. On paper, Portugal is the superior squad,
and they will have the upper hand this weekend.

Switzerland is now anchored to the bottom of their group and has had a difficult season. The
Swiss team lost 1-0 to Spain earlier this week and will be looking to rebound in this encounter.

Portugal, on the other hand, is leading Group 2 in League A and has had a strong start. The
Iberian giants defeated Czech Republic 2-0 in their previous match and will be looking for a
repeat performance this weekend.

Switzerland vs Portugal: Probable Playing XI

Switzerland : Yann Sommer; Silvan Widmer, Nico Elvedi, Manuel Akanji, Ricardo Rodriguez;
Granit Xhaka, Remo Freuler; Steven Zuber, Xherdan Shaqiri, Renato Steffen; Breel Embolo

Portugal : Diogo Costa; João Cancelo, Pepe, Domingos Duarte, Raphael Guerreiro; Bruno
Fernandes, Ruben Neves, Danilo Pereira; Bernardo Silva, Cristiano Ronaldo, Rafael Leao

Switzerland vs Portugal :Prediction

For huge stretches of their Nations League campaign, Switzerland has appeared to be lacking
in offensive ideas, but the likelihood of wholesale Portugal changes might play into Yakin's
hands in front of the home fans. 

However, even if Santos takes a major decision regarding
Ronaldo, Portugal will not require any lessons in scoring goals, and the Selecao should
maintain their comfortable lead at the top before departing for their well-deserved vacation.

Prediction: Switzerland 1-3 Portugal
