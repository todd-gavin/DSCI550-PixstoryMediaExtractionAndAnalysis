This is so what happens after waking up from a nap. You're disoriented, still sleepy and somehow even more lethargic and tired😂
It's like you're experiencing an out of body situation cause you just take so much time in understanding where you are, what you're doing 😂
You're like, "Whooaaaa, wait....., what...."😂
And it's worse if someone wakes you up! On your own you kinda get your bearings slowly but surely. But when someone else has woken you up, there's this annoyance that makes it worse🤦‍♀️
