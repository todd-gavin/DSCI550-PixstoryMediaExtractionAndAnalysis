Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri thus commented to Dazn&#39;s microphones on the success obtained in Genoa against Sampdoria Morata among the first in Europe on a technical level but if he plays with his back to goal he struggles If he plays more from the sidelines he puts his qualities on the field they are important Today on a technical level the team played well We have to improve when we had control of the match in the second half we had to better understand the situation in order to hurt up front It wasn&#39;t easy in Genoa but the team did well It was important to win to consolidate fourth place and better prepare for the Champions League Kean needs to improve in management and controls even today the ball slipped a couple of times when he has room to become devastating We hope to recover Dybala also mentally fresh and need such people The team is growing in terms of confidence and dribbling but he needs to improve in finding forwards Rabiot is having a good year He sacrifices pace and needs to be more free in going to score He can do more but he&#39;s doing well
