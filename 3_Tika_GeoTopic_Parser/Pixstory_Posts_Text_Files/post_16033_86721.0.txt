Introduction 

Prediabetes was first described in 1965 by the World Health Organization (WHO), using the term “borderline diabetes.”1Prediabetes was formally identified in 1999 by WHO by identifying a state of “intermediate hyperglycemia”2 marked by both impaired glucose tolerance and fasting glucose. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is well known as a complex metabolic disease that develops over time. The pathophysiology of prediabetes and T2DM include the development of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. These 2 hallmark features occur along a spectrum of interrelated deficits of glucose metabolism. Diabetes develops when frank hyperglycemia results from pancreatic cell failure.3 Prediabetes represents a timeline of hormonal dysregulation influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Environmental and lifestyle influences that are linked to the development of diabetes include but are not limited to age, sex, dietary intake, obesity, physical inactivity, socioeconomic status, and stress level.4 The time leading up to diagnosis of T2DM is often marked by no overt symptoms; however, chronic inflammation and hyperinsulinemia are linked to the development of microvascular complications, such as cardiovascular disease5 and retinopathy.6 Incremental increases in 2-hour post-prandial blood glucoses are associated with the development of cardiovascular disease.7 Fifty percent of patients with prediabetes have been estimated to develop diabetes within 5 years of diagnosis.2 In addition, those with gestational diabetes (GDM) also carry elevated risk of the development of T2DM in the future. 

Prevalence and economic burden 

The global prevalence of diabetes among adults increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014 and the number of people with diabetes was estimated at 422 million in 2014.8 Roughly 10% of the US population, or 34 billion, is estimated to have diabetes, with an estimated 20% being undiagnosed. Approximately one-third of the US population is estimated to have prediabetes, or roughly 88 million people. This percentage has stayed relatively stable between 2005 and 2016.9 The total estimated financial burden of diabetes to US health care was estimated to be greater than $300 billion in 2017.10 These statistics continue to support the importance of early detection of prediabetes with the goal of prevention or delay of progression to T2DM through lifestyle change.
