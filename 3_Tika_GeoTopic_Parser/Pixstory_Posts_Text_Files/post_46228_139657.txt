There s something about conversations isn t it Speaking your heart out to someone who you know is there for you no matter if it s in the morning or afternoon Venting yourself when you re hurt confessing when you know you re wrong sharing all the little joys and sorrows and everything in between with someone who is ever ready to hear your rants It s not always about talking sometimes it s more about sharing When you know you ve someone on the other side of the door waiting for you to ask about your day to pass on words of encouragement on your terrible days and to hear everything that you hesitate to speak you know how special is he she and how you can never resist talking to them When on days you ve nothing to share express or complain about even then all your heart wants is to sit beside them look into their eyes and confabulate Words may not be enough to express but then you know when you have your favourite person in front you can talk about anything and everything even if it s not worth the time because what s better than talking to the one who makes you feel like someone wanted to be heard
