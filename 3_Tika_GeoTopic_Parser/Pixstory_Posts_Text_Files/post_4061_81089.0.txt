We should not again fall for divide and rule. Do you know how easy it is to create an intolerance in India due to many religions and castes. It is the same phenomenon that made things easy for British. When we fight for independence did we talk about religion or did we stand for our country? Yet let's not forget the bloodshed and pain after independence upon the separation. Is religion important than peace? Religion is never an identity, it is a belief. Your identity lies in your behaviour, your empathy, your process of thought.

Hijabs or Turbans or scarves, if it's their to segregate people and make them think as 'we' and 'you', then what are we doing? Stop targeting religions, let it be election or a violence people always enquire about the religion and caste of a person.

â€ŒIndia is a democracy with a strong emphasis on secularism. We could practice any religion we want. But always understand their is always a chance to manipulate and get religion, too much in the head. I realised this when I was heartbroken to hear the news of a little girl Asifa being raped inside a temple. After a week when I was travelling and I saw children from the age of 4 along with men and woman protesting against woman entering Sabarimala temple on road. They had this massive aggressive expression and hatred in their face. And I DID NOT SEE anyone protesting with this vigour for Asifa. She went out of news yet I still hear, even after 2 years people blame the floods and Corona upon women entering temple in Sabarimala (curse). Similar example can be quoted with the picture from history wherein children chasing to 'Kill' a Jewish woman during Nazi Regime.
