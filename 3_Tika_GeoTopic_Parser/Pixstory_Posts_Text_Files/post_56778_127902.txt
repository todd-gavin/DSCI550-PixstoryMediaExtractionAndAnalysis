Those who are working in such dingy areas want relief from it No one would even support this idea of legalization or even thinking prostitution as a profession And if any woman who has been a part of it and wants prostitution to be legalized then the only reason could be that she has been desensitized enough by the harms and images that there is no other option left Prostitution humiliates women and if we accept it or legalize it it will worsen the situation A former sex worker Rachel Moran said To be prostituted is humiliating enough to legalize prostitution is to condone that humiliation and to absolve those who inflict it It is an agonizing insult It is a myth that any form of acceptance or legalization would protect the rights of these people It is not possible to protect someone whose work and income expose them to the chances of being raped on average once a week The debate would never end and so make the points that favour the complete annihilation of prostitution
