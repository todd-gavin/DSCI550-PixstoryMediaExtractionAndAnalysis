Not only lakes and rivers in Lombardy the drought also dries up the fountains This was announced by the regional Coldiretti in underlining that the lowering of the aquifers caused by the lack of rain and water scarcity is putting the so-called resurgence belt in crisis It is a question explains Coldiretti region of a strip that crosses the Lombard plain from west to east in the middle of the regional territory between the provinces of Milan Pavia Lodi Bergamo Brescia Cremona and Mantua where the over still active fountains are distributed according to a Coldiretti analysis on regional data The fountain continues Coldiretti Lombardy a mouth created in the ground to bring out the groundwater, which tends to be close to the surface, to collect and convey it into a small canal. Often the fountains were built in areas originally already affected by the presence of resurgences. Lombardy we are collecting several reports from farmers who highlight the drying up of springs due to drought A worrying situation continues Coldiretti because in addition to allowing irrigation of the cultivated countryside in various areas, the springs represent a refuge habitat for many animal and plant species. it had never been seen in our area, says Sergio Vismara, grain grower from Cisliano in the Milan area. Normally, a flow of water of thirty liters per second comes out of the head of a fountain and a small lake forms, now we don&#39;t even get to the liter and there is only a thin layer of silt The water tables have dropped too low so it is impossible to draw water This is an area full of fountains that are used to irrigate areas where the Villoresi network does not reach Now we risk losing 1% of the corn sown on these same fields
