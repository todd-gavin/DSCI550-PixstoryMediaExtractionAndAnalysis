1. Keep Quiet When Someone Is Wrong. 
Trick: When someone is wrong, donâ€™t point it out to them. Directly telling a person that he/she is wrong hurts their ego to the very core. A polite conversation where you express your disagreement is a better way to go about it.


2. Repeat Back What They Say
Trick: Paraphrase their words and repeat back to show that you understand them.
A positive way to win people over and influence them is to make them feel that you understand their feelings and empathize with them. The technique called Reflective Listening works well in this regard. You just need to paraphrase their words and repeat them back- this is an effective way to connect with people.

3. Nod While You Speak
Trick: Nod a lot while you converse with the person you want to win over, especially before you ask for a favor.
Scientists have found that nodding during a conversation has many positive effects. First of all, when you nod while listening to a person speak, it shows that you agree with the speaker. Moreover, it was also observed that when someone nods before your eyes, naturally, you will do the same.
