Measures such as restricting and limiting voter registration, as well as absentee ballot practises, according to rights groups working for the now minority population, threaten to deprive tens of thousands of tribal people of the right to vote. 

Tehran Times reported that since the summer of last year, when the House Administration Committee discovered that a lack of available polling places disproportionately impacted Native American voters, there has been growing concern about minority groups in America and their right to vote freely, fairly, and without restrictions or harassment policies. 

In a very lengthy report, the committee acknowledged that firstly Americans in general “have not enjoyed equal access to the ballot. Indeed, only a small fraction of the population cast ballots in the election elevating George Washington as our first president.”

It identified voter identification and documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements “disproportionately burden minority voters,” saying “the burden of these requirements disproportionately fall on Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American voters, and newly naturalized citizens. 

Recent studies have demonstrated that Black and Latino voters are less likely to have access to birth certificates and passports, documents often required to establish proof of citizenship, than White voters.”

Under proof-of-citizenship rules, minority groups would face greater barriers to registration than White voters, according to the analysis. 

It also revealed that over 1,600 Native American polling locations have been closed since 2012.

I hope that this matters gets addressed as soon as possible because of this report and appropriate measures are taken to rectify the situation!
