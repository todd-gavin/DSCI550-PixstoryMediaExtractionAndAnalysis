A builder devoted to his alma mater, Shifa-ur-Rehman is one of the longest incarcerated accused in the Delhi riots conspiracy case. As we look back at the legal trajectory of his case, Rehman spoke to us from Tihar jail about the India he was born into, Islamophobia today, and the biased application of stringent laws.

Close to two years after the Delhi police arrested him on 26 April 2020, Shifa-ur-Rehman, president of the Alumni Association Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI), is one of the longest incarcerated accused of the Delhi riots conspiracy case, and someone who has not quite caught the attention of the press and the public in the same way that other social and political activists in the case have.

Rehman, 45, one of the 18 people accused of instigating communal violence in the national capital in February 2020, is named in the chargesheet for first information report (FIR) 59/2020 of the Delhi crime branch, invoking over 30 crimes including murder, sedition, and committing a terrorist act.

In the months following the riots, the Delhi police arrested some of those protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA), accusing them of using the two-month long anti-CAA movement as a front for planning the communal riots that left 53 people dead, two-thirds of them Muslim. Of the 18 people accused of planning the worst communal violence in Delhi since the killing of Sikhs in 1984, 16 are Muslim. 

Over the past two years, the police investigation into the conspiracy behind the Delhi riots has come to be regarded as an exercise in delegitimizing the anti-CAA protests and silencing critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government especially Umar Khalid, a political activist and a PhD from Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. 

In bail orders for three student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, and Asif Iqbal Tanha, and a former mobile phones salesman, Faizan Khan, the Delhi High Court judges have castigated the Delhi police investigation, finding no prima facie case of terrorism against them.
