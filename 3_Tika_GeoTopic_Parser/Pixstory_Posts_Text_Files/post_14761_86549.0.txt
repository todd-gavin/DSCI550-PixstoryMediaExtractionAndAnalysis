Twitter Inc has removed tweets from the Russian Embassy in the United Kingdom about the bombing of a children's  hospital in Mariupol for breaking its rules against denying violent events, the company said on Thursday.

Three people including a child were killed in Wednesday'sair strike on the maternity and children's hospital in theUkrainian city, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said onThursday.

"We took enforcement action against the Tweets youreferenced as they were in violation of the Twitter Rules,specifically our Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behavior policiesrelated to the denial of violent events," said a Twitterspokesperson.

One of the tweets from RussianEmbassy posted images with ared label saying "fake" and said the maternity house wasnon-operational and was being used by Ukrainian armed forces.

Russia has shifted its stance over the hospital bombing,with a mix of statements on Thursday that veered betweenaggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clearfacts.

Moscow has cracked down on tech platforms during theinvasion of Ukraine, which it calls a "special operation,"including restricting Twitter and blocking Meta-ownedFacebook. Twitter has also launched a privacy-protected versionof its site, known as an "onion service", which can be accessedthrough the dark web and could bypass such restrictions.
