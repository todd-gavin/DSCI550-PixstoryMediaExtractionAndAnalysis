The much awaited Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) auctions for season 9 took place on August 5 and August 6. It's not even 6 months since that dramatic final between Patna Pirates and Dabang Delhi in season 8 of the tournament and the excitement of season 9 is here. 

All 12 teams have already announced their list of retained players ahead of the auctions. A total of 111 players have been retained which includes 19 Elite Retained Players (ERP) 13 in the Retained Young Players (RYP) category, and 38 in the New Young Players (NYP). 

The likes of Pawan Sherawat and Sachin Tanwar and Pardeep Narwal were a part of the auction.

What is NYP? 

The NYP category is separate from the other categories of players in the PKL Auction. This category is for players between the ages of 18 and 22. Players in this category are those who have never participated in a PKL auction before.

Mashal Sports' flagship Future Kabaddi Heroes (FKH) programme produces the NYPs. It's a platform where coaches from various teams conduct a nationwide scouting hunt. The process is in place to identify some of the best young talents and nurture them by providing them with a platform to compete in the Pro Kabaddi League.

NYP includes uncapped players who have shown promise and skill at the domestic and junior levels. Each team is permitted to retain 6 NYPs before the auction. 

Defending champions, Dabang Delhi have retained Ashu Malik, Vinay Kumar and Krishan in the NYP category. While 3-time champions Patna Pirates have retained Rohit and Manish in the same category. 

Some of the prominent names to have been retained in this category include Bharat by Bengaluru Bulls, Prince D by Telugu Titans and Jaideep by Haryana Steelers. 

Jaipur Pink Panthers, Bengal Warriors were the only two teams to have not retained anyone in the category. 

A total of 41 new young players were nominated by franchises for the 9th edition.
