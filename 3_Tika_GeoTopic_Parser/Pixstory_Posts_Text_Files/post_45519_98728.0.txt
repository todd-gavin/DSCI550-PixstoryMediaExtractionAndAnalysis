Newcastle United are pleased to announce the contract extension of their defender Paul
Dummett, keeping him at the club for the season 2022-23.

The 30-year old left-back who can also operate as a centre-back made his first-team
debut for the Magpies in January 2013 and also amassed more than 200 appearances
for the club.

Born in Newcastle Dummett joined United’s academy aged eight and progressed
through the ranks, eventually captaining the club’s U-21 side and enjoying loan spells
with Gateshead and St. Mirren- winning the South Scottish League cup with the
Buddies.

Dummett has also represented Wales on the International stage, qualifying through his
grandfather. He made five U-21 appearances before earning four full international caps.

Dummett said, “this is a hugely exciting time for the football club and the city, so I am
delighted to be committing another year here and staying at my boyhood club.”

“I’m extremely proud that next season will be my tenth involved with the first team and
I’m really looking forward to being part of what is a big season to come.”

Newcastle United's head coach, Eddie Howie said, ”Paul is a consummate professional
who has given so much to this club and I am delighted he will be staying with us.”

“He is a player and a person I like very much. He leads by example both in the dressings room and on the pitch and I am pleased to retain someone with his positive influence
and defensive capabilities.”

Dummett won five caps for Wales, who he qualifies through his grandfather, before
calling time on his international career in 2019 to focus on club football.
