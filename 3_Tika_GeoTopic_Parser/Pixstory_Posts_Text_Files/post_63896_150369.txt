It has become a common discussion in the anime community as to whether old anime is better than new anime In order to answer this question we must first identify what old and new really mean For most people s are the mark for designation old vs new but here the line between older and newer anime is post s since the s now easily classify as old Now that the time is clear the simple answer to this question is yes older anime is in fact better That does not mean that new anime has nothing going for it now but merely that old anime qualitatively has more going for it A big factor for this qualitative difference is due to better storytelling less emphasis on over stylized action sequences and better art style due to relying less on CGI and D models These models may look more refined but also feel way too industrial cheap lazy and lifeless especially when the D animation models lack any kind of fluidity making even k textures feel like cardboard pieces Furthermore old anime unlike new anime has too much repetition in character design attributing to studio laziness Character development is not always better in older anime as it many times remains incomplete it has always been a focal point of driving the story forward as animators and storytellers were content on taking their time to tell a story rather than rushing it This leads to an increase in the memorability factor as we tend to like things which make a greater impact on us And of course there is the factor of nostalgia which plays a huge role in this big attraction to older anime despite them having plenty of flaws But most of all it packs a great deal of originality as there is a lot of thought poured into the production animation and storytelling process This is unlike new anime where there is a general lack of thought in the process But most of all new anime s biggest failure is its strong focus on fan service while old anime s focus was more on content and storytelling
