The name Rabindranath Tagore is brought up ceaselessly whenever one talks about Bengali heritage. The Tagore household boasts of the few most accomplished people in India in the fields of art, music and literature. The women of this household may have been forgotten, but their work most definitely has not. Living in Jorasako, these vivacious women were revolutionary, so modern for their time, catalysts of change in the society. 
Jnanadanandini Tagore was a social reformer who pioneered various cultural innovations and influencedwomenâ€™s empowerment in 18th century. She was the first fashion designer in Bengal, introducing blouses and chemise jackets. She fashioned her drapes after Parsi and Gujrati styles. 
Sunayini Devi was the first woman painter in India. She was niece of Rabindranath Tagore. A self-taught artist, she was a true primitive of the Bengal School of Art. Inspired by Patachitra, her paintings depicted mythological scenes and domestic scenes. Some of her most notable works are are Sadhika, Milk Maids
and Satir Dehatyag. 
Swarnakumari Devi was a poet and novelist. She was the eldest sister of Rabindranath Tagore. Deepnirban (1870) was her first novel, Chinna Mukul, Snehalata, and Kahake were her most prominent works. The first opera of Bengal Basanta Utsav was written by her in 1879. Swarnakumari Devi attended the annual sessions of the Indian National Congress in 1889 and 1890. She was the first woman author of Bengal to be the recipient of Jagattarini Gold Medal from Calcutta University. 
These women helped shape Bengali society as we know it. They are the inspiration for many Bengali 
girls like me to be ourselves and hone our skills, not holding ourselves back.
