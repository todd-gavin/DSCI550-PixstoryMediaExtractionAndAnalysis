Martin Braithwaite’s future at Barcelona remains up in the air as we move close to the summer transfer window. 


The Danish international was bought in as an emergency in February 2020 from Leganes and has been a handy squad player at Camp Nou without really establishing himself as a first-choice in the frontline. 


However, in the past months, it has been clear that he does not register himself in the plans of manager Xavi Hernandez going forward. 

Braithwaite had started the 2021-22 season fairly well under the former Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman before being struck down by an injury that ruled him out till January. Upon returning, Xavi made it clear to him that finding another club for him would be the best option. 


But, Braithwaite has hardly featured himself in the second half of the campaign, playing just 22 minutes of football under Xavi. 

However, according to reports, his salary is proving to be an issue in finding suitors for him. The Dane is on a contract worth 4 million pounds per year with the Blaugranas with the deal running until the summer of 2024. 

While there are teams interested in him, they are reluctant to meet those wages, leading to roadblocks in the Catalans giants' efforts to offload him before next season. 


The report further adds that the English side Brighton and Hove Albion is one of the Braithwaite’s suitors. Having tried to sign him in January, the Seagulls still retain an interest, but his salary continues to be a deal-breaker. 


With Barcelona trying to bring in another forward next summer, there will be no place for Braithwaite in Camp Nou and the club must find a way to resolve this issue next summer.
