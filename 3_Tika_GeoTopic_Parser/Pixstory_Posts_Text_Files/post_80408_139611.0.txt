Aaron Ramsey
Fans will undoubtedly continue to be upset by the Welshman's leaving. Wenger gave him his chance when he was young, and he developed into a really prominent person. Ramsey's well-known jubilation at Fulham in 2018 was the result of Arsenal's decision not to extend his contract. He would accept a free transfer to Juventus, but the move never materialized. He most recently made a return to the Italian Club OGC Nice.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 
Within a few months, his stock appeared to rise quickly before falling. Wenger spent the most money on Aubameyang, who scored the last goal of his reign and was a consistent source of goals. There were no indications, especially in north London, because of issues that would arise under Arteta and lead to the two parties' eventual dissolution. Although Aubameyang's goal scoring record is among the best in Arsenal history, the current administration couldn't deal with his attitude issues and had him locked out before he left for Barcelona and now Chelsea.
Alexandre Lacazette
One of the select few who have persevered through the course, but how much longer? The France international has a few months left on his contract and might depart for nothing, which is a scenario that Arsenal supporters have heard all too often. He is presently being chosen to lead the line and was regarded as Aubameyang's superior player overall. Lacazette, meanwhile, has had to make accommodations for his colleagues in various positions and therefore left this summer to Ligue1 club Lyon.
Henrikh Mkhitaryan
He was included in the exchange that allowed Alexis Sanchez to move to Manchester United. It's safe to say that neither transfer was very successful, and the Armenian is currently at Inter Milan under Simone Inzaghi. He was one of several players that Arteta, who is now heavily rebuilding at the Emirates, shipped out. Mkhitaryan was never able to match the incredible form he displayed when playing for Borussia Dortmund.
