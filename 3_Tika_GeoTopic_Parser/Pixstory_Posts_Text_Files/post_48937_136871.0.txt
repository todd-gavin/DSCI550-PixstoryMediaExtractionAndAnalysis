Because fish retain a high amount of ecosystem nutrients in their tissues, transport nutrients farther than other aquatic animals, and excrete nutrients in dissolved forms that are easily available to primary producers, fish play a key role in nutrient cycles.
Around intensive fish farms, waste from fish feed and faeces can pollute the water and seabed, resulting in poor water and sediment quality. Chemicals and pesticides (which are used in certain fish farming to manage parasites and disease) can potentially contaminate the environment and have an impact on nearby marine species.
By undermining the resilience of many marine species to climate change, overfishing makes marine fisheries production more vulnerable to ocean warming, and sustained warming will thwart efforts to recover overfished populations. Mercury levels in some fish species can also be exacerbated.
It's important we start taking climate threat more seriously. We have absolutely DESTROYED our oceans. We aren't the only species living on the planet and we need to stop acting like we are. Our sealife is dying, many flora and fauna have gone extinct, many our in the process of it.
A big part of it is due to fishing. Something we can slowly get past. Change is slow but it's important that we start. There are plenty excuses to make, but excuses aren't going to save the planet.
And unfortunately for a lot of our ignorant conscience, we need to make individual efforts for it it too. How do we have the nerve to complain about species extinction while simultaneously being an active part of it?
