The meeting between Pogba&#39;s entourage and the Juventus management seems to take place Today The confirmation comes from several sources and the Juventus fans are already starting to dream of the return of the Frenchman who in was taken on a free transfer by Manchester United and then resold in forever to the Reds for over million euros Now history could repeat itself given that Pogba&#39;s contract is about to expire and he will leave Manchester again on a free transfer He has never forgotten the years he spent in Turin that began with the bench and then ended them with the number shirt on his shoulders and the awareness of being one of the best midfielders around Juventus is not the only team interested and ironically the one that can offer the least salary to the player Currently they receive millions of euros a year but the black and whites couldn&#39;t offer more Different story for Real Madrid and Psg which, on the other hand, could guarantee Pogba a salary of millions a year The choice may not depend on money, especially given Pogba&#39;s last years in Manchester A lot of money but little return due to tense relationships Maybe going back to where he grew up could benefit him a lot And this he knows too and is evaluating
