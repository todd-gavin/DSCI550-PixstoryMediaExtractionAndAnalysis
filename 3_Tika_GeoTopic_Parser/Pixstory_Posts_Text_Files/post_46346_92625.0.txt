But Worry no more ! As I have some healthy options for you all ! 

Lemme tell you my Fruits for late-night snacking 😋

Banana 🍌
Kiwi 🥝
Strawberry 🍓

🥝 Kiwis are high in vitamin C, melatonin, and a range of other nutrients, making them a wonderful choice for a late-night sweet appetite.

🍌 Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to relax our muscles and promotes restful sleep.

🍓 If you're looking for a large snack serving that doesn't pack a lot of calories, reach for fresh strawberries. Strawberries are an excellent source of vitamin C and contain a notable amount of melatonin

The Secret is , The serotonin in these fruits helps to reduce carb cravings .
