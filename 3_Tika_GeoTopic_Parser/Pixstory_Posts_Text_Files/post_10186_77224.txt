If one day despair overwhelms you think of those in Afghanistan who are breathing under the whip of misery Those who soften their fingers with thousands of sufferings But they have no choice but to endure Think of those who are brutally raped But they have been freed from the cruel oppression of the time If you re disappointed one day think of mothers selling their lonely pieces on the street for snacks Who can bear this pain And yet the mothers who live in this abusive mourning Although they are dead If you are disappointed one day talk about people who are losing their rabbits in the perilous path of migration They can not even look at them for the last time Their faces are covered with dust If you are disappointed think of girls who are in love always living in the sweet dreams of the future waiting for the warm look of the beloved But they are forced to separate from everyone burying love in the graveyard of compulsion They shoulder the corpse of their dreams to decide their unknown destiny in another grave Never think of despair as long as there is love hope is another name for living How good it is to love each other to shake hands with each other kindly to greet others with a suitcase of laughter
