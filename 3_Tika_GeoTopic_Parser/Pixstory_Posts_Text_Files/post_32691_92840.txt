The Superbike world championship restarted with a good race that saw the three most awaited riders as protagonists The final victory went to Jonathan Rea at the end of a very close battle with Alvaro Bautista The two Kawasaki and Ducati drivers immediately made it clear who had it more with the reigning champion Razgatlioglu who had to give up early and let his two rivals go away. Then the usual battle began between the more powerful Ducati of the Spaniard who prevailed on the straight and the more agile Kawasaki of the British who took the lead again in the corners right up to the last lap when Rea&#39;s response came immediately to Bautista&#39;s decisive attack. The first points are his ahead of the Spaniard and the Turkish. Iker Lecuona
