Koffee With Karan latest episode news The episode featuring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan has emerged as the most entertaining episode of Koffee With Karan Season so far Apart from Aamir trolling Karan Johar all the time the highlight of the show remained Kareena talking about how she had to do the screen test for Laal Singh Chaddha Karan to his utter dismay and shock asked her again you actually screen test for this role and Kareena reiterated yes they got the camera and made me enact a scene because he was like I am not confident KJo dug more and asked her tell me about screen testing which is a norm all over the world but does the ego come in between sometimes Kareena said No it wasn t the ego I was just nervous because I had never done it And when I told Saif he said it s cool and you should do it I said if I am going to do it it s going to be for Aamir The whole episode turned out to be a big promotional show for Laal Singh Chaddha and probably the only video where Aamir and Kareena are seen promoting the film together
