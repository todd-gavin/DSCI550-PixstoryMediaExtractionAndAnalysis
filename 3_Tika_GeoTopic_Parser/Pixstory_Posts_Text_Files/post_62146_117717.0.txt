Thomas Tuchel now has the foundations of a very good squad, adding to that with experience and quality with Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly has only heightened the strength of the side, even with the departures. The third man to add into Tuchel's plans is Jules Kounde.

As Chelsea move closer to bringing in the versatile and highly rated 23-year-old defender, the start of this sentence alone tells you why he is of such value to Tuchel. After being pursued for most of last summer, the closer the deal gets the more sense it makes and the more it becomes remarkable that Chelsea nearly walked away from him in favour of Nathan Ake

Kounde is the younger version, the less established model, of Tuchel's vision. He's flexible, quick, technically brilliant. He can play the ball, dribble with it and has a fearless attitude that follows him onto the pitch. He might not have the immediate impact that 109 Premier League goals and four titles from Sterling will, there's also an expectation that Koulibaly's presence and physical dominance will be more commanding than him. But Kounde is in the same bracket of importance.
