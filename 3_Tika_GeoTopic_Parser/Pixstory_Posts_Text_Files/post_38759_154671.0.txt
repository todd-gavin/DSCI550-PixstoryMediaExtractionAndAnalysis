Scout Report - Young U19 Players taking the World by Storm
Every once in a while there are talents who burst onto the field, namely Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford, Lionel Messi, Kevin De Bruyne, Neymar, and Cristiano Ronaldo. A few of them have become legends of the game.
Now there is a new generation of players who are emerging and forcing the world to take a look. They are Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham, Gio Reyna, Ansu Fati, Gavi Paez, Pedri, Jamal Musiala, Eduardo Camavinga, and Gio Reyna, who are taking the world by storm.

We will focus on midfielders who are bound to make a name We will take a look:
Eduardo Camavinga
The Frenchman is one of the exciting talents to come out from the Rennes youth academy. In the 2020-21 season, he was scouted by big clubs, but Real Madrid won the war and scooped for him. The 6 ft can deceive his opponents with his speed and agility, he can beat his opponents at ease. His passing range and his work ethic are of a seasoned midfielder. Even though he started very fewer games, he came good in UCL against Paris St Germain, Chelsea, and Manchester City. Even though it looked like Real will be knocked out, he turned the game around off the bench in Real Madridâ€™s favor eventually winning the 14th Champions League. 
Looking at the heatmap, we can see that Camavinga has operated mostly in the midfield role. The blue spot represents where his all actions came from, in the form of passing, defending, touches, and carries per game. 
Passing
It will be unfair to compare him with the likes of Luka Modric or Toni Kroos who have amazing passing range, nor does he have amazing shooting and goal-scoring range, but he has shown promise in passing and goal-scoring. He ranks 0.15 per game in goals scored, taking him to the 81 percentile and 0.15 in non-penalty goals scored per game, ranking him at the 85 percentile.
He had a pass completion % of 90.1 per 90, out of which he completed 55.19 passes per 90 taking him to the 89 percentile.
