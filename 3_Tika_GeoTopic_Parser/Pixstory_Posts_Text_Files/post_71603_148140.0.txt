Prologue continues....
The colonial government brought railways and the English language.
Railways linked various parts of the country and made movement easier
and faster. The English language brought new ideas and thoughts that, in
the ultimate analysis, helped in creating nationalistic urges and a quest for
freedom from bondage. Centuries of subjugation had destroyed the vitality
of the Indian people. 
They were more or less resigned to their fate. English education and contacts with intellectuals and thinkers in Europe made
Indians aware of the stirrings of new thoughts and ideas in the West. The
insights they gained compelled them to take a fresh look at the sociopolitical conditions in India. The awakening created waves in the realms of religion and social and political life. India, which had been suffering from intellectual exhaustion, woke up and began to inhale the freshness of new ideas. Raja Ram Mohun Roy and Swami Vivekananda are two
outstanding personalities who helped in awakening the conscience of
Indians.
Swami Vivekananda followed the path of Vedanta to make Indians
realize the glory of their civilization and the path they should choose to
recover their lost dignity and pride. The reformist zeal that permeated social
movements of this century was the product of modern education.
Rabindranath Tagore himself translated into English his seminal work
Geetanjali, for which he received the Nobel Prize. Tagore was one of the
greatest poets, a reformist and a great humanist who symbolized the new
awakening in India.
