Hector Bellerin has seen a complete evolution in himself and his surroundings since moving
away from Arsenal. The Spaniard moved away from the Premier league in 2021 as part of a loan deal, but will now return to the North London club, says Betis president Angel Haro.

Bellerin moved out of his mediocrity, as he developed into a confident, aware and mature
footballer in the year that he's spent at Betis.

Believe it or not, the club felt more like home
than anywhere else â€” that even after representing Arsenal for 9 years on various levels.

"Hector is a fanatic player and a very good person," Angel Haro told reporters. "It was a loan
that we had from Arsenal, now he returns to Arsenal and from then on, we'll see.

Bellerin bid a teary farewell to Betis' Benito Villamarin stadium last week as the Laliga side
beat Granada 2-0 in what was the final home game of the season.

"It is true that he has been very caught up in everything about Betis because, in addition,his
parents are Betis fans. Hopefully we cross paths again."

Real Betis are the club Bellerin grew up supporting, and so do both his parents. It is likely
that the 27 year old will push for a move back in the future, likely permanently. For now, he
moves back to Arsenal who have just suffered a major blow in missing out qualification for
next season's Champions League.

Betis too, finished 5th in laliga but did so with great grit and character. The move back is
likely to change a lot for Bellerin, who seemed to have settled into the Spanish lifestyle,
where his family feel most comfortable and his fashion is more relatable. Above all, his
football seemed to be going great as well.
