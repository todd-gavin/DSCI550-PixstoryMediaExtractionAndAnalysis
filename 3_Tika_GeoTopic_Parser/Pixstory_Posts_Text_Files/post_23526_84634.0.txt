Ever since HYBE Labels acquired other labels, things are not looking good for some k-pop idol groups and netizens can't help but be concerned about the same. 

Groups like GFriend and NU'EST are disbanding not long after HYBE acquired their lables and this has made the fans really upset. 

One fan wrote on an online community: 
"After [HYBE] acquired GFriend's label, they disbanded. After [HYBE] acquired NU'EST's label, they disbanded.

fromis_9 members are promoting, but are very risky. When [HYBE] didn't have enough groups [in their company], they acquired groups and used them. But when [the groups] run out of popularity and after [HYBE] got TXT and ENHYPEN, they automatically turn their heads on them."

However, there are others who think that HYBE shouldn't be held responsible for this. 
"It's right to get rid of groups that don't make money, in the perspective of the company Lol They're not some charity organization."

What's your take on this?
