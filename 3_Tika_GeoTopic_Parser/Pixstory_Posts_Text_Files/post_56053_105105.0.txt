A clerihew is an impulsive, four-line biographical poem of a type invented by Edmund Clerihew Bentley.
‌
‌Edmund Clerihew Bentley, who generally published under the names E. C. Bentley or E. Clerihew Bentley, was a popular English novelist and humorist.
‌
‌Although he is best known for his crime fiction and clerihews, Bentley also wrote at least one science fiction short story. This is the previously re-discovered "Flying Visit", published in the Evening Standard on 31 March 1953.

‌The first line is the poem's subject, usually a famous person, and the remainder puts the topic in an absurd light or reveals something unknown or spurious about the subject. 
‌
‌The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often urged. The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley developed the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

Sir Christopher Wren
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
If anyone calls
Say I am designing St. Paul's."

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target prominent individuals and reposition them in an absurd, anachronistic or commonplace setting, often offering them an over-simplified and slightly garbled definition.

Another one of his examples, 

John Stuart Mill,
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote Principles of Political Economy.
