Lo van Pham's road to the NFL began when he fell in love with sports after coming in Texas with his family after living in refugee camps. 

US News reported that Van Pham is ready to become the first Asian American to officiate in the NFL, more than 40 years later. 

“I never dreamed about being the first of anything,” van Pham said on the AP Pro Football Podcast. “It’s just a great honor. People reaching out to me, reminding me of how special this is, and I just want to do the right thing and carry whatever message I need to carry to represent not only our Asian culture and Asian friends, but also really to represent all minorities, whether Middle Eastern, just different backgrounds, different people that are out there. I want to communicate to convey the fact that if you work hard, prepare yourself, commit and do the things that you can control, your desires and your passion will carry you to the next level in whatever endeavor you choose.”

Van Pham and his parents and two siblings spent three years wandering through the jungles of South Vietnam and bouncing among refugee camps in Laos, Thailand, and the Philippines before being introduced to football in America. He was too little to recall much of the event, but as he grew older, his parents filled him in.
