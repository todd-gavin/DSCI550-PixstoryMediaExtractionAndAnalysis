Formerly of Chelsea and Arsenal and currently of AC Milan Olivier Giroud spoke out in an interview recently. The Frenchman, now 35 — talked about multiple topics including his growing up as a football fan in France and his affection for his current club. 


“I was 20 years old, I had grown my hair long, I wanted to be like Cannavaro or Nesta," Giroud told L'Equipe when speaking of his love for Italian footballers.


The Frenchman was a fan of players from the Italian National team growing up.


"My brother gave me the Squadra Azzurra jersey, the very tight one made by Kappa with this magnificent sky blue. Moreover, since France was not there, I supported Italy at the 1994 World Cup and I cried when Roberto Baggio missed his shot on goal in the final.


"On the other hand, concerning that final of 2006, I was 100 per cent for Les Bleus!"


Giroud also made his love for Milan clear, priding over the fact that he supported the Rossoneri as a young boy.


"In Italy, it was Milan," he added. "In 2007, they won it, they came back even stronger. That's a great club.


"This Milan was typical Italian class, always well-groomed, beautiful as a whole , but also very professional, rigorous."


Giroud plies his trade in Italy these days, after an up-and-down spell in England where he represented both Arsenal and Chelsea. His most recent contribution for Milan was a goal in the win against Lazio, equalising soon after half-time. If Milan do secure this season's Serie A title Giroud will add that trophy to a whole host of other titles that include Premier league winner's medals, the Champions League and France's 2018 World Cup.
