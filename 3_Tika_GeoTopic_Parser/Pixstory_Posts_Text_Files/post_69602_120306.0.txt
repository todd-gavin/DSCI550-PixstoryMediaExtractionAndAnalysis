The oldest holy site in the state of Jammu & Kashmir is Charar-i-Sharief, which was constructed to honour Sheikh Noor-ud-din (the patron saint of Kashmiris). In addition to being well-liked by Muslim devotees, this 600-year-old wooden shrine is also highly regarded by Hindus. 
The Sheikh Noor-ud-Din Wali, a well-known Kashmiri saint who offered his Friday prayers at this mosque, is also known as Charar-i-Sharief. In this well-known religious location close to Yusmarg, his remains are also preserved. People of different religions visit the shrine to seek graces on the saint's yearly Urs (death anniversary).
