“When you visit ‘Oxford's oldest monument’ you are looking at a landscape that has changed little since prehistoric times…Bronze Age people buried their dead here and during the Iron Age people lived on the meadow during the summer and grazed their livestock on the rich pasture. These burials and settlements are well preserved and clearly visible from the air or in some cases on the ground as shallow circular ditches and banks” — Oxford City Council’s page of Port Meadow 

Grateful for my friend aryandroz , who took me around favorite spots in Oxford including Port Meadow with swimming dogs, galloping horses and River Thames at its heart. 

From cycling around our neighborhood to walking through Port Meadow — Aryan leads with a comfort that instantly makes you feel more at home within yourself.
