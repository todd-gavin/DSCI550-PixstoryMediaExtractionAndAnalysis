Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi yesterday said an 18-year-old should not be demonised amid Congress's allegation against Union minister Smriti Irani's daughter Zoish Irani which the minister rebutted and dared the Congress to legally prove its claim. 

Without quoting the name the Union minister, Priyanka Chaturvedi tweeted, "18-year-olds may not know the process is the punishment in acquiring licenses for running a restaurant in India." Her tweet comes while the Union minister asserted that her daughter is a first-year college student and does not run any bar. "I speak as a mother of a 19-year-old & keeping my politics aside," Priyanka Chaturvedi tweeted.

The Congress on Saturday alleged that Smriti Irani's daughter is associated with an illegal bar in Goa. The minister challenged Congress and said, "I will see you in the court of law and the court of people". Asking the Congress where her daughter's name was mentioned in the notice that Congress cited.
