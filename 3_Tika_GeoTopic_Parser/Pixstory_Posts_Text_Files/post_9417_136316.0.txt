Three women in their 20s, perhaps 30s hang out and have random conversations throughout. No story, no incidents, no provocations. They keep shuttling between Vienna and Berlin. Sometimes we hear about their education, creative ennui, and job needs. We feel they are broke seeing the apartments they rotate. It’s never crucial for them. No such detailing. We hardly feel they exist. 61 minutes of screen time gave me faint clues about them.

Insomnia kept coming in. One suffers it so others talk about it. One is attempting a book. One is trying to land a job. All three are stuck somewhere. They are bored and facing an existential struggle. They don’t go deeper into a conversation, it is plain and lasts a few minutes. The three sync in time and space keeping themselves isolated from each other. It seemed to me when they talk they seek something out from the other. Perhaps, an aura to be settled in. Not sure it happens till the end. The scene - Daniela, Mia, and Natascha sit by a river and try a subconscious talk with themselves using a pendulum lives in my memory. I could connect them here. The party scene was weird. This film is all about disconnects with an urge to connect.

I have struggled with art movies at festivals. But this was a zero-structure genre. Ted Fendt, the American Independent filmmaker is known for it. He believes in creating something from a disorganized mess. Let me assure you, Outside Noise indirectly grabs noises from life happening outside the three leads. Two of them were co-writers of the script! They very well knew what they were doing. As they wander aimlessly in parks and roads and walk past city signals you can assume their backstories. Don’t even think Fendt would attempt it in his low-budget storytelling through a 16 mm camera.

Outside Noise screened at the New York Film Festival.
