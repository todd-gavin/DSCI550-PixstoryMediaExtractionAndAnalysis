The political, security and educational behavior and pattern of the Taliban is disappointing and disappointing. From the point of view of historical experience, the Taliban have modeled a dark and failed vision. Repetitiveness, failed past, illusion and fear, revolution and resistance against the government have been the characteristics of the post model in history.
The meaning of low model is ineffective political and governmental approach, character and behavior; An approach that creates poverty, deprivation and extremism for the society.
