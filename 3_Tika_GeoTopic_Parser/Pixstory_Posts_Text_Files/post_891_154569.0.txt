Horrible case of human sacrifice in Kerala; two women have been murdered.
A couple and an agent are in Kerala Police custody.
According to the police, an agent from Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district smuggled women from Kaladi and Kadavantra localities for a couple in Thiruvalla in Pathanamthitta district. The agent named Shafi and the couple -- identified as Vaidyan Bhagawal Singh and Laila -- have been arrested for performing ritualistic human sacrifice. The murdered women have been identified as Padma and Roslie. Roslie, a lottery ticket vendor, had been reported missing in August. 
The crime is very cruel. We have learnt that Bhagawal Singh, an Ayurvedic doctor, was facing financial troubles. Shafi has claimed that he received some financial benefit for providing the women for the ritualistic ceremony. Shafi was present at the spot when the two murders happened. The first case happened in June, while the second happened in September. The women were lured on the pretext of monetary gains for them. But what happened was totally different. The couple has confessed that they carried out the human sacrifice," Kochi City Police Commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam said.
According to preliminary information, the women were allegedly sacrificed under the belief that wealth and prosperity would be attained. Both bodies were buried. The body of one of the women has been found with her throat slit. 
Such a case of human sacrifice for financial gain and prosperity has not been reported before in Kerala. The gruesome crime has sent shockwaves across the state. The police investigation ended up in Thiruvalla based on the mobile tower location of the woman. The agent reportedly lured the women and brought them to Thiruvalla.
