Fire Safety Tips

CALL 101 IN CASE OF FIRE

FIRE SAFETY IN PUBLIC SPACES
We urge people to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves when they’re in public buildings like malls, theatres, Hospitals, and restaurants. Most people don’t consider fire a significant risk, and complacency is one of the greatest dangers when it comes to fire safety, No one ever thinks it will happen to them – until it does. Fires can and do happen and people need to be prepared in the event of one.

FIRE SAFETY TIPS FOR ENTERING AND SPENDING TIME IN PUBLIC SPACES.

Before You Enter
Take a good look. Does the building appear to be in a condition that makes you feel safe? Is the main entrance wide, and does it open outward to allow easy exit? Is the outside area clear of materials stored against the building or blocking exits?

Have a communication plan. Identify a relative or friend to contact in case you are separated from family or friends in an emergency.

Plan a meeting place. Pick a meeting place outside to meet family or friends with whom you are attending the function. If there is an emergency, be sure to meet them there.
When You Enter

Locate exits immediately. When you enter a building, make sure to identify all available exits. Some exits may be in front and some in back of you. Be prepared to use your closest exit. You may not be able to use the main exit.

Check for clear exit paths. Make sure aisles are wide enough and not obstructed by chairs or furniture. Check to make sure your exit door is not blocked or chained. If there are not at least two exits or exit paths are blocked, report the violation to management and leave the building if it is not immediately addressed. Call the local Chief Fire Officer to register a complaint.
