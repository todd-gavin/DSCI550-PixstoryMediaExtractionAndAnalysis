Without water in the fields, it is impossible to complete the crops and thus guarantee the production of food, as stated by Coldiretti Lombardia in view of the stop to payments for agriculture from the Lombard lakes starting with that of Idro We recognize the commitment of the Lombardy Region in managing a situation extremely difficult and complex on several fronts says Paolo Carra vice president of Coldiretti Lombardia but now we need a further effort we appeal to all the institutions concerned so that a solution can be found to avoid the loss of what farmers have managed to save so far despite the serious crisis water system in place and thus avoid further losses in crops Despite the race against time to try to save what can be salvaged says Coldiretti Lombardia in the countryside already today it is estimated that there will be drops of about a third for the production of barley, wheat and rice while losses for fodder is now approaching the same as the estimated drop in corn yields In the stables the cows are producing up to less milk but drought and heat also threaten the herds that go back towards the mountain pastures in search of grass and temperatures fresher continues the Coldiretti with the lack of rain that risks drying out the meadows and lowering the water tables An alarming scenario concludes the regional Coldiretti especially if we take into account that in Lombardy they produce not only rice made in Italy but also milk and all the national corn but half of the Italian pigs are also raised
