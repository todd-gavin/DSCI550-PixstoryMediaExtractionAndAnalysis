When you choose the same style of jacket or hoodie as a celebrity you look up to, you’re adopting a little bit of the style that makes them so appealing. As long as you remember to keep your own, brilliant identity, enjoying fashion can be a fun way to keep up with best and brightest in the world of stage and screen.
