My inspiration has always been Mary Kom Ma'am. My training for the day starts at 7:30 A.M. till 9 A.M. and then I have my breakfast. Then after getting some adequate rest, I usually start to train again at 5:30 in the evening. I train two times a day. I sometimes also have sparring sessions at 11 A.M. The biggest achievement for me in my career till now has been winning the Gold medal and Best Boxer award in the Youth World Championship. I've just entered the senior level now, I'm working really hard to achieve my next goal that is to win a medal for India in the Olympics. 
I have an Orthodox Boxing style, I am really aggressive and I have fast hands thats gives me a lot of speed in my punches which helps me land my combinations very quickly and thats what I try to rely on. I stick to the gameplan that my coaches set up for me. I still have a lot to learn and improve upon on to box at a more higher level. That is exactly what I'm working on in my training.
