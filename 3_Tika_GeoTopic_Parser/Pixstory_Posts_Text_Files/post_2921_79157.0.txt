In the last few weeks, Denmark, Norway and France have started removing at least bringing down Covid-19 restrictions as cases begin to fall. Sweden is the latest country to join this list, with Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson announcing Thursday that her country would end almost all restrictions from February 9 onwards. 

With growing calls for the coronavirus to be treated as an endemic illness, just like the flu, living with the virus as long as it does not result in deaths or serious illness is considered the right way forward.

Even as Europe was not yet out of the woods almost a month ago, Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, suggested that Europe should consider treated the virus like a flu and slowly return back to normal. Not many leaders stood up in his support, but that he along with a few others have been proven right.

Countries in the continent are allowing restaurants and nightlife to open and other restrictions are being lifted, including quarantine steps and removing restrictions on masks. Even as some cases like France and Germany have witnessed increased cases, Europe seems to be confident of having gained control over the virus.

More than week ago, the World Health Organization also provided a ray of hope saying that the Omicron variant was offering hope for "stabilization and normalization." Dr. Hans Kluge, the director for the W.H.O.'s European region, has said that between vaccination and natural immunity through infection, "Omicron offers plausible hope for stabilization and normalization." However, he had couched his optimism with a warning saying that it was too early for the world to drop its guard.

European nations are conscious of that. For instance, France, Austria or some other countries have strict vaccine mandate against coronavirus while also lifting restrictions that were there on people.
