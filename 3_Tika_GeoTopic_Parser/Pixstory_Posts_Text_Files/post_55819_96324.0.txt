Claudia Karvan, judge of the Stella Prize, Australia's first literary prize for women has talked about how there weren't many Australian books on her reading list as a student and it sheds light on a much bigger problem. 

“Certainly, when I was at school, there was a bit more cultural cringe," she says, referring to the term coined in the '50s to describe Australia's deference to English art. Instead, she "surrendered" to authors like Graham Greene, Jane Austen and the Russian greats.

As abc news has discussed, it's a common story: for decades, Australian kids were taught about Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, and George Orwell in school, then left to discover their own country's stories later in life, if at all. Karvan comments, "It took me a while to get around to Helen Garner and Peter Carey." 

If her bookcase was weak in Australian authors before, she's now been given a crash course as the host of Books That Made Us, a three-part documentary series that examines Australian literature and poses the question: can books help us understand our country?

Yes!
Rather than shying away from our unique past, the books in the series portray the good, terrible, and ugly aspects of Australian society. The picture that emerges is not of a single, unified Australian identity, but of a collection of stories with only one thing in common: a burning desire to show us more of ourselves. Even if we don't agree with everything we observe. 

Moreover, it appears that the Australian literary business is increasingly eager for formerly marginalised voices. The Miles Franklin Award, Australia's most distinguished literary prize, has gone to a woman for the past five years. Tara June Winch (2020) and Melissa Lucashenko (2019) are two of the past three winners who are Indigenous women (2019).

Let’s see if Australian literature can revive the meaning of home and identity as an Australian!
