Unbeknown to Bachchan, fate was conspiring to help him in a major way. Prakash Mehra, with a popular hit like Samaadhi behind him was starting his own production. He had bought a story idea from the duo of Salim-Jaaved. SJ had had a big hit (Sita Aur Gita) behind them & now they wanted an unknown hero so the credit of the success would not be shared with anyone else. The story idea, of an angst-ridden police inspector who wrecks his own revenge by going outside the system, was unusual. No big hero wanted to do it. It fell to Bachchan, who himself was not sure that he could carry it off, but was convinced by SJ to come onboard. 

Zanjeer, released on 11th May 1973, proved to be a huge success, but it did not overturn the hierarchies or popular tastes immediately. Notably, Rajesh Khanna had a bigger hit in Daag in 1973, a romantic melodrama, produced & directed by Yash Chopra. 

But Bachchan was on his way. He was no longer seen as a comical misfit.
