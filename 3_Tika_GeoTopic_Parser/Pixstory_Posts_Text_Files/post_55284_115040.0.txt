This past #EarthDay, The Indian Biodiversity Conservation Society in Jhansi-Uttar Pradesh, India planned a tree-hugging activity. The purpose, was to connect people back to the #Earth. Sadly, most people have lost their #connection to #nature and unfortunately, without it, people are less likely to protect it. 
How are you making an effort to become one with nature?
