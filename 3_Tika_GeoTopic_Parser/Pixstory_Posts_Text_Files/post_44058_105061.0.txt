Manchester United's David De Gea has never been one of Luis Enrique's favourites. Despite his fame, an incredible individual career and his shotstopping assets he's failed to be part of Enrique's plans for the past 18 months or so. Now, going into the Winter World Cup in Qatar De Gea has been left out of the Spanish squad altogether. 

Enrique has in the past been known for making such exclusions, owing to his footballing ideologies. He is a purist in every sense of word and De Gea's current error-prone profile does not suit the stability the Spanish set up demands ahead of a World Cup. The Spanish lineup is full of these unexpected Enrique favouritism-related decisions so much so that it isn't really unexpected anymore.

“I look to have three starting goalkeepers and I think that right now I have them. Honestly. I wouldn’t have an issue with any of the three of them starting," Enrique explained.

Enrique has preferred Athletic Bilbao keeper Unai Simon, who is experienced and matches the profile the team demands. De Gea meanwhile, is simply globally known as one of the best keepers of the current era for his miraculous prime at Manchester United a few season's in the past. More recently however, his career has been down a slippery slope.

“Unai has accumulated some interesting experience. A goalkeeper should start the play and generate the first superiority, they must dominate the aerial play," the 52-year-old added.

He concluded by saying “I need a goalkeeper that transmits peace and calmness to me - and that doesn’t mean they won’t make mistakes, errors are part of football. But what they generate I like a lot.”

Surely Enrique insists there's no partiality or favoritism involved here, but it isn't very difficult to see where his ideas have come from.
