UEFA new league has started this year to give more opportunities for more teams all over Europe. Leicester failed to qualify in the Europa League next round that's why they have to play the qualification for getting in the Conference league. 


They were drawn against Randers FC who finished 2nd in the Conference group D. Leicester on the other hand finished third in the Europa League Group C which led their demotion to the Conference League.


Leicester won the game with a scoreline of 4-1. It is the second win of the year in all competitions. Leicester is still without Vardy. The formation was 4-3-3 with Daka, Lookman and Barnes in the attack. Randers went with a 4-4-2 formation. Vito and Alhaji were the two strikers for the game.


Leicester had a dominating game. They had 65% possession in the whole game as well as a staggering 24 shots in the whole game. Randers had just 4 shots in the whole game. Ndidi scored the first goal of the game in the 23rd minute. Randers equalised in the first half only as Vito scored in the 45th minute.


In the second half, Leicester City went on a rampage and score 3 goals in a span of 25 minutes. Barnes, Daka and Hall were on the scoresheet for the three goals. Leicester City had 640 passes in the whole game with a 88% accuracy. Randers on the other hand just had 328 asses with a 70% posession.


Leicester City is the favourites to qualify for the next round. Randers need a minimum of three-goal in order to be in the competition. They also have to avoid conceding in the next fixture. Leicester on the other side should not be overconfident and lost the tie due to eros from their side.


Leicester City will be playing wolves on the weekend at the Moneullix stadium before ravelling to Denmark for the second leg of the Conference league. Randers FC will be facing Viborg before they meet the Premier League team for the second leg.
