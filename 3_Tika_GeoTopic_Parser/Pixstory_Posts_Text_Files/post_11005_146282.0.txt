A* gazed at the wall in silence, while a younger cousin spoke nervously, struggling to keep her emotions in check. A’s younger sister B, 28 years old, died on 27 June 2022, hours after setting herself ablaze. 
According to the upper middle class Hindu family, B was being pressured by her husband for dowry. A resident of Delhi’s Paschim Vihar, he owned a small restaurant in the national capital. 
“There was occasional domestic violence as well,” according to A. 
At the time of her death, B was pregnant. She had just broken the news to her family.  
“The day she died, my mother spoke to her in the morning and she mentioned her pregnancy,” said A, still coming to terms with the loss of his sister. “By evening, we were looking at her burnt body.”
India recorded more than 6,700 cases of dowry-related deaths in 2021. In 2019, the country reported more than 7,100 dowry deaths, a marginal decline, which, experts said, was not a particularly hopeful sign.
More than 18 women die every year in violence connected with the practice of seeking or giving dowry, outlawed more than six decades ago.  
Dowry involves the culture of the bride’s family giving durable goods, cash and property to the groom, his parents and his relatives, based on a condition laid down at the time of finalising the matrimonial alliance.

The law has been useful only to a limited extent.
