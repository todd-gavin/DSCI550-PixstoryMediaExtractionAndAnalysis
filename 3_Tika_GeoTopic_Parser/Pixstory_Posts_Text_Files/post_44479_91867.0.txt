Dele Alli's January signing to Everton was a 'waste of time,' according to Simon Jordan. 

The
25-year-old moved to Goodison Park in the hopes of reviving his career after a slump in form
and playing time at Tottenham, but things haven't gone as planned.

Since joining Merseyside, Alli has made six appearances, all in the Premier League, but has yet
to start a game and has yet to score or assist. The Toffees are just three points above the
relegation zone, with two games in hand on the teams behind them, including a must-win match
against Burnley in 19th position. Frank Lampard's faltering team will face Sean Dyche's Clarets
in a crucial match at Turf Moor on Wednesday, with both sides keen to take all three points in
order to stay in the Premier League.

On Monday's White and Jordan show, Jordan, Jim White, and Danny Murphy examined
Everton's chances of staying up, with the three questioning what has led to the Toffees flirting
with relegation.

The lack of quality players recruited in the January window was one of the issues cited by the
hosts, and the talk then went to the recruitment of former Spurs sensation Dele Alli.

Lampard left the ex-MK Dons youngster out of his starting XI for the Toffees' 2-1 defeat to West
Ham on Sunday, prompting the Toffees coach to explain his decision.

“Dele has to train and show he’s in that way of thinking,” the former Chelsea manager said
following the team announcement. “Every time he comes on, he has to show he’s worthy of
starting a game.

“When the time is right and I feel he is there, he’ll help the team and he’ll do it.

When asked by White just what was going on with the midfielder, Jordan gave a typically brutal
and honest response.

“He’s been there for two months, he’s a complete and utter waste of time,” the former Crystal
Palace chairman said.

“He was a waste of time at Tottenham for two years, he’s been a waste of time being signed for
Everton. It was a waste of time signing.”
