Australia had its single-largest enrolling day in history. More than half of the 700,000 new AEC students were between the ages of 18 and 24. 

What does that mean, exactly? ABC News reported that Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers dubbed it a "democratic miracle." But what's perhaps more remarkable is how little those young, first-time voters have been mentioned on the campaign road thus far. 

Every day, our listeners at triple j Hack tell us what's most important to them when it comes to electing officials: climate change. 

But don't take it from those latte-sipping, festival-goers who listen to triple j: Climate change was named as the most significant concern by 38% of 18-29 year-olds, according to Vote Compass, which was higher than anything else.

Climate change was mostly absent from the first week of the campaign, but it did hit the news in the second. The Coalition attacked Labor's climate change programme this week, claiming it will cause electricity bills to skyrocket. 

For young people, whether or not the claim is true is irrelevant. When you ask a young person about climate change, they will not discuss the cost of power or the expense of reducing emissions. They'll inquire about the cost of inaction — as well as the cost of ignoring the subject.

Let’s see whether the concerns of the young generation will be addressed or not!
