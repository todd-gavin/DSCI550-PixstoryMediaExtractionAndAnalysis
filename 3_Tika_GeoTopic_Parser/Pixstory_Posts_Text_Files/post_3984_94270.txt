When we hear of Easter our mind is filled with is easter egg chocolates and celebration of the day with non veg foods as a part of breaking the days fast The Easter morning starts up with breakfast which is Appam and stew which is finger licking good And then comes the lunch and for that all the members in the family work together and with that unity we make the meal and the meal consists of all the non veg items like chicken fish beef and so on In the evening we usually enjoy the time together either by having a good long talk after so many months or we might have a night out This is usually how my Easter goes what about yours Also wishing all of you a wonderful Easter
