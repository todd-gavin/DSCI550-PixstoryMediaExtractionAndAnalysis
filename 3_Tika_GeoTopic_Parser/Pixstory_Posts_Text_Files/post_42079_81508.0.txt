Man's knowledge of his surroundings has risen dramatically in recent years. The environment and its conservation are inextricably linked to man's existence and well-being. The term "environment" refers to everything that surrounds us and our planet Earth. It refers to all external factors and conditions that have a direct impact on humans and other living things. In other words, our atmosphere and environment are made up of our biosphere and eco-system. These are necessary for the survival of life on the planet.



The Earth is special because of its life-giving and life-sustaining environment. There is no life on other planets such as Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn since there is no habitat. Only on our planet has life been possible due to a specific equilibrium of natural components such as air, water, earth, soil, and so on. Thus, we must take action to protet this unique beauty and preserve the only known place that gave birth to life.
