I've always been a lover of love. Although it may sound old-fashioned, I firmly believe that I have a soulmate out there and that we were all created in pairs. I also believe in monogamy. The desire I have to always advance myself and learn new things is largely motivated by the idea that I want to give my partner the finest that this planet has to offer. I believe it's critical to possess the qualities you aspire to have, thus I've changed for the better. I also want to settle down, start a family, and pass on a quiet, content existence. Despite the fact that I know it is impossible for me to live a life that is fully trouble-free and that I will always face challenges, if my partner shares a love that anchors with me, I will be content and at peace.
