In one of the busiest winter transfers in Serie A, Inter were one of the most active in the market, bolstering their ranks with quality additions as well as culling their squad by securing departures for a few. Let's have a look at their window in general.

Inter started things off by buying Atalanta utility man Robin Gosens on loan with an obligation to buy. Gosens is a quality addition considering that he can play anywhere across the left flank and is proficient in defence as well as attack, being part of a very talented Atalanta team. Inter also went ahead and signed striker Felipe Caicedo on a 6 month loan as an emergency cover after Joaquin Correa suffered a long term injury. Caicedo is familiar with current Inter coach Simone Inzaghi with his time in Lazio which was a key factor in his signature. Inter also went on to bolster their goalkeeping department by signing Ajax stopper Andre Onana on a free transfer. This is a massive deal with the Cameroonian considered to be one of the best young stoppers in the game and also creates competition for current goalie Handanovic.

As far as outgoings are concerned, Stefano Sensi had been loaned out to Sampdoria in a view to ressurect a career that has been wrecked by injuries. Talented attacker Martin Satriano has been loaned out to French club Brest.

All in all, this has been an excellent window for the Nerrazzurri considering the financial restrictions on the club and the fact that other teams equally spent to bolster their ranks. The new signings are all quality acquisitions which will go a long way to consolidate themselves in a season which they are performing above expectations by mounting a serious title challenge. Manager Inzaghi has got them playing as a unit and has acquired players who have a similar ethic. 

This is a very exciting time to be an Inter fan. Hopefully these new signings act as the catalyst for Inter to once again be crowned kings of Italy and successfully defend their title.
