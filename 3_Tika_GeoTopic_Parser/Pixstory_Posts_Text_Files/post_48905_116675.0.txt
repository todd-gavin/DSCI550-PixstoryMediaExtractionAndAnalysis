Absolutely agree with you! Cats can be protected and tamed without us caging them.

I believe we got to treat our animal companions like our children â€” and I think that's why people like to call themselves cat parents or dog parents. If you won't let your kid go out alone to an area, don't let your feline friend go there either. If you'd let your child go there, let your cat too. But at the same time, you'd take your child to the park, so it's just as much important to take your animal buddy out too. That's another thing if they don't like it though.

Keeping a cat in a harness is not for the faint hearted. Be ready to get scratched and bitten lol. But also, that comes with choosing to have a cat. If you don't want that, you shouldn't have a cat probably.

It's a good thing to train cats to not hunt either. For their health and your own. Like the main post of the thread said, the parasites can cause many kinds of diseases.

My point is, instead of forcing your cat to do or not do stuff like that, train them well!
