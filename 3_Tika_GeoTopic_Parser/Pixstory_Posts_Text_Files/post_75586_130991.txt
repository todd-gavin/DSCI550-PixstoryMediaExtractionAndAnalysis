Going into Monday s eagerly anticipated game both teams looked in desperate need of a win Of the two however it was Manchester United that had lost their first two games of the season conceding four to Brentford in their last game From the first whistle it was United who looked the side with confidence Their pressing high their tackles strong and their passes expansive You could level a few criticisms towards Liverpool over the last years under Jurgen Klopp but weakness was never one of them On Monday night Liverpool looked extremely weak Their midfield was barren held together by an out of position teenager an aging utility player and their club captain who looked ready to hide Their defence wasn t much better the renowned aura of Virgil Van Dijk letting him down as he was beaten repeatedly by United attacks Trent Alexander Arnold isn t best known for his defensive work but tonight he was schooled first by Anthony Elanga and then Marcus Rashford The Liverpool attack probably deserves some criticism of their own but they were almost completely isolated cut off by their own team Mohamed Salah got his goal but for the most part looked dejected and was well marshalled by United s new left back Tyrell Malacia Another new signing Lisandro Martinez looked to finally assert himself The Argentine was everywhere using his strength and intelligence to always be in the right place to block tackle and shield Erik Ten Hag must have been praying for something to go his way and it finally has This could finally be the boost his team needs to push on this season with the arrival of Casemiro undoubtedly a massive asset However perhaps the bigger takeaway is the potential crisis now surrounding Liverpool Just two points from their opening three games they now sit behind Manchester United and seven points behind leaders Arsenal Salvation in Klopp s side doesn t seem likely without the acquisition of a new midfielder which doesn t seem forthcoming
