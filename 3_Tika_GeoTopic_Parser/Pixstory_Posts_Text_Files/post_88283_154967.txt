as the festive season approaches everyone s spirits seem to be livening up The weather starts to become pleasant and gives a break from the scorching heat there s flowers and lights all around the city and the joy of sweets and gifting is spread all around I personally spend the week before Diwali enjoying the various festivities which surround it meeting family and friends and having the best time with them However while the festival brings about so much joy we need to remind ourselves of what s important Use this time to help those less privileged be mindful of other living creatures around you and lastly don t contribute to the pollution by bursting crackers Wishing everyone a great festive season ahead
