Amnesty International reports that at least nine Hazara men were massacred by the Taliban in August The organization also found evidence that people including a year old girl were killed in late August in Daikundi province The return of the Taliban to power means a retreat from the limited social gains that the Hazaras have made over the past twenty years The authors of the analysis say the apparent Taliban atrocities across Afghanistan could mean that the Hazaras may face imminent ethnic cleansing and that regional actors are unlikely to act to help the Hazaras While it was thought that Iran might support the Shiites in Afghanistan the country did not come to the aid of the Hazaras during the massacres and has not taken any serious action to support them since the Taliban took over Afghanistan The authors emphasize that the only hope for the Hazara people is for the international community to live up to its human rights commitments and to press the Taliban to ensure the rights and protection of the Hazaras
