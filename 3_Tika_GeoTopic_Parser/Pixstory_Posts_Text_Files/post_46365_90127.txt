If you re like us then you re completely and utterly obsessed with Netflix s Bridgerton Prepare for another social season Season two will focus on Daphne s older brother We left Anthony Bridgerton at the end of the first season at a bit of a crossroads so I m looking forward to jumping in and see how he fares in the marriage market In the second book The Viscount Who Loved Me Kate Sheffield is the older sister of the woman Anthony Jonathan Bailey is set to marry Edwina But when she decides Mr Bridgerton isn t good enough for her little sis it kicks off an enemies to lovers plot that readers love so it s not just about the glamour of the balls but also a deep delve into her heart You ll see a lot more of the yin to her yang I just love that she s such a complex character she s mischievous dedicated to the Crown dedicated to the gossip and the pomp and ceremony In the new season things will get even trickier Whistledown will continue to wreak havoc on the Ton without qualms She s morally excused herself from certain things to barefaced lie to her friend and make it okay but she also wants to impress Eloise Coughlan reflects and I think a lot of Whistledown is to impress Eloise My hope is that you re able to get beyond those things even if they are huge But when you are that age and they have been ride or die for that long you can imagine that it would be shattering How many of you are excited Comment below
