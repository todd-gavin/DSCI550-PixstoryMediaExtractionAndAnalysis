Not all deviations detract from a film s textual counterpart Because the strengths of print differ from those of film it s not surprising that some items are cut Because books are supposed to be read over several hours they can be much more comprehensive Movies have significantly less time to work with therefore each scene is more important Even yet in the right hands a film adaptation may capture the essence of a book on screen When you watch a film based on someone else s interpretation of a popular narrative you get a chance to think about other people s views and viewpoints It s always exciting to see how our favourite characters have morphed and to see if the director actor sees them the same way we do Adaptations can help a book reach a wider audience boosting the franchise s fan base beyond just those who enjoy the book Adaptations must be made to entertain the broader public in order to appeal to this larger audience Film adaptations from books sometimes also bring a fresh perspective as the filmmakers take certain creative liberties and add their own touches to the film And most importantly it gives people who d rather not read or maybe can t read a chance to experience the beauty of the story too There are many many reasons a person may not be able to read from no desire to do so to several conditions like dyslexia or other mental disability from illiteracy to not a good eye sight Those people get to see and know what that story is It is easy to not watch a movie at all if you don t want your reading experience ruined but to ask people to not make any adaptation because YOU don t want it is ignorant and selfish
