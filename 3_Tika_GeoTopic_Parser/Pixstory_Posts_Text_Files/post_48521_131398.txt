 Is any sick among you Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord And the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much James Get your sins off your chest and confess them if you want to be cured This is what the Epistle of James says in these lines With grave sins this should be to a priest before the Sacrament of Anointing You could confide smaller forgivable sins in a trustworthy friend and ask them to pray for you
