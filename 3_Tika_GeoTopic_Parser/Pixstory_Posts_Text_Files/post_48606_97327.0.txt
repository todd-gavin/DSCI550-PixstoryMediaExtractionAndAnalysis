Fat Joe, the New York Knicks superfan, feels that if he were on the coaching staff, he could help the team win 20 more games.

Fat Joe said on the "Certified Buckets" podcast:

"I'm going to tell you all the truth: They let me coach the Knicks and be an assistant coach on the Knicks, we would definitely win 20 more games. It's the lion in my eyes. It's like, I'm letting my crew know like, 'Yo, we got to go down.'"

After last season's 37-45 record, winning 20 more games appears to be an almost impossible improvement for the Knicks, but there is some merit to his claim.

"We lost about a good five to 10 games that we were up 20-something points this year. That's unacceptable, bro."

Bringing in a new coach, especially one who is a fan, may not necessarily solve the problem, but squandering several 20-point leads in a season is something that a winner's mentality can address.

Given his track record of success in both music and life, the rapper at least makes a case for having a winning mentality. It's debatable whether he'd make a difference for the Knicks.

"Hey, listen, they put a good team together," Fat Joe said. "I just don't know why we didn't go further, because I love the youth. I love our team. Do we need one? We need a certified bucket."
