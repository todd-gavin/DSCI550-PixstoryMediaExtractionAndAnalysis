Lionel Messi is reportedly set to be called up by Argentina for their forthcoming World Cup qualifying games.

Argentina face Venezuela and Ecuador, having already booked their place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The Argentinian superstar missed his nation's previous few games with manager Lionel Sculani citing his recovery from Covid-19 as the reason for his omission.

But journalist Gaston Edul has reported that the former Barcelona man is set to make a return to the Argentina squad.

Argentina will be looking to usurp rivals Brazil who sit atop the CONMEBOL Qualifiers table with four points separating the two sides.

The forward's PSG career has been up and down thus far, with him not wholly impressing in Ligue 1 with just 2 goals and 6 assists in 16 games for the club so far.

However, the forward was impressive for the Paris side as they thrashed Lille 5-1 with Messi a key player in the victory. He took his goal with great aplomb, placing a delightful chip over goalkeeper Ivo Grbic.

Argentina will be hoping this form continues as they venture towards the upcoming World Cup and with it the possibility of their star striker winning a much-coveted World Cup trophy.

Argentina's place in the 2022 World Cup is already sealed and so the question will arise as to whether Messi can help steer the nation to a first World Cup since 1978.
