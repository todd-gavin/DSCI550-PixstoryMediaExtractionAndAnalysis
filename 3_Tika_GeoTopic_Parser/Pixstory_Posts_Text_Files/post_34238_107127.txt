The match between Sweden and Norway was far from easy for Erling Haaland The new signing of Manchester City scored a double that allowed his side to seize the second victory in as many games in the group of League B of the Nations League but it was also protagonist of an all-out fight with the Swedish defender Alexander Milosevic The central defender under AIK played an aggressive game both physically and verbally. This was confirmed by Haaland himself at the end of the match. Milosevic called me a whore but I assure you that I&#39;m not Then he threatened to break my feet and a minute later I scored it was right so A thesis Milosevic wanted to disprove I&#39;ve never said it quite rude what he says because I don&#39;t speak Norwegian and he doesn&#39;t speak Swedish so I don&#39;t know how we should communicate I don&#39;t speak English on the pitch so it&#39;s very particular that I say things I haven&#39;t said Regardless of how it really went on the pitch there was no match Haaland scored two goals and after that of he looked for Milosevic and challenged him with the eyes In short, it was a challenge that was anything but trivial Photo credits SportBible
