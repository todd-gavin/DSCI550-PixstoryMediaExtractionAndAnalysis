Tweet culture could not be ignored easily Yes I said tweet culture because it developed slowly over time When Twitter was first introduced it didn t have any retweet hashtag or messages option It was just social media to post opinions and news The introduction of each and every option in a tweet had changed the course of its use developing into a tweet culture indeed a double edged sword This culture now is something that people put to use for positive as well as negative aspects If we take the example of the retweet option it is the reason why news spread so quickly on Twitter which is also a space for spreading misinformation fastly Hashtags are a great way of finding like minded souls but they re also indeed a pool for spammers It has become over time aggressive sans nuance and it motivates contrarianism via the dopamine friendly flow of likes retweets and high follower counts This is the tweet culture Typos can be ignored like we always did What about these other aspects Will people actually use edits to correct honest mistakes or will that sweet moment of virality prove too intoxicating to worry about honesty Will this option to post impulsively and edit later make people more aggressive Should we wait and see where this takes us forward
