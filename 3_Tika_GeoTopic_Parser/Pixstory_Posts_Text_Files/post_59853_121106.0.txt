BJP National President Jagat Prakash Nadda was present as the Bharatiya Janata Party Parliamentary Party meeting got underway on Tuesday morning at the Parliament Library Building. Rajnath Singh, Ashwini Vaishnaw, S. Jaishankar, Anurag Thakur, and Pralhad Joshi, all Union Ministers, were among those seen heading to the Parliament Library building for the meeting. The conference is being presided over by Rajnath Singh, and several BJP MPs are also in attendance.

Notably, both Houses of Parliament have postponed a number of sessions during the current monsoon session on a variety of problems, from price hike concerns to the arrest of Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. In the meantime, the Rajya Sabha will examine the topic of price increases today despite the opposition's persistent demands.

 The Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut was arrested, among other things, so the opposition Congress and other parties disrupted proceedings. The government will also introduce "The Family Courts (Amendment) Bill, 2022" for passing and consideration.

Additionally, the Lok Sabha removed the suspension of four Congress MPs on Monday in exchange for them not bringing placards into the house. On July 25, Manickam Tagore, Ramya Haridas, Jothimani, and TN Prathapan, Lok Sabha MPs, were suspended for the duration of the Monsoon Session for using placards and interrupting business in spite of Speaker Om Birla's warning. The Opposition party had expressed outrage and protested the decision, and the Congress responded that the Center was intimidating them.

MP Shashi Tharoor had added to this by saying that the government is obviously arrogant about its overwhelming majority and appears ignorant of the need to accommodate Opposition opinions. Additionally, Speaker Om Birla asked all parties to refrain from carrying placards to the Parliament on Monday.
