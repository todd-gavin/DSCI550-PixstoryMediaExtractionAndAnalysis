Have you ever heard of a story where a ship had a mutiny and all the mutineers found a deserted island to escape punishment. 
If you haven't you definitely need to visit the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island. It all happened when Acting Lieutenant led a mutiny against the Captain William Bligh and set them adrift in lifeboats in 1789. The remaining crew found for themselves Pitcairn Island whose existence was till then unknown to anyone else. What happened to Fletcher Christian is a story worth another post.
Most of the inhabitants are direct descendants of those aboard the HMS Bounty.
