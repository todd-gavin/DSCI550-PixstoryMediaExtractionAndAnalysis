One of my favourite Australian films, whether it's because of Leonardo DiCaprio's charisma or Baz Lurhmann's incredible directing work, is this one. 

As experts say, Baz has succeeded in transforming the classic book into an unforgettable visual experience with the help of visual effects, a modern music, and other modern touches.

It is a movie based on the same-titled 1925 book by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki, the movie was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann. Executive producer was Jay-Z. 

Moreover, it was a box office hit too! With a net production budget of $105 million, filming in Australia took place from September to December 2011. 

Therefore, safe to say, this Aussie gem excelled in all departments!
