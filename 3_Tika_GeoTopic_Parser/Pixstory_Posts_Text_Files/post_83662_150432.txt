Meeting your twin flame will not be a chance encounter but rather your souls will recognize one another You will know it by how you feel because you won t feel that way with anyone but them Everything feels different looks different is different The connection is so strong and intense it may even scare you but you will not be able to ignore it You come alive around them and the passion you experience is out of control almost to the brink of madness And it is the most you have ever felt You breathe differently now and every cell inside you is on fire and yet they bring you a kind of peace you have never known Your entire world is shaken and yet you are home N R Hart Twin Flame
