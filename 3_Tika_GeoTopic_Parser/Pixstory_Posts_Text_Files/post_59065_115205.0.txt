On Saturday, Vicky took to his Instagram account to share a video of his advertisement for male grooming brand. The video showed Vicky in a striped suit with a rose on its lapel. He was covering his face with a hat, which he removed towards the end of the video to reveal his beard, as a message said ‘officially a beardo.’ The actor captioned it, “This is just the beginning.”
