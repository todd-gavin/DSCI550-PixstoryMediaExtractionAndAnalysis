Radja Nainggolan told La Gazzetta dello Sport at length The Roma Inter and Cagliari midfielder spoke about his past in Italy and revealed some anecdotes from his coaches Spalletti once gave me a bottle on the head I played a lousy first half against Toro We were all looking at each other&#39;s boots without saying anything with our heads bowed then he comes to me and stuck Wake up a bit he said throwing me the water And laugh Spalletti a great motivator sees football differently than the others Dominate the play to then maybe see the results and notice that he won less than others I played the best year with him goals and second place with points April was the anniversary of the comeback Rome Barcelona Every time I see that match I catch one more detail We believed it I can&#39;t explain it but in the previous days there was a strange flame in Trigoria We were all convinced that we would make it except Manolas He is a pessimist by nature What we win But come on Kostas talked about it like this a very believer I don&#39;t know how many times a day he crosses himself but then I saw him rejoicing with that mad face Roma was the woman of my life and when such a great love ends you don&#39;t know if the next one will ever be like the previous one The story between me and the Giallorossi ended in painful way in Milan I never had the same flame that lit me in the Capital.
