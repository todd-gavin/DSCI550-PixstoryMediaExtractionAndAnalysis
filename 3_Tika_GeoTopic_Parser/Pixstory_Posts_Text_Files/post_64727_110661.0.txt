The current Champions league model is getting stripped apart and being replaced by a new Swiss Model which will start form the 2024-25 season.
 
So How will the Champions League change?

Firstly, the 32 team group stage will be replaced by a single 36 team league. Each team will play 10 games of which 5 will be home games and the other 5 will be away games. These fixtures will be decided by a seeding system which will rank clubs based on historic performances. 
After each team has played their 10 matches, the teams finishing in the top 8 of the League will automatically advance to the Knockout rounds while the teams placed between 9-25 will have to play playoffs to compete for the other 8 places to complete the Knockout rounds.
Andrea Agnelli the chairmen of the European football association has describes this new format as his ideal Champions league. He also believes that this will provide great opportunities for the teams participating. The Swiss model is a clever way to stage a competition with such a large number of clubs and those too being the clubs with the best reputation in Europe. This model would enable the competition to be played without sending out 16 teams after just 6 matches, these teams would be able to play an extra 4 matches now and it would also make the elite European teams play each other more often.


However, the way the extra 4 participants are chosen in the new model is very weird. The first spot would be taken by a League 1 club. The second spot would be awarded to a team that performed well in a recent champions league but would ordinarily be asked to progress through qualifying rounds. Here comes the weird part now, the other 2 remaining spots would be awarded to underperforming clubs that have best club coefficient which would be based on their performances in Europe in the last 5 seasons. These are the clubs with failed to qualify for the champions league and were placed in between the 5-7th positions
