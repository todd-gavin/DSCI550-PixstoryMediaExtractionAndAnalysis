Russia's state-run Channel One is a tightly-run television channel. It shows what the government wants. And the propaganda of Vladimir Putin has been running like a well-oiled machine. The word "war" is hardly being mentioned on the channel. In fact, the Russian war machine rolling into Ukraine has been called a "special military operation" with the state aim being to "demilitarise" and "denazify" the country.

The propaganda was running well, until the arrival of Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, on the screen. In fact, on Monday,  she burst onto the television screen in the middle of a live telecast of news with a placard and shouting, "Stop the war. No to war."

The sign she held read, "Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here." It was signed in English: "Russians against the war." ( https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/15/anti-war-protester-interrupts-russian-tv-news-show )

This instantly made international headlines and Marina Ovsyannikova became an international figure out of nowhere. Marina after being arrested, was produced in court on Tuesday, and she was fined $280 by a court and then let off. She will most probably lose her job too.

Her protest comes days after a Russian pilot condemned his country's war on Ukraine during a flight, calling for an to the war. He said: "The war in Ukraine is a crime. (https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/camel-kills-two-tennessee-farm-v0ea31a26) 

The unidentified pilot was flying for airline Pobeda, a subsidiary of Russian airline Aeroflot which recently suspended all its flights to the EU and the UK after the imposition of sanctions.

While social media in Russia has been tightly controlled, protests by citizens against the war in Ukraine have taken place, and these have been shared on various platforms. According to experts, Putin's propaganda is being blown to smithereens with all these incidents taking place. ( https://www.npr.org/2022/03/15/1086705796/russian-propaganda-war-in-ukraine )
