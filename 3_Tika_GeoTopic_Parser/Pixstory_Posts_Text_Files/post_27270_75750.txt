Paris and Schiaparelli inaugurated Haute Couture with a collection conceived in a brief pause of hope last April A fashion show at the Petit Palais which, as fashion often does, went beyond fashion itself to talk about our time and what will be The description in the words of its creator Daniel Roseberry We could begin to imagine that the collective nightmare was behind us or at least soon would be Yet now intertwined with that hope is a sense of loss The loss of people is the most heartbreaking But also the loss of certainty Ours loss of certainty the loss of a collective future There is also the pervasive sense of disorientation that we all feel that succession of red carpet appearances of awards even fashion presentations there is something about all of this that seems lackluster We are not exhausted by it all Fashion has insisted on its relevance yet I feel that even some of its protagonists are no longer convinced What does fashion mean what fashion has to say in an age where everything is in motion And as for this Maison what does surrealism mean when reality itself has been redefined While trying on the pieces in this collection I realized that what seemed exciting to me right now was something different something more restrained disciplined Suddenly the color felt wrong As did the volume I wanted to see if we could get the same type of drama and otherworldly glamor without relying on that system After two years of thinking about the surreal I found myself instead thinking about the empyrean The sky as a place to escape from the chaos of the planet but also the home of a mythical priestess at the same time goddess and alien who might actually walk among us I design to make people feel something I love fashion Not for celebrities not likes not reviews Rather because when done right when it has something to tell us it can help us feel the elusive Why it still has the power to move us
