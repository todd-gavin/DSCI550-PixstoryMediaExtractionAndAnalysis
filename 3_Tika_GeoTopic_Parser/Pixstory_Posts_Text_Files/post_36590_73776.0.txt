Six-time Grand Slam champion, 42-time tour winner, the first Indian woman to be the World No. 1 doubles player, Sania Mirza officially announced on Wednesday (January 19) that 2022 is going to be her last season on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour after her first-round defeat at the Australian Open in women's doubles. Mirza and her partner Nadiia Kichenok from Ukrainian, seeded 12th, faced a 4-6, 6-7 defeat to the unseeded Slovenian pair of Tamara Zidansek and Kaja Juvan in a clash that lasted an hour and 36 minutes. Also she added that it is getting tough for her to find the motivation every day to come out, and the energy is also not the same anymore.
