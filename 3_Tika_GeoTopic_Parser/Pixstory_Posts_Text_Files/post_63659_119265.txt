 After his success with The Gray Man Ryan Gosling has reportedly said that he is interested in starring as Ghost Rider with Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige saying that he is equally eager to cast him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Hey man If Ryan wants to be Ghost Rider Feige started to tell MTV News Josh Horowitz at San Diego Comic Con Gosling s unbelievable I d love to find a place for him in the MCU Well Marvel with its resources and Ryan Gosling as an actor can certainly do the character justice But do we need another Ghost Rider Probably If we are getting the likes of Moon Knight and Blade in the future then Ghost Rider would be a more than welcome addition to the MCU s ever growing roster of heroes How will Marvel handle it is another question altogether that has too many answers but bottom line it ll be either good or it will suck there is likely not going to be a middle ground for this particularly with Marvel s new direction in Phase with the overdose of comedy and stupid storylines Marvel s now also going strong with the whole mystical angle with the likes of Doctor Strange Blade and Moon Knight so the Devil s Bounty Hunter would be more than a perfect fit Ghost Rider last made a film appearance with s Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance starring Nicolas Cage While the movie was a good one it bore little resemblance to its predecessor and was really goofy overall Hopefully a new Marvel rendition could bring out those aspects of the rider of Hell that we have been wanting to see for a while
