If you are wondering what kind of a man BTS's V is then there is another person who is here to give you an insight to his personality. 

Back in November 2021, BTS members J-hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook drew a lot of attention when they attended Harry Styles' "Love On" concert in Los Angeles. There, V met Grammy award-winner Lizzo and her sister Vanessa Jefferson. 

Recently, in an interview Vanessa shared her experience after meeting V.

"I tugged at his shirt like Tae I am Lizzo's sister & then he said Hey! & was just so excited & hugged me. He then hugs Lizzo & she tells him I'm her sister & he says Yeah! & hugs me again. 

When we were taking a group picture V grabs me and pulls me in the picture. 

[..] He was saying some english words to me.. It was the cutest thing I had ever heard."
