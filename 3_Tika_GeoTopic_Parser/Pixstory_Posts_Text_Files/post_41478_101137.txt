The United States Soccer Federation achieved historic agreements to pay its men s and women s teams equally making it the first national governing body in the sport to do so It was reported on Wednesday the federation signed separate collective bargaining agreements with both national teams unions that will run until December bringing a conclusion to years of often bitter discussions The players have been playing under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement that expired in December The women s CBA expired at the end of March but negotiations proceeded after the federation and players agreed to resolve a gender discrimination case filed by certain players in The agreement was conditional on the federation securing labour agreements that equalised salaries and bonuses for both teams I feel a lot of pride for the girls who are going to see this growing up and recognize their value rather than having to fight for it However my dad always told me that you don t get rewarded for doing what you re supposed to do and paying men and women equally is what you re supposed to do U S forward Margaret Purce said So I m not giving out any gold stars but I m grateful for this accomplishment and for all the people who came together to make it so
