Black History Month is being celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country. Given the new awakening about the importance of the same in the light of the Black Lives Matter campaign, people are doing their part to bring attention to the history of black people and start a revolution against racism. 

In this fight against racial prejudice education plays a key role. Since most of the racist behaviour is learned and not inherent, it is important to teach our children in early age about racism and how to identify call it out. 

Unfortunately, a school in Indianapolis got it all wrong. WTHR reported that according to the school district, students were told they could draw a picture showing different ways of life in northern and southern states back in the 1800s. But the Clarks said their daughter's teacher took it a step further, telling students to only draw a Black person picking cotton and a white person working with machinery.

"Our children said that she specifically said Black people picking cotton," Ramond said. 

Feeling offended by the assignment, their daughter was among several students who refused to complete the project. She sent her parents pictures of drawings made by other students in class. 
"I'm glad they stood up for what they believed in," Cindy added.

The intentions of the school administration may be right but they went about it in a wrong way. 
This also again emphasises the need for sensitisation in education. The way children are taught history needs to be changed and the adults who have grown up seeing racism normalised need to un-learn it. 

Then, and only then, the Black Lives Matter movement will be a success.
