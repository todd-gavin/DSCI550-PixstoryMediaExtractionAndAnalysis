I’ve seen it firsthand. An argument begins online, sparked by a slight disagreement over something- say, the gender wage gap. The argument quickly grows heated. Personal comments are made. And instead of logging off, or saying ‘let’s agree to disagree’ (like one presumably would in real life), one person types out ‘d*e you ***********.’

There are no rules online. Everything is fair game. Your kids. Your parents. Your appearance. People can share photos of you to huge, nasty anonymous forums (think the now-defunct 4chan), and spend hours criticising the proportions of your body. People can email your employer, or publish your address and phone number online (a practice known as doxxing). There’s no limit to how inventive people can be with their harassment, and there are no victims too young to be deemed off-limits. (According to a 2021 survey by the Cyberbullying Research Center, almost one in four U.S. students ages 13 to 17 said they had been bullied online in the last month, up from about 17% in 2019. ) 

When I was high-school age, we didn’t have smartphones. We didn’t have Facebook, or Instagram, or TikTok or Snapchat. I was part of that lucky pre-smartphone generation. By the time we got Twitter and other social media, I had turned 18. I had already developed some sense of perspective, and I wasn’t quite so vulnerable to insults as a thirteen year old might be. People bullied me in high school, sure- but it was bog-standard bullying compared to the sheer viciousness and volume that a kid might get online in 2022. 

I often think of how lucky that made me. I wonder what would have happened if I hadn’t been so lucky, and what it would have done to my mental health to grow up being targeted online.
