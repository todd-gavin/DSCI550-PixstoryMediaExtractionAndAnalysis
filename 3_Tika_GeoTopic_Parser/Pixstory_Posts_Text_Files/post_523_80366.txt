As a young Kashmiri without internet google search and all the technology that makes the World one unlike the world that children youngsters of today experience Hence our windows to outside world were our parents who either read some books or read world news in magazines that would come fortnightly to our homes There was also world service of BBC and voice of America which some news buffs like my father followed When you have a father who has a world view and is also a Muslim it is no surprise u hear about people who are their icons u do hear names of minority activists like Martin Luther King or his critic and contemporary Malcom X The name fascinated me I thought Malcom X was some Sherlock Holmes style detective or some film star But the real icon for my fathers generation was Mohammad Ali Born Cassius Marcellus Clay Ali was an American professional boxer activist entertainer poet and philanthropist Nicknamed The Greatest regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the th century and is frequently ranked as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time But why was he important in our childhood because he had made history by not only wining major titles but standing up for equality and dignity The fact that Ali converted to Islam for the same purpose was a pat on the back of every Muslim who was facing similar identity crises across the world As we were growing the political fabric back home was eroding corruption was at its peak jobs were dwindling and the unease had already set in It was obvious Ali was an ideal an icon People like him I feel are still relevant more so when blacks and minorities are again wanting to find their voice When majoritism seems to be flavour across the world When minorities are made to feel like second class citizens When inequality stares u across your face Ali and his message of racial integration is more relevant than ever before
