If you haven't already figured out what those vibrant colours are, let me give you a hint.

Flowers ðŸŒ»

You're looking at Bangalore's biggest flower market.

The sight is truly marvelous. For my photography assignment, while putting together a portfolio of pictures from around Bangalore, I had to capture KR market too. 

This place is always buzzing with activity and is home to many kinds of goods. It's especially vibrant during festivals. Many people's livelihood depend on this market and thousands of people visit everyday. 

You will find everything from flowers, to spices, and vegetables. Outside the market you'll find peddlars with all kinds of good including apparel. If you want to explore this place properly, then it would be a good idea to visit in the morning hours to get your hands on fresh vegetables, fruits and flowers.This is also a great place for photographers and writers or anyone seeking inspiration.

The pandemic and lockdowns have severely affected many of the livelihoods this market supports. Things have started to normalize but the fear of COVID still sticks around like a ticking bomb. However, on my last visit to this market, there were hardly any people following COVID-19 protocols or precautions. I love shopping fresh, but I'd still be wary visiting a place not following proper protocols. I do believe that even if people cannot be made to follow strict protocols, preventative measures to contain any outbreaks are extremely necessary in light of recent risings in COVID cases.

Do you like shopping from farmer's markets or big grocery shops? If so, why? Has the pandemic affected your choice?
