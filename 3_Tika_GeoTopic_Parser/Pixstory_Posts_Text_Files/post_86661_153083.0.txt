Sometimes, we need simple, clean, clich√©d, loveable, not with twists movie. That's simple life we crave.
 Thiruchitrambalam is one such movie where we enjoyed the simplicity in every frame. D just nails it simple reactions. The way he reacts to Rashi when she offers a tip was a treat to watch. Bharathiraja sir with simple satires rocks every frame with great emotional connects. I love him always for his role in Pandiya Naadu. Prakashraj sir does his job Neatly... BUTTTT woowwww factor. Nithya Menan. She just takes your breath away. If Janu was a household name before, every youngster would love to have a SHOBANA in their life to shoulder on. She is simply wow. What an actress. The songs / BGM just drives alongside the movie instead of being speedbreakers. Every technician worked on this movie has to be applauded for their work.
 Thiruchitrambalam will leave you with joy & smile even after couple of days.... MUST WATCH...
