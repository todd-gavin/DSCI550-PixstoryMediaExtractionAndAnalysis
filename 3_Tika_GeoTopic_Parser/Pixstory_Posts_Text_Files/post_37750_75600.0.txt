“Trust is the first step to love.”- are the words of one the greatest hindi novelist. In my opinion he is not a novelist, he is the hero who wages war from status quo with his pen. He was one of the first authors to write about caste hierarchies and the plights of women and labourers prevalent in the Indian society of late 1880s.
