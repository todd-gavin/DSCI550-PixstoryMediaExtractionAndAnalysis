So good morning people... 
I like watching documentaries. Knowing things zoomed in is interesting. Today I watched this amazingly directed documentary film titled “The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes” on Netflix. This documentary analyzes the mystery surrounding the death of the movie icon Marilyn Monroe through once unheard interviews with her inner circle. 2022 American documentary film directed by Emma Cooper for Netflix. It's a 1 Hour 41 minutes long tape. 

One should know about Marilyn Monroe.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's sexual revolution.
