As soon as the PM was found guilty and pressure on him to resign increased new guidelines appears in the government. As per the new government guidelines, Ministers who break standard rules in a "minor" way will not be required to resign or face the sack.

It has been a convention that MPs should resign from the government for breaking the Ministerial Code in any way. In the new section of the code, the PM has been given the alternative of decreeing a lesser sanction. Labour has indicted Boris Johnson of "watering down" standards in public life.

The changes follow a review of the Ministerial Code by the advisory body the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which made a series of suggestions for reforms in a report. Doubts increases as Prime Minister Boris Johnson confronts an inquiry by a committee of MPs into whether he deceived Parliament about lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.

Ministers who mislead Parliament will still be expected to resign, with the code saying: "It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament. But there are 'buts'-"But for the first time, the code has introduced the idea of a "minor" breach and penalties "which the prime minister may decide to issue in a given case".

Possible sanctions under the new law for breaching the code could include a "public apology, remedial action, or removal of ministerial salary for a period".

This is issued by the government as so now to protect Boris Johnson. Minor breach or major he did deceive the confidence of people. He even deceived the confidence of his MPs. We see politics one breaks the laws-make another to protect themselves.
