The truth about the stock market is that anyone can succeed financially as long as they have a strong mentor and a foundational understanding of stock markets. However, everyone seeks returns of 50% to 100% in a very short period of time. Many people consider a 50% return on their investment in intraday trading. That cannot be done. Although it will take 3 years to get a degree and 4 years to complete an engineering degree, many in the stock market do not want to learn and do not even enjoy spending time and money to educate themselves about the stock markets. They seek out professionals for easy and quick money-making advice but end up paying exorbitant commissions. After losing their capital, they realise that the stock market does not operate in this manner.
If the professional personalities are able to generate such significant revenues, consider why they provide advice and make calls. Don't even trust anyone in the stock market, instead, understand first before making money.

Before entering the stock market, make sure that you understand that there is no shortcut and that the only way to succeed is to learn and conduct thorough analysis.
