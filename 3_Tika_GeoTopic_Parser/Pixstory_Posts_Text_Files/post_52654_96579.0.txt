In my opinion, London is the best place to enjoy vacations, whether you are traveling alone, with friends, family or kids. A place like London attracts all kinds of people and people of all ages. London has a feel of happiness and welcoming smiles from the people who make you feel like part of the city. Despite London's phenomenal growth as a powerful city, its rich culture and heritage remain intact. It is a hub for retail, fashion, IT, film and theatre, finance, et cetera, making it one of the busiest and most beautiful airports in the world.

Numerous tourist attractions and sight-seeing spots can be found there. Their style, architecture, and history are unique, awe-inspiring, and lovely. London is such a systematic city, and the signs throughout the city are self-explanatory and never leave you feeling lost. Tube maps are available at stations along the London Underground, popularly called tube stations. Tube travel is easy and inexpensive. Buses are also an option. Taking a black cab in London is the best way to experience the city, but they aren't the best way to travel, since they are very expensive. There is a hop on hop off bus that travels along London Attractions and major landmarks of the city. There are night tour buses too. Cycling is also an option for tourists.

It is unpredictable in London, and rain can occur at odd hours and even during off-seasons, but the spirit of Londoners and the way they make tourists feel at home make London the most happening city in the world to me.

London's nightlife is amazing. Both young and old enjoy it. Clubs are safe for women and the music is upbeat and trendy. Some clubs have dress codes. Most clubs don't allow stags. Two of my favorites are Ministry of Sound and Tiger Tiger.
