Neville Southall, a former Wales captain, has challenged Wayne Hennessey to aim for a record-breaking 150 caps for his country.

In Tuesday's friendly against the Czech Republic at the Cardiff City Stadium, Burnley goalkeeper Hennessey, 35, will become Wales' third male centurion.

With 92 caps, Southall held the record for Wales for many years.

Former Everton goalkeeper Southall, in a message to Hennessey, said: "Well done, mate, there is another 50 in the bank if you want to try."

Speaking to BBC Sport Wales, Southall added: "There is no point sitting here and saying 'I have 100' and finishing.

"You have to push on and get as many as you can because I know you can sit at home and have loads of memories. So, you may as well just crack on."

Hennessey will become the sixth player from Wales to reach the century mark. Gareth Bale scored his 101st goal in last Thursday's historic 2-1 World Cup play-off semi-final triumph against Austria, which he shared with fellow squad member Chris Gunter, who leads the way for men with 106.

Jess Fishlock, Loren Dykes, and Sophie Ingle, all from Wales, have also reached the century milestone.

Danny Ward has been favoured to Hennessey in previous years, but the Leicester goalkeeper is presently out with a knee injury. So, Hennessey, who was born in Bangor, returned to the starting lineup against Austria, marking his first competitive start for Wales since being injured against Bulgaria in October 2020.

"People don't understand how much incredible mental strength it takes to come from a situation like that," said Southall.

"If you are playing regularly from Championship down to League Two then it's a massive step for you anyway - mentally and physically, because it is played a lot differently.

"Wayne is used to training with great players every day, so that is a bonus for him, so his level will not drop in that sense, what you do miss is the sharpness of match stuff.
