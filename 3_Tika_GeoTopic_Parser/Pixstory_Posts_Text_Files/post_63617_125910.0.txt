 TerraGenesis: Operation Landfall, the much-awaited sequel to Tilting Point’s TerraGenesis: Space Settlers has just been released for iOS and Android. A space survival and city construction simulation, the game has players establish the human settlements on Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and other celestial bodies as humanity leaves Earth and attempts to explore the vastness of the solar system.

TerraGenesis: Operation Landfall combines in-depth building mechanics with an immersive and realistic simulation of space exploration. Players will be able to get up close and have personal interactions with the cities that they have built, with the freedom to view each individual facility and building. These same facilities that players choose and build impact the skills, healthiness and happiness of their city's residents, giving players complete control over the success of their new society.

Everything lies in the hands of the players, from recruiting settlers to discovering, collecting and managing all the planet’s hidden resources. Surviving on another planet is a daunting experience, with unpredictable dangers scattered throughout. Shuffling through problems, players will be forced to find solutions to random challenges in their city to survive in a test of intelligence and ingenuity.  The original game was an award-winning title that was downloaded over 28 million times and was a work of passion created by Alexander Winn.
