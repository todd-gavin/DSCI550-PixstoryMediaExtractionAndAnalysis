With the coming of Valentine’s Day, images of a chubby Cupid aiming his arrows of love at unwary humans’ hearts seem to be everywhere.

The Cupid that Americans see splashed across greeting cards and chocolate boxes began life as a Roman God of love and desire, based on his Greek counterpart, Eros. The word erotic is even drawn from his name.

What is less well known in the Western world is that Eros has a Hindu equivalent: Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love, desire and infatuation. Indeed, as a scholar of Indic traditions, I find that there are often parallels between the sacred stories of Hindu deities and those found in cultures around the world, particularly Indo-European ones.

The Hindu Cupid also shoots his arrows into hearts. Kamadeva, however, is not a chubby cherub, but a handsome youth who rides upon a large green parrot named Suka. His bow is made of sugarcane, its bowstring is made up of honeybees and his arrows are made of flowers. Indeed, this description can be found as early as the Rigveda, the most ancient of Hindu scriptures, which dates back at least 3,000 years.

All these elements symbolize the sweetness of love. They also evoke the springtime, when new life emerges into the world. Kamadeva’s parrot, Suka, also represents spring, as well as romantic love, as parrots are often observed living in pairs.

Kamadeva, also known as Madana, is accompanied by his partner, Rati, who is, appropriately, the goddess of love.
