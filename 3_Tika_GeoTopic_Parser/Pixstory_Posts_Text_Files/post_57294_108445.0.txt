Decreased need for sleep:
If you or a loved one is functioning well (with no signs of fatigue or cognitive impairment) on four to five hours of sleep for weeks on end—or significantly less than a previous sleep schedule—this could point to mania.
Racing thoughts and accelerated speech:
You can't catch your thoughts because they are rolling off the teleprompter screen in your brain too quickly to read—resulting in much babble that doesn't make sense to the person in front of you. Now compound the jumbled thoughts with a speech that is so accelerated that you appear to be on speed. Get the picture? That's a sign of mania.
Restlessness and agitation. 
Imagine someone sitting down at a restaurant for only two minutes before being agitated by something and needing to move. The following table is too loud. The waitress is too slow. His chair is too wobbly. Or he decides he isn't in the mood for Mexican. One red flag of bipolar mania is the inability to sit still and chill, i.e., a cranky, compassionate adult with the attention of a fly.
Other signs could be:
Overconfidence.
Impulsive and risky behaviour. 
Hopelessness. 
Withdrawal from family and friends and lack of interest in activities. 
Change in appetite and sleep.
