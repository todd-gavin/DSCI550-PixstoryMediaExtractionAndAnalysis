Giacomo Raspadori could be a Juventus signing in the summer That class interests the Juventus club is not a mystery so much so that last summer he had already tried to bring him to Turin to make him grow Attempt to be rejected by Sassuolo Almost a year later for Raspadori it would always be at the top of Juventus&#39; wishes and the player didn&#39;t hide his happiness What a pride their interest said in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport I can&#39;t deny that I&#39;m happy that my name is mentioned for a transfer to Juve or others big clubs My ambition to play at that level In black and white it could take over Dybala&#39;s legacy initially only as a position on the pitch and in the future it will be a source of pride to be associated with him and to think of me as his heir Paulo has impressive quality We have in common the taste and the tendency to tie the game He is very good behind the center forward and I am also very happy To bring him to Turin, Juventus will have to present an offer of millions of euros
