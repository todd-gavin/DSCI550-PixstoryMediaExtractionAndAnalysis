With almost of their population being vegetarian Indians have mastered the art of plant based cooking There s nothing you wouldn t find there and there s not much one needs to say about the vast cuisine of that land One of my favorite such dish is the Soya Chaap It s a popular north Indian delicacy a sort of mock meat Mouth wateringly delicious and very healthy too All of the necessary amino acids that our body requires are present in soy chaap making it a good source of protein Additionally it is a good source of iron and dietary fibre Soya chaap is also low in fat and cholesterol making it a healthy option for those who love meat but don t want to consume all those calories with it And would you believe if I said it contains more protein than meat The most reliable sources of protein have traditionally been thought to be milk meat and eggs but plant based sources are equally as if not more protein rich Soya contains a substantial gm of protein per gm with pea protein at gm per gm and Mycoprotein protein derived from fungi at gm per gm which is still higher than the protein content of milk In comparison chicken meat milk and eggs contain gm gm gm and gm of protein per gm respectively With a protein content algae are a great source of protein as well
