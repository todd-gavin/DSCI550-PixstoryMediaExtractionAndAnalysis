Even though euthanasia or Mercy Killing is Iegal only in few states think the issue is very complicated Whatever it is life should not be taken Doctors have supposed to treat patients to assure life they should not be killers There are chances that some people can recover from a terminal illness and offering them the possibility of euthanasia may seem like doctors are giving up on their patients This is against public health in America We need to maximum assure that citizens are given proper and good medical attention and are not left with only hope to die We can give hope and assurance to the patience to live Palliative care is a good alternative to withstand with the patients after all life is important There are also instances where the law has caused trouble to marginalized or vulnerable communities and has caused involuntary euthanasia Admit the world isn t perfect This would promote illegal organ business that aim for human organs rather than life Euthanasia would even weaken society s concern about life and its worth Even if it s not what they want when a law is introduced the family is pressurized to submit to euthanasia If taking life was the only option then why do we go on researching cures and treatments for the terminally ill This would discourage the need for such discoveries and I really don t think doctors should be given the power or be promoted to take life
