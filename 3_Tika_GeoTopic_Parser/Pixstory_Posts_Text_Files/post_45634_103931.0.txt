Anne is a 23-year-old college student in France in 1963 when she falls pregnant. She doesn't want to be in this situation. She isn't ready to have a child. Abortion, on the other hand, is not allowed in the country and will not be for another 12 years. 

AP News says that In the new film " Happening," Anne is forced to discover a solution on her own, despite the fact that doing so puts her life and freedom in jeopardy. 

The film "Happening" is inspired by a genuine story. It belonged to Annie Ernaux, who wrote about her horrible experience in 2001 and released a book about it. Despite the fact that the treatment had been legal in France for over 25 years at the time, Ernaux's candid and honest memories of the unexpected pregnancy, solitude, anxiety, and determination struck a chord 40 years later.

With a renewed urgency over abortion access, the film adaption arrives in North American theatres on Friday. According to a report released Monday night, the United States Supreme Court is likely to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade judgement, which legalised abortion in the United States. Individual governments would be able to limit or outright ban the procedure under the leaked draught decision.
