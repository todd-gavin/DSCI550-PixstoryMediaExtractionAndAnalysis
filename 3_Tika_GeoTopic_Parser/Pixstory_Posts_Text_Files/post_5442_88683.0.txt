Kanye West's performance at the Grammy Awards, which will be hosted by comedian and The Daily Show presenter Trevor Noah, has apparently been cancelled owing to West's internet activity, according to reports. 

According to HipHopDx and other reports, West will no longer be invited to perform at the awards presentation, which is scheduled for April 3. 

West has recently made threats against others on social media, including comedian Pete Davidson, who is rumoured to be dating West's ex-wife, model, and businesswoman Kim Kardashian. West has also been squabbling with comedian D.L. Hughley and Noah.
