To answer this we need to delve more into the human psyche and how they discern a myth Myths are basically stories that are made on traditions Although some of them might have factual origins otherwise they are all fictional and concocted So to answer the initial question we know that the world we live in has a liking for fiction as much as they have for reality But this was not the only reason why myths were created They had a core aim of making people understand things they were sceptical about but never found the answers to There s always a profound meaning associated with myths that narrate different stories from how the world was created to who was the first living being Myths and archetypes answer some timeless questions that science cannot answer as well as set a narrative and explanation around the things that already exist in the world but need acknowledgement Like the myths of heroic tales how virtuous and honest people won the game and the one who chose to lie lost it But besides this unlike fairy tales its aim is not to create an ideal world but an honest one To let people know about the binaries that have always existed to torment people or make them happy Like in all bad there would be good if there exists a lie there would be a truth if there are angels there would definitely be evils So myths have a far more critical role in our world they are not mere stories or narratives without any meaning instead they have a lot to say
