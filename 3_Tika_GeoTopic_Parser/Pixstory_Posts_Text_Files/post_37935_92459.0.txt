As per the Sun, Cristiano Ronaldo is looking to leave Manchester United in the summer. The report states that the Portuguese striker could surprisingly be moving to Major League Soccer in the United States.

According to the report, Cristiano Ronaldo is being tipped to move to the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami side in the summer. The MLS team is owned by former Manchester United star David Beckham. 

Ronaldo's return to Old Trafford has not been as fulfilling as the 37-year-old had hoped for. Manchester United will end the season trophyless. This means that the Portuguese international would not win at least one trophy in a season for the first time in 12 years! 

Manchester United are currently seventh in the Premier League table. Hence they are in danger of missing out on Champions League football for next season. This has added fuel to the rumours of Ronaldo's exit from the club. 

On a personal front, Cristiano Ronaldo is the top scorer of Manchester United with 18 goals in all competitions this season. But the Portuguese striker's output has been quite low when compared to previous seasons.

The Iconic number seven had a goal-per-game ratio of 0.75 at Juventus and 1.02 at Real Madrid over the years. Meanwhile, his ratio for United since his return has been just 0.56. Cristiano Ronaldo has even expressed that he is not happy at the club on multiple occasions over the season.



Is a move to the MLS on the cards? 

Yes, A Manchester United exit is on the cards for Cristiano Ronaldo. But a move to the MLS with Inter Miami? We don't think so! With the FIFA World Cup 2022 in less than 8-months, it looks unlikely that Ronaldo would move out of Europe for now.

If Cristiano Ronaldo does decide to move, the most realistic option would be Paris Saint-Germain. The French club could be losing out on Kylian Mbappe. Hence signing Ronaldo would make sense as PSG are looking to achieve Champions League glory!
