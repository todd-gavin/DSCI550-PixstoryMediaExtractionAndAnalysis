Prakash Jha is one of the most renowned filmmakers in the film Industry and has given various Big Blockbuster. The filmmaker is a very outspoken and never hesitates to express his opinion. He has recently spoken on the current state of the Film Industry. He said, “'Bollywood superstars don't know where have they gone. Especially the content that is coming from the last 6 months and the way the audience is treating this content is not understandable. Bollyood Star Gutka Bechne me Busy he. They are  not making a film. If they get free time, they make a film by taking remake rights of a hit film. I can see that they are not making any difference to this situation. They are not thinking of anything to do better. Everyone's life is stuck in gutkha. They need to think about what can be done new and better. Otherwise whatever (audience) has made him a star, he will drown him too.” He Further added, “ Producers and content writers are also beginning to feel that due to big stars, they can make their films a hit. Film industry and the stars need to think seriously about this. They must think that the people who raised them so high will drown them. Speaking about with South and Bollywood debate the filmmaker further added, “Bollywood people are not doing any experiments with films. What are the people of Bollywood thinking and what are they thinking and writing content. Now they are serving content to the audience only through big stars and remakes, while that content is not. On the other hand, South people are coming up with good stories and doing new experiments, that is why their films are going on.”
