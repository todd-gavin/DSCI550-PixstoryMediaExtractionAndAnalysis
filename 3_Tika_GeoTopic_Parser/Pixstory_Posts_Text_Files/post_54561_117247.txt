Midsummer is the time for forecasts of the size of this year s dead zones and algal blooms in major lakes and bays Will the Gulf of Mexico dead zone be the size of New Jersey or only as big as Connecticut Will Lake Erie s bloom blossom to a human health crisis or just devastate the coastal economy We are scientists who each have spent almost years figuring out what causes dead zones and what it will take to resuscitate them and reduce risks of toxic blooms of algae Researchers can forecast these phenomena quite well and have calculated the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution cuts needed to reduce them These targets are now written into formal government commitments to clean up Lake Erie the Gulf and the Chesapeake Bay Farmers and land owners nationwide received US billion to support conservation including practices designed to reduce water pollution from to and are scheduled to receive billion more between and But these efforts have fallen short mainly because controls on nutrient pollution from agriculture are weak and ineffective In our view there is no shortage of solutions to this problem What s needed is technological innovation and stronger political will Map showing a zone with low oxygen values along the Louisiana coast Problems return to Lake Erie State and federal agencies have known since the s that overloading lakes and bays with nutrients generates huge blooms of algae When the algae die and decompose they deplete oxygen in the water creating dead zones that can t support aquatic life But in each of these big three water bodies efforts to curb nutrient pollution have been slow and halting The U S Canada and cities around Lake Erie started working to reduce phosphorus pollution in the lake from domestic and industrial wastes in Water quality quickly improved dead zones shrank and harmful algal blooms became less frequent Read more
