I can totally relate to thisss mood swings are very common around the time of menstruation. We girls go through lots of emotions at the same time like from feeling irritable to angry, to crying your eyes out, you often have to deal with a rollercoaster of emotions in a short period of time. 
But our eating habits and our lifestyle can help to control mood swings as:
1. Eat well
2. Excercise 
3. Sleep atleast 8hours 
4. Manage your stress
