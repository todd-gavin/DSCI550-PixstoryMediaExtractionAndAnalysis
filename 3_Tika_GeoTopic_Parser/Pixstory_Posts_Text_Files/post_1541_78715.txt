At this point the likelihood of Simmons getting traded before the deadline continues to decrease As the Sixers keep their asking price sky high teams either don t have what it takes to land Simmons or they aren t willing to meet the price However though the odds of Ben Simmons getting traded before the deadline now may only be according to betting odds it seems the Sacramento Kings still have the highest statistical odds of being the team that trades for him assuming Morey comes down on his price According to NBA insiders there are two teams that seem to still be interested in pursuing Simmons since the Sacramento Kings announced they are officially dropping out of Simmons discussion The Hawks and the Timberwolves However the possibility of a trade actually happening with either of these teams seems very low Atlanta s big piece is Collins and he doesn t fit on the ers since they don t need a PF The Timberwolves aren t trading any of their stars to get Simmons which makes this option a non starter Simmons has already lost million by not playing this year and stands to lose approximately million if he sits out the remainder of the year Morey is playing the role of a tough negotiator and seems fine to let the trade deadline pass and wait for a better offers in the off season in the hopes of trading for James Harden
