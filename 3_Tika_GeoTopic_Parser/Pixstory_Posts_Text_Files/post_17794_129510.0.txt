Jonah Hill announced today that he will not be available to promote a documentary about mental health, nor any of his other upcoming projects.

Hill discovered that he has spent "nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks, which are exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events" while working on the Netflix film, titled Stutz after his personal therapist Dr. Phil Stutz. As a result, he intends to refrain from promoting the documentary "or any of my upcoming films while I take this critical step to protect myself."

It will be his second feature after 2018's Mid90s. The actor-director has retreated from the public eye since then.

Hill hopes to make it more normal for people to talk about their mental health issues. McKay: "I usually cringe at letters or statements like this but I understand that I am of the privileged few who can afford to take time off". In a 2021 story for GQ penned by McKay, Hill name-checked Stutz many times, opening up on how he started seeing his therapist in 2017 at the suggestion of Joaquin Phoenix, his friend and co-star in Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot.

He invented a set of visualization techniques that greatly changed my life. Filmmaker: "It's become very collapsed on itself, and I can't let him know it maybe isn't going to work because the film is about him". I don't want to give too much away, but it's become very collapsed on itself," Hill told McKay, who revealed that he used to see Stutz's partner, Barry Michels. 

Mental health is an ever-present topic in many industries. Actor Jonah Hill is the latest high-profile person to address the topic and his own struggles.
