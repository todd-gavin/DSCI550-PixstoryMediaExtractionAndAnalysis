There are some songs telling Romeo and Juliet's tragic love story like Dire Straits' ‘Romeo and Juliet’, some a punk retelling of them like Wipers' ‘Romeo’, or some that retells their story ending on a beautiful, happy note, like Taylor Swift's ‘Love Story’. Some songs, however, add just a little reference here and there of them in the lyrics in the form of a metaphor talking about the lovers the song is about. Because what's greater than being compared to the greatest lovers in history?

‘HERE IN HEAVEN’, SPARKS (1974)

"And I’m thinking…
Juliet you broke our little pact
Juliet, I’m never coming back"

‘ROMEO HAD JULIETTE’, LOU REED (1989)

And Juliette had her Romeo"

‘(DON’T FEAR) THE REAPER’ BLUE OYSTER CULT (1976)

"Valentine is done
Here but now they’re gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity, Romeo and Juliet
40, 000 men and women everyday, Like Romeo and Juliet"

"Our love’s gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet"

‘THE BOTTOM LINE’, BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE (1985)

"Romeo oh Romeo ya gotta have your say"

‘ROMEO’, DOLLY PARTON FT. BILLY RAY CYRUS (1993)

Get out here on the floor"

‘DESOLATION ROW’, BOB DYLAN (1965)

"And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning,
‘You belong to me I believe.’
And somebody says, ‘You’re in the wrong place, my friend
Then you had better leave.’ "

‘MYSTERY DANCE’, ELVIS COSTELLO (1977)

"Romeo was restless, he was ready to kill.
He jumped out the window cause he couldn’t sit still.
Juliet was waiting with a safety net.
He said “Don’t bury me cause I’m not dead yet”."
