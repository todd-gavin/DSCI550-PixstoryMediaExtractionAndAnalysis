Guidestones after the explosion have become a major source of conspiracies, the latest one being the Georgia prosecutor interpreted the apparent targeting of a mysterious monument with an explosive device as an "act of domestic terrorism".

“The destruction of a public building by explosive is inherently intended to influence the actions of the governing authority that owns the structure,” Parks White, the Northern Judicial Circuit district attorney, said in an email about the explosion of the Georgia Guidestones on Wednesday.

“The use of violence to sway or alter the behavior of any government agency is terrorism,” said White, whose office would handle a potential prosecution. 

The Elbert County Board of Commissioners is the site's governing authority, he said.
The agency published a new video Thursday showing what it characterized as an unknown person vacating the device at the site in northeastern Georgia. The explosion occurred around 4 a.m. Wednesday.

The agency said one of five massive granite slabs — which were inscribed with messages about protecting humanity — was destroyed in the explosion. The entire structure was destroyed after authorities inferred that the weakened monument was hazardous for investigators, the agency said. The agency described the probe as active and ongoing.
