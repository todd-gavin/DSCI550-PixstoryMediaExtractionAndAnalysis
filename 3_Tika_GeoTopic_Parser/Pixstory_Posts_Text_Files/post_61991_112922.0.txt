New Thor: Love and Thunder Trailer Features Shots of Thanos & Loki
Thor Love and Thunder Loki Thanos MCU
By Benny SteinJuly 01, 2022
Thor, set to make his return to the silver screen in the aptly titled Thor: Love and Thunder, has been a key part of the MCU for a long time. As such, the character has a long and full history, one dotted with tragedy, humor, and just about everything in between. Even as Thor faces possibly his toughest foe yet in the upcoming sequel, his troubled past, including his experience with characters like Loki and Thanos, will likely play a key role in the film.

Even though Loki hasn't been announced as appearing in Thor 4, the character could very well affect the film. Loki's death at the hands of the Mad Titan, Thanos, left a significant impact on Thor, motivating his need for revenge in Infinity War. However, Loki has oddly been ignored in recent reflections on Thor's past, making any kind of presence in the upcoming film less certain.

So it seems that the hopes of seeing Thor and Loki together again won't be fulfilled.
