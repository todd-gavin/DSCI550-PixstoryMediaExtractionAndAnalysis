On International #𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗗𝗮𝘆, let us embrace the essence of 𝐏𝐄𝐀𝐂𝐄 as defined by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, the apostle of peace: "Peace does not mean an absence of conflicts; differences will always be there. Peace means solving these differences through peaceful means; through dialogue, education, knowledge; and through humane ways," His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. #𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗗𝗮𝘆 #𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗗𝗮𝘆
