Asaduddin Owaisi increased his criticism of Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday after the Samajwadi Party lost its strongholds to the BJP in the byelections for Azamgarh and Rampur. The former chief minister had been unable to stop the BJP from winning the crucial UP state elections in February and March, despite emerging as the party's main rival. He had, however, emphasised the significant increase in the SP's assembly vote total.

"Akhilesh Yadav is incredibly haughty. From that seat, his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, served in the legislature. He was then elected. He doesn't even go there to explain to them why he decided not to run for office from that position." said Owaisi.

The results of the by-election in Uttar Pradesh demonstrate that the Samajwadi Party lacks the intellectual integrity necessary to overcome the BJP. Voting for such inept parties shouldn't be done by the minority group. Who is to blame for the BJP's victory? Who will they name as the B- or C-team?" he continued.

The reference to the "B-team" was probably intended to allude to Mayawati's comments, who has been critical of Akhilesh Yadav and others for calling her the BJP's "B-team" in light of her party's lacklustre results in the state elections.
