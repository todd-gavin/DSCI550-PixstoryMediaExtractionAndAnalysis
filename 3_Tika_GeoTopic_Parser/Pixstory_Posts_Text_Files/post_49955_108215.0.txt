Trump has denied the claims of the Jan 6 Committee that he tried to force former vice president Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 presidential election results on January 6 last year.

He responded after the House select committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol held its third public hearing, where Mr. Pence’s former White House Counsel Greg Jacob confirmed the pressure campaign the former vice president maintained at the hands of the president and his legal team.

But Mr. Trump pushed back on the allegations on his social media platform Truth Social. He said "Such LIES & MISREPRESENTATION by the Unselects, and absolutely nobody allowed to challenge what is being said", Mr. Trump posted. "As an example, I never asked V.P. Pence to 'overturn' the election (although Thomas Jefferson 'took' the Georgia votes), but that he send the votes back to the Legislatures so that they could determine if the irregularities and Fraud were as widespread and significant as they seemed."

This case needs to bring out the truth in the issue to understand how democracy can be manipulated by people in power.
