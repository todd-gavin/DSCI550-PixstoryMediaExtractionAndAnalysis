This acephobia if you will too is a socio economic occurrence due to coming out as ace being a largely secluding experience even within the community as is prevalent from recent discourse in fact it wasn t until that the term even entered the academic vocabulary A large variety of factors thus influence the obscurity regarding coming out as asexual with people not only actively refraining from using the term even if they associate themselves with it we know why but this is also ultimately affected by underrepresentation in the media but also how confining the label can often feel due to its long term implications as most of us even unconsciously do hope of finding a romantic partner or a variation of it simply because of how re inforced the idea of finding a whole is by society Even the concept of being a virgin almost synonymous to being the laughing stock is common evidence of how our life revolves around these norms The lack of awareness around it which also stems from lacklustre representation only makes the label as such feel extremely confining and can only be addressed through accurate representation derived from real experiences as it is one of the most tangible means to propel the much necessary de stigmatization of ace identities It s a vicious circle indeed how easy it becomes to be able to conventionalize a minority with the marginalised being unable to push back to their inherent nature of being a minority only to impel forward this nature of remaining a minority due to the stigmas that can be built around it
