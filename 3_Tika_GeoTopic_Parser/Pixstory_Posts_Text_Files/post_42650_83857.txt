I will if you allow me talk about my childhood in terms of periods There is so much to tell you that I am one of those fortunate ones to have been born in what is now a very contentious part of the world the Kashmir valley in terms of minds and the people thinking about it However luckily it does not surpass the impressions of the Kashmir valley being one of the most beautiful places on this Earth And these are credentials that don t come out of just me as a Kashmiri but you will find these written right from time immemorial The earliest writers such as Francois Bernier a French travel writer who accompanied Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb during his invasion said the same thing So obviously I do not think that at any point of time I will be accused of being biased Let me just start with the stories narrated by my mother who was Professor of Economics at the Women s College in Srinagar Her name Mohini and my father s name was Mohan Mohanlal Kaul and they were a beautiful couple My mother was one of the most beautiful women of her time Very graceful In fact she was so beautiful that it was a matter of insecurity for my father I am told He couldn t tolerate men looking at her She would sparkle in red or green and that was a matter of envy for many I am the eldest child and I have two sisters Malini two years younger to me and Manisha years younger to me I was basically born to a family which has originated out of that part of Kashmir which again probably has been in the news for all the wrong reasons and that is Pulwama I belong to a village called Chukur and my folks were the landlords of the area We used to grow and sell almonds but then at some point of time the almonds were no longer profitable Hence almond orchards were replaced by apple orchards My great grandfather was the sarpanch of the village To be continued
