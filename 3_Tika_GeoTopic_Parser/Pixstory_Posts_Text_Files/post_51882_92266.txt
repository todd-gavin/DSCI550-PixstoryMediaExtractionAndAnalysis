Climate change has affected Japan drastically The temperature and rainfall have increased rapidly in recent years resulting in increase in natural calamities in Japan which is also especially prone to natural disasters such as typhoons tsunamis and earthquakes and even volcano eruptions due to its location on the Pacific ring of fire also called the Circum Pacific Belt The Ring of Fire is a path along the Pacific Ocean which traces boundaries between several tectonic plates and is characterized by active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes caused by the amount of movement of tectonic plates in the area Along the Ring of Fire plates overlap at convergent boundaries plate that is underneath is pushed by the plate above which causes the rock to melt and form magma Such conditions give rise for increased volcanic activity in the region resulting in Japan having one tenth of the world s total active volcanoes also causing massive Tsunamis and earthquakes As Japan s climate changes and weather patterns are affected there is an increase in the likelihood of more intense and frequent extreme weather events Typhoons are a common occurrence in the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa around the end of summer accompanied with heavy rains wind and floods Japan is situated very close to the region of the warm waters of the Western Pacific where these typhoons originate A large portion of Japan s population and industrial output is located near coastlines and therefore highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change A symbolic example of climate change is the early flowering of the iconic cherry trees and late onset of the autumn season In Japan established its Strategic Energy Plan with goals set for to effectively decrease usage of non renewables In October PM Yoshihide Suga announced Japan s target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by The Cool Biz campaign was targeted at reducing energy use through the reduction of air conditioning use in government offices The country has taken several countermeasures against its frequent natural disasters like research and reinforcement of existing structures and construction projects emergency measures and recovery operations improvement of information and communication systems and increasing general public awareness
