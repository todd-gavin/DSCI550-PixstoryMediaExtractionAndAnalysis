“It was an out-of-the-world moment for both of us,” Advocate Amit Mishra told Article-14 in an interview after the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark judgement on 29 September, ruling that all women, irrespective of their marital status, have the right to abortion between 20-24 weeks, interpreting the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA), to include unmarried and single women whose pregnancy arise out of a consensual relationship.
Mishra was referring to the Supreme Court’s interim order two months earlier, permitting his client, a 25-year-old unmarried woman who was in a consensual relationship and wanted to terminate her pregnancy after her partner refused to get married, to get an abortion. 
The three-judge bench of the Supreme Court,  comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud, A S Bopanna and J B Pardiwala, also recognised that nonconsensual sex with her husband was rape and gave a woman the right to an abortion. 
Refusing interim relief to the 25-year-old woman in July, the Delhi High Court bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad ruled the MTPA did not cover unmarried women whose pregnancy arose from a consensual relationship. 
In the 29 September judgment, delivered on World Safe Abortion Day, the Supreme Court said the Delhi High Court took an “unduly restrictive view” of the MTPA. 
For Mishra, the judgment, hailed as a huge step forward for reproductive rights and personal autonomy for women in India, is a significant achievement. The 36-year-old, who completed his PhD from the Faculty of Law, University of Delhi, in 2016, has been practising as an independent lawyer in the Delhi courts for the past six years. 
Mishra, whose expertise lies in criminal law, business law and medico-legal cases, also represented a 16-year-old who sought the termination of her 18-week pregnancy that arose out of a consensual relationship. 
Government and private hospitals had said no to terminating the pregnancy until the matter was reported to the police under Section 19(1) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012.
