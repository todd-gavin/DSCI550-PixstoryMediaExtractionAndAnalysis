NASA's Perseverance rover has been a massive asset for the space agency as it has come up with brilliant pictures from Mars. The pictures have played a huge role in scientists determining the surroundings and terrains of the planet. 

Now, the Wion reported that the Mars Rover has spotted an extremely fascinating piece of debris in the shape of a ‘spaghetti’. The picture was captured by the front-facing hazard avoidance cameras on the rover, but the scientists were unable to determine the exact nature of the object. Most experts believe that it can be yet another debris from a previous NASA mission.

Last month, the rover took the picture of a shiny object which was found on the floor of Mars' Jezero Crater, but it turned out to be a piece of junk that actually originated from the Mars Rover itself.

"My team has spotted something unexpected: It's a piece of a thermal blanket that they think may have come from my descent stage, the rocket-powered jet pack that set me down on landing day back in 2021," Perseverance team members tweeted after the picture of the shiny object went viral.
