Abstract
Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a common complication of cystic fibrosis that is associated with worse outcomes and higher mortality rates. CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) modulators have shown favorable effects on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and nutrition status. However, data regarding effects of CFTR modulators on glycemic control among those with CFRD is lacking. In this retrospective study, CGM data was analyzed to determine effect of elexacaftortezacaftor- ivacaftor therapy (ETI), a CFTR modulator, on glucose control among patients with CFRD. No difference was seen in glucose patterns after 3- and 6- months of starting ETI.
