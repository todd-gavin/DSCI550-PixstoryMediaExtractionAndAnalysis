Although Australians are known for not taking themselves too seriously, this is not the case when it comes to sports. Australia is a sports lover's paradise, with major international events like the Australian Open tennis and the Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne, as well as local leagues like the AFL and the NRL, as well as the beloved summer of cricket and all the water sports that miles of golden coastline afford. 

Also, did you know that according to culture trip, despite the stereotype of Crocodile Dundee prowling the Outback, Australia is one of the world's most urbanised countries. Around 85 percent of the 25 million people live within 50 kilometres of the shore, including 10 million in Sydney and Melbourne, the two largest cities. Perhaps the temptation of Australia's 10,685 gleaming beaches is too much to bear.
