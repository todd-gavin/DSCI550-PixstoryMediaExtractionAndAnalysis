Anubhav s first reaction to the war was to suggest that Anna should get out of Kyiv he connected to another Indian person whose wife was in Ukraine and advised Anubhav Tell your fianc to just get out right now At the time Anna still felt that things would settle down in Kyiv I can t just leave my house and everything The war has to stop you know this is probably temporary Anna had responded But the situation escalated and Anna and her mother who was visiting from Mexico had to shift to bunkers while the city was ablaze with sirens In the coming days Anna decided she would try to get out but couldn t access a way to her house was too far away from the train station and there were no taxis On the fourth day she decided I m going to get out even if I have to go by foot This time Anubhav was hesitant about the safer option the attacks on Kyiv were becoming more dangerous with news outlets reporting about civilian deaths This is the worst time to leave Maybe you should stay a few more days and let Kyiv calm down a little bit he recalls telling Anna But Anna was confident about making a move I m gonna leave now and I ll see you in India however I do she told Anubhav Thankfully they were able to find a taxi and Anna s mother and Bao took a rescue train to Kamyanka village in Cherkasy region where Anna s grandmother stays A couple hours later Anna got onto a train towards Lviv The worst thing that I experienced was to put my mom and a dog to a train not knowing if they will reach the destination safe or if I ever see them again letting them go and myself going into the unknown Anna says I think our relationships became stronger after this whole thing as we realized that can t lose each other literally Up Next My heart was in my mouth
