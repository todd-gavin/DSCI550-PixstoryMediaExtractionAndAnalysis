Being a pet parent is much common now when compared to a decade before. Having a pet not only keeps us engaged but it also enhances our mental health. 

Pets help our mental health in many ways: 

• Being around with pets increase our physical activities. Dog owners are most likely to take their pets out every day for a run. This is a fun way to exercise into one's routine. 

• A companion who is close by who gives us a sense of security and someone who is there with us always to share the day with. 

• The companionship of a pet can reduce anxiety. It eases the anxiety one faces. 

• Pets are great listeners they offer unconditional love and won't criticise you. This helps in boosting one's self confidence especially when one feels isolated. 

• Pet owners have a great chance of associating with other pet owners as they will be much interested to discuss about their pets and will also meet many pet related people in the pet shops and so on. 

• Sets a routine for one which helps you to stay focused and grounded. 

Pets also help those with specific conditions. People who have ADHD will be able to benefit from a structure and routine that a pet needs. Children who get hyperactive with ADHD gets a great way to release their excess energy by being around the pet. 

Autistic people can also benefit from having a pet. The pets give unconditional relationship that helps one to build on their social skills and confidence. They can provide a sense of calmness and reassurance when the owner feels overwhelmed.
