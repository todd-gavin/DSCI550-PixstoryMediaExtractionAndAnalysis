For those unfamiliar with this term aate or aata means whole wheat flour and pinni is a Punjabi term used for sweets made in round shape Aate ki Pinni Hence Aate ki Pinni means round ball shaped sweets made of wheat flour ghee jaggery and dry nuts Always use good quality ghee Since the Punjabi pinnis are roasted in ghee therefore the flavor of pinnis depends on ghee Aate ki Pinni There is no other liquid in the recipe It s the ghee that binds these Punjabi pinnis As the ghee solidifies pinnis will become firm therefore I would recommend that do not cut back on the ghee The secret to perfect pinnis is to stir constantly and maintain the heat between medium low and low Roasting atta and semolina on a medium low flame will impart a sweet nutty flavor and that is what we are looking for in this Punjabi pinnis Use a heavy bottomed pan for making the pinnis There are fewer chances of flour semolina mixture in a heavy bottomed pan sticking to the bottom and getting burned But keep stirring that is an essential step Aate ki Pinni For a healthier version swap regular sugar with jaggery The taste will remain the same the only difference you will note is a darker shade of pinnis These pinnis make great gifts for the Lohri and Makar Sankranti festival season foodie punjabicuisine pinni
