When we are going through those breakdown days we need to avoid certain foods. 

Here are some of them and the reasons why you need to avoid them. 

Fruit Juice 

The fiber that's in the whole fruit fills you up and and decreases the way how your blood takes the energy. Without the fiber what we drink is just a nutritious sugar water drink which can hype you up and can being you down. This can leave you hungry and more angry and this won't help you in anxiety and depression. So eat your fruit and drink water when you are thirsty. 

Regular Soda 

The drink consists og blood spiking sugar of fruit juice with no nutrition. Sugar sweetened drinks like soda do have a direct link to depression. So when you crave for a pop, try seltzer water with some juice. It will give you a bubbly drink with much of the content you need. 

Toast 

If your toast is made from white bread then yes it is a no no during this period. Since its made from highly processed white flour it can turn your blood sugar high after you eat it. This can lead to energy spikes and this can be bad for anxiety and depression. You can have a toast but the one made with whole grain bread. 

Ketchup 

Tomatoes and sugar and its just not little but too much of sugar is a no. The light ketchup that have artificial sweeteners this could be linked to anxiety and depression. Instead of ketchup maybe try some home made salsaÂ
