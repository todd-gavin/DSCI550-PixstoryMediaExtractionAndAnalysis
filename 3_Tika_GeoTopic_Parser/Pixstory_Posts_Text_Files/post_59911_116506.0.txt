In 1989, terrorists supporting Kashmiri independence kidnapped Rubaiya Sayeed, the daughter of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, the then-home minister of India. In exchange for Sayeed's release, the kidnappers threaten the government free five militants who were members of  Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). To bring them out in a triumphant procession, thousands of young men gathered at Rajouri Kadal, but they immediately escaped to their hiding places.

Rubaiya was recently asked to come before the court so that her statement may be recorded. Rubaiya named Malik as the person who had threatened to move her out of the mini-bus when she was being kidnapped. Malik was present via video conference. She once more recognised him and the other three people based on the images that were provided by the prosecution.

The names of the other three people she recognised are Mohammad Zaman Mir, Mehraj-ud-Din Sheikh, and Manzoor Ahmed Sofi.

Malik, who was found guilty of funding case, is currently serving a life sentence in Delhi's Tihar prison.

Ten people, including Malik, were charged by the court with kidnapping last year. The remaining individuals, in addition to the four named by Rubaiya on Friday, are: Ali Mohammad Mir, Iqbal Ahmad Gandroo, Javed Ahmad Mir alias Nalka, Mohammad Rafiq Pahloo alias Nana Ji alias Saleem, Wajahat Bashir, and Showkat Ahmad Bakshi.
