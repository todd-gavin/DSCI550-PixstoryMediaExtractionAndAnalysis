Land pollution is as a result of numerous human induced activities. Agricultural activities use harmful pesticides and toxic fertilizers that pollute the soil. Industrialization and urbanization have led to deforestation which is a root cause of soil erosion and thus land pollution. The nuclear plants generate harmful radioactive waste that severely pollute the land. These activities lead to ground water poisoning, soil pollution and a decline in the human health.
