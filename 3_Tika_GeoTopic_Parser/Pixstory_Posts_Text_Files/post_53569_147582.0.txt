Industrial action by Nigeria’s university lecturers has entered its seventh month. The strike is one of the longest by academic staff in Africa’s most populous country.Strikes have plagued Nigeria’s university system for the better part of three decades, beginning in 1988. At the heart of the problem are longstanding disputes over arrears of unpaid salaries and repeated failed promises of the federal government to fund public universities.Nigeria’s first university, the University of Ibadan, was established in 1948, originally as a college of the University of London. There are now 217 universities: 106 public (49 federal, 57 state) and 111 private, according to the National Universities Commission.The public universities are funded by the government, taking less than 10% of the federal budget. The grant is based mostly on staff strength and number of students. The public universities also charge tuition fees, typically only a fraction of the full economic cost. Relying heavily on limited government funding, the universities have struggled to meet their costs or diversify their revenue streams.The problems facing Nigerian universities have worsened over the years. This is due to the rapid expansion of Nigeria’s youth population and the increased pressure for places in crowded institutions. As university education is widely perceived as a passport to social and economic mobility, demand and enrolment for university places have rapidly increased in the past decade.Nigeria’s lecturers’ strike raises fundamental questions about how Nigerian universities are run and funded. There’s no easy fix, but there are three fundamental areas that Nigeria needs to address.The first is government funding, which is currently well below the UN recommendation and needs to be increased. It should also be more transparent and better managed.Read more: https://theconversation.com/nigerias-universities-can-find-funds-and-produce-job-creators-heres-how-190155
