I have been seeing these pictures continuously for days and I have one question, why can't you do it now? There are hundreds of thousands of children if not more waiting for adoption, so many of them from parents that decided against abortion. Why are those babies not adopted?

In foster care, there are currently more than 400,000 kids in the United States. Foster care adoption is far less expensive than waiting for a newborn kid to be born and adopting it that way.

Saying those who are against abortion should adopt those children is an incorrect interpretation of what's happening, it's not a way to give home to the babies, it's a way of religious expansion. That is what Christian nationalists in the US want. Many of them have expressed their belief that they should reproduce more frequently than atheists in order to increase the number of Christians in the world. They desire a greater number of newborns to rear as servants or for their faith. This is where we need to take a look at the history of adoption by Christians. It's not as simple as it looks like.

Once again, none of this was about children getting homes, none of this was about babies getting to live â€“ all of it has always been about regulating the choices of people with uterus. This is a misogynistic tactic to take away our choices under the guise of niceness.
