Enter the Dragon Chinese Invasion of Tibet continues The problem of Tibet is very complicated It is intrinsically linked with many issues politics the nature of society law human rights religion culture the identity of a people the economy and the state of the natural environment Consequently acomprehensive approach must be adopted to resolve this problem that takes into account the benefits to all parties concerned rather than one party alone Therefore we have been firm in our commitment to a mutually beneficial policy the Middle Way approach and have made sincere and persistent efforts towards achieving this for many years Since my envoys have conducted six rounds of talks with concerned officials of the People s Republic of China These extensive discussions have helped to clear away some of their doubts and enabled us to explain our aspirations to them However on the fundamental issue there has been no concrete result at all And during the past few years Tibet has witnessed increased repression and brutality In spite of these unfortunate developments my stand and determination to pursue the Middle Way policy and to continue our dialogue with the Chinese government remains unchanged A major concern of the People s Republic of China is its lack of legitimacy in Tibet The principal way to lend weight to their position is for the Chinese government to pursue a policy that satisfies the Tibetan people and gains their confidence If we are able to achieve reconciliation by treading a path of mutual consent then as I have already stated many times I will make every effort to win the support of the Tibetan people To be continued
