Lionel Messi will make his comeback for Paris Saint-Germain against Stade de Reims on Sunday after fully recovering from COVID-19, coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Saturday.

The Argentine forward has not played this year after getting infected during the European winter break.

"He trained well during the week with the squad and I'm happy he's back with us," Pochettino told a news conference.

Pochettino added that French forward Kylian Mbappe would also be included in the squad after nursing a groin injury.

"I'm happy with the way it went. We'll see if he can start or not," the Argentine said.

PSG leads the Ligue 1 standings with 50 points from 21 games, 11 head of second-placed Nice.
