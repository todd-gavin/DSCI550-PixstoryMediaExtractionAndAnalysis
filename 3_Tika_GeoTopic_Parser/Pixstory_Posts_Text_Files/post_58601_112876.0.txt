People of Varanasi have one more reason to smile 😊 as they would be enjoying journey upon earth through 3.8 km long rope way from Varanasi Cantonment railway station to Gowdowlia crossing , close to Ganges. 

The project was envisaged due to technical problem in implementation of Metro project , owing to laying of centuries old under ground sewage system.

UP government has already given approval to the viability gap funding, its feasibility report, request for proposal (RFP) documents, draft concession document, etc. The 3.65 km project will start from Varanasi Cantt and go up to the Church Crossing via Sajan Tiraha
 and Rath Yatra. As per estimate, 80,000 passengers will use the ropeway per day.
The Chief Secretary of UP, Durga Prasad Mishra ordered the high district officials to work on project fast so that beginning of construction may take place in next two to three months. The cost of project is Rs 461 crore
