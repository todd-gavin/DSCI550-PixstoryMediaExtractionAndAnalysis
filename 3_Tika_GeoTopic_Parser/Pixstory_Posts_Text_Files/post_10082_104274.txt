Nooshe Joon located in Lajpat Nagar will sort you out Quite famous for its kebabs you should head here with your group if you re looking to try different kebab platters and a variety of pulao think Kabuli Uzbeki chicken and vegetarian Considering Iranian flavours you ll find food here that is not overpowering but will certainly burst with flavour as you take the first bite Their kebabs are tender and meaty and you have an option to try them as a part of the mezze platter with pita bread and a choice of dips Or if you are not a kebab fan which we don t think is possible you can try their main course we d recommend Mahicha Zafrani with rice or lamb chops with fire
