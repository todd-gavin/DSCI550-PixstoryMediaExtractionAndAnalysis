I can write a basic introduction for myself, talking about my college, my course but instead I feel like I can use this opportunity to give a more in depth idea of who I am and what I stand for I’m Niharika, a 19 year old college student who more often than not behaves like she’s 10 and 80 at the same time. I’m a direct but introverted individual, however I don’t shy away from standing up for what I believe in. I express myself through art, digital or paper. Every now and then you’d find me in a corner doodling a mandala or listening to music on my phone, lost in my own world While not exactly a “sporty” person, I enjoy watching most sports and even play badminton frequently.
