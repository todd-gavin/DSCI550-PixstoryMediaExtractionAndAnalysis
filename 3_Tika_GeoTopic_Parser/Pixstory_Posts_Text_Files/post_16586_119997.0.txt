In the pic, Farah was seen dressed in a purple coloured outfit with heavy embroidery and she appeared to be a drunk dulhan who was enjoying her sangeet ceremony to the fullest. She was seen shaking a leg with Priyanka Chopra and Rani Mukerji. Priyanka looked stunning in her red suit with golden embroidery while Rani also made a statement in her red outfit. Farah captioned the image as, “#flashbackfriday .. drunk dulhan dancing at her own sangeet with priyankachopra n #ranimukherjee.. ( btw had managed to lose my dupatta, necklace n hair extensions)..”❤️❤️🌹
