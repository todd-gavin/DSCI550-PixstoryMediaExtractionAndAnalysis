You have listened the words psychologist and psychiatrist , but how many time you could differentiate? And this difference is not actually clear to many people. So let's understand basic difference.

1. Psychiatrists treat mental issues through medications; Psychologists treat them with therapies

2. Psychiatrists primarily deal with mental disorders. For Psychologists, it is just one branch.

3.  Psychiatrists can prescribe medicine, Psychologists can not.

4.  Psychiatry requires a degree in Medicine. Psychology requires a UG & PG degree in Psychology.

5. Psychiatrists deal with complex psychological conditions; Psychologists deal more with behavioural and developmental issues.

Hope by reading this , you'll get to know and learn something.
