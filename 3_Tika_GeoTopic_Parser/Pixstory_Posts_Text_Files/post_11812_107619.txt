Parenting is hard I definitely do not claim to know how it is done I have heard of people being overwhelmed and tired and sometimes frustration leads to blurting out words and sentences more harmful than intended According to me Whatever parents say gives alot of impact on children Today I just want to share phrases which can be uttered by parents sometimes with the intention to hurt sometimes not Still all of these will surely damage the confidence and Self esteem to child Phrases Parents Should Never Say You should Be more like your sibling You will never ever succeed in life I really wish you d never been born at all Stop crying you are such a baby You should Be really ashamed of yourself You really cannot do anything right ever can you Do not show your emotions it makes you look weak You should be better than who you are now You were an accident and not really wanted Why are you always so overly dramatic You have to be perfect at all times I don t believe you or anything you say Every parent is human and not perfect Nevertheless it is also important to understand and realize the power behind words As children parents are their first reference to the world and internalize a lot of their parents words and actions Remember that words matter and can hurt Tell me your views in notes about parenting
