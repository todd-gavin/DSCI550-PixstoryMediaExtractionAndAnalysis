Marco Reus, captain of Borussia Dortmund, is once again in danger of missing a key tournament for Germany.
Reus, 33, was stretchered off during the first half of Dortmund's Ruhr derby against Schalke on Saturday with what appeared to be a significant ankle injury.
Reus was in tears after unnaturally twisting his right ankle in a duel for the ball with Schalke's Florian Flick. American Gio Reyna replaced Reus, while Flick was allowed to continue after knee surgery.
Flick's namesake, Germany coach Hansi Flick, had included Reus in his team for future international games against Hungary and England, and was banking on the offensive midfielder to be a crucial element of his World Cup squad.
The event begins on November 20 in Qatar. Germany plays Japan three days later in Doha, four days before facing Spain in Al Khor, where it also plays Costa Rica on December 1.
Throughout his career, Reus has been hampered by injuries at inconvenient moments. Also missed Germany's World Cup victory in 2014 due to an ankle injury incurred in a warm-up game, and he missed the 2016 European Championship due to a groyne injury. He was a member of Germany's unsuccessful World Cup defence in 2018, however he missed the next European Championship to rest after his season with Dortmund.
There was no immediate word from Dortmund on the seriousness of Reus’ injury. The player was still receiving treatment in the changing room before halftime and was due to be brought to a hospital.
Reus has 15 goals in 48 games for Germany
Will Rues be able to play this world cup ? What do you think ? Let me know in the notes...
Thankyou ⚽
