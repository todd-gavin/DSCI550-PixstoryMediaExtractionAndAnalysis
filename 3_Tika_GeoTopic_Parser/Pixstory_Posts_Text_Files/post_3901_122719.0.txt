I'm sure most of us have called some people as best friends at some point of time. We categorise the friendships we have unknowingly and call the group we are close to as best friends. 

Eventually we know that the terms to convey our friendship are just words and the true value lies in the relation we keep with our friends. 

So in reality does the term friend and best friend actually make any sense? 

Just sharing some thoughts on friendships, if you have any thoughts on friendship do share through the notes. 

Happy Friendship Day ❤️
