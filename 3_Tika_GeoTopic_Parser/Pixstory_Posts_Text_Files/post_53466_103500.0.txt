You may remember when TV channel BBC Three was made an online-only brand in 2016. The reason given at that time was that teenagers and young adults, the channel’s target audience, were now all streaming television online anyway.

The naysayers (including academics like myself) suggested that this was a bad move. And we were not exactly surprised when BBC Three came back as a linear TV channel earlier this year.

Now, the BBC has announced that it plans to move the children’s channel CBBC online. The BBC says this is largely to cut costs, but also because children and young teenagers are perceived to primarily watch YouTube and other streaming sites, which has impacted ratings for the channel. However, as the BBC Three move showed, shifting the channel online will have significant other costs.

CBBC, like BBC Three, has been important to the BBC’s overall national and international brand identity and reputation. It has produced and commissioned some outstanding content, including The Dumping Ground, Horrible Histories and the much-loved Blue Peter and Newsround.

It emerged as a channel in 2002 when the switch from analogue to digital broadcasting freed up space to deliver more channels on the same frequencies. And over the 20 years of its existence is has delivered programming specifically aimed at an audience of children up to the early teenage years.

Such an audience is always going to be small in comparison to the mainstream audiences of BBC One and BBC Two. As such, it looks, on the face of it, as not really financially viable.

In this context, the role of public service television is often mentioned. The BBC has a remit to cater to the whole nation and that includes a specific focus on children and teenagers.
