one of us is lying This is one of my favorite books I have ever read The story has a perfect mix of drama suspense mystery and romance and I haven t read anything quite like it I couldn t put this book down I was constantly on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next with the characters It shocked me when they finally figured out what actually happened to Simon because it was definitely not what I was expecting I can t wait to read the sequel One of Us is Next There were a lot of things in this book that I never saw coming but they added much more dimension and detail to each of the four main characters This book is definitely a must read if you love teen mystery drama Whether your invested in the mystery itself the relationships between the characters or your just looking for a good book there s something in this story that will keep anyone from putting this book down
