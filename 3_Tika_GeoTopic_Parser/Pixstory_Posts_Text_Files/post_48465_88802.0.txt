“One who understands can calculate the number of the beast, for it is a number that stands for a person. His number is six hundred and sixty-six” (Rev. 13:18).

One could question where all the fear of the ominous 666 stems from. First, the number is a concrete result of a numerical procedure that could only be reached by a careful reader—"one who understands." Second, it refers to a real person, a historical figure in particular.

According to the Book of Revelation, the number 666 is the mark of the beast. Those who value personal safety over fidelity to Christ take the mark of the beast in apocalyptic end times. Mankind's mark is the mark of the beast. It is diametrically opposed to Divine's plan of salvation.

Because the number seven in the Bible represented wholeness and completion, being labeled all a "666" was an insult, meaning that you fell short of being the real deal. Also, if you write the Greek form of Emperor Nero, the Roman emperor around the time of Revelation, in Hebrew, the letters, which can also have numeric values, "add up" to 666.

The mark of man is introduced by Jesus when he introduces a mark that is always six and never seven. It makes no difference how many times the number six is multiplied; it can never be seven. It will never be finished. It's never going to be divine. Mankind's mark is the mark of the beast. It is diametrically opposed to God's purpose of salvation. It is a works-based salvation. It is dominated by men. It is God-denying. As a result, the mark of the beast, "666," could be translated as "never God, never God, never God."
