Bino George's Kerala  clinched a thriller to emerge victorious in front of their home crowd.

Kerala beat West Bengal 5-4 in the penalty shootout to win the Santosh Trophy 2022 at the Manjeri Stadium in Malappuram, Kerala.

Dilip Orawn had handed the visitors the lead in the 97th minute but 'super-sub' Bibin Ajayan equalised in the 117th minute of the match to bring his side back in the game.

During the penalties, Kerala converted all their spot-kicks while West Bengal's Sajal Bag failed to convert his kick.

This was Kerala's seventh Santosh Trophy title. The last time they bagged the trophy was during the 2017/18 season when they defeated the same opponents in the penalty shootout at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.
