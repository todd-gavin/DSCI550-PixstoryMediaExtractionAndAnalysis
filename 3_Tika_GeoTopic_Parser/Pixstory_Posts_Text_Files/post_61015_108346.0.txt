Meet my dad: Surendrapal Singh
On this auspicious day, to want to give recognition to my dad. The person who helped me change my path in life. He has inspired me to be a better me. I am the person I am today because of him. 
Till grade 8th, I was an extremely introverted student. I didn't realize how I had so much to say but couldn't because of my stage fright.
My dad was the one who would see the spark in me and made me join a speaking club. That step changed my life forever in such a great way. I want to thank my dad for directly and indirectly supporting me. He has inspired me to get out of my comfort zone, prove my worth and make my family proud. 
Thank you, Dad for everything.
