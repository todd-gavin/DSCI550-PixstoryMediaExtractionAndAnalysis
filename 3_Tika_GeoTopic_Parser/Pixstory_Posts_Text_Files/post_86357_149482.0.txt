I am Himanshi Verma, a girl who can be seen as a butterfly in her own world. I am a coffee aficionado and also suffer from obsessive caffeine disorder. You will always find me expressing my ardent love for food. In normal life, I am just in charge of the music (I was born with earphones built in my ears). In professional life, I am surviving solely off of maladaptive daydreaming. My work life experience is summed up by these words: procrastination & precision. My hobbies include sleeping, cooking, and reading fiction (my genre includes mystery and romance). I love skygazing; pretty skies and the moon light up my mood and fill up my gallery. One thing I like about myself is my energy towards social work and causes. I love to volunteer for social needs and NGOs. On the other hand, one thing that I dislike about myself are my mood swings ( mainly mood tsunamis). My daily life is all about having an existential crisis and a main character moment at the same time.
