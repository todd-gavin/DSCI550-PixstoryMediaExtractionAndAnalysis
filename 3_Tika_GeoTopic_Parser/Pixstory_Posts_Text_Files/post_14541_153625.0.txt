Research from 2015 supports the idea that earlier exposure to peanuts, for example, may lower the risk of developing a peanut allergy later on.
This is what parents can do-
👉Try first rubbing a very small amount of an allergenic food on your child’s lips to observe any signs of reaction.
👉If all looks good, add around a quarter teaspoon of the allergenic food to your baby’s usual puree and mix well.
👉Over time, increase the amount of the allergenic food (by another quarter teaspoon) if you don’t observe an allergic reaction.
👉Don’t rub foods into your baby’s skin. It doesn’t help with identifying allergies and it might actually increase the risk of your baby developing an allergy to that particular food.
