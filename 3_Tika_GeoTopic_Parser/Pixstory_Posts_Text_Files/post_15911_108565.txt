Introduction The nuclear factor erythroid NF E related factor Nrf and Kelch ECH associated protein Keap signaling pathway is known as the guardian of lifespan as they play a vital role in cellular defense and survival mechanisms which help in the prevention of a wide range of diseases including cancer Phytochemical mediated bidirectional modulation of Nrf Collaterally the endogenous and exogenous Nrf regulatory factors that influence the incidence and progression of cancer have been better deciphered and managed To prevent oxidative stress inflammation mediated carcinogenesis activation of Nrf remains a useful approach whereas for cancer therapeutics and resistance reversal inhibition of Nrf inhibition is desirable Biochemical properties bioavailability and biotransformation of tea polyphenols Tea prepared from the dried leaves and buds of the plant Camellia sinensis is one of the most ancient medicinal beverages The major chemical constituents of green tea leaves are polyphenolic catechism Anticancer potential of tea phytochemicals by modulation of Nrf Tea polyphenols exhibit a wide variety of biological properties including antioxidant and chemopreventive effects The anticancer nature of tea lies in its canonical antioxidative behavior owing to the efficient ROS scavenging property of its active constituents This enables the tea flavonoids to directly bind with the carcinogens and neutralize them Challenges and prospects Tea a widely used beverage comprises numerous pharmacologically active polyphenols which have diverse health benefits It has been known that Nrf plays a crucial role in the oxidative stress signaling pathway Tea polyphenols have always been novel molecules for treating oxidative stress related disorders especially cancer The structure function relationship of different bioactive tea components is not distinctly established and very often they show overlapping action Conclusion A chronic multifactorial disease such as cancer requires continuous attention starting from prevention to finally therapy In this context a detailed study on the composition and efficacy of different tea types in preventing or curing cancer should be of prime relevance Reactive oxidative byproducts play a dual role in carcinogenesis and anti carcinogenesis The broad chemopreventive potential of tea phytochemicals lies in their two inherent properties namely reduction of the Sources
