Do you Ever Feel like ?? Naah ! today is Not my day ! Naah ! I don't want to do anything today ! We all get stuck in a rut sometimes . Maybe you woke up on the wrong side of the bed or you are simply overwhelmed by the stressors of everyday life . Feeling a little down from time to time is normal 😩

if you ask me - Day like these just call for a little extra dose of self-care . ❤️

Whenever i feel Low , There are several mood boosting activities i always do ! Lemme share Those activities with you ;

1 Make a happy meal -
Certain foods rich in the “happy hormone” called serotonin may help us experience more joy , and even better sleep . Some of these foods include tomatoes , walnuts , pineapples , plums , kiwi or bananas . Try adding them to your meals or make a colorful , cheerful smoothie . 

2 Learn a language -
Have you always dreamed of being able to speak another language ? There are so many good resources out there to help get you started , many of which are free .

3 Read a feel-good book -
There’s nothing like getting lost in a good story . Grab one off your shelf , pick a cozy spot near natural light and get to reading . 

4 Take on a challenge -
Challenges are a fun way to motivate yourself and interact with others . Maybe it’s a workout challenge or a dance-off with friends . Whatever it is , don’t be afraid of a little challenge !

5 Phone a friend -
Give them a ring . Hearing their voice and listening to their laughter will do you some good .

6 Dance like nobody is watching -
Speaking of dropping those shoulders , try putting on your favorite tunes and dancing it out . Nothing puts a smile on my face like a good song and dance .

Ladies , Just Chill out and do these activities ! ❤️
