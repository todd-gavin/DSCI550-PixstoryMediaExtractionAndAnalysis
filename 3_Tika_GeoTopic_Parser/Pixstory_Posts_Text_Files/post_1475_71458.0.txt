Took the bake bread in pandemic trend too far.

Delusion stage 1: Started out with Jaffa oranges that I bought with enthu and put in the forget fruit basket (banana is the only fruit I eat 😬).

DS stage 2: attempted to modify a wonderful Nigella Lawson clementine cake recipe with these oranges. Working with almond flour also ✔️

DS stage 3: bought cupcake cases cos what does Nigella know, Imma make cute orange cupcakes, not cake. Obv flop, #epicfail yada yada yada

DS stage 4: presenting blueberry yogurt ripe banana granola orange crumble, the healthy delight you didn't know you needed.
(Everything but orange crumble is store bought and I have no caloric info.)

P.S. pandemic, please stop. Yours, a tired homecook.
