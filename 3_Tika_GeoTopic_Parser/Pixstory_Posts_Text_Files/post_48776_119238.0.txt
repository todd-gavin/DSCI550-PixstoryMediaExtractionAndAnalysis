Men need to be feminists. If they are not, then the world will keep spinning on its axis, and we will never be able to make any progress in our lives. Men cannot sit back and do nothing when they have the privilege to help.

Men need to recognize that patriarchy is a form of oppression and inequality. They cannot just ignore this fact, because if they do, then they are going to be living in a society where half of the population is oppressed and exploited, which is not an ideal society at all.

They need to understand that there are many reasons why women have less power than men. For example, since patriarchy is built on unequal power relationships between men and women, most of them are caused by cultural traditions or norms which perpetuate patriarchal values and beliefs. Men often don't even realize that they're being sexist until someone tells them so!

They all really need to recognize that one of the main reasons why women have less power than men is because some men believe that they can treat women however they want without consequences; however this attitude also perpetuates oppression as it makes it seem like there's nothing wrong with treating women like sex objects or disposable objects. Women are subjected to all kinds of abuse at the hands of men only because of that power imbalance.

In all of them, how some men call themselves "nice guys" is beyond me. A nice guy does not turn a blind eye to oppression, remember that. And if you don't, them use the word â€” Feminist.
