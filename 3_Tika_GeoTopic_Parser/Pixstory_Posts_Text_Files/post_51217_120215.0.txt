1.Drink Matcha Tea For a Glowing Complexion-

Matcha is as prevalent in Tokyo as coffee and soda combined in the U.S. Matcha has anti-inflammatory properties, meaning it can help curb the redness associated with acne and can help improve our overall body health, which can be reflected in our skin.

2.Take Probiotics For Gut and Skin Health-

We have natural bacterial flora that help boost our immune systems and help minimize bad bacteria. When we throw off this sensitive balance, Probiotics can help rebalance the skin and bacteria internally, but it’s important to also adhere to a good topical regimen, and diet, to decrease the disruption of the good bacterial flora and pH as well. 

3. Make Hydrating Lotions a Staple In Your Beauty Routine-

A lotion is a product with a liquid, watery texture that you pat on your skin with your hands after cleansing to deliver deep, intense moisture that feels lightweight and non–pore-clogging on the skin. It's as important to the Japanese routine as moisturizer is to us; in fact, some Japanese women use a lotion and an oil without any moisturizer at all.

Gels differ from creams and lotions on their reduced oil content. Gels are lightweight and absorb quickly into the skin, making them an ideal choice for sunscreen for those with acne-prone skin, or for use in hotter, more humid climates and during the summer

5. Use Makeup to Complement Your Skin (Not Hide It!)-

flawless" skin in Japan doesn't mean a thick coating of full-coverage foundation: It all starts with a clear, hydrated complexion underneath—achieved with the products and lifestyle habits I've already mentioned—matched with a foundation that conceals and evens out just what's needed while still looking like natural human skin.
