Biases and stereotypes will always exist for women no matter how hard we try to bring equality and eradicate them.
Your views are just a bundle of those stereotypical notions that have been questioned and criticised many times.

Firstly, women being competitive is not always a negative point as you're trying to portray. Rather interestingly, the competitiveness would make them the best managers as it will compel them to work hard and harder for their company.
The sense of competitiveness you're talking about can exist not just in women but in men too. Also, it could be the personal nature of some people, but not all women who make good managers.
So your idea contradicts itself and doesn't need any other validation.

Another thing is that there are behaviours that both women and men will show, but unfortunately, the world would always follow their misconceptions about women.
When a man is being empathetic, they're considered to show concern, but surprisingly for women, it will come out as people saying they're too emotional or sentimental.
Thirdly, cognitive skills and forming of the brain come in equal portions for both men and women, the history is filled with examples that would assert how women's cognitive skills made them great leaders and fighters. So there's no such thing that men have strong cognitive skills.

Above all, no matter how long a list would go that can enumerate the positive points of women being great leaders and managers, stereotypes will always remain that will not end as long as humanity exists.
