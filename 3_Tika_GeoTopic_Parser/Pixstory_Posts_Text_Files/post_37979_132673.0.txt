Nicolas Pepe has completed a loan move away to Nice for the 2022/23 season. The winger was quite unsettled in the English capital and hence a return to France should help rebuild his career before he decides on the next steps.
Arsenal themselves confirmed the loan move on their website. The Gunners' website confirmed that the former Lille player would be playing for Nice until the end of the current season. 
Pepe joined Arsenal from Lille at the start of the 2021/22 season. The Frenchman has scored 27 goals in 111 appearances for the Gunners in all competitions since then. Though Pepe is the most expensive transfer signing in the clubs' history, the forward failed to establish himself.
With the rise of Bukayo Saka, Nicolas Pepe was relegated to more of a substitute under Mikel Arteta in the past seasons. The Ivory Coast star helped Arsenal in winning the 2020 FA Cup title against Chelsea. 
Internationally, Nicolas Pepe has been a regular in the Ivory Coast national team since making his debut in 2016, being a part of his countryâ€™s squad at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017, 2019, and 2021. He has made 34 appearances for Ivory Coast, scoring nine goals. Hence it has to be seen if the winger can rediscover his touch with Nice this season.
