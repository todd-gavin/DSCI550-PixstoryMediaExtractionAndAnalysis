I was probably ten years old when I first came across the poem Daffodils by William Wordsworth Being so young I could not appreciate his art but as I grew up I realised why his poetry is important for any literature enthusiast Wordsworth was the first person to advocate for simplicity in poetry In an era where the art of poetry was dominant by flamboyant language and fancy diction Wordsworth gave us Lyrical Ballads In Lyrical Ballads he talked about the importance of spontaneous overflow of emotions which according to me defines poetry best Additionally by advocating that the language of poetry should be simple and essentially pastoral basically language of peasants he ensured that poetry is not restricted to the elite but is also accessible to the lower class too My favourite thing about his poetry is the ever present theme of nature Yes poems about wars and kings and mighty heroes are good but in my opinion nothing comes close to reading about a field of daffodils which automatically transfers me to the English countryside Therefore do yourself a favour and read any poem by Wordsworth I promise you will not regret it If you have read him please tell me about your favourite poem of his
