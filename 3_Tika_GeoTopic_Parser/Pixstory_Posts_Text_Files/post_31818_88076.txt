A study conducted by the National Institute of Molecular Genetics Ingm in collaboration with the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the National Research Council Cnr Igm found that the exosome extracellular vesicles of patients with mild forms of Covid allow a better functioning of the immune system than those present in patients with more severe cases Research published in Frontiers In Immunology has been shown that exosome extracellular vesicles contribute to the spread of viral infections but still little is known about their role in Covid pathology In a recent study carried out by researchers Elisa Pesce Nicola Manfrini and Chiara Cordiglieri of the National Institute of Molecular Genetics Ingm of Milan under the scientific guidance of Renata Grifantini in collaboration with Spartaco Santi of the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the National Research Council Cnr Igm of Bologna and published in Frontiers In Immunology comparative data on the exosomes recovered from the plasma of patients with moderate or severe form of Covid Only exosomes from patients with moderate form are able to efficiently regulate the responses of CD T lymphocytes with a consequent correct functioning of the immune system while those of patients with severe form of the disease are associated with an important acute and chronic inflammation explains Spartaco Santi of the Cnr Igm Using in parallel electron microscopy and super resolution microscopy Sted and Storm two techniques that have recently been developed to overcome the diffraction limit of optical microscopy and to increase by consequently the resolving power it was discovered that exosomes obtained from patients with moderate form of Covid have numerous fragments of the SARS CoV Spike protein on their entire surface These fragments could derive from an active phagocytic activity or from a transient viral infection The exosomes are therefore from consider peculiar indicators of the functional state of the patients&#39; immune cells which generally appear to be more performing in individuals with mild symptoms conclude the Ingm scientists These observations provide the basis for further insights into the involvement of exosomes with a preventive approach for the treatment of SARS CoV
