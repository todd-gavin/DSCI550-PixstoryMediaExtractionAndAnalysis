Because we re overwhelmed Because no one s listening Because our kids are about to get hurt Don t put your hand in there Because the mess keeps piling up and we re the only ones cleaning nonstop We yell as our arms charge up and down into the air We scream as our voice accelerates and our cheeks flush And then after we do we feel immense guilt defeated and like we want to break down into tears We don t want to get to that point We hate when it happens But it does more than we d like to admit Are all moms angry and that s why we yell No we don t wake up this way We find ourselves losing it because this parenting thing is hard We lose it because we have so much anxiety and no outlet We lose it because we re exhausted to the point where our brain is functioning at battery and we need more than a good night s sleep to recover We need a break because we re tired of doing everything of nobody listening of not being appreciated But just because we lose it doesn t make us bad parents We re just humans who care more than anything in this world about our children and the type of humans they ll become all while wanting to keep them safe that we get frustrated with them and mess up ourselves We don t want them to be brats So sometimes we yell We don t want them to hurt each other and if they do that to each other they must do that to other kids So sometimes we yell We care so much about them that we get run down from trying so hard all the time so of course we lose it And you re not alone in this constant battle of losing it and feeling bad Every single parent struggles because we re human and parenting s messy so we aren t going to stay calm every confrontation of the day So if this is you today give yourself grace apologize for losing it and try better next time You re still a good mom
