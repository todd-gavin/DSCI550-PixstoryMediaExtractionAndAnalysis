No way! Periods are totally normal and natural, there’s nothing to be ashamed of and there is no need to feel gross about it:

- Due to the patriarchal nature of society and lack of scientific advancement, period blood/menstrual blood was historically termed as impure. 
- In many societies, women were socially distanced and made to isolate themselves from their families, often in highly unhygienic conditions.
However, none of those practices are grounded in any scientific fact:

- Period blood is not an infectious agent and does not cause infections in itself
- What can cause infections is letting menstrual products like pads or tampons stay in for so long that the blood starts getting oxidised and attracting infections.
Periods should be celebrated and not spoken about in hushed tones since periods cause life to continue. The menstrual cycle consists of a delicate balance between multiple hormones, glands, and organs. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands control hormones which in turn control estrogen and progesterone levels. Estrogens and progesterone levels also vary along your menstrual cycle, reaching a high when ovulation occurs with progesterone levels then taking over and gradually ebbing with the onset of bleeding. If bleeding doesn’t occur and the egg released by the ovary is fertilised by meeting a sperm, then pregnancy can occur and thus life is continued.

Also, periods are part of what our bodies do to slow ageing and even reduce our risk of cardiovascular diseases. There’s no need for us to hide a tampon up our sleeve or have to whisper about needing a tampon. Talking about periods isn’t something out of the norm. The more we can talk about the funny or annoying or the awesome experience of periods, the fewer people will think they’re gross.
