The three years wait finally comes to an end. Kohli bagged his debut T20 Century against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup 2022.
The solid fruit of three years of hard work and perseverance come to an end.
122*(not out) off just 61 balls
Congratulations dear Kohli....
May the Cricket God showers you with more blessing to achieve more feet in the history of the cricketing universe.
