Welsh superstar Gareth Bale has recently moved to the MLS side LAFC and is enjoying the moment at the club.
The forward was having a difficult spell for the last few years and faced a lot of criticism.
During those 2-3 years of difficulties at Madrid, Bale only found happiness in the games for his national team.
But his move to MLS this season has made him fall in love with football again. He is feeling love for his new club.
Bale joined Los Angeles FC in July after his contract with Madrid expired. He is regularly featuring for the team in Major League Soccer. But he appears mostly as a substitute player to build his fitness after lack of game time in the final season in Spain.
Bale focuses on getting his fitness back before 21st November when his country will compete against the United States in its opening group game at Qatar World Cup 2022.
This will be a historical moment for both Bale and his country. Bale will feature for the first time in the World Cup whereas Welsh will reappear in the World Cup for the first time after 1958.
Bale has won 5 Champions League trophies for Real Madrid which is the greatest achievement in his career. And he also led Wales twice in Euros. Before Pogba joined Manchester United, Bale was the world’s most expensive player.
Despite being lined with several clubs across the world, Bale chose to move to L.A. to spend the final years of his career.
When he was asked about his time in California, Bale spoke: “They made me feel at home straight away. I’m getting good vibes from my team in the MLS and hopefully, that will give me more confidence playing for Wales.”
He also added: “It’s nice to be playing, nice to kind of just be in a place where I feel wanted and just enjoy myself now”. He also revealed his plans before going to World Cup as his current focus is on his club LAFC.
