Senior Tories have suggested that all MPs facing sexual misconduct investigations should have the whip discarded. Caroline Nokes, the chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, and Karen Bradley, the chair of the Procedure Committee, have written to Chris Heaton-Harris, the Tory Chief Whip, to urge action in the wake of Chris Pincher’s resignation.

They said that “recent incidents have demonstrated an inconsistent and unclear approach by the Party to instances of sexual misconduct” and warned that unless the circumstance is enhanced the Tories and the Government “are at risk of serious reputational damage”.

They said a new code of conduct should be urgently brought about to make clear “expectations of behavior” and in the meantime, there should be a “policy of zero tolerance on these issues”.

Mr. Pincher who allegedly got drunk and groped two men at a private members’ club in London resigned as deputy chief whip last. There are now rising calls for Mr. Pincher to lose the Tory whip. 

Whereas On Thursday, a Downing Street source according to BBC, said as things stood Mr. Pincher would face no further action from the party and would keep the whip, enabling him to continue to sit as a Conservative MP.

When those voted into power take advantage of the situation it makes the citizens fearful, hence resignation or suspension is needed until he is proven guilty or not.
