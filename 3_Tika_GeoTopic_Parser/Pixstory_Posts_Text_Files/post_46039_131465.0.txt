Kobe Bean Bryant, who was born in 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, would go on to become a rising star in the National Basketball League (NBA). Many people are unaware that Kobe was given that name when his father ordered the pricey Japanese steak after noticing it on the menu. 

Kobe Bryant plays four incredible years of high school basketball before deciding against attending college and joining the NBA. The Charlotte Hornets selected him in the draught, although that only persisted for 16 days. He was then signed by the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played basketball for the remainder of his 20-year career and won five championships.

In addition to his stellar career as a player for the National Basketball League, Kobe Bryant also represented the United States on the Olympic basketball team. He won two gold medals, in Beijing in 2008 and in London in 2012.
