The WSL match between Chelsea and Tottenham on Wednesday has been postponed due to Covid-19 cases in the Tottenham camp.

Chelsea were scheduled to play at Kingsmeadow on Wednesday evening, and a win would have moved them ahead of league leaders Arsenal.

This is the second time that this game has had to be rescheduled due to Covid-19, having been postponed in January due to a number of incidents in the Chelsea camp.

Tottenham will face Arsenal in the north London derby at the Emirates on Saturday.

"The decision was agreed between the Club and the FA after a number of positive tests for Covid-19 were returned within the squad," Tottenham said in a statement.

“We would like to apologise to everyone at Chelsea and to both their supporters and ours for any inconvenience caused.”

Chelsea has confirmed that a new date for the match will be announced soon, and that all existing tickets will be honoured.

Emma Hayes' side was looking to move to the top of the table after trailing Arsenal for the majority of the season. Arsenal is currently on European duty and will face Wolfsburg on Wednesday.

However, both teams announced the postponement a few hours before the game was scheduled to begin due to a string of positive Covid tests among the Tottenham players.

"Chelsea FC can confirm that tonight's match against Tottenham Hotspur Women will be rescheduled," Chelsea said in a statement.

"The decision was agreed between both teams and the FA after a number of positive tests for Covid-19 were returned within the Tottenham Hotspur team set-up after the last round of testing.

"A revised date for the match will be confirmed in due course. All existing tickets to remain valid."

The postponement also calls into question Saturday's north London derby. Tottenham will face local rivals Arsenal in a game that will be played at the Emirates Stadium for the first time.
