“Iron” Mike Tyson, 56, used to appear unbeatable in the ring, but he now seems sure that his time on Earth is running out.


Tyson discussed his own mortality as part of a bigger conversation on financial stability and the influence of money on happiness during an interview with his therapist Sean McFarland for the Hotboxin' With Mike Tyson podcast.

Tyson informed McFarland and fellow visitor DJ Whoo Kid that "we're all going to die one day, of course." Then, when I see those tiny dots on my face in the mirror, I think, "Wow. That means that my expiration date is almost approaching.

This is not Tyson's first important public reflection in recent months, nor is it the first time he has brought up his own impending demise.

Tyson disclosed he had used Sonoran desert toad venom 53 times for psychedelic purposes during a conference on psychedelics in Miami last fall, and claimed he "died" on his first trip from the drug.
