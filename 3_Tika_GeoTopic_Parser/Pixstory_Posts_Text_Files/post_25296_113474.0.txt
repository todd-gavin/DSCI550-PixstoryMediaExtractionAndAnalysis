there isn’t crack in this book there’s fucking heroin
My rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Ana put her whole thrussy into this one. this book was a thicc motherfucker but i read those 500+ pages like my life depending on it. i was addicted from cover to cover. it became unhealthy. i was losing control, sleep, and my fucking mind because i couldn’t get enough.

let me make one thing fucking clear. Jules? carried this entire book. i fucking love her. she’s so fiery it’s honestly inspiring. i had a lot of laugh out loud moments with this book and it was due to miss girl.

josh? ok i experienced a lot of emotions when it came to him. at times i wanted to fuck him and other times i wanted to beat him senseless. this book became one of those books in which i fell for the female lead harder.

i love josh and jules’ dynamic. they still had that fire even after that got together and i loved that shit. the josh and alex scenes were also so so cute like omfg the bromance 🥺

i gotta say, i felt like chapter 46 was no unbelievably unnecessary for this book. like the shit that happened in that chapter felt so out of pocket that it made me feel a lot differently about certain characters than i did in the beginning. that’s why this isn’t rated a full 5 stars. nonetheless i really enjoyed the book and story.

it feels like every book is getting better and better with this series like i can’t wait for twisted lies because the few scenes we did get with Christian already had this gorilla grip throwing punches. i NEED book 4 already! it has released but I'm just waiting for the hard copy
