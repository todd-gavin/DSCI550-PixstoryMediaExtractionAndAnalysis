Often people romanticise the notion of donating blood as a noble cause as you can save someone s life by doing it Even I had this thought when I went for donating the blood in the camp that was held in my college But when I enquire about it from the team of young doctors there they explained to me that donating blood is not used for a single patient but the red blood cells white blood cells and plasma can be used to treat many patients This explanation made me realise that the romanticization of blood donation has not too far away from reality Now feeling even more excited I went for the pre test to determine my blood group after that I had to wait for a couple of minutes as both the bed were occupied But finally the time came when I was about to give my blood for the first time in my life Dr Asked me to lie down in a semi sitting position and put a single in hand it hurt a little but I went with it the entire process just took half an hour but felt completely worth it I also got a don t card which will work across India for the case where I need blood for myself the card will ensure that I get it for free of cost Plus I also got a cool mug with blood doner written on it To sum it up blood donation might appear as scary for some people but at the end of the day it s worth it
