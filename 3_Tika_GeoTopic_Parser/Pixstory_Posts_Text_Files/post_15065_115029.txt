On the occasion of the Big Jump, the initiative organized by the European River Network which every year allows citizens to get closer to rivers, lakes and wetlands with a great symbolic dive Legambiente has focused the light on the now structural water crisis that grips the regions crossed by the river Po Activists of the environmental association together with the participants throughout Europe on Sunday afternoon at staged a flash mob to the motto of Sveglia The Po cannot die in Cremona sul Po in front of the Canottieri Bissolati While drought is a natural fact even if the level of The Po is dry, certainly not because rainfall has drastically stopped in this spring and summer, but also because the water that should arrive at the Po from the mountain basins is all intercepted for irrigation. In these days of great water shortage, only four emissaries of the large pre-Alpine lakes Ticino Adda Oglio and Mincio have a total flow rate which, at the outlet of the respective lake basins, is over mc sec of one third of the average figure for the period but in any case a quantity of water that would be able to give breath to the great river The water for it does not reach the Po because it is withdrawn along the way The Lombard farmers claim a priority in the use of water with respect to the protection of river outflows and river ecosystems, declares Barbara Meggetto, president of Legambiente Lombardia, but the heavy withdrawals, however insufficient for the needs of the countryside, mean that the lower course of the Po does not receive water from upstream the saline wedge penetrates inland this year up to km from the mouth and the agriculture of Polesine is on its knees The blanket has never been so short and the future holds great unknowns We need to come to terms with it and change both the irrigation techniques than crops because the river system of the Po Basin is in crisis and will be increasingly so if irrigation needs are not drastically reduced to adapt to climate change
