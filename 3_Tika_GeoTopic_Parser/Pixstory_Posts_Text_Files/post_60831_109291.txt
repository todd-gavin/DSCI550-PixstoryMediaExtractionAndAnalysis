I don t travel as often by trains but when I do I try to soak up every moment There s just something about train journeys that make me really happy Waiting at railway stations when the weather is hot and humid can be annoying Having to get on a crowded train can be irritating as well However if you set the annoyances aside you ll get to see that the station no matter how rural the area is is always buzzing with activity Having nothing else to do but wait for my train I sat and just observed the people around me I could make out some of the office goers going back home after their shifts parents trying to pacify their children and vendors trying to sell their goods It s interesting to see that what s a fun travel journey for me holds different meanings for different people For some it s a means to earn their daily bread and for some others it s a daily commute route What s your favourite way of travelling and why
