In life, we are faced with two issues, one is certainty, another is uncertainty. Certainty brings comfort because we know about everything that is going to happen in the next moment as everything is measured. 

It's the uncertainties on the other hand that call for action, which demands our intellect to jump into action with a creative impulse to come out of us. Uncertainty beckons our intelligence to act. As the world is an uncertain place things change fast and it can be difficult to see what's coming next but with the right approach, we can make things easier for ourselves and learn to be comfortable with uncertainty and be prepared for whatever the future holds. When we are uncertain or things are uncertain around us, there are two possibilities; First, it moves in the direction of fear which is a natural reaction to uncertainty. It might lead to the feeling of being out of control which can be challenging. Uncertainty also causes anxiety and stress which damage our health and cause us to get stuck in a vicious cycle. Exercise helps remove stress hormones from our body while meditation and mindfulness can help us relax and reduce anxiety when talking to someone we trust will help to find perspective, a shared problem is a problem halved one of the biggest causes of unhappiness and stress in uncertain times can compare how we think things should be with what they are. Second is the possibility of uncertainty if it can move in that direction of innovation. Every innovation has come out of not certainty but comes out of the demand of the time or the necessity of the time. It beckons us to think differently. So this time of uncertainty during the covid 19 we need to think. Even In India, there was plague during World Wartime. But after every one of those disasters, we have come back with full force.

Therefore, looking at these experiences gives us the confidence to dream about a better future.
