One of the greatest and most acclaimed filmmakers of all time, James Cameron, best known for films such as Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, Titanic etc is all geared up for the release of ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’. Sequel to the billion dollar 2009 film, the movie is set ten years after the events of the original with Jake Sully now having a family of his own, and must fight to keep them safe from a rising danger.

Speaking to Empire, the legendary filmmaker revealed his plans for the upcoming movies in the series, including the possibility that he may not direct Avatar 3 and 4. “The Avatar films themselves are kind of all-consuming,” Cameron said. “I’ve got some other things I’m developing as well that are exciting. I think eventually over time – I don’t know if that’s after three or after four – I’ll want to pass the baton to a director that I trust to take over, so I can go do some other stuff that I’m also interested in. Or maybe not. I don’t know.”

However, speaking enthusiastically about the future direction of the later movies, Cameron said “Everything I need to say about family, about sustainability, about climate, about the natural world, the themes that are important to me in real life and in my cinematic life, I can say on this canvas.” He added “I got more excited as I went along. Movie four is a corker. It’s a motherf****. I actually hope I get to make it. But it depends on market forces. Three is in the can so it’s coming out regardless. I really hope that we get to make four and five because it’s one big story, ultimately.”

The sci fi movie sees the return of Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao and Joel David Moore alongside new cast members such as Kate Winslet,  Michelle Yeoh, Edie Falco,  Oona Chaplin and Jermaine Clement.
