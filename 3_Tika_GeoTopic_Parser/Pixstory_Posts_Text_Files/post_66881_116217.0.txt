Pakistan cricket team captain came in support of Virat Kohli as he suffering from a bad form these days. 

Kohli is suffering from a prolonged bad form as he hasn't hit a century in last 3 years. After missing the first ODI against England with a groin injury, Kohli made just 16 in the second match, which India lost by 100 runs at Lord’s. It means the right-hander has now gone 77 consecutive international innings without reaching three figures, after scores of 1 and 11 in the T20I series and failures in the rescheduled fifth Test.

Pakistan's Captain Babar Azam extended his support to the former Indian captain. Babar wrote on his Twitter handle " This too shall pass. Stay strong." with a photo of both the champions on the field.
