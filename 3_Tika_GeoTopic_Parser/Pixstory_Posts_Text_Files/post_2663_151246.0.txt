Forward From a Friend:‘When I visited Mahatma Gandhi Museum in New Delhi a few years ago I was warmly welcomed by its Director, A Annamalai. Rajmohan Gandhi, Gandhi’s grandson had informed him that I was an ex doctor. The director removed a file from his cupboard and placed it in my hands . It was the original medical file of Bapuji. It contained many blood reports, letters written by doctors to Nehru and Patel , and three electric Cardiograms . I photographed them and started thinking about how I could use them to create a work of Art.!!
