The Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most disappointing seasons in franchise history in 2021-22 and as a result, they decided to part ways with head coach Frank Vogel.

The move came as a bit of a surprise considering Vogel had guided the Lakers to the franchise’s 17th championship just two seasons prior in the Orlando bubble.

There were a number of reasons why the Lakers missed the postseason despite having LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook but it ultimately was Vogel who took the fall.

In addition to the Lakers, the Charlotte Hornets are also searching for a new coach after firing James Borrego. It appears Vogel may have a chance at that job as Jake Fischer of Bleacher Report is reporting that he is among the candidates that have interviewed.

The Lakers have interviewed some of the same candidates as the Hornets with Milwaukee Bucks assistant Darvin Ham being among them.

Vogel is certainly a qualified enough candidate to get another opportunity as a championship-winning head coach. Reports have indicated that Ham may be the favorite in Charlotte though, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out with the Lakers also interested.
