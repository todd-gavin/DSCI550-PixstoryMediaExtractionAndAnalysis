A trip to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi has sparked substantial controversy inside the United States government and with the Chinese government The Taiwanese dollar plummeted as a result of the trip announcement and China issued a stern warning that such a trip would interfere in China s internal affairs and lead to a very serious situation and grave consequences Fortunately despite all of China s warnings U S authorities assessed that China was not actually prepared to eliminate one of the United States highest ranking government officials for a simple trip to Taiwan Taiwan deserves complete sovereignty from China China s repressive communist dictatorship has no place in a free society and any nation that wishes to be free of tyranny and communism should have the right to be free and that right should be defended by every nation that cherishes freedom With that being said we have reached a tipping point with China Their efforts to influence the culture of the United States and infiltrate our highest levels of government via deception surveillance and espionage are becoming increasingly evident There may not be a suitable moment for such a journey but in a country with an unyielding repressive regime like China there may never be a good time so a show of power may be necessary
