Nolan has used an unbelievable sleight of hand a magic machine with lights and sparks to distract the audience from a stupidly complex but ultimately practical solution to a magical problem but in the end the movie rejects such scrutiny with cutter and the film s conclusion stating you re looking for the secret but you won t find it because of course you re not really looking you don t really want to work it out you want to be fooled somatically at least cut is right it doesn t matter because the machine and the multiple duplicate murders perfectly serves the film s main theme that sacrifice must be made to create the perfect illusion whether it s Chung Ling soo pretended to be crippled for years that twin brothers board and each only being able to enjoy half a life or Angier stepping into the machine every night never knowing if it would be him or his double drowning in the depths below death following obsession While perfection is strung throughout the film with Angier s wife dying because of a better knot that s the act that sets the better knot that s the act that sets the first place now the ending divides a lot of people with some like the audience s in a magic show refusing to accept the simple and comforting idea that the fantastical is real They try to find a logical truth but when the curtain comes down after the ones and top hats have been put away the practicality of the film s ending is just plot the only thing you know for sure is that once again Nolan has used a high concept to smuggle a big ambitious question about humanity onto our screens The perfect deception is your legacy worth dying for a question of obsession that ultimately touches us all setting up the plot is just the pledge the boggling twist ending is just the turn something unbelievable made to distract you what the film makes you feel though the horror and respect for people with that insane passion to succeed that s the true Prestige
