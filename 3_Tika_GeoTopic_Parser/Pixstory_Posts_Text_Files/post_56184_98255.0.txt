A Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that the majority of Americans say the Supreme Court should uphold Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that solidified a constitutional right to abortion. 

The survey finds that 54 per cent of Americans think the 1973 Roe decision should be upheld while 28 per cent believe it should be overturned — a roughly 2-to-1 margin. The poll finds that 57 per cent of Americans oppose their state making abortions legal only in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, while a similar majority, 58 per cent, rejects limiting abortion to the first six weeks of pregnancy.

Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Texas and Wyoming have passed new abortion restrictions recently. The Post-ABC poll finds that 4 in 10 residents in these states are aware that recent abortion restrictions were passed in their state, but a majority said they were uninformed of new restrictions.

Americans overwhelmingly support permitting abortion in certain cases. Eighty-two per cent say abortion should be legal when the woman’s physical health is jeopardized, and 79 per cent say abortion should be legal when the pregnancy was affected by rape or incest. Meanwhile, 67 per cent say abortion should be legal when there is information about serious birth defects. 

Abortion is a right! Access to legal, professionally-performed abortions reduces maternal injury and death caused by unsafe, illegal abortions. Women who receive abortions are less likely to suffer mental health problems than women denied abortions. Abortion gives pregnant women the option to choose not to bring fetuses with serious abnormalities to full term. Women who are refuted to abortions are more likely to become unemployed, to be on public welfare, to be below the poverty line, and to become victims of domestic violence.
