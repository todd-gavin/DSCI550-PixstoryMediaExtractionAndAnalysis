Constitutional Adviser to Bikaner continues It appears that this intimation was sent to me in view of the approaches that had been made by the Maharaja of Bikaner to Sardar Patel and Lord Mountbatten for an extension of my months leave thus permitting me to serve in Bikaner after its expiry The Maharaja was very keen that I should continue in Bikaner for at least six months more but Sardar Patel did not like me to serve the State after the expiry of my leave in June On the th of May Sardar wrote the following letter to the Maharaja Thank you for your letter of the th May regarding the services of Mr Justice Mahajan The question primarily concerns the East Punjab Government It is rather awkward for a judge of a High Court to be away from duty so long in the service of another State It was with some difficulty and great deal of reluctance that the Punjab Government agreed to his going to Kashmir on the last occasion I am doubtful that they would take kindly to this suggestion now Moreover he was released for Kashmir for strategic and tactical reasons and therefore the ordinary rules and practices had to be set aside I am doubtful if in your case I could urge the same consideration I am sure you will appreciate my difficulties in sponsoring this proposal but of course if Mahajan can persuade the East Punjab Government to agree I shall have no objection Lord Mountbatten was a great friend of the Maharaja and through him he again approached Sardar Patel twice for my stay for few months more in Bikaner but Sardar Patel did not agree I informed the Maharaja that I would like to be relieved of my work by th June as I had to join the High Court at Simla by the th of that month Accordingly after I had finished my work on the tribunal I was released To be continued
