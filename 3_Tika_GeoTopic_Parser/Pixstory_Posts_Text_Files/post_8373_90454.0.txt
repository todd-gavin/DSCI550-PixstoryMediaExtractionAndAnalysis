Well, we just got our annual visitor to the garden. Thought of introducing it to all of you as the period between its flowering and its bloom enthrals everyone in our house!

So I present you here, the most awaited of the lot — "Amaryllis Lily" ❤🌷

The less I speak and the more I admire its beauty justifies its annual bloom 💟

But I'm sure looking at the elegance of this flower, y'all must be curious to know about its origin, nature and making it a part of your garden family. So here you go, fellas:

>Like daffodils or tulips, the amaryllis plant begins as a bulb. They are naturally a spring-blooming bulb, eliciting flowers at some point between late winter and mid-spring (Feb to Apr in the Northern Hemisphere).

What's in the name!?

However, there has been some confusion regarding the name of this plant. Most amaryllis varieties evolved today are crosses and are not “true amaryllis”; they are instead part of the genus Hippeastrum, which are native to tropical parts of South America, from Brazil into the Andes.

The true amaryllis—members of the genus Amaryllis—are local to South Africa and are a.k.a belladonna lilies (despite not being true lilies). That being said, both Hippeastrum and Amaryllis are part of the amaryllis clan, so they are all amaryllis in some sense!

The term “amaryllis” comes from the Greek word amarysso, which means “to sparkle.”


Fun Fact: Victorians attributed the amaryllis with strength and determination because of its size and sturdiness. 

I'm sure after learning about it, you'll be excited to have it at your place, so why wait? 

Go get it from your nearest nursery, it's time to plant it, except, a well-drained soil, not much maintenance is required, some repotting ( because generally, it won't be in the same pot again in the next season) and sweet, bright sunlight !!!
