During my visit in 2008, the small Shiva temple as noticed by the earlier visitors, was seen to be the largest temple on the site and perhaps the most well built. The earlier form of the temples has been dismantled and new constructions are in place. There are no means of visualizing the earlier form of the temples in absence of historical records. At present the earlier main temple was found to have been dismantled to form two rooms of the modern design, which house statues on the walls and on constructed platforms. The statues were found to have been plastered into the walls and covered with cloth as seen in the photographs below. The local priest informed about the theft of some statues from the site, about more than 20 years ago, after which the locals decided to plaster the statues into the walls for their protection. But it must be said that from the outside, the present structure does not at all look like a temple, and seems to have totally spoilt the antiquity of the place which could have been maintained had the earlier temple been restored to its original design. The elevated terrace as mentioned by Buchanan and others was still seen in remnants of bricks below the grass in front of the temple.

The Shiva Temple :-


Early descriptions :- About 100 yards north, or rather north-west, of the above group of temples, on the margin of the village mound, Buchanan had noticed “another small and more entire building of brick, which contains an immense linga, with a human face carved on one side of the phallus. Garrick also noticed a figure of Durga with a cup of blood in hand, and the slain Raktavija under foot. It is to be mentioned that this sculpture of Durga was not seen by Buchanan in 1812. This was found to be a popular temple especially among Mahajan classes in 1881 and was said to be built by Babu Baijnath Singh, a Paliwar Rajput about a century earlier. Cunningham has not mentioned about this temple.
