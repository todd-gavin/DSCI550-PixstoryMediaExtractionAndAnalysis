Qatar has been selected as the host for the AFC Asian Cup The middle east country will also be controversially hosting the FIFA World Cup later this year China was initially selected as the host for the nation flagship event in However due to their zero Covid policy China withdrew their name earlier this year This meant that AFC had to find a new host in just over a year s time Qatar Indonesia and South Korea put in their names for the hosting rights Following this the AFC selected the former on Monday Qatar are also the defending champion going into the tournament The nation won the AFC Asian Cup against all odds AFC chief Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa hailed Qatar s existing world class infrastructure and unrivaled hosting capabilities He said Qatar s capabilities and track record in hosting major international sporting events and their meticulous attention to detail are well admired throughout the globe I must also commend the AFC for showcasing utmost professionalism in conducting a fair and transparent expedited bidding process and I thank all our commercial partners and sponsors for their patience during these unprecedented times Qatar has built new magnificent stadiums for the FIFA World Cup Hence this would give a chance to the Asian teams that have missed out on the World Cup a chance to play in these venues However with question marks raised over human rights was it a good decision to award another big event to Qatar Let me know your mindset regarding this in the comments
