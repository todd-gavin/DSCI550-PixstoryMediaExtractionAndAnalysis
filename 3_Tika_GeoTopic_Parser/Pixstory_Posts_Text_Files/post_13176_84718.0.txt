Night when I sleep
In the nightmare, I have hope
Maybe one day
The war will end
And the leaders will get together
And remains that old mother who
The eye is on the path of his martyred son
And that young girl who waits
For his lover
And children waiting for the father
And their hero is sitting
A child who wants to be warm in his mother's arms
A bird whose pillow is broken
Waiting for the flight
The valve that has not tasted the river in the morning for many years
The book is buried under the rubble of war
Waiting for freedom
I do not know who sold the homeland
But!
But I know who paid for it
