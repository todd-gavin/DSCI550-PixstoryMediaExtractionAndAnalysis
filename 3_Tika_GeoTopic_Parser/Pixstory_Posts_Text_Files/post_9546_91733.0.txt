Consequences of conflict in Afghanistan continues..... 

The conflict in Afghanistan was at the core of a region including conflicts in other countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, and in India over Kashmir, Afghanistan borders three regions: Central Asia, South Asia and the Iran/Persian Gulf. 

There was a high degree of external involvement in Afghanistan and these external forces had a tactical approach that had been facilitated by the civil war in Afghanistan. The external actors could be classified according to their specific role in the Afghan conflict, inter-related within their international status. 

Throughout the war, all of the major factions have been guilty of grave breaches of International Humanitarian Law. 

Their war-making was supported and perpetuated by the involvement of Afghanistanâ€™s neighbors and other states in providing weapons, ammunition, fuel, and other logistical support. Both state and non-state actors in the region and beyond were playing this game with their proxies within Afghanistan. The arms provided have been directly responsible for serious violations of International Humanitarian Law. These include aerial bombardments of civilian targets, indiscriminate bombings, rocket and other artillery attacks on civilian-populated areas, reprisal killings of civilians, summary executions of prisoners, rape, and torture.
