Ukrainian LGBT rights activist, Bogdan Globa, posted about a possible humanitarian corridor set up by the U.S. and Polish army at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing of Lviv-Rzeszow.

“Evacuees will be welcomed at the G2A Arena,” Globa tweeted at six hours ago, addressing Ukrainian LGBTIQ+ friends.

With Russia’s invasion into Ukraine, an unfolding human rights catastrophe threatens to become an incoming reality putting LGBTQI+ people at risk, as detailed in a recent letter by the US State Department to the United Nations, obtained by Washington Post on February 20th.

The letter by Bathsheba Nell Crocker, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. office in Geneva, suggests that Russia has a “Kill List” with plans for targeted killings and forced torture against dissidents in exile, religious and ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ people and journalists.

“Specifically, we have credible information that indicates Russian forces are creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps following a military occupation. We also have credible information that Russian forces will likely use lethal measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from civilian populations,” the letter by Crocker reads.

Russia is infamous for its human rights abuses against LGBTQI+ folks. In 2013 President Vladimir Putin signed a law banning the spread of LGBTQ+ “propaganda” to minors, after which crimes targetting folks for their percieved queerness doubled.
