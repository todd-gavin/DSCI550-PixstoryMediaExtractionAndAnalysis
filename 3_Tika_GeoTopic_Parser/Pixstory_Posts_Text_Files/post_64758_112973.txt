In the beginning of the movie we see Teddy throwing up in the bathroom which he thinks is because he is seasick but its actually because of his withdrawal from the medicines he was taking and also that the ocean reminds him of the water where his wife drowned the kids Then he goes up the deck to meet Chuck Teddy doesn t seem to think that its weird that he is meeting him for the first time The other hint is that Teddy doesn t have a lighter when Chuck asks him for his to light his cigarette this is because patients aren t allowed lighters as they are deemed to be dangerous objects When they reach the island the guards are seen to be a lot more alert than they were before and are also seen to tighten their grips on their rifles because the guards are nervous knowing Teddy is a patient and they don t know when he might snap When they are about to enter the institute they are required to give their firearms to one of the guards Chuck seems to fumble getting his firearm out of the holster you d expect a Marshal to be smooth doing this but Chuck is actually a doctor with no experience with Firearms Additionally Teddy s room in the ferry awfully looks like a prison cell
