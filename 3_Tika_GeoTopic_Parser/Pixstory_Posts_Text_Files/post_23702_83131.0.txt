Khajuraho is a town in the state of Madhya Pradesh, which houses several temples built between 10th to 12th centuries. Spread across an area of 20 sq km, the monuments of the town are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The temples are built of sandstone and dedicated to the deities of Hinduism and Jainism. The temples are popular worldwide for the erotic cravings, which can be seen along with other cravings depicting the daily chores of life.

It is believed that there were over 75 temples in the area but only 20 exist today. The temples have been divided into three zones – eastern, western and southern. The Western zone consists of the most famous temples; the largest temple of Khajuraho, Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, falls under this zone.

An annual Khajuraho Dance Festival, celebrating classical dance forms of India, is held against the background of Chitragupta or Vishwanath temple in the first week of February every year.
