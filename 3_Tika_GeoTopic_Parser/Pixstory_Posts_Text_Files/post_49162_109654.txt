As Justice Ginsberg says A woman who has an abortion is not a mother She bears the undue burden of having lost an expected child It is extremely traumatic for a woman to be in a position like that Having to kill their own child because of societal pressure Supporting abortion necessitates denying biological reality and disobeying established judicial precedent pertaining to the resolution of human rights problems I ll add that Body Autonomy does not give the right to kill another human being because this will definitely elicit comments based on the Body Autonomy argument Mother s breast cancer risk is enhanced if she had numerous abortions was under the age of was above and never had children Women can become infertile after abortions They can suffer haemorrhage and so much more And they continue to maintain that abortion is for the health of women Abortion ban is for women s health
