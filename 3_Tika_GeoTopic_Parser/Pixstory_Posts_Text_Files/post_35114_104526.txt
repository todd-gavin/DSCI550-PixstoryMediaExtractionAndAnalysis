Those who hoped that the ways of Fabio Quartararo and Yamaha were about to separate will have to wait The Japanese team has confirmed the French rider for two more seasons Quartararo has so far shown great camaraderie and consistency in his two years with the Yamaha Factory Racing Team in the MotoGP World Championship The successful partnership resulted in his maiden MotoGP world title last year in his first season with the factory team Currently also leading the points standings Fear passed for Yamaha after earlier in the season the same rider admitted class that he was also starting to evaluate other options for his future The start of racing eased the bad moods and the relationship gradually strengthened until the renewal announcement I am really happy to announce that he will remain with Yamaha for another two years Yamaha believed in me from the beginning and one thing I don&#39;t forget But having said that the new agreement represents an important decision I am at a very good point in my career so I took a little more time to make this decision and be sure I believe in the Yamaha MotoGP project and I feel that Yamaha really motivated the words of Quartararo
