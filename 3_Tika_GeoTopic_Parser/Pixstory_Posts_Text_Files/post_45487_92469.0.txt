Arsenal are planning a surprise approach for Gareth Bale, who will leave Real Madrid as a free
agent in the summer transfer window.

Gareth Bale's time at Real Madrid will come to an end in the summer transfer window, according
to Spanish website Fichajes, when he leaves the Santiago Bernabeu as a free agent. Arsenal
could go all out to sign the Welsh forward on a Bosman transfer ahead of the 2022/23 season.

Gareth Bale arrived at Real Madrid full of optimism. And for the most part, the 32-year-old has
delivered on that promise, with the exception of the last few years. The midfielder, who is now
an outcast at the Santiago Bernabeu, was instrumental in most of the Merengues' trophies
during his time with the club.

However, the Welsh international's 2021/22 season has been a nightmare for him, with only 274
minutes of game time across six appearances in all competitions and one goal. Bale's
tumultuous time at Real Madrid will come to an end when he becomes a free agent in the
summer transfer window. Arsenal might be one of his possible suitors.

Nicolas Pepe has become a shell of the player who scored many vital goals for Arsenal last
season, therefore Arsenal will likely look for a wide-attacker in the summer transfer window. The
Ivory Coast international is expected to leave the Emirates ahead of the 2022/23 season,
freeing up a position in Arsenal's attack.

As a result, the Gunners have been connected with a number of wingers recently, notably
Memphis Depay and Gareth Bale. Even if wages are not an issue for the north London giants,
signing the Real Madrid renegade may be beyond Arsenal's reach.

Bale has past ties to Tottenham and enjoys a good working relationship with the club.
Furthermore, the 32-year-old does not match Mikel Arteta's recruitment profile at Arsenal,
implying that if he continues his career after leaving Real Madrid, he may need to look for
another option.
