When health is absent, wisdom cannot reveal itself, art cannot manifest, strength cannot fight, wealth becomes useless, and intelligence cannot be applied.

Your digestive tract is an important interface between your body and the outside world. It is a highly tuned mechanism designed to discern friend from foe—healthy food from things that might harm you. At the same time, it is responsible for directing the digestion and absorption of food and all the vital nutrients that come along with it. 
When things go wrong with your digestive tract it has far-reaching impacts on your overall health. Scientists are discovering that there is a connection between digestive imbalances and obesity, diabetes, mental and behavioral disorders, heart disease, and autoimmune disorders. Maintaining a healthy gut is a strong support for your overall health and well-being. 
In this chapter we’ll explore some important, simple ways you can nourish your digestive system, which can affect your overall health and well-being. 
DO YOU HAVE A HEALTHY DIGESTIVE SYSTEM? 
If you have one or more of the following symptoms, your digestive system could be impaired: 
Eczema, acne, and other skin conditions Food and environmental allergies Frequent bowel movements (3 or more per day) Consistently loose stools 
Consistent constipation Stools that float, are lighter in color, or are urgent GI upset after eating fatty or greasy foods Frequent bloating, distention, gas, or belching within 15 to 45 minutes after eating Undigested food in the stools Intestinal cramping 
WHAT IS DIGESTION? 
          
The word digestion literally means to break from large to small. Food must be broken into smaller 
pieces before we can access and absorb the nutrients it contains. This process usually begins with chewing and the secretion of enzymes from our saliva.
