Honestly I can write the whole essay on F R I E N D S but I ll keep it short F R I E N D S series is unbelievably amazing Those who love the show want to be like one of them All the characters are relatable to most of the people and you just can t hate any of them even though none of them is perfect I personally love Chandler Bing the most and desire the sarcasm level that he has If I have to rate this show it is it s always If you ll ask me to compare this show with others then even two other comedy shows together will not be able to win If I were given a choice to remember any comedy show it ll be F R I E N D S only
