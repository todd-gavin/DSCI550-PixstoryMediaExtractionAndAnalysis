Our planet is an amazing place, but it needs everyone's help to thrive!
We celebrate Earth Day on 22nd April.
So i follow RRR form..... Not RRR movie but here RRR stands for  Reduce - Recycle - Reuse 

"Save Earth Save Environment"
 
Nature has given us air, water, trees, plants, rivers, mountains, and minerals present below the earth for our help. We can earn money through our hard work, but neither we can make natural things nor increase it. All these things given by nature are limited.
