Strangely, A young man hasÂ  set fire to a Mercedes that was parked outside the house. The CCTV camera that was beside the building was able to record the entire episode.
The owner of the Mercedes car filed a complaint about the entire occurrence with the Noida police station, and as a result, the police have begun looking into the situation.
With the CCTV clip, a man can be seen riding up on his bike before sprinkling the Mercedes in petrol and setting it ablaze.
The individual has been identified as a tile worker who had worked at the Mercedes car owner's home but was dissatisfied since he had not received the entire sum due.
Even the owner of the car recognised him as the tile installer who had performed work in his home.
The man allegedly took this action and left the scene of the crime since he hadn't received the whole amount of money.
The owner of the Mercedes vehicle added that the man is from Bihar and currently resides in Noida's Greater Noida West neighbourhood, which is a part of the Bisrakh police station.
Police are currently searching for the young man who allegedly lit the care on fire, and it is anticipated that he will be arrested shortly.
