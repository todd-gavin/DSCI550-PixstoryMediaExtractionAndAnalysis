Since the US government decided to pass the Inflation Reduction Act there has been much chaotic discussion on the essential topic of climate change Though it s a good step towards protecting the climate yet too little actually to create an impact Recent research suggests that the region around the Norwegian archipelago Svalbard has been heating four times faster than the global average which shows that the arctic is warming at much higher rates Although U S Lawmakers have decided to bring the massive climate law the question remains whether the climate would wait steadily for any human action Of course not it is already too late for any actions to commence and function at their fullest it is the culmination of climate devastation And this picture is quite clear from whatever has been happening worldwide for the past few months Last month s heat wave and torrential floods of late in Kentucky and South Korea provide steady evidence of global warming s intensifying impact on the planet This is just one but there lies many to show the constant decay the most affected is the Arctic where some of the shifts are severe The historic moment a phrase used to refer to the Inflation Reduction Act would aim at reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases by encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient appliances and a quickening pace of renewable energy installations But studies remarks that it is still a minimal amount as compared to the harm that has been happening because of global warming There s still no change in whatever has been happening to the climate and the question remains whether this historic act would bring even the slightest difference
