I don't know when this shift happened, but I hate how we have started disrespecting legends of the sport to rationalise our own shortcomings or whatever it is. 

Even at 37 years old, Ronaldo is a proven commodity being a sole match winner for Manchester United in the last season and the reason for them finishing 4th in premier League. 

Ronaldo is not wrong in wanting to play champions League football as he wants to compete with the best and prove his mettle again.
