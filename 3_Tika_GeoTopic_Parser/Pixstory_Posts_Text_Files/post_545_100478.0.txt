After New York Times Modern Love series, the Mumbai series did get me excited. Juggling between work and home, I managed to watch it yesterday. I binge watch everything, anyways . 
I found the series refreshing, the gay couple,the Chinese immigrant mother/ son love story, the couple in 40s and their rediscovering love, Sarika sexy and sensuous. 
However I will talk about Raat Rani . 
A Kashmiri immigrant couple, left their home for love 10 years back. Out of caste romance-Yes caste system is sickeningly predominant when it comes to marriages. Otherwise we are ‘Muslims’ and caste is Non Applicable. Anyways back to the story. 
Lali is a househelp, works as a cook and a nanny in a household of a lesbian couple. She is so much in love with her security guard husband that her first instinct is seeking his touch the moment she wakes up.
The man leaves her, He IS JUST BORED. Absolutely shattered initially but later she learns to live more so learns to be happy without him. The entitled male can’t accept this reality even presumes there must be a lover-he can leave/cheat, she is still supposed to love him. But she goes out with the message that love/care/loyalty has an expiry date. Once hurt a person can pick up the pieces of his/her life and move on.
Fatima Sheikh, who claims Kashmir roots has delivered, she very much looks the part. Even when she calls people ‘Shikaslad’ (loser), her Shahruk Khana as she calls out for SRK is natural. 
Even her clumsiness with the cycle. 
However I wish, they would do away with things that just seem forced.
First I haven’t heard the profanities like the d—-head used by people so freely. Infact I heard it first time like that in the series. And her Kashmiri clothes-why can’t she wear anything except the ari work clothes. They are expensive and she has been living in Mumbai for ten years. And that over bearing accent of “sacooter”.
Wish the makers could concentrate just on her character than her attire and accent. 
Good job otherwise.
