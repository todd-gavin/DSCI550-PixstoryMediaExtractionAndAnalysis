Abstract Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease affecting bone tissue at different length scales Higher fracture risk in diabetic patients is difficult to detect with common clinical fracture risk assessment due to normal or high bone mineral density in diabetic patients The observed higher fracture risk despite normal to high areal bone mineral density in diabetic patients points towards impaired bone material quality Here we analyze tibial bone from individuals with type diabetes mellitus using a multiscale approach which includes clinical and laboratory based bone quality measures Tibial cortical bone tissue from individuals with type diabetes mellitus T DM and age matched healthy controls n each was analyzed with in situ impact indentation dual energy X ray absorptiometry DXA high resolution peripheral microcomputed tomography HR pQCT micro computed tomography microCT cyclic indentation quantitative backscattered electron microscopy qBEI vibrational spectroscopy Raman nanoindentation and fluorescence spectroscopy With this approach a high cortical porosity subgroup of individuals with T DM was discriminated from two study groups individuals with T DM and individuals without T DM while both groups were associated with similar cortical porosity quantified by means of microCT The high porosity T DM group but not the T DM group showed compromised bone quality expressed by altered cyclic indentation properties transversal direction in combination with a higher carbonate to amide I ratio in endocortical bone In addition in the T DM group with high cortical porosity group greater cortical pore diameter was identified with HR pQCT and lower tissue mineral density using microCT both compared to T DM group Micromechanical analyses of cross sectioned osteons longitudinal direction with cyclic indentation qBEI and nanoindentation showed no differences between the three groups High tibial cortical porosity in T DM can be linked to locally altered bone material composition As the tibia is an accessible skeletal site for fracture risk assessment in the clinics CT indentation our findings may contribute to further understanding the site specific structural and compositional factors forming the basis of bone quality in diabetes mellitus Refined diagnostic strategies are needed for a comprehensive fracture risk assessment in diabetic bone disease Sources
