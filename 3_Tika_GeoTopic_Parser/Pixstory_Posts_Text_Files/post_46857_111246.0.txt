Erin Brockovich, a single mother, and environmental rights activist, became a household name when she helped a small town being poisoned by toxic water for more than 30 years

Erin Brockovich despite her absence of education in the law, was instrumental in building a case against Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) about groundwater contamination in a town in California with the help of attorney Ed Masry in 1993. 

Their successful lawsuit was the subject of the Oscar-winning film, Erin Brockovich (2000), starring Julia Roberts as Brockovich and Albert Finney as Masry. 

Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality as well, hosting the TV series Challenge America with Erin Brockovich on ABC and Final Justice on Zone Reality. 

She is the president of Brockovich Research & Consulting. She also works as a consultant for the New York law firm of Weitz & Luxenberg, which has a focus on personal injury lawsuits for asbestos exposure, and Shine Lawyers in Australia.

In 2015, Brockovich asserted antagonism toward vaccine mandates. In early 2016, Brockovich became pertained to in potential litigation against Southern California Gas for a large methane leak from its underground storage facility near the neighborhood of Porter Ranch north of Los Angeles.
