Hiking is a great way to get outside and enjoy the natural environment, but it can also be dangerous if you don't know how to stay safe. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe while hiking:
- Use proper gear, including a helmet and sunscreen
- Stay on the trail - don't stray off the path
- Leave No Trace - take nothing but pictures and leave the place as you found it
- Tell someone where you're going and when you'll be back
-Always wear a headlamp during hikes at night. This will allow you to see where you're going and avoid getting lost.
-Stay aware of your surroundings at all times. Watch for animals that may be scared or defensive and keep your distance.
-Only go hiking if you're prepared for potential accidents. Make sure you have enough food, water, and first-aid supplies in case something goes wrong.
-Test the safety of any trail before beginning hiking by walking it slowly with a friend in front of you. If everything looks okay, then hike ahead!
And if something does happen, remember these tips for emergency evacuation: 
- Get out of the area as fast as possible - don't try to help anyone else.
- Walk downhill - this will help your body cool down faster.
