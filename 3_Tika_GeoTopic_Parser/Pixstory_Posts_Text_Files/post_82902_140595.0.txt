Cadbury celebrations 
We think later about the chocolates but the   first thing that makes us happy is the box of this chocolates itself. Different types of chocolates are packed inside it like Gems, 5  star, Dairy milk and chocobake cakes. It is very famous all over our country. It is sometimes given as a gift and sometimes for thanking someone. 
It is given as a gift on Raksha Bandhan to the sisters by the brothers. 
It is given as a Diwali sweet gift to friends and family members as well as neighbours.  Start your day with a bite of dairy milk chocolate and make your work and day happy.
