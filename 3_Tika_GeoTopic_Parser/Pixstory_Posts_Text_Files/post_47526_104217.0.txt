Without doubt, the lack of European football will attract a lot less top level players to the club
than it would otherwise. Defeats like the 2-1 Loss at Aston Villa or the EFL Cup defeat versus Liverpool really emphasised on the need for a new spine in the team. Multiple
positions are open with veterans out through injury or an impending transfer. Goalkeeper,
centre-forward and defensive midfield being a few of them.

Leicester's FA Cup campaign ended in massive disappointment with a 4-1 crash at
Nottingham Forest. Their football is slower than ever, and some of their star players will in all
likelihood â€” leave.

The owners must without fail cash in on the likes of Maddison and Ndidi,
maybe even Schmeichel or Vardy who now find themselves deep in their 30's. With some
tinkering, Leicester can once again become a dominant force in England again, competing
with the likes of West Ham and Arsenal for that sixth place.

Hit of the Season: James Maddison. The Englishman was once again fundamental to the
few bright parts of Leicester's season. When they suffered too, he was one of the most proactive and resilient men on the pitch.

Flop of the Season: Caglar Soyuncu. The Turkish defender was a breakout star last season, but has quickly been relegated to the bench this season. Following a string of poor performances, he no longer finds his place absolute.

Top Scorer: Jamie Vardy with 15 goals. No arguments here really, just plain class. Could do
with some support in the goalscoring department.
