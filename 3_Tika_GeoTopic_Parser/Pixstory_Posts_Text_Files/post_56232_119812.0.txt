More than 100,000 people escaping the war in Ukraine have obtained sanctuary in the UK through its visa schemes, according to Government figures.

Some 104,000 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes as of Monday, figures published by the Home Office and UK Visas and Immigration show.

The milestone was achieved more than four months after the Governmentâ€™s visa schemes were launched in March.

The Government thanked members of the public for their generosity in opening their homes to those seeking safety.

The total includes 31,300 people under the family scheme and 72,700 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.

Overall, there have been almost 200,000 visa applications, meaning just over half of those who have applied have arrived in the UK.

The figures show that, as of Tuesday, around 198,200 applications have been made for visas, and 166,200 visas have been issued.

These include 55,000 applications under the family scheme, of which 47,200 visas have been granted, and 143,200 applications under the sponsorship scheme, of which 119,000 visas have been granted.
