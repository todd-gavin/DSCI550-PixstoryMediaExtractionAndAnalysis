US News reported that on Friday, Stewart scored 17 points, and the Americans jumped out to a quick lead to defeat Canada 83-43. The 43 points scored were the fewest ever in a World Cup semifinal game. “Canada has been playing really well all tournament and the goal was just to come out there and really limit them,” said U.S. forward Alyssa Thomas. “We were really locked in from the jump with our game plan.”The Chinese will take on the Americans after defeating Australia 61-59. The Americans' pool-round loss to the Chinese squad by 14 points was their closest contest of the competition.
