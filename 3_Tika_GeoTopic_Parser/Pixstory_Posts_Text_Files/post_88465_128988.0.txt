The festival of Janmashtami also referred to as Krishna Janmashtami, Saatam Aatham, Gokulashtami, Ashtami Rohini or Â Srikrishna Jayanti marks the birthday of Lord Krishna, one of the most powerful human incarnations of Lord Vishnu. 
Janmashtami  is celebrated with a lot of zeal and vigour around the country but his birth took place in a dark dungeon. When Krishna's mother Devki got married to Vasudev, a prophecy in the sky announced that the 8th child of his sister will kill him, as the legends suggest. After this Kansa locked the newlywed couple in a dungeon and every time a child was born Kansa would kill him soon after until Lord Krishna was born.
Janmashtami is celebrated by one and all in India, down south, people make small feet of the Lord on their entryways and decorate the house with Kolam as a variation of the celebration.
