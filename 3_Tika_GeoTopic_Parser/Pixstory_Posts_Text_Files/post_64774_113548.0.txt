At this moment Mr. Kim completely snaps earlier in the film Mr. Park mentions his distaste for the poor who smelled like they take the subway his incredible disgust for the poor even in such a crucial moment causes Mr. Kim to stab him and end his life. So why did the song begin having a seizure during the attack? Earlier in the film it's revealed that his first seizure happened after he saw a ghost, the man that lives in the Parkâ€™s basement is the ghost he saw so seeing him appear at the party triggered the attack giving audiences the satisfying yet bleak payoff that's been building throughout the film after the disaster at the park house Mr. Kim flees but his daughter doesn't survive her wounds. After court proceedings in which Ki-Woo and his mother get probation, Ki-woo dumps the rock in a river signifying the end of his shortcut to wealth. In the process he decodes Morse code that's coming from the parks house which reveals that his father is still alive and hiding in the basement taking the place of Kim say then we get to see a hopeful montage as ki-woo works hard to find a good job and make enough money to buy the parks house reuniting what's left of his family. 

But of course this hopeful ending isn't real. It's Ki-Woo's plan but Bong Joon-Ho has admitted that it probably won't ever happen because of the stain on his name and no job opportunities, meaning his father will never be free. bong joon-ho described the ending of the film as a surefire kill shot this is because it's the final nail in the coffin the reality that nothing will ever be the same again and the Kim family has failed and they're actually worse off than before. The Kim family or the park family have been forever changed because of class, struggle and wealth inequality in a way there are no winners in this system. Bong wants to highlight that there's not always a right way to break out of poverty and sometimes there's no way at all.
