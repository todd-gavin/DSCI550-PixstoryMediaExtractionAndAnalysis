The Instagram and Facebook pages of Disneyland Resort were hacked early Thursday with a series of posts that had foul language and racist slurs.

A Disneyland spokesperson ascertained that the accounts “were compromised early this morning.” The posts have been removed.

“We worked quickly to remove the reprehensible content, secure our accounts, and our security teams are conducting an investigation," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Four posts appeared on the Instagram account around 4:30 a.m. local time, with one caption saying a “super hacker” was taking retribution on the park, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Posts from the hack used racist and homophobic insults, and one pertained to the "release" of another strain of Covid-19, according to the Times.

The Instagram account for the park, in Anaheim, California, has 8.4 million followers. It regularly posts photos of interests at the park and photos of guests, including families and young children.
 
This is the extend to which cyber attacks happen when someone like Disney. Disney has come a long way with the world yet some people are stuck in the old and conservative times.
