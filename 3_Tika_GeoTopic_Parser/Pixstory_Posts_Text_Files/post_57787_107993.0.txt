Solid foods are easier to halve and distribute, so mostly that's what ends up happening (keyword- mostly🤭). But, in the case of beverages, and especially those that you and your sibling both like, it's either absolutely even in both drinks or it's more in yours and yours only😂
The quantity is then measured by various possible means, it can be done by your sharp eye😂 or by actually getting out a weighing machine and seeing how much is there in both😂
Siblings have their own quirks and specifications that need to be followed to maintain the balance in the relationship😂
