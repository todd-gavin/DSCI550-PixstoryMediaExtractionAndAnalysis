In a woman named Kaitlin McClure was traveling home on Interstate from Philadelphia when she ran out of gas and money A homeless man named Johnny Bobbitt provided McClure with his last to pay for her gas to get home McClure uploaded a video of the situation to a GoFundMe page that went viral and collected almost in donations in a short amount of time As it turned out however McClure her boyfriend Mark D Amico and Bobbitt were all faking it It was a scheme intended to garner the most interest and the most funds McClure was recently given a sentence of one year and one day in prison while her partner received a term of months Bobbitt is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of the allegations against him The most distressing aspect of this ordeal is that it exploited people s generosity It was not as if the criminals delved into the pockets of their victims rather they had to present them with a tale so compelling that the victims were prepared to victimize themselves by reaching into their own pockets Although the amount of money taken from each victim throughout the hoax amounted to a few dollars the fact that they raised over demonstrates the cold calculated creation of the video and their complete disregard for the large number of people they intended to deceive
