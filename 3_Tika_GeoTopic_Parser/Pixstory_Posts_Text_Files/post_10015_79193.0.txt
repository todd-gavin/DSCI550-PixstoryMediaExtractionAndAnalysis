*Top Lessons from the book*

*1.	We have the power to make choices, and our choices are important*
Harry Potter is all about choice. From the moment that Harry says "Not Slytherin" when he's under the Sorting Hat to the countless times in which he chooses to help somebody in need. There are two quotes from Dumbledore that put it best: 1. "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."...and: 2. "Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right."
We all have the power to make the choice to do what is right, and in these times, we need to continually make that choice.

*2.	Even in dark times, we can find happiness and make others smile*
Another golden Dumbledore quote: "Happiness can be found even in the darkest times if one only remembers to turn on the light." Even when everything seems to be crumbling around us, we can still find ways to uplift each other and bring joy to each other. We see this best put into practice by the efforts of the Weasley twins and Lee Jordan, and how they use Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and their radio show, Potterwatch, to bring light into other people's lives.

*3.	Be critical of your news sources*
How many times in Harry Potter do we see the Daily Prophet print something that is just completely    wrong? Not to mention, all the damage that people like Rita Skeeter and Umbridge do on purpose. In this  era of "fake news" we have to be critical of every piece of media we take in.

*4.	Its Okay to Ask for Help*

Harry was often loath to ask for help, even when he really needed it. Whether that was working out what a clue meant during the Triwizard Tournament, or tracking down a long-lost diadem, his first reaction was often to try and do things alone.
