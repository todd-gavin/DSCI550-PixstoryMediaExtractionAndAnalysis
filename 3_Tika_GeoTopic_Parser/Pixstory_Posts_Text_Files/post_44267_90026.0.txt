Spurs have had Diego Maradona and Rivaldo come close to joining the club in the past, which may seem unbelievable to some. However, as is customary for the club, it has also signed a slew of flops who have failed to impress during their time in north London. Tottenham's recruitment, maybe more than that of many other clubs, has been particularly terrible on several occasions.

Let's quickly dispel whatever hope you may have had about Spurs' prospective transfer transactions by looking at some of the club's previous blunders in the transfer market. Let's hope the lessons were learned!


#5.  Sergei Rebrov

Starting things off with one of the biggest flops in Premier League history, let alone Tottenham's recent history, Sergei Rebrov only scored 10 goals in 59 Premier League appearances during his time at the club – a disappointing return for a player who formed one of Europe's best strike partnerships with Andriy Shevchenko at Dynamo Kyiv. Rebrov was a failure, whether it was due to his playing style or his inability to settle in England's top flight.


#4.  Roberto Soldado

Roberto Soldado, another striker with much of promise after joining the club for £26 million from Valencia, put in a lot of effort during his stay at the club, but his goal-scoring ability may be questioned. Soldado's return of just 7 goals in 52 appearances is nothing short of a disgrace, given that he was brought in to do precisely that.
