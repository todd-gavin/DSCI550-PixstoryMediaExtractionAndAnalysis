College Romance 3The brand new season of the most awaited series is finally here and streaming live on Sony Liv. Like the previous two seasons the 3rd season too is all about the college which revolves around friendship, love, feuds and betrayals.

Dahan, on Hotstar is a horror story which is all about a cursed village and the superstitions that have been passed on from generations. The series has a total of 9 episodes and I won’t be wrong if I said Tisca Chopra as the lead, did justice to her role.
