To eradicate the views of heteronormativity we need to work at deeper levels the work needs to be done everywhere even changing the language that portrays the existence of gender conformities It is not always appropriate to use bride or groom as everyone would not feel safe respected or included in society Like using Nearlywed instead of saying bride or groom the term implies that someone is engaged irrespective of their gender identity Well it is also appropriate to say engaged but the word would intensify the meaning of the special wedding day Another one would look like a well acquainted term as we often use it without knowing it s a gender neutral term The word is Fiance It doesn t imply any identity when used normally unless the person using it specifies it by saying the gender Therefore this term is perfectly suitable for use Newlywed is also very commonly used and it s a gender neutral term the only difference between Nearlywed and newlywed is that instead of being used before the wedding it is used after So instead of specifically mentioning husband or wife you can just call them newlyweds Before introducing another one we must understand that most of the terms already exist but they need to be used more to make language gender neutral This one is spouse This is also used often instead of saying husbands or wives and it could be made more accessible by just saying spouses We can also use partners couples or significant other for addressing people with different identities without specifying who they are There are many others to use for constructing a gender neutral language that doesn t harm or disrespect anyone s identity You can begin including it in your vocabulary while you speak it will bring a difference
