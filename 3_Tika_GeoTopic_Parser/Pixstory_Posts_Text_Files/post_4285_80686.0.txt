Claudette Colvin was the first person to be arrested at age 15 for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, and not giving up her seat to a white woman. Her story made it to a few local papers, as she did not get the recognition at the time for several reasons. Nine months later the Rosa Parks incident took place which made it to local and national news. However we remember Claudette Calvin today, for being brave and standing her ground. Letâ€™s never forget those who silently paved the way for all of us.
