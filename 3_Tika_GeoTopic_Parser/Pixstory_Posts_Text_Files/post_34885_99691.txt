My contract with PSG ends in June I&#39;d like to stay but I&#39;m not sure if the club has the same wishes I have Words from Angel Di Maria that also open a window to Juventus, a team that had already been interested in the Argentine in the past His contract expiring and at the moment Paris Saint Germain has not offered him a renewal If Di Maria does not stay in Paris he would like to play in a team in Europe better if he also makes the Champions League If he does not sign with PSG I will try to see if there is the possibility of find a team in Europe to get to the World Cup in Qatar in the best possible way if he is called up The feeling that the bianconeri could make an attempt to reinforce the squad that Dybala Di Maria will lose for he is almost years old and the engagement to offer him would certainly be from top The match would be resolved in an instant instead if PSG wanted to keep him they would immediately say yes
