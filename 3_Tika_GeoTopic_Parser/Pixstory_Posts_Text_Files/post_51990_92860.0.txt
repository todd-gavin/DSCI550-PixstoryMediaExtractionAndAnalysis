Daniel Ricciardo has arrived at Albert Park for the Australian Grand Prix amid chaotic scenes from delirious fans who wanted their moment with the home favourite.

Ricciardo arrived at Melbourne Walk just before 10am, and took about 30 minutes to walk the 100-metre stretch to the paddock.

It was by choice, as the Australian stopped to sign virtually every signature, and take every selfie, among those who lined the pathway.

As he met the fans’ demands, iconic Aussie tracks such as Land Down Under and You’re The Voice blared in the background.
