Caterpillars metamorph from juvenile to butterfly And maggots turn to ants and wasps and beetles by and by And tadpoles can be newts and salamanders toads and frogs But when it comes to mammals well There s little change of which to tell For puppies only ever get to grow up into dogs But you know that s not quite true we re changing too Though the other way round See larvae are more evolved than their parents Their bodies the new kids in town But we you and me start out as a fish With proto gills and a tail to swish In a primordial sea of warm Then it s time to move to shed our skin And let our reptile selves begin Engage evolve transform It s time to metamorphosise We mongrel robots in disguise From instar into more bizarre Our restless genes must shift and swarm And take this blood cold world by storm By becoming the mammals the furry mammals we are But don t stop now the urge ain t gone I don t know what s next but I feel it coming on Pic credit pixabay Poem credit Toastingfork
