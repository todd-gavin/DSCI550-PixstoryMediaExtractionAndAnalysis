PM Narendra Modi will arrive in Bengaluru on Monday for a two-day visit to Karnataka, where he will participate in a number of events, including laying the foundation stone for Bengaluru's 148km-long suburban rail network, which was first conceived nearly four decades ago, and leading the International Yoga Day in Mysuru on Tuesday.

According to CM Bommai, the PM will attend inauguration and foundation-laying ceremonies for IISc, railways, and NHAI-related programmes, as well as declare open the Ambedkar School of Economics on the Bangalore University campus.

Due to security concerns, twenty-two schools and institutions located along the path Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take in southwest Bengal during his visit on Monday will remain closed. The educational institutions in the KommaghattaKengeri corridor, Pattanagere ward, Jnanabharati ward, and Kumbalgodu cluster will be closed for the holiday.

The University of Bangalore has also declared a break for its employees and students. On the BU campus, Modi will dedicate the Dr. BR Ambedkar School of Economics. He will lay the foundation stone for numerous development programmes, including the Bengaluru suburban rail project, at Kommaghatta.

The education department was asked by the home department to proclaim a holiday since traffic will be disrupted due to the PM's cavalcade, and vehicles transporting children will be inconvenienced.
