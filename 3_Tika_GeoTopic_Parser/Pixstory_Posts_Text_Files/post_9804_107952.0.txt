My grand father who is a dearest person in my life and we have flee our home country Afghanistan together . It was amazing seeing him enjoy the scrumptious taste of red and riped water melon. Back in Afghanistan he used to enjoy every traditional seasonal fruits particularly those tasty watermelons he used to buy from our near home shop. I could see the joy on his face eating watermelon and narrating stories of our home. I could see him in peace while knowing he is safe and in pain for losing his home.
