Jawaharlal Nehru University is one of India s highest ranked universities and known as one of the country s best graduate schools in the social sciences But it is not fair to take all the credit for what it provides and its building It is the students who made this possible Liberals should not be too happy with the ranking because it s not because of them that they secured the top rank In my opinion Left liberals only do politics It was through the hard working of students that today the University is among the top Indian Universities under National Institution Rankings NIRF Left Liberals only play cheap political games They trigger the students to involve in violent activities JNU is under scrutiny since due to these left liberal leanings Don t forget the clash between two groups of students at Jawaharlal Nehru University The conflict between students affiliated with Left organisations and members of the RSS student wing ABVP allegedly broke out over non vegetarian food served in the hostel mess on the Hindu festival of Ram Navami Several videos surfaced on social media one of them was Akhtarista Ansari a second year MA student of sociology bleeding from the head Violence Bloodshed Politics and Manipulation but it s students of the University that make JNU one of India s highest ranking universities What is your opinion
