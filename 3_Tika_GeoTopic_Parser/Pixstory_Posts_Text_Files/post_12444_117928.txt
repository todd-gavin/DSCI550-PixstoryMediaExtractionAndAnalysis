We sometimes tend to look into things that we can t control and this can lead us to become anxious stressed helpless So here are somethings you can control and what is in your hand which you only need to mainly look into and it s time to keep aside those uncontrollable factors When we focus on what we can control we will feel more self empowered with which we also take care of ourselves So here are some things you can control How often you think about your past Past can be cherishing those moments which is great to remember But if they unsettle you then slowly you have got to deviate your mind from it as it can take you to many other thoughts How many negative articles you read We are exposed to lot of info s and among them we need to check how much of positive and negative content we are exposed to When it gets over a limit it is better to restrict the number of negative articles you may get into How much time you spend worrying When we start analysing ourselves we will be able to get an idea of where much of your time goes especially while it is happening up in your head When you walk away from a conversation When you know that what is not worth of listening especially if the matter affects you mentally in a way that bothers you you are free to walk out of it How nice you are to yourself in your head The image in our mind about ourselves tells a lot about ourselves When you ask for help When you want a help and when you know that you are in total control of whom to go to seek the help Until and unless you decide to get help no one can help you out Sources Instagram
