The Matildas have beaten New Zealand 3-1 in Canberra with a dominant performance that still left questions over their ability to finish chances.

In front of an enthusiastic 13,077 supporters, Sam Kerr (2) and Hayley Raso scored to give the hosts a 3-0 lead.

However, New Zealand pegged a goal back with only their second chance of the game when Hannah Wilkinson showed great tenacity to slot home on the stoke of half-time.

Neither side were able to find the net in the second half, despite the Matildas creating a multitude of chances and, although New Zealand improved in the final 10 minutes, the visitors never really challenged Lydia Williams's goal.

Kerr described the performance as "controlled" and that appeared a fair reflection to a contest in which the Matildas were clearly the better team throughout.

Making just one change from Friday's frustrating outing in Townsville, with Caitlin Foord starting in place of Kyah Simon, the Matildas instantly impressed their dominance on the game.

The visitors were repeatedly exposed when attempting to play out from the back, their admirable ambitions thwarted by the Matildas' press.

However, New Zealand did have the first chance when Wilkinson got in behind the Matildas defence and sent a shot just wide of goal.

The Matildas scythed at will through the Football Ferns, who aided and abetted their hosts with a litany of errors in possession, including the careless concession of a corner that led to Australia's first goal.

One particularly egregious example saw Betsy Hasset passing the ball straight back over the dead ball line, bisecting her two closest team mates with unerring accuracy.

From the subsequent corner — the Matildas' third of the game in the opening quarter-hour — Kerr eased away from her marker, Olivia Chance, to powerfully head home virtually unchecked.

Two minutes later the Matildas had their second, with Raso pouncing on a rebound to stroke the ball in off the far post.
