In the recent years studies, scientists have identified the possibility of using ketamine to resolve and treat mental illness, which is in particular associated with the treatment - resistant depression (TRD). 

Ketamine, is a dissociative anesthetic that was developed during the early 1960s which was primarily used for human and veterinary anesthesia. 

Ketamine is sometimes prescribed off-label for depression, under medical supervision and in a clinical setting. But if proven in clinical trials, R-ketamine could be a safe antidepressant for people to use at home.  

With more than 30% of adults with major depressive disorder affected by treatment-resistant depression, potentially millions of people could be helped by ketamine therapy.  

FDA Approval for R-ketamine 

One form of ketamine has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in a life science study, to be carried out by German psychedelics startup Atai Life Sciences. Their clinical trial will use R-ketamine, a non-psychedelic form of ketamine, to look at whether it is effective for TRD.  

So far, we have reason to be optimistic that our R-ketamine formulation, PCN-101, could have potential as an effective, at-home treatment for people with treatment-resistant depression.

“S-ketamine is rapid-acting, offering relief from depressive symptoms within hours (as opposed to weeks or even months, as can be the case with SSRIs),” Rao explains. 

But when compared to S-ketamine, PCN-101 has demonstrated the potential for greater potency, longer duration of effect, and reduced abuse potential in pre-clinical studies. “These characteristics could potentially position R-ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant with a more favorable safety and tolerability profile than S-ketamine,” Rao says.
