Polls released on Wednesday suggested that Australia's national election has become too close to call, as the ruling conservative coalition halved the gap with the main opposition Labor Party three days before the country elects a new government. 

According to a poll for the Sydney Morning Herald, Labor's lead over the Liberal-National coalition has decreased to 51-49 percent on a two-party preferred basis, down from 54-46 percent two weeks ago, while a Guardian poll indicated it had dipped a point to 48 percent. 

The pre-polling tendencies, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, are "very positive." Official figures showed that about 6 million voters out of a total electorate of 17 million have already voted via postal ballots or early in-person voting.

As per DD, an additional 1.1 million postal votes have been received so far versus the 2019 election. "If it's close, this level of postal votes makes an election night indication of who forms government less likely," Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers said, referring to the additional time required to count postal votes.

Everyone is waiting for the results with bated breath. Letâ€™s see who the people of Australia will choose!
