In just one year, there were approximately 599,000 migrant "gotaways" - people who crossed the border and invaded authorities and are therefore unaccounted for. These numbers are the result of a review of border crossing recordings in which the subjects were not detained. 599,900 unidentified, unaccounted-for individuals who may be infected with diseases and who may have been hardened criminals in their prior nations are currently at large in the United States. The critical question is why this does not bother Democrats. Even if you want open borders, do you truly want unaccounted-for individuals? Can Democrats find a middle ground between their extreme policies and common sense? The answer appears to be an emphatic no. As a result, governors of states such as Texas and Florida are delivering migrants to the states responsible for this crisis, as they must bear the repercussions of their advocacy.
