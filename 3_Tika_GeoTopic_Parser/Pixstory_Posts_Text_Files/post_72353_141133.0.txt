PVR Cinemas CEO Kamal Gianchandani has set the record straight about ‘false and negative’ stories floating in the media regarding the recent release Brahmastra.

On Thursday, a day before the release of Brahmastra, certain reports claimed that Brahmastra had ‘misfired’ for the major cinema chains in India like PVR and INOX, causing a huge monetary loss to them. On Saturday, PVR Cinemas CEO Kamal Gianchandani reacted to ‘false and negative’ info about the film, setting the record straight. 

The report from Business Insider claimed that the cinema chains suffered losses of around ₹800 crore due to the dip.
On Saturday, taking to Twitter, Kamal Gianchandani addressed such reports but without explicitly mentioning them. He wrote, “It amazes me, the false and negative info about @BrahmastraFilm on the internet and in the media. Is it a lack of understanding or is it intentionally designed to cast doubts?” He added that PVR had done a bet box office business of ₹8.18 crore for Brahmastra on Friday, higher than many other recent blockbusters.

Gianchandani added that he expected the numbers for Saturday and Sunday to be even higher given the booking trends. “The way advances / pre sales are today (Saturday), @_PVRCinemas would easily cross 9 cr NBOC (today) and 10 cr NBOC on day 3/ Sunday. When a film grows further from a record setting day 1 number the simple take-away is that the paying audiences are enjoying the film and spreading a positive word about it. #PVR is having a fabulous weekend which is so encouraging given the massive lineup of films over the next 3 months,” he added.
