The past few weeks have been mayhem for the United States as people suffer from the constant grief of losing their loved ones.
Gun violence has become so common that officials or lawmakers hardly care to resolve the issue.
 But who is responsible for this reckless attitude? It is, of course, the government and people sitting on the pedestals higher than those of common people or the innocent children who were killed in the Massacre.
Do they still think of protecting their gun and not their lives?

Every law is made to assert that keeping a gun in hand was always a sign of superiority for the American people and should be neglected. It is high time we ask these important questions to us without being driven by the rights that say keeping a gun is not unconstitutional.
There should be guidelines on who could possess a gun; it is not someone who has mental issues or can harm others.
Keeping a gun could be unconstitutional, but does that mean killing innocent lives with those guns is acceptable?
Indeed not, the young children who lost their lives in Uvalde had the right to live, and their rights were violated by the constitutional right to possess a gun.
People should be aware of their rights and the harm they can cause to others; it is time they care more about lives than guns.
