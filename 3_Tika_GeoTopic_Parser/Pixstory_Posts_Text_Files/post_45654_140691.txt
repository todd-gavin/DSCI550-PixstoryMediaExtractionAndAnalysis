Kate Halfpenny recounts when Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Abdullah paid a visit to the Scottish estate in the Queen was the one who suggested that they take a drive around the Balmoral grounds The prince agreed to do it He occupied the royal Land Rover s front passenger seat as directed The monarch then rose beside him and departed The prince was astonished and uneasy since he was in charge of a nation where it was forbidden for women to drive According to Sir Sherard Cowper Coles the then British ambassador to Saudi Arabia the Queen s visitor begged her to calm down and concentrate as she fancied her way over winding roads while conversing the entire time The wrong woman was picked by Prince Abdullah to lecture In her history busting reign the Queen never needed to be told what to do or to watch out for on the road ahead She was a stickler for small but important details and she realised the political and social message she was delivering to the Saudi king with her choice of brooch and words I am better than you at everything you can accomplish We can improve
