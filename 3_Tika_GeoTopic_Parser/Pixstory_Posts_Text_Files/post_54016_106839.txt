For decades scientists have warned that ecologically destructive activities increase the risk of diseases spilling over between wildlife and human populations Examples of these drivers include climate change habitat loss wildlife trafficking environmental contamination expansion of anthropocentric activities and invasive species introduction Domestic animals also contribute to the movement of diseases between species Free roaming domestic animals like cats can facilitate the spread and transfer of diseases impacting both humans and wildlife Infectious parasites Free roaming cats which include feral stray and house cats present a particularly compelling case because of their large population sizes and their central role in the life cycle of a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii T gondii that infects both wildlife and humans Most people may have only heard of toxoplasmosis from their doctors during a pregnancy or in articles on brain altering parasites However T gondii is one of the most common zoonotic parasites globally and is estimated to affect about to per cent of the global human population T gondii infections can have severe and life threatening consequences especially for immunocompromised people and infants infected during pregnancy Pregnant women are often advised to avoid interacting with cat feces because of the risk posed to their unborn children Shutterstock Toxoplasma gondii forms a permanent resting tissue cyst in the muscle or nervous tissue of a host so even healthy infected people are impacted Chronic toxoplasma infections have been linked with illnesses including degenerative neurological diseases schizophrenia and brain cancer Domestic cats or wild felids like lions jaguars or cougars intermittently excrete millions of T gondii eggs called oocysts into the environment through their feces These oocysts persist under favourable conditions for years in water and soil with the capacity for long distance dispersal If any warm blooded animal ingests an oocyst it can become infected with T gondii This can happen if a person or animal ingests oocysts in contaminated water or food or through eating another animal that has already become infected Read more
