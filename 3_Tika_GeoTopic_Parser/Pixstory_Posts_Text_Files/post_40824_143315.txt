Who goes there hankering gross mystical nude How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat What is a man anyhow what am I what are you All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own Else it were time lost listening to me I do not snivel that snivel the world over That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids conformity goes to the fourth remov d I wear my hat as I please indoors or out Why should I pray why should I venerate and be ceremonious Having pried through the strata analyzed to a hair counsel d with doctors and calculated close I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones Walt Whitman
