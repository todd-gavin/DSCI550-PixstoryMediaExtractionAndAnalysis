For an entire week, we are all about healthy eating, however as weekend comes knocking the story changes. 
Our eating outs, take aways, kids wanted to have dinner, the small slice of pizza would not do harm, I just took a small bite of the burger, all the excuses come along. 
Even this seems fine as long as we don’t binge eat. We sometimes go on an eating marathon. 
While the week brings in a strict diet mentality, weekend gives relaxation signals for dieting also.
Sometimes one also indulges in food as a stress buster . Eating to relax. 
But the question that arises is . How much can we stretch weekend eating that it doesn’t become over eating. 
Weekends generally called cheat days should not take you to a level that your dietician feels cheated . 
My dietician friend shared the best way to stop weekend overeating would be to do as follows . 

1 No to cheat meals
Don’t ban everything through the week. 
No cheat meals? It’s hard for your body to process too many calories . So eat consistently watch calories . Have small treats when you want to through the week . 
2.Be mindful of portion size . Even on weekends large meals are a no no. Eat your favourite meal but watch the size of that plate. 
3.Choose lunch treat instead of dinner . Don’t save your calories for end of the day. Try to burn them before u hit the sack. 
4. Start a food journal- log everything you eat. You will automatically eat better. 
Yes if u can take that evening stroll on weekends as well. 

The big question is how much of this advice do I follow . 
Some days to the T, other days are just cheat days .
