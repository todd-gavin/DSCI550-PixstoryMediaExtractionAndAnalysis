My back is warm to you I do not know how my tongue would turn if you were not I would not call you Honestly sometimes even when I have nothing to do with you I call out to myself Dad I am so in love with your hands that sometimes my heart stains hold my hands Every time you hold my hand I feel relieved I know you have my air and I am in the midst of a strange crowd I do not get lost and you never let go of my hand Happy Father s Day my dear Dad
