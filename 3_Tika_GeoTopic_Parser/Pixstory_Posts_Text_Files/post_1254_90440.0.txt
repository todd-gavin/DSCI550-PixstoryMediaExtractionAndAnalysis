Comedy is comedy. If Michael J Fox can laugh about his own Parkinson’s, Jada can have enough guts to take a joke about her hair.

Parkinson’s is a way more serious disease than pattern hair loss. Fox has made multiple quips about his Parkinson’s. So have others. He has always laughed at it. So much so that Fox decided to star in an episode of ‘Curb Your Enthusiam’s 10th season which was dedicated entirely to him being a prick and blaming it on his disease.

One of my comedy idols, Norm MacDonald was privately suffering from cancer for 10 years. It was at this time he made his legendary joke about cancer which went something like this.

“I don’t know why people say someone is ‘battling with cancer’. Because that means the last thing you do is lose. ‘Oh he lost his battle to cancer. WHAT A LOSER.’ If you really think about it, when the person dies, so does the cancer with him. So you don’t LOSE your battle with cancer. It’s actually a tie.”

People have forgotten how to laugh at themselves. I know everyone is going to think I sound like a boomer but it’s the truth. Everyone’s too sensitive about everything and it’s setting a bad example.

You’re also justifying and defending beating someone up just cause you don’t like a joke they made. Dangerous stance, man. Dangerous.
