Usage and benefits of screw piles:
The use of screw piles is widespread and has spread from lighthouses to the rail, telecommunications, and road sectors, among many others, when quick installation is necessary or where building work must be done near pre-existing buildings.
Residential applications for screw piles are already being installed, and many homeowners prefer them over other solutions. Helical pile foundations are frequently used for residential decks, sheds, cement pads, prefabricated staircases, and grade beams.
The design of contemporary screw piers are based on accepted geotechnical and structural concepts. Typically, screw pile designers employ proprietary design software they have created after field testing various compression pile and tension anchor configurations in various soil profiles. Corrosion is addressed in long-term field tests and global databases on steel in-ground corrosion. The load capabilities of modern screw piles exceed 2,000 kN. (220 short tons-force). For connecting to different concrete or steel structures, large load capacity screw piles may feature a variety of components, including flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates, or re-bar interfaces.
Due to cost savings and - increasingly - less environmental effect, most companies employ screw piling specialists. By screwing' the foundations into the ground, less earth is moved, and hence less soil needs to be removed, saving on transportation expenses and lowering the project's carbon imprint.
Shorter project durations, ease of access, reduced carbon footprint, simplicity of removal when foundations are no longer needed, decreased risk to labour, and lower costs are some of the critical advantages of screw piles.
They are also utilised for masts, signage, and retaining structures since they can withstand both tensile and compression stresses.
