 I wish I knew how It would feel to be free I wish I could break All the chains holding me I wish I could say All the things that I should say Say em loud say em clear For the whole round world to hear I wish I could share All the love that s in my heart Remove all the bars That keep us apart I wish you could know What it means to be me Then you d see and agree That every man should be free I wish I could give All I m longin to give I wish I could live Like I m longin to live I wish I could do All the things that I can do Though I m way overdue I d be starting anew Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky How sweet it would be If I found I could fly I d soar to the sun And look down at the sea And I sing cause I know How it feels to be free Nina Simone
