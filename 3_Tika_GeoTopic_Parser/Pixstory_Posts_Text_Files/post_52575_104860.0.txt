Washington DC food trucks are a delicious and convenient way to sample cuisines from all over the world right here in the nation’s capital. Believe it or not, in DC some of the most unique and best-tasting eats come from food trucks. They are definitely not to be missed!

The food trucks in DC are created and inspired by some of the best chefs and culinary artists in the area.

1. FAR EAST TACO GRILLE

Far East Taco Grille specializes in Korean-style tacos made with organic ingredients sourced locally in Virginia. The first thing that comes to mind when eating these delicious tacos is that they are extremely fresh—not always the words used to describe food from a truck. But what truly sends this Washington DC food truck over the top is the quality and the uniqueness of their toppings.

2. ROAMING ROOSTER

Roaming Rooster has some downright delicious chicken sandwiches, securing its spot on our guide to the very best Washington DC food trucks. With homemade pickles, super tender chicken pounded thin, and the perfect amount of heat, our favorite offering here is the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. We love that they use free-range, grain-fed chicken too. It is a local favorite and shouldn’t be missed!

3. SATÉ INDONESIAN FOOD

Saté (pronounced sa-tay) serves up authentic Indonesian street food and we are thrilled to share it on our guide to the best Washington DC food trucks. You’ll be able to smell it before you see it in the best way possible—their grilled meats and exotic spices are heavenly. And as the name suggests, you simply cannot miss the chicken saté. We’re talking about tender marinated chicken on bamboo skewers, grilled over a hot charcoal fire, then drenched in amazingly thick peanut sauce, and served over rice. So tasty, even the pickiest eater in your group will love it.
