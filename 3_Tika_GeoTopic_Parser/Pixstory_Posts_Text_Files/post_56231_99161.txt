Happy Mother s Day to all those who celebrate it today In the UK mothers day is celebrated on March in the UK with the date set by the celebration s Christian foundations as Mothering Sunday It always takes place on the fourth Sunday in the festival of Lent exactly three weeks before Easter Sunday Almost countries including much of Europe Africa and South America followed the American system and celebrates it on th May Talking about or origins of mothers day in the UK during the middle ages when children who had left their families to work in domestic service returned to their mothers or the home The connection between mothering Sunday and mothers day came when the children returning home started bringing flowers and gifts for their mothers Another aspect that made the mothering day to mothers day is because of West Virginia activist Anna Jarvis who campaigned for a holiday in honour of her mother who was a community activist Anna Jarvis s mother Ann Jarvis was a peace activist who treated wounded soldiers in the American Civil War Her daughter campaigned for a day to honour the part played by mothers following Ann s death and the idea gained much traction that by all US states observed the holiday In it had become so universal that President Woodrow Wilson declared Mother s Day a national holiday as a public expression of love and reverence for the mothers of our country Later Jarvis deeply resented the commodification of the holiday that she had created The commodification of emotional symbols like the white carnation led her to withering criticism and she was even arrested for protesting against organisations selling Mother s Day merchandise Even though it has relations to Christianity it is largely a secular celebration in the UK It is not about dates but about the emotion that we celebrate mothers Mothers are an emotion Let s celebrate them every day and a bit more on Mother s Day
