Religion is something that should be stayed far away from by the human beings I wouldn t recommend being religious to an adult because its so easy to get caught up in it and make choices that you wouldn t normally make Religion is inherently exploitative and manipulative which makes sure that you make the choices conducive to the traditional view no matter how old that idea truly is Speaking of which teaching religion to adolescent children should not even be a debate Kids are not mature enough to understand the complexities of religion It is inherently catastrophic if we keep going down the path of mixing education with religion it would just create another generation of adults willing to commit atrocities in the name of God
