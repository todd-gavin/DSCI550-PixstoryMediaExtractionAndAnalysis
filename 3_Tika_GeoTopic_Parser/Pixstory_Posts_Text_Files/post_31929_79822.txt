Antonio Rudiger has increased his wage demands to remain at Chelsea for the foreseeable future The German international s deal at Stamford Bridge expires this summer and as of yet the Blues have been unable to agree terms on a new contract Rudiger was said to be looking for per week but he has now increased those demands to per week with the likes of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich sniffing around The Athletic th of February The former Stuttgart man has been with Chelsea since the summer of and under Thomas Tuchel he has become a key squad member So far this season Rudiger has made appearances for Chelsea and also popped up with three goals transfermarkt However there is the very real possibility that he leaves at the end of the season Given that he is you would think this will be his last major contract so you can t blame him for wanting to get the maximum amount of money that he can However will Chelsea decide that per week for Rudiger is too much Again this is a possibility and you would have to think that both the player and the club will need to compromise The one positive for Chelsea is that Rudiger admitted that his family were settled in London which could play a major role in his next decision Sky Sports Certainly this is something that I will be keeping a close eye on because Rudiger has been one of the best defenders in the world since Tuchel arrived at Stamford Bridge and it would be a shame if he moved on in the summer Hopefully Chelsea resolve this contract issue soon and avoid splashing out on a new replacement
