Use essential oil diffusers safely. Always diffuse crucial oils in well-ventilated areas and avoid diffusing them for several hours. It’s best to diffuse for 30 to 60 minutes and take a 30-minute break.

Essential oils are meant to be inhaled but never ingested unless they come in capsule form, which is only available outside the United States.

Essential oils should never be applied directly to the skin without diluting with a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil. Dilute essential oils with 1 ounce of carrier oil to every three to six drops of essential oil. Some people may develop a skin reaction or irritation to certain essential oils, particularly if the individual suffers from atopic dermatitis. Reach out to your doctor if you create an itchy rash or hives after using essential oils.

Not all essential oils are created equal, so it's important to check the ingredients and understand their origins. For example, the bottle should say “100% essential oil.” However, if the bottle says “therapeutic grade,” that doesn’t necessarily mean top quality – it could mean it's half essential oil and half synthetic oil.
Essential oils aren't safe for use in all groups. Therefore, these populations should also exercise extra precautions:

Infants and children are more sensitive to all medicines; the same goes for essential oils. In addition, children may react to certain types of aromatherapy deemed safe for adults but not diluted enough for children.

Pregnant women should not use essential oils unless under a doctor's or trained aromatherapist's supervision.
