Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan got into a fight at Katrina Kaif's birthday party in 2008. It was so bad that they stopped talking to each other for many years.😰😰😰

They ended their differences at Baba Siddique’s iftaar party several years later. At the 2016 Star Screen Awards, Salman and Shah Rukh were seen joking about their fight. “Kisiko yeh nahi maalum hai ki Salman aur mera jhagda kyun hua. Humara jhagda bohot ek chhoti si baat pe hua, ki hum dono mein se zyada khush kaun hai Shah Rukh said.

“Maine usko kaha ki main ghar jaata hoon toh mujhe bohot khushi hoti hai. Biwi hoti hai toh mujhe bohot khushi hoti hai. Salman ne kaha, ‘Main jab ghar jaata hoon, meri biwi nahi hai, isliye mujhe usse aur zyada khushi hoti hai’

He added, “Maine kaha main ghar jaata hoon toh meri laadli mere godh mein baithti hai, mujhe khushi hoti hai. Usne bola, ‘Main ghar jaata hoon, mere godh mein bohot saari laadliyaan baithti hai, mujhe aur bhi zyada khushi hoti hai.’ Toh isi baat pe humara jhagda sa ho gaya🤔🤔

They exchanged their jackets after which SRK told Salman, “Maine weight lose kiya hia aur tune gain kiya hai. Kaafi charbi chadh gayi hai tujhe.”

Well, they have sorted out their differences and how! Now, they are quite close and even make guest appearances in each other’s films. Salman recently spoke about being in SRK’s Pathan and SRK being in Tiger 3. He also spoke about the possibility of the two actors coming together in full-fledged roles for a film.❤️❤️
