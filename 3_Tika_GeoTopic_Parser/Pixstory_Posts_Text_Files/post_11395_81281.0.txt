Despite having 17 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of internationally critical diseases, Africa remains far behind in terms of knowledge generation, providing only around 2.5 percent of worldwide research output.

The lack of highly trained researchers who can supervise higher degree scholars, poor career progression pathways for scientific researchers, inadequate research infrastructure that provides access to scholarly resources such as scientific literature, and a lack of supportive services such as administrative support, communication and public engagements, among others, are all factors contributing to the continent's poor research output.

As a result of these issues, Africa is seeing a major and growing brain drain as researchers and academics migrate to more resource-rich countries. As a result, Africa has a weak research-training environment, a lack of long-term research productivity, and inadequate capacity to address its overwhelming health concerns.

Africa's reliance on the global north for research

More African governments have expanded funding for scientific research and capacity building at national and regional levels in the recent decade, resulting in a significant rise in investment in Africa's research and development capability.

The majority of investment efforts, however, have come from the global North, and have been led by scientists with a limited awareness of the continent's research landscapes and specific difficulties.

It is not commonplace for research initiatives run by scientists from the global North to reduce African researchers to the role of programme managers, with their scientific focus transferred to more northern-related studies.

Strengthening Africa's long-term research and development capability necessitates an African/locally-led strategy that builds on current national and regional capacities.
