The FIFA World Cup™ that’s happening this November is arguably one of the largest sporting events that’s held once every four years.
For three years, national teams will compete to qualify for the tournament phase in the fourth year, during which 32 qualifying countries will compete for the title of champion and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.
