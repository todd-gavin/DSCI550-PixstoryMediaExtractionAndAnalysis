5- Harris was a national leader in locating and verifying potential clients through websites that sex workers could access.

Harris exploited her position as California attorney general to go after websites like Backpage.com, which gave sex workers an online platform to exert extra agency in ensuring safe working conditions. She did so as early as 2013, when she became one of the first state attorneys general in the country to seek Congress to alter Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act so that sites like Backpage may be prosecuted for aiding the sale of sex.

By 2017, Harris had successfully persuaded Backpage to remove the adult component of the website, a move that angered advocates for independent sex workers as well as anti-human trafficking organisations. Closures like that of Backpage's adult section, which sex workers and anti-trafficking groups thought would stymie anti-trafficking investigations, proved to have just a little impact on reducing child sex trafficking. However, it would drive many people interested in consensual sex work to look for and/or return to far riskier parts of the sector, such as dating apps and street-based sex work.

Kamala Harris is not unproblematic, in fact she's transphobic and anti-sex work. Transgender people and women have been struggling to safeguard, or even attain their rights to their bodies only for people in power attack them. It is not okay.
