Under Sanju Samson s captaincy Rajasthan Royals have reached the final of the Indian Premier League IPL Last time when they reached the finals was way back in under the leadership of Shane Warne The year old Samson has led from the front with his smart strokeplay and matured decision making as the Royals booked only their second IPL final since making it there in the debut season which they also went on to win It is fascinating that Sanju one of the best wicketkeeper batsmen in Indian cricket was virtually an unknown commodity when the Royals last reached the IPL final years ago He was an under player when Warne lifted the cup I remember playing an under game somewhere in Kerala and I remember watching the last game with my friends and remember that last run where Shane Warne and Sohail Tanvir hit the run and they were running it was a very vague Samson told Harsha Bhogle last night The final was held at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai Batting first Suresh Raina s ball along with captain MS Dhoni s ball unbeaten helped Chennai Super Kings finish with for five in overs Yus uf Pathan was the pick of the bowlers for Rajasthan with his for and he also played a key role in the chase with his ball laced with three boundaries and four maximums However a couple of quick dismissals in the fag end of the innings left RR eight to score of the last six balls with Warne and Tanvir on strike But the pair held their nerves in the crunch moment to complete the chase in the final ball as Rajasthan Royals a team that was written off at the very start of the season managed to stun all and win their maiden IPL title
