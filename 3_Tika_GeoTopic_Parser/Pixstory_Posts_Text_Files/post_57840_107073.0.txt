Shabir Hussain Khan is a 58 year old papier mache artist living in Kamagarpora Kadi Kadal area in Srinagar, Kashmir. He has donated 174 pints of blood in the last 41 years and continues to do so still. On the 4th of July, 1980, he donated his blood for the first time when a friend of his got injured playing football and was losing a lot of blood. He rushed to the hospital on foot to donated blood that day. He was nervous that first time, but ever since it has become the norm for him. He gives blood four to five times a year, is a life member with the Indian Red Cross Society and heads a team of volunteer blood donors with 2,300 members in Kashmir Valley. The team organises blood donor motivation programmes to motivate people, hold donation camps and anti-drug campaigns. 
During the devastating earthquake of 2005, floods of 2014 and Political unrest during 2016, in times of need, people have turned up because of his campaign to help and rescue.
He says, "Donating blood can save a life. Blood is not something you can buy in the market. It's significance is felt in the conflict-toen places like Kashmir where even blood banks can run dry at times due to heavy casualties. There is also an immense need for blood in hospitals for accident victims, pregnant women and others in need of blood. So people must come forward and donate blood to save the lives of people irrespective of religion, region or caste." 
Shabir has donated blood not only in Kashmir, but also in Odisha, New Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and various other parts of India. 
He believes blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give.
