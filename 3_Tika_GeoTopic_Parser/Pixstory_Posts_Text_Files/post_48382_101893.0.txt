The archbishop of San Francisco has prohibited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from receiving communion in the archdiocese due to her support for abortion rights. Is this the idea that religion promotes? Religions are known to suppress women for many years and this statement has proven the point.

Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone wrote in a letter to Pelosi on Thursday: "I am hereby notifying you that you are not to present yourself for Holy Communion and, should you do so, you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion, until you publicly repudiate your advocacy for the legitimacy of abortion and confess and receive absolution of this grave sin in the sacrament of penance
In a separate letter to priests explaining his decision, Cordileone, who has been the archbishop for a decade, insisted that his "motive is pastoral, not political."

Pelosi has long been a supporter of abortion rights. In addition to firing this month's leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, Pelosi denounced a restrictive Texas law when it was implemented last year, calling it the most "extreme, dangerous abortion ban in half a century."

The archbishop, referring to the speaker's Texas comments, said in his letter to Pelosi that he had previously instructed her that he would “have no choice” but to refuse her access to Holy Communion if she failed to publicly dismiss her advocacy for abortion rights and otherwise refrain from referring to her Catholic faith in public.
