How dramatically things change in the game of football Less than hours ago everyone was excited by the prospect of watching Lionel Messi tearing up Real Madrid after all fans across the world in all these years are much used to watching the former Barcelona star delivering his best against Los Blancos Kylian Mbappe on the other hand was more in the news for a possible transfer rumour to Real Madrid next season The role reversed in the Champions League night While Mbappe struck a stunning last minute goal to see the Parisians through with a margin in the first leg Messi backers were simply crestfallen They couldn t believe their eyes as Messi missed a penalty in the nd minute that almost allowed Madrid to take home a point from the away encounter A day before the match everyone around was confident even the coach Mauricio Pochettino He said Leo is in good form he has great desire these are the nights that are important for his talent It didn t happen the way he predicted Now to use a clich Mbappe spares Messi s blushes Yet at the end of the day PSG took home three points and that s the most important point At Santiago Bernabeu the two teams will meet again in the second leg and Messi would have yet another opportunity to rediscover the incredible form that he displayed on that very pitch several times over the years Of course at Parc des Princes Mbappe was the true hero not for the goal alone but for the way he played throughout the minute period There wasn t slightest doubt about who were the superior side if Madrid had three efforts at the rival goal then had even when Messi wasn t anywhere near his usual form Desperate Pochettino had to bring in out of match practice Neymar minutes from close and it signalled the change It was Naymar s back heel that released Mbappe to surge in from the left and claim a crucial victory deep into stoppage time Messi for certain heaved a sigh of relief
