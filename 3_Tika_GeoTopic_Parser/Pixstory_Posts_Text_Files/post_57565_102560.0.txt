Again a terrifying image of violence could be seen in America where a gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School.
This is another appalling gun attack within two weeks of the Buffalo massacre. Investigators say that the 18-year-old suspect had a handgun, an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, and high-capacity magazines.
The teenager is suspected of shooting his grandmother before the rampage.
Local media report that he may have been a high school student in the area.

The use of semi-automatic weapons to terrorize people has become common in the United States; this incident has once again questioned the permissive gun laws of the United States.

Easy access to firearms makes the United States a target for many such attacks that could happen even later. The incident in buffalo made it clear that the suspect was carrying a semi-automatic rifle.
While after the Texas slaughter, many reports have informed that the suspect bought two guns for his recent 18 birthday.
Isn't it bizarre to see how a gun could be a present for an 18-year-old's birthday? 
The unconfined access to these weapons eradicates the fear of keeping them in people. However, they often choose to have firearms for enjoyment, which raises challenges for public safety and the country's national security.

Although the intent may differ in the shooting cases that happened in the country within two weeks, the harm it does is not concealed from anyone. Killing 19 innocent lives couldn't be an enjoyment for the suspect; there is a deep-rooted abhorrence and negativity that evokes such violence. The only way to end these attacks is to make gun laws that forbid and restrict people from keeping a gun.
