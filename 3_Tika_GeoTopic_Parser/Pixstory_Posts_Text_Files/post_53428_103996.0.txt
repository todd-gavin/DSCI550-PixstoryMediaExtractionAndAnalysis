Three years into the pandemic, it’s clear that Canada’s provinces have been hampered by a lack of a comparative cross-Canada analysis of school closures and  the effects on students.

What we do know about the disruptive impact of school closures on Ontario and other provinces comes largely from a June 2021 Ontario Science Table study documenting the extent of school closures from province-to-province.

Four mass school closures in Ontario cost Kindergarten to Grade 12 students some 28 weeks of schooling since March 2020, far more than the average lost time in Europe (10 weeks) or in Europe and North America considered together (17 weeks).

Most other Canadian provinces were close behind Ontario, with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, for example, checking in at 20 to 22 weeks of disrupted instructional time by June of 2021.

Revamping standardized testing could be part of the solution, but Ontario’s incoming government after the June 2 election will also have its work cut out for it in restoring the public’s faith after extensive closures.

Fallout of school closures
Schools are now confronting the fallout of pandemic school closures. A July 2021 follow-up Science Table report identified the cumulative learning loss and social harms inflicted since March 2020.

It recommended that, barring catastrophic circumstances, schools should remain open for in-person learning for the foreseeable future and that school closures, “or transition to an online learning model, should not be used as a public health measure for pandemic control.” That helped bring an end to system-wide closures, but left us with a pandemic generation well behind in their academic progress and social development.
