The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work The big idea One factor that influences the use of the labels soft science or hard science is gender bias according to recent research my colleagues and I conducted Women s participation varies across STEM disciplines While women have nearly reached gender parity in biomedical sciences they still make up only about of students receiving undergraduate degrees in computer science for instance In a series of experiments we varied the information study participants read about women s representation in fields like chemistry sociology and biomedical sciences We then asked them to categorize these fields as either a soft science or a hard science Across studies participants were consistently more likely to describe a discipline as a soft science when they d been led to believe that proportionally more women worked in the field Moreover the soft science label led people to devalue these fields describing them as less rigorous less trustworthy and less deserving of federal research funding Why it matters Over the past decade a growing movement has encouraged girls and women to pursue education and careers in science technology engineering and math or STEM This effort is sometimes described as a way to reduce the wage gap By encouraging women to enter high paying fields like science technology and engineering advocates hope that women on average will increase their earning power relative to men Others have hoped that as women demonstrate they can be successful in STEM sexist stereotypes about women s ability and interest in STEM will erode Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
