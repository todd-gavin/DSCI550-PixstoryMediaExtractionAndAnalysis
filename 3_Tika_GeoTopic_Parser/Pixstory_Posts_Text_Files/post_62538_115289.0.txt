Contradictory to the common belief, swans do not just attack unless they are threatened. They almost never start the offense, they are defensive birds who just try to protect themselves and their flock.

The warning signs of a swan would be:

1) Ruffling of feathers: The swan will appear as large as it can without moving by completely ruffling its feathers.

2) Swans will stand as tall as they can while they are standing up straight without lifting their necks. The feathers on their neck will now be raised and fully ruffled.

3) The swan will eventually resort to vocal hisses because immobile physical action is ineffective.

4) Next, the swan will hiss and slightly extend its wings, making it appear even larger.

5) The swan will now begin to approach you physically. It will begin approaching you slowly and purposefully, giving you one more chances to get away.

6) The swan will now decide to increase its display of hostility because you continue to pose a threat, so they change their slow, determined walk into a furious march or a run.

7) Despite all of its warnings, the swan has decided that you are still endangering it. It expands its wings even more and begins flapping them at you as hard as it can when it is close enough to you while charging.

8) The swan will now try to peck and bite you with its beak if you don't move away.


The best way to prevent a swan attack is minding your own business. They are not offensive but they are extremely protective of their flock and territorial. These beautiful creatures are not all that friendly.
