Further on the building of skyscrapers on the aztec foundation is making it a lot worse due to their very heavy weight Due to a phenomenon called subsidence Mexico City is sinking at a rate on a foot and a half each year All this also effect the underground systems like sewage gas and water lines The city invested a lot of money in a new sewage system which was completed in the late s it was meant to help with the flooding and sewage problems which didn t quite work as well it was meant to due to subsidence The city has spent about Billion dollars on a new sewage system which would help with the flooding but the flooding in late still costed the lives of people just north of Mexico City To make matters even worse rain and spring water flow done the mountains into Mexico City which would make the city sink deeper and eventually contaminate the drinking water The city is already facing a problem of water availability due to the increasing population the failure to harvest the water water and rain water means that the city loses about million gallons of water via crippled sewers like the grand canal The city planners have installed water pumps to draw water from whatever is left of the rivers but this still is not enough The city s demand is of more than million gallons a day the city has to import more than of the water from other sources but almost of this water is lost across miles of pipes because of leaks and other losses million homes in the city lack access to water of the city residents can t rely on the water supply To battle this the government sends out water trucks so people can take water for their needs but this still doesn t reach everyone A lot of these trucks draw this water from the Aquifer which lie metres below ground And this is not helping the problem of the sinking city
