I didn't even know what this event was since I've never heard of it, I'm new in Delhi.
It has been over a month since a guy I started talking to online asked me about it. He said, "Shreya, we're gonna go to Horn Ok Please, its happening after 2 years because of covid and you'll love it." I was like alright, let me see the tickets and stuff, and he went like I've already bought two.
So we went there yesterday and we met for the first time. It was epic, the food, the concert, the vibe, the drinks and everything, also the guy I went with was super sweet. I had an amazing time, and I just wanted to share my story so here it is.
