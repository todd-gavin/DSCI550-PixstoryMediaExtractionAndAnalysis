After a 3-0 final-day victory against Sassuolo on Sunday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who helped AC Milan win its first Serie A title in 2011, was spotted celebrating after his side claimed its first
Serie A title in 11 years.

"Of all my titles, this is the most fulfilling," says the author, Ibrahimovic. "I recall promising when I
returned that I would return Milan to the top and win the scudetto. Many people were skeptical
and laughed. Instead, I'm here now as a champion.

"We toiled, sacrificed, and suffered." And once you've mastered it, everything is possible. I went
through a lot of pain for this prize. It gives me the most pleasure."

On Sunday, AC Milan defeated Sassuolo 3-0 to take the Serie A championship from local rivals
Inter Milan for the first time in 11 years. Milan brushed aside their hosts in front of an army of
away fans at the Mapei Stadium, needing just a point to secure the Scudetto.

Olivier Giroud scored twice, and Franck Kessie added another in the first half. Milan ended two points ahead
of Inter, who won 3-0 at the San Siro against Sampdoria. The 'Rossoneri' returned to the top of
the Italian game after years of weak squads and financial issues since their previous title in
2011.

The season-long battle for the Italian league between Milan and Inter came down to the last day,
with the Rossoneri needing only one point to capture their first scudetto since the 2010-11
season. It led Inter by two points and had the stronger head-to-head record, which was the
tiebreaker.

After Giroud was replaced in the 72nd minute, Ibrahimovi was introduced, and the 40-year-old
Swedish striker felt he had scored in what may be his final club encounter, but it was called out
for offside.

When questioned about his future, he answered, "First I have to do things that make me feel
happy." "If I stay healthy, this will not be my final match." We'll see how things go.
