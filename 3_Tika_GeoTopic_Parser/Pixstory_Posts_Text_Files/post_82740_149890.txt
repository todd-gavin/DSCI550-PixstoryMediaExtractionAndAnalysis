 George Orwell completed his masterpiece a book which would later gain four major film adaptations and created words such as telescreen thoughtcrime and doublethink which are used and are in today s dictionary A true work of genius as well as my all time favorite and least favorite novel here I exercise doublethink it s truly a masterpiece It s rather uncomfortable to read and parts can be somewhat confusing but it s all worth it not just for the terrifyingly clever political messages but also the excellent characters something which many readers don t pick up on Winston is a perfect bullseye with that worryingly relatable quality of knowing the world in which he lives is wrong and unjust but being too scared and aware of how bad things are to do anything about it until through Julia he finds new purpose Julia is also great with her rebellious free spirit and general stubbornness and passion but with that same fear and worry Winston possesses O Brien well I can t say anything without spoilers for those unlucky few who haven t read the book but he s also a great character The ending is terrifying and leaves a poor taste in your mouth especially the final four words but it s still powerful and effective More than anything it makes you think about the world and society in a different way changing your worldview forever Above all it s brilliant and one everyone should have on their bookshelf
