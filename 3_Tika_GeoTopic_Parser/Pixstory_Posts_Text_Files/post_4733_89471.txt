The Russian media is a powerful propaganda machine Russian media outlets have been closely controlled by the government over the past several decades and since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb many journalists and editors have been turned into mere mouthpieces for the government line But a few recent examples of journalistic defiance show that the Kremlin can t guarantee full control over Russian journalists during the war At the same time Russians access to online information about the war constantly challenges the Kremlin s lies about the invasion Some Russian journalists have left the country since the end of February while others have resigned from their jobs For the most part even the state media employ people with normal moral standards Most of them are not all in with what s happening now all this hell and horror said commercial television NTV anchor Lilia Gildeeva who resigned over the invasion and has left Russia For now most Russian journalists many apparently driven by fear of arrest or worse are publicly going along with President Vladimir Putin s lies about the war And it s certainly not clear if the exodus of individual journalists will result in systematic change in Russia But even in authoritarian states journalists can have power I believe that if enough journalists take a serious risk and reject the Kremlin s control they can significantly undermine Russia s war on Ukraine by telling the public the true story of what is happening I base this on years of studying the Russian media from how state control of media destroyed nascent political parties to the way the internet challenges Kremlin control Stop the war Russian television news editor Marina Ovsyannikova walked on the news set of state run First Channel on March and held up a sign behind the newscaster that said no war in English and stop the war don t believe the propaganda in Russian Full story at The Conversation Imagery A woman looks at a computer screen as Russian state news editor Marina Ovsyannikova protests the Ukraine war during a news segment AFP via Getty Images
