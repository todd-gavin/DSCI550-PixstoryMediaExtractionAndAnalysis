3 Ricardo Kak√°
Kaka was an attacking midfielder who could also operate from the flanks and easily beat 3-4defenders; it was a piece of cake for him and the player exploded onto the scene in 2007, when AC Milan won the Champions League; Kaka was awe-inspiring in the final. As a result, he became the last Brazilian to win the coveted Ballon d'Or. He scored 95 goals in 270games in just five seasons.
2 Gennaro Gattuso
Gattuso was the Roy Keane of Italy, a hot-headed guy with a monster mentality who would not tolerate folly from anyone, and his time at AC Milan was just entertaining, he would do anything to defend and played games as if he were in war, AC Milan's badge was like a heart for Gattuso, and this is what made him the greatest holding midfielder of all time.
After impressing in a small team, he joined AC Milan and quickly became their best holding midfielder, winning two Serie A titles and the Champions League.
1 Andrea Pirlo
Pirlo was an artist, a master midfielder on par with Xavi and Iniesta. His Serie A legacy is very inspirational, and the player gave the club European status with his presence; his presence was enough to pull all the strings from midfield and bring goals via strikers. He was a set-piece expert who had fans in the chokehold.
Italy will never see a player of Pirlo's calibre again; he was a magician in the park who
played 401 games for AC Milan and won two Serie A titles and the Champions League.
