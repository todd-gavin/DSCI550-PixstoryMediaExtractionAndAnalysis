Wow!!! Never thought that a movie that was so hyped up by marvel, would be a failure of such epic proportions. 

Thor Love and Thunder managed to do every possible thing wrong that you can imagine. The whole movies seemed like it was made in a hurry. 

The expectations that fans had for the movie after Ragnarok were crushed, after seeing how Taika Watiti had failed to deliver. 

Maybe it's just me, but the only enjoyable thing about the whole movie was Christian Bale being awesome as Gorr the God butcher, but even that was ruined, coz he had such less screen time. 

Jane's medical condition wasn't properly dealt with, and the storyline of Jane and Gorr were so special in the comics, and i cannot help but feel that Love and Thunder ruined it a bit for me.
