The Dangar assigned no name for this deity. Immediately within this ditch rises the work of Man Singh, as is declared by an inscription on a gate in Persian and Sanskrit, of which former I procured a copy. The works form the finest castellated ruin I have ever seen.”

An interesting legend is recorded by Buchanan in his journal on the 26th of December 1812.  Buchanan records that

 “ In the evening I received a visit from Bupnath, who lately lived in Srinagar, a mud walled house with two stories thatched and a mud fort near, just opposite to Porcha, but has now gone to Sonpur, a similar abode. He was well dressed and very civil, but has little apprearance of a gentleman. He says that he is descended from Chundraban who was expelled from Rohtas by Shere Shah, as usually related, and that Chundraban was descended through the Oyudiya (Ayodhya) family of Ruedas. That he is descended of Chandraban is highly probable. He says that the image on Rohtas Chauri represented that prince, and that the conical rock mentioned in my account of Katautea gate was left by one of his ancestors, who was attempting to dig out a passage for the Son through the hills. When the workmen began to cut this part blood issued from it. He says that he can trace his ancestors very far in the papers belonging to his family, and has promised me a list.”

Rohtas has been mentioned by most medieval chroniclers for its strength. It has also been mentioned by Ferishta and Tavernier.
