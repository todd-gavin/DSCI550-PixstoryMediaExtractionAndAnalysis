Every year, World Rabies Day is observed to commemorate the progress made in eradicating this terrifying disease and to promote rabies prevention. The French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur, who created the first rabies vaccine, passed away on September 28. This year is also the anniversary of his passing. Following the appearance of clinical symptoms, the contagious viral disease rabies almost always results in death. Together, the veterinary and human medical fields must fight this still-prevalent disease in Africa and several Asian nations that is still preventable.Source: DOY
