Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has decided against having surgery to recover from his knee injury and has opted for therapy instead.
During his team’s pre-season training in the USA, the French international suffered a lesion to the meniscus in his left knee. There was concern that the injury could force him to be absent from the upcoming 2022 World Cup.
However, as reported by Il Corriere dello Sport(via Juventusnews24), it looks like Pogba is doing his best to avoid that outcome.
Multiple reports suggest that he needs surgery to handle his knee problems, but the midfielder has opted for a different solution.
