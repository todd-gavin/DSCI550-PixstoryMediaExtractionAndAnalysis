Lewis Hamilton has a positive outlook. Mercedes has made headway in challenging the Formula One leaders, with the team claiming that the "adversity" of trying to stay up has brought them closer together. 

US News reported that the seven-time champion has only one podium finish from seven races, his worst start to a season since 2009, after Mercedes had to modify a car that had a tendency to bounce and shake at high speeds at the start of the year.

“Can I say it's the best, most exciting journey? No, but it is an experience and it's bringing the team closer," Hamilton said Friday, speaking before practice. "It’s making us all have to sharpen our tools. The technology is advancing a lot to be able to understand it, and we’re pulling closer than ever before. I guess that's what happens when you're faced with adversity, and so there's lots and lots of positives.”

Hamilton said upgrades the team brought to the Spanish Grand Prix last month have "given us more of a direction to go in and it's been positive” as he and teammate George Russell try to chase down title contenders Max Verstappen of Red Bull and Charles Leclerc of Ferrari.
