The 'Vote for Women' session at the UNSW Sydney Centre for Ideas heard that the quest for equitable gender representation in Australian politics required fundamental reform. 

UNSW Newsroom reported that the panel discussion featured Greens Senator for NSW and UNSW alumnus Dr Mehreen Faruqi, novelist and former Liberal-turned-Independent MP Julia Banks, and 2022 Independent candidate Georgia Steele, and was moderated by Professor Rosalind Dixon of UNSW Law & Justice. 

Prof Dixon said it was critical to remember that Australians will vote in less than two weeks. She said it was important to “reflect on the role of women in our politics, the challenges and opportunities, and the role of voters”.

Despite being among the first in the world to be granted the right to vote as well as the ability to be elected to parliament, women account for barely a third of Australia's elected members in 2022.

Unlike in the corporate world, there are no systems in place to protect women in parliament, Ms Banks said.

“There is literally nowhere in that house for women to go. Particularly women where there is a power disparity, where they’re not an MP. There is nothing they can do, there is no structure in place for either of the parties.”
