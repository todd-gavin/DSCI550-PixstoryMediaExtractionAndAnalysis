She is last to the table She is busy making sure everyone has what they need She is last out to the car She has been searching for missing shoes and hurrying to get everyone else ready Often she is last to get to whatever she is doing She has got good intentions but she is getting used to being late Yet when you ask her children who s always been there their cheerleader their safe place Her name comes first When the world looks around and notice the most influential voice in the live of the next generation Her name comes first When it s been a hard day And her family needs someone who will listen with compassion and grace Her name comes first Hey Mom You are perfect You are messy and frustrated But you keeps getting back up And you keeps going You keeps giving You are doing such a good Work ohh mom You may not hear a thankyou today but one day you will Love you Mom
