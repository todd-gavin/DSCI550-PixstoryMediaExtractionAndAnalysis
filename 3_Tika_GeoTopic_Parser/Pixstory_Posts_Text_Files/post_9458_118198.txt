Remembering my friend Sachy now brings nothing but pain A national award was always his dream If Sachy was alive he would have been the proudest person on earth I am sure he wouldn t have any control over his emotions That was his very nature His characters portrayed the different shades of it Ayyappanum Koshiyum which earned him a posthumous national award for the best director deals with a powerful three letter word ego Ayyappan is from the lower class and Koshy comes from the upper class Both have powers at different levels When it failed to settle them a petty ego transforms into an act of deadly revenge and branches out to their personal and social spheres They become primitives Such a small thread But you cannot deviate a moment from Ayyappanum Koshyum Your judgments fail You cannot take a side Tempo built by punch dialogs and realistic fights kills you Ayyappan s tribal background has some political subtexts So is Koshy s upper class feudal background Brilliant penning and direction Eminent Malayalam actors Biju Menon and Prithviraj essayed both characters as real enemies No wonder Biju Menon the Ayyappan bagged the best supporting actor award
