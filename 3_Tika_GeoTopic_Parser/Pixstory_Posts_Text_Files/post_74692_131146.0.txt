The teaser of the movie has been released in Telugu and Hindi language🎬
While the Megastar becomes the leader of the masses in a short time and gains the title of GodFather, he is exiled for two decades from his hometown. The one-minute-thirty-three seconds’ teaser progresses as it sees many are happy with his return, and there are numerous people who didn’t want to see him again. Nayanthara’s character hates him, while Satya Dev who is the chief minister of the state commands his officials to eliminate him. The latter even commands his officials to take him out of his way. 😳😳😳💯

As the clip progresses, we hear the dialogue in the background, “Do you know who he is? He’s the boss of the bosses. Our one and only Godfather,” which uplifts Chiranjeevi’s character.✅

Then comes the Bollywood superstar Salman Khan - a huge supporter of the Godfather. “Lag Rahaa Hai Badi Lambi planning Chal Rahi Hai… Apne Is Chote Bhai Ko Bhool Naa Nahee… Kahe Tho Aajaathaa Hoo Mai…” says he, extending his support to the Godfather. 🎬✅
However, the latter asks him to wait for his command.
Salman Khan’s presence is one of the biggest crowd pulling factors.
