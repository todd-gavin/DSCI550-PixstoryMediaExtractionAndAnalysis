Down a game, down four match points and then an astonishing comeback.
Full beast mode was on display while the brothers at courtâ€” Chirag & Satwik took India closer to a historic gold against the 14-time champions Indonesia in the Thomas Cup final.

The Indian duo beat the Indonesian pair of Ahsan/Sukam 18-21, 23-21, and 21-19.

The first two matches have gone the way the H2H was before the final started. 

Srikanth now takes on Asian Games gold medallist Christie in the gold medal decider, though the H2H is in the Indonesian's favour 4-5, the Indian would look to wrap this up 3-0.

First Lakshya and then Sat- Chi!! The boys are killing it!! Living the dream!! We are one step away from winning the Thomas Cup2022 

Fingers crossed, just hoping Srikanth plays his natural game. If he manages to pull this off, it will be a pathbreaking victory for not just badminton but the Indian sporting realm in general.

Come on Sri!! We can do it!! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ 

Go for gold ðŸ¥‡

Update: Kidambi Srikanth wins the first match 21-15 against Christie! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
