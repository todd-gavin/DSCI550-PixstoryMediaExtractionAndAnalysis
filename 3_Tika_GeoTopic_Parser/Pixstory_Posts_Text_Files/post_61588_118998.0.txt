Over the last few months, there have been rumours about the possibility of WWE changing ownership. Although the brand, as such, is not for sale, many investors are interested in buying it because of its profitability.

One of the names linked to a potential takeover is that of former professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson, better known as The Rock.

According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Radio, The Rock could be one of the partners who would be in interested in acquiring the wrestling brand in the future.

"The two names that have come up in many questions as far as if they sell are Tony Khan and Dwayne Johnson," said Meltzer.

"Those are both very interesting. Of course, Nick Khan and Dwayne Johnson have a relationship, the story is they were childhood friends in Hawaii when they were both very young.

"Nick Khan's sister is the showrunner for Dwayne's television show, so whatever relationship they had before, the fact is they know each other.

"Dwayne himself does not have the money to buy WWE, nor does anyone, but could he go in there and round up capital? Can they all work together and buy this company together? That is an absolutely intriguing possibility.

The Rock has already purchased XFL from Vince McMahon before, so this story is not all too crazy!
