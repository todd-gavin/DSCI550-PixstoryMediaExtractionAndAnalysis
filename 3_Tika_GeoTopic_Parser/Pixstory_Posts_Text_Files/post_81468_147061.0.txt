Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale have been rewarded by the Premier League after reaching 100 appearances in the division.The duo picked up their awards after recently reaching the milestone, which are given to every player who has made a century of top-flight appearances.Saka completed his ton in the 3-0 win against Bournemouth in August, having made his league bow on New Year's Day 2019 against Fulham as a late substitute, becoming the first player born in the 21st century to play in the division.In the process, the attacker became the second youngest player to play 100 times for us in the Premier League, behind only Cesc Fabregas, and in his first 100 games he scored 17 goals while assisting 15 more.Ramsdale meanwhile completed his century back in April away at Crystal Palace, with his games spread across spells at three clubs.The shot-stopper made his Premier League debut while at Bournemouth in the 2019/20 season, in a game against Sheffield United on the opening day of the campaign. He would make 37 appearances that term before moving to the Blades, where he was an ever-present between the posts before heading to Emirates Stadium.12 of his 22 clean sheets from his first 100 games would come for us last season - a campaign that also saw him handed his first England caps.
