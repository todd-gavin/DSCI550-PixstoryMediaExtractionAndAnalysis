In July, during Pedro Obiang&#39;s fitness visit, myocarditis was diagnosed. Difficult to understand the causes first. I had bronchopneumonia. I was vaccinated but I probably also had asymptomatic Covid. I felt tired but my father had just died and I thought it was stress. Instead. I was told it would take six months to heal Hard to digest I thought I&#39;d be home sooner Having no symptoms I didn&#39;t feel the seriousness of the problem I realized it in the hospital They plugged in the machine for heartbeats I just had to stand up my pulse they went up a lot and the machine made that noise I learned how important it is to get checked Time went by and I got discouraged I stayed in the hospital for days and already on the fourth day I asked Alessia to bring me rubber bands and other tools to maintain muscle tone After the third month I started doing control tests The first went well the second less I confronted and almost collided with the excellent Mapei specialists who, looking at the data, invited me to be patient In the sixth month I was convinced I was cured But it wasn&#39;t like that and I started thinking about retirement A new life After the third month I stopped considering myself a footballer I concentrated on my family Before it seemed to me that I never had time to do anything else the truth is that there would be time but I couldn&#39;t find it There are so many important things outside football I started a winery la Cria Cuervos for now we make a white a red and a ros√© After my first game we will all toast together in the locker room I also learned to cook
