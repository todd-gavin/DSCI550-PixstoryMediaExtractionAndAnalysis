Believe me, it pains me to say this. 

I have been a lifelong fan on Comic book movies, I have seen them since I was 8 years old. Some of these characters have a major hand in who I am as a person. 

But that does not mean that I would disregard all the trauma that people have endured at the hands of that monster, Ezra Miller. They are responsible for so many wrongs that have transpired due to their behavior and how it will affect those teenagers and their parents for the rest of their lives. 

WB can find another Flash for DCEU, because none of the children should grow up having to see their abusers play a Superhero, that is as just and righteous as Barry Allen is. 

WB can afford to take a loss on this movie, and as a fan, believe me, I can stay not watching Michael Keaton don the Bat costume once again, if it means providing some relief to those kids
