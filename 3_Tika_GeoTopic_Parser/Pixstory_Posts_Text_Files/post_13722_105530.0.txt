Bernard Henri Levy, a French thinker who has visited Afghanistan many times, says the Taliban is becoming a full-fledged terrorist state.
 Resistance to the Taliban will take time, but the return of freedom fighters to the front is promising.
The main French writer and philosopher said about the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan that one of the main reasons for his "deep regret" for the abandonment of Afghanistan and its people by the United States and the West is that the world is in danger of a new "terrorist state" in Afghanistan. It was overthrown twenty years ago.

According to him, Western countries made a "big mistake" in believing that the Taliban wanted to establish a civil government and internationally accepted laws in Afghanistan.

The French media figure added that recognizing the Taliban regime would be another big mistake in the level of "disrespect" to the Afghan people.

Bernard Henri Levy described the current situation in Afghanistan as horrific because of the Taliban regime and equated it with al-Qaeda, terrorism and extremism.

He added that with the return of the Taliban to power, the Afghan people suddenly lost all the freedoms and privileges they enjoyed.

The famous French writer and philosopher said that the situation in Afghanistan today can be defined "only by likening it to the darkness of night": "Today blackness has returned to this proud and lovable country."
