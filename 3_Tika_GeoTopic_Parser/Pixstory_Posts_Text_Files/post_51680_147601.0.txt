Rudiger tells about their unexpected dinner with Real Madrid coach Ancelotti.
Antonio Rudiger explained an unexpected but appreciated dinner with coach Carlo Ancelotti while he was enjoying his first season with Real Madrid.
The 29-year-old German centre back left Chelsea on a free transfer and signed a four-year contract with Real Madrid in the summer. 
He has participated in each of the team's first six La Liga games, and earlier this month, they defeated RCD Mallorca and he scored a goal as well.
Rudiger began his interview by describing what it was like to arrive in the Spanish city during the summer.
He stated - 
"I had only been with my family in my new house for a few hours when the doorbell rang. I opened the door and it was Carlo Ancelotti. A shocking moment.
“He sat down at the table to eat with us and meet my family. He stayed for two hours, we talked about everything. 
“I had never experienced anything like that, no coach had ever done anything like that for me.”
Finally, Rudiger praised his new coach and talked about some of his impressive achievements.
“Don Carlo, a legend who was already collecting Champions League titles when I was a kid. Working with him on a daily basis at the most successful club in the world is wonderful.”
What do you think about this lovely gesture shown my Sir Ancelotti ? 
Who is the best manager according to you ? Tell me in the notes...
