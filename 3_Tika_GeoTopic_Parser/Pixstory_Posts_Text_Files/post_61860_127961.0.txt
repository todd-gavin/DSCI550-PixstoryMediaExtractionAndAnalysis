It depends how you determine the GOAT.

Here is my minimum requirements for goat:

Album sales

Influence/impact

Longevity/relevance

Discography

Overall Skill

Album sales, Eminem is the most selling rapper of all time.

Influence/impact….I would give Tupac the edge over Em..because since his untimely death in 96′ we are still talking about him to this day. Considering his short career.

Longevity/Relevance Em, Jay and Snoop have been around for 20+ years. Of the three Em is still doing better numbers than Jay and Snoop.

Overall Skill Eminem is a true MC and lyricist. He can rhyme his ass off. He can rap really fast with great cadence and delivery. His also a good storyteller.

Discography Now this is where the problems starts. In my top 5 list of greatest rappers Eminem has the most inconsistent discography. The Marshall Mathers LP 1&2 and The Eminem show are great. Infinite and the slim shady LP are aiight.

Then you have Encore, Relapse, Recovery and Revival…apart from a few songs, these albums are really bad.

I don't know if I expect too much from Em but I felt he half-assed those albums.

Kamikaze is only good.. because it was unexpected and Eminem only made it because of the backlash Revival got. As a standalone album, it's average at best.

I personally think it's disrespectful to all the great rappers that we've had, to pick one of them as the goat, without discrediting the rest.

But if you wanted to state that Eminem is greatest rapper of all time, you would have a strong case.
