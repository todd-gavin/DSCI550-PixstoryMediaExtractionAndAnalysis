Sassuolo does not go beyond Salernitana&#39;s home Game full of goals and with many controversies These are the words Alessio Dionisi the black and green coach We approached badly we could have done better in the first minutes thanks to Salernitana our demerit for the lack of intensity We have individual qualities el we showed team quality in the first half and we showed it in the second We played minutes in but we created From outside there was the feeling that we could have conceded the goal due to tiredness and so it was We are a team that needs to create we could be better in the first half at not conceding I&#39;m sorry I approached badly but I&#39;m satisfied because we tried to win it in the half despite being undeserved Raspadori&#39;s red card stems from a great desire to demonstrate and help the team the opponent didn&#39;t even touch him If Giacomo got it wrong, the evaluation was not right We have to accept because last Sunday we were lucky in the episodes today a little less Too bad we didn&#39;t win it because at a certain point we had many chances to win it Giacomo will make up for it with interest because he is an extraordinary and strong player Ad today I think we must be quite satisfied one line will come to an end Now we hope to continue to give continuity
