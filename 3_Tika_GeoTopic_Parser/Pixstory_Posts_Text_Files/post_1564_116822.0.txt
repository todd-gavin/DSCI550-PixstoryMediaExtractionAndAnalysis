The Nationals will entertain trade offers for superstar Juan Soto after he rejected a 15-year, $440 million contract offer. 
 
It’s nearly unprecedented. Why would Soto say no to nearly half a billion? The Nationals’ offer would have been the largest by total dollars in MLB history, but it also would have made Soto a National for life — keeping him under contract until age 38. It probably doesn’t help that the Nats (30-63) have the worst record in baseball.
