The former Southampton superstar, Jannik Vestergaard is attracting praise for his performances at both the club and international levels. The player is featuring for Denmark in the international circuit after not being able to get regular game time under Brendan Rodgers.

The central defender shone for Denmark in their game against France. Denmark went on to win 2-1 against the reigning World Cup champions, France. Jannik Vestergaard went on to be rock solid in the defense for his side against France. The player had two tackles and an aerial duel to his name in the UEFA Nations League fixture. 

Talking to the media during international duty, Jannik Vestergaard said: 

Matches are extremely important. After all, it's more competitive to play matches where it really matters than it is in training, but I have not become a worse football player in the last six months.

Of course, playing time is crucial over a long period of time, also to be the best version of myself. I'm working hard on that. I will be highly motivated when I return to Leicester to improve that and I think it will benefit me with a little break at the back of this and a full pre-season

Former Southampton star moved to Leicester City at the start of the 2021/22 season. Brendan Rodgers secured the services of the player for a fee of £15 million from the St Mary’s outfit. However, the game time has become hard to come by for the player. In the English Premier League 2021/22 season, the player featured only in ten games out of which Vestergaard started only in six games. 

With the FIFA World Cup 2022 on the sidelines, the player would want to play a huge number of matches in the 2022/23 season. Jannik Vestergaard is hopeful of returning to the team with a strong performance during the pre-season.
