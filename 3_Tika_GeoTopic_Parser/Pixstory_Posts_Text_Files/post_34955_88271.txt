The goal is to do the best tonight at the final of the indoor meters but first Marcell Jacobs will have to pass through the semifinal of The first race went well the blue recorded the fourth fastest time with a good reaction time but one exit from the starting blocks that could have been done better Before him came the Qatari Femi Ogunode and the two Americans Christian Coleman and Marvin Bracy who set the best time for the moment with a good start for the morning said Jacobs at the end of the first heat I&#39;m happy because I felt good about the first part I have to review the match from the outside to understand if everything went as I wanted but I stayed easy and checked the launch phase also because there are three rounds to run and it will be tough On the opponents in particular the two Americans It will be tough it will be really demanding this is not my world I knew it and I came on purpose to get out of my comfort zone and try to improve the part where I struggle more even in view of the meters which is the race that interests me most Being here and playing it with the best in the world in this important specialty because it is always good to have new stimuli
