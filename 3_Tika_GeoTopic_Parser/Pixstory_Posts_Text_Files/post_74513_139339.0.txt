Filmmaker Karan Johar is currently judging the popular dance reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa season 10 along with Madhuri Dixit and Nora Fatehi. ✅✅✅

KJo has been judging this show since season 5 and has been doing a pretty good job with his enigma. However, there are naysayers who are constantly criticising him and claiming that he gets a fat paycheque to judge reality shows. 😱😱😱😱😱

During an interview with Indian Express, KJo simply asked, “How do you know how much I get?” He then added that there is always a reason for the payment that one takes home. “I don’t think anyone gets what they don’t deserve. No one has put a gun on their head. So whatever money I earn is for a reason,” the Ae Dil Hai Mushkil director replied. 😳😳✔️🙏🙏🙏

When asked what he has to tell people who criticise his frequent appearances, Karan Johar shot back by saying, “The ones who are saying it are not there on screen na? So they must be feeling bad.”👍👍👍👍👍👍 

Meanwhile, Jhalak Dikhhhla Jaa 10 is one the most popular dance shows where the stars are seen dancing with the choreographers.The show premiered on September 3 onwards, every Saturday and Sunday at 8 PM on Colors.✅✅🎬🎬🎬🎬
