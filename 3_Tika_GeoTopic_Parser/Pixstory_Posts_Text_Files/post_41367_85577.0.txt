Donald Trump has fiercely challenged the foundations of Republican foreign policy that have characterised the party since World War II since the beginning of his first presidential campaign. 

U.S News reported that he made fun of John McCain's detention during the Vietnam War, used cliches to glorify autocrats, questioned long-standing military and security ties, and embraced an isolationist mindset. And, much to the dismay of many Republican leaders at the time, it succeeded, resonating with people who believed, among other things, that a bipartisan establishment in Washington had negotiated trade deals that harmed American workers and foolishly wandered into so-called "forever wars."

However, Russia's ruthless invasion of Ukraine is putting Trump and his "America First" credo to the test at a time when he is considering another presidential run and using this year's midterm elections to further bend the GOP to his way. He's largely alone in calling Russian President Vladimir Putin "clever," a description he repeated this week at talks to funders and conservative activists. Mike Pence, his usually submissive vice president, disagreed with him on the matter late Friday.

Meanwhile, the West has quickly banded together to stifle Russia's economy with coordinated sanctions, thanks to the global partnerships that Trump has frequently insulted. NATO, which Trump previously described as "obsolete," is exercising its muscles as a deterrent to Russian aggression.
