#6 Man United 1-6 Man City, October 2011
This contest was a punch on the throat to United players, as City made a mockery of them at Trafford. City were on the front foot, with Mario Balotelli being the scorer in 22 minutes. As their goals kept raining, the Italian again scored another before Aguero added a third. 
Substitute Edin Dzeko added a brace after David Silva's late fifth to round off the humiliating loss to Manchester City.
#5 Man City 2-3 Man United, April 2018
The two most famous managers, Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho met again, this time in Premier League. City were one win away from securing the title, and under Pep Guardiola they were a force to be reckoned with. 
City began the game with club captain Kompany and Ilkay Gundogan putting the Citizens two goals ahead. United looked lethargic, were outran and were hoping this wasn't another embarrassing defeat.
But when you have Mourinho, he can change any match on a whim, and that's what United did a brace from Paul Pogba and a winner from Chris Smalling, with 20 minutes to cue mayhem in city stands, but United managed to keep City onslaught at bay. 
#4 Man City 5-1 Man United, September 1989
Days after promotion to top-flight, City faced their city rivals, and a victory against them would be the cherry on top of the cake. But this was not anticipated to be a walk in a park for City. 
United had a tough day as their lackadaisical defending allowed David Oldfield, Trevor Morley and Ian Bishop to find the net before Mark Hughes's scissor kick gave hope, but it only lasted for a few minutes when Oldfield got his brace, restoring the three-goal lead, and Andy Hinchcliffe capped the win with a powerful header at the back post.
