I love travelling a lot and I believe everyone should take a chill pill during these crazy times and go on a vacation. Covid-19 had put us all in mental and physical jail for so long and it's our time to redeem it. At least I feel after seeing these pictures of Dwight! My next vacation will be in India! What beauty these monuments are! Spirituality and Aesthetics merge in India. Dwight seemed peaceful and content during his visit and very much Happy! I have visited India once the experience was so welcoming. I hope Dwight had the same.
