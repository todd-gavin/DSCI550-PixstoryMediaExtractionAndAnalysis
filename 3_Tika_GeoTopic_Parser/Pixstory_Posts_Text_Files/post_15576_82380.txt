Breast cancer is increasingly widespread but the opportunities for treatment and recovery are growing thanks to a therapeutic armamentarium that is being enriched In total, there are thousands of patients living in Italy with a diagnosis of breast cancer in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region alone I live at five years from the detection of the pathology and in most cases healing can be achieved Thanks to the diagnostic-therapeutic progress that has made it possible to obtain important results even in the most aggressive forms of the disease, what emerged last night in the webinar On the women&#39;s side Focus on Breast Cancer It is a pathology emblematic of the progress we have witnessed in oncology in recent years says Prof. Fabio Puglisi Director of the Department of Medical Oncology at the IRCCS CRO of Aviano and Scientific Director of the Conference We are living in an era in which scientific evolution is extremely rapid and continuous evolution There is therefore the need to extricate oneself in a more favorable situation for the patients but also with greater complexity to manage Today we are able to have much more biological information on the various subtypes of carcinomas and thus new avenues are opened for the development of drugs research is very important translational and therefore the close collaboration between the various specialists and also between clinicians and experimental oncologists Innovative strategies are also appearing on which it is essential to invest resources to implement the possibilities of healing this is the case of the liquid biopsy a non-invasive procedure that allows us a more precise diagnosis of the molecular nature of the carcinoma through the identification of alterations present in the DNA of Udine ample space dedicated to genomic tests which, after more than a year of introduction in our country, have finally been made reimbursable From a strictly scientific point of view, genomic tests must be part of daily clinical practice because they have undoubted advantages and make it possible to avoid treatment useless concluded Prof. Saverio Cinieri
