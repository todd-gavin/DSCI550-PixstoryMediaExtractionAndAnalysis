Today is Naseeruddin Shah's 72nd birthday! I'm sure everyone here has seen at least one movie starring this famous actor and director. His memorable performances in A Wednesday, Krrish, Vishwatam, and many more movies prove that his fame is truly earned. 

Naseeruddin Shah has starred in over 100 movies since his first movie, Nishant, in 1975. Since then, he has appeared in a number of films in Hindi, English, and other regional Indian languages.
In 2014, he published his autobiography, And then one day: A Memoir.

Naseeruddin Shah also directed a movie in 2006 by the name of Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota starring Irrfan Khan and Konkana  Sen Sharma. 

We wish Naseeruddin Shah a very happy birthday, and a great career ahead!
