If you have missed a dose, you should take your pill as soon as you remember. If it is close to the next scheduled time, you should take your medication as quickly as possible. You should use a backup method if it is more than a day away from the next scheduled time. 

If you are using a backup process, you should take your pill when you would take medicine if you are on time. If you are using a backup method, you should take it simultaneously every day. You should also take your pill with food or water.
