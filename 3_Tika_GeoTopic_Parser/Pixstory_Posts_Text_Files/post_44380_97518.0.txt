The Spaniard believes his colleague's extension at Anfield is "very excellent for the Premier League," but that it has no bearing on his own situation. Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City, has reacted to Jurgen Klopp's contract extension at Liverpool while being questioned about his own future as he nears the end of his term at the Etihad Stadium.

Klopp signed a new four-year deal at Anfield on Thursday, having been rewarded for another brilliant season that has seen Liverpool emerge as genuine candidates for the quadruple, becoming the first English team to do so.

With Guardiola at the helm, City can still derail Liverpool's title bid by winning the Premier League and Champions League, and the Spaniard isn't looking beyond the conclusion of the season, despite the fact that his own contract is set to expire in 2023.

During his six-year tenure at the Etihad Stadium, Guardiola has already won three Premier League crowns, one FA Cup, and four League cups, and he is extremely pleased in Manchester as his team continues to compete for titles on both the domestic and European fronts.

The 51-year-old is unconcerned about his long-term prospects, claiming that Klopp's choice to extend his contract with Liverpool has no influence on his personal status.

“Everyone has their own situation and if we decide to stay longer it's because we all decide together, not because of my colleague staying," Guardiola told a press conference ahead of City's trip to Leeds on Saturday.

"All my career, 14 or 15 years as a manager, I've had rivals. I think it’s really good for the Premier League that Jurgen’s signed. He decided and the club decided to stick together.

"I have an incredible relationship with the chairman and CEO. I’m incredibly happy and could not be in a better place. I can't visualise a better place.

"But it’s not just me, it’s many other things and situations, so we're going to think about it."
