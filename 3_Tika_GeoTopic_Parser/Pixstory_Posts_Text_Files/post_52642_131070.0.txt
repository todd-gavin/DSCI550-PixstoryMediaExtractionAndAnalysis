Music is my life, music is my soul
Music keeps me happy, music keeps me whole
Rapper Donovon Jenson

Music is magic that touches every heart and penetrates every soul. When words fail, music speaks. The connection has no barriers of a language, transcending time and space. When sorrow hits you, put on your favourite melody, turn up the volume, and let it turn over your soul. We all have one song which triggers an emotional response bringing a smile to our face or a tear in our eyes.

We have come a long way from recording songs to a touch of a button which brings our choice at any place or anytime. Of course, that era had its charm, while online streaming is interesting too.

Music stimulates the mind, is pleasing to the ears, and nurtures the soul. Do not you feel that sometimes the lyrics of a song are written just for you? You feel motivated and encouraged to move forward in life after hearing inspiring songs. The national anthem or a school prayer invokes fervor of patriotism like nothing else.

The music of Mozart and Beethoven lulled my infant daughter to a peaceful sleep for hours together, gaining sensitivity and a musical ear along the way. Melody may not cure us, but it has therapeutic potential.

The fatigue of a long and tiring commute goes away with good soothing music, and we experience a sense of awe and admiration after hearing our preferred music. One song brings back a flood of memories to drown your soul, and you come out refreshed after the soulful bath. A lullaby sung by a mother can put a cranky baby into a deep slumber. Music is a friend for teenagers uplifting their blues away while they bond with their tribe.
