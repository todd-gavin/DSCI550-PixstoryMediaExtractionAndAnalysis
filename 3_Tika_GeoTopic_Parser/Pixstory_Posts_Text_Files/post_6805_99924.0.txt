A photo of an ‘Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinic’ hoarding above a pile of garbage is viral on social media. Below it in smaller font is the name of the area, ‘Niti Vihar, Kirari, New Delhi’. BJP MP Nishikant Dubey tweeted the image and wrote, “This is Mr Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party-ruled Delhi’s Mohalla Clinic.” (Archive link) BJP MP Manoj Tiwari quote-tweeted the post and stated that this was the reality on the ground.

BJP MP Pravesh Sahib Singh also tweeted the image, claiming that this was one of the thousand Mohalla Clinics set up by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi. ( Link https://archive.is/PPyKt)

Several BJP workers and supporters, including Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha treasurer Sai Prasad, shared this picture with the same claim.

Fact-check
Alt News noticed that a user named Adil Azmi replied to Singh’s tweet with a video of the location where the viral photo was taken. Adil shared a video that showed the viral hoarding along with the Mohalla Clinic located a short distance away. In other words, this hoarding has been installed a short distance from the Mohalla Clinic. The user wrote that the Mohalla Clinic was located further inside while the board was put up on the main road so that visitors could find it easily.

Aam Aadmi Party also tweeted a second video from its official Twitter handle along with a picture of a hoarding of Mohalla Clinic in Kirari, clarifying that the viral claim was fake. It also termed the pile of garbage seen in the image as a failure on the BJP’s part since the Delhi Municipal Corporation has been under BJP control for 15 years.
