From the land that birthed Yoga itself comes Swami Vivekananda He was an Indian philosopher monk author and a nationalist struggling for India s freedom from the British US historians and literary gurus are well aware of this man from the speech Vivekananda gave at the World s Parliament of Religions in which he introduced Hinduism to America and urged for religious tolerance and an end to extremism He advocated a religion that was inclusive of many different creeds and was founded not on any particular faith but rather on personal experience Such a religion according to Vivekananda did not need belief because it had no dogmas and was entirely compatible with a rationalist worldview One book he wrote that I m a fan of is Raja Yoga It was originally a series of lectures His translation of The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali an ancient collection of Sanskrit verses by Sage Patanjali of India serves as the book s concluding chapter The book covers themes of spirituality which is the core of Yoga unlike what we believe in the states It talks about the level and steps to attain that level of meditation that grants you psychological tranquility The steps of being a true yogi But other than that one of the reasons why it s worth reading and the reason I read it is that it gives an insight into the mind of the man that was a pioneer in not only bringing but establishing his culture to the west
