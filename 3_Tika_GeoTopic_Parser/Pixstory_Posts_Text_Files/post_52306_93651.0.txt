Most Australians are easy to talk to about sports. They enjoy talking about it because they are generally good at it. Despite its relatively small population of around 22.5 million people, Australia frequently finds itself in the top five of the medals table at the Olympics. For every Olympic medal won by Australia in Beijing, there are fewer than 500,000 Australians. The figure for the United States is 2.7 million. Outside of the Olympics, Australia has won nine world championships in rugby league, twice in rugby union, and had arguably the most dominant cricket team in history in the 1990s. They even have their own sport, Australian Rules Football, which they play when other countries are resting.

But what is it about them that makes them so good at sports? When I asked them this in an attempt to find out, they were only too happy to assist. Professor Hans Westerbeek is the Director of Victoria University's Institute of Sport, Exercise, and Active Living. He was born in the Netherlands and moved to Australia in 1994, and his love of sports is reflected in the fact that he conducted a phone interview while riding an exercise bike.

"Australia has used sport to identify itself for the past 200 years, as it has very little history to fall back on." "Sport is a form of expression in Australia," he says.
