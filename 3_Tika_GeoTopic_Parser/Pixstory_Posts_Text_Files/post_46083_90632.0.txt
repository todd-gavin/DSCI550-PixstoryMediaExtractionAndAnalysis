Fortunately, the “real world (and real America)” has access to top class media and is more than capable of keeping up with views from the entertainment and political fields at the same time. 

It is very easy to write off the incident as “glitterati gasp” but we have to remember that what happened today sheds light on the much deeper problematic issues in our society like ableism and making jokes at the expense of black women.

Coming to the political side, it is being said that “If we want to end the war in Ukraine, diplomats need to find a solution...and that involves Putin, whether we like it or not.” - The animosity between US and Putin has already turned into an adversity for Ukraine. For once in our history can we stop with making everything about the US? 
“We” should not be  focusing on finding a solution for the war, rather we should be focusing on our internal matters.
