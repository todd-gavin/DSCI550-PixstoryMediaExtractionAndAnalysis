By Shivaji Dasgupta Kolkata: Well, truthfully, this could well be Diwali or any other mainstream Indian festival, to qualify as justifiably accused. While a large section of the citizenry is obsessed with revelry, an increasingly significant populace is slogging with enforced disregard for holidays or even humane shifts.As per the latest learned data points, the Durga Puja micro economy in West Bengal alone is worth about Rs. 40,000 crores, that too at conservative estimates. While a chunk of this is the creative economy, which does the honors before the holidays commence, a considerable volume is generated by the point-in-time service economy, from public utilities to private indulgences.
