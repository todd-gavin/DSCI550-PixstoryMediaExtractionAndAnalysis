The subject of a viral video, where the offender destroyed property and threatened men and women in a McDonalds with an axe, was let go without bail. But, as we’ve already seen with New York’s backwards bail reform laws, he has been arrested again for spraying graffiti and stealing a $3,500 bike.Oh, and did I forget to mention… he was released without bail again.When will the insanity end? I understand that maybe people shouldn’t be locked up for extended periods of time while they await trial, especially for low-level crimes. But threatening people with a deadly weapon? Getting rear-rested for grand larceny after you were out with no bail? At what point will we finally say, “maybe this is going too far.”Of course, not every single person let out without bail is committing another crime. But in the cases we have seen, they often clearly could have been prevented.
