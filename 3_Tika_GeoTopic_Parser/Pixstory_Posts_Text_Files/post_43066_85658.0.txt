American actor and director Sean Penn spoke about his impressions of his two meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an interview with CNN.

He said he met with Zelensky the day before the invasion and then on the day of the invasion.

" I don’t know if he knew that he was born for this, but it was clear that I was in the presence of something new, new for the modern world,” Penn recalled.

“Courage, dignity and ... love that comes from a person. And the way he united the country.”
