A photo of Arvind Kejriwal with Bhagwant Mann is widely being circulated on social media. In the photo, it appears that the two politicians are sitting outside a government registered liquor store. Punjab is going to the polls next month and this photo is being shared at a time when there are reports that the AAP will announce Bhagwant Mann as the CM candidate.

The photo has also been shared to mock the AAP-led Delhi government’s new liquor policy under which 400 liquor vend licenses were issued to private players last year. Moreover, the Delhi government plans to start home delivery of liquor very soon and had introduced a bill related to it in June 2021.

On Twitter, the photo was shared by Kamaljeet Sehrawat, the former mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. It drew over 11,000 likes and more than 2,000 retweets.

Morphed image
From the very first look, it is obvious that the photo is manipulated. To understand the level of manipulation, we performed an ELA (Error Level Analysis) on the photo using FotoForensics. Below we have uploaded the result. The pixels in purple tell us that there has been some manipulation.

It is important to note that ELA is just one factor that helps determine whether an image is manipulated or not, and it cannot be accepted as a piece of conclusive evidence. But there are some other red flags that can be observed in this image:

. The quality of the image is different depending upon where you look. If you look at the two politicians in the front, they appear to be more pixelated while the background appears to be more sharp/defined.
. The lighting is uneven — Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal have a different level of exposure to the Sun compared to the background.
