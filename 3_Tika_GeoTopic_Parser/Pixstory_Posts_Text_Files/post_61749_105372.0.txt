Warriors were never going out peacefully. 

A fight back was expected from the warriors in the second game and that is exactly what they delivered as they crushed Celtics as they ended the Game 2 (107-88) in their favour. 

The NBA Finals are now tied with one victory a piece. 

Golden State put the game on lockdown by going on a 12-minute scoring spree in the second half, in which they established a winning lead against the Celtics with 41-12. 

Multiple Warriors felt that this was possible because of the way the game started.Â Celtics got very comfortable with the position and the way they were playing in Game 1, but it didn't work this time like it did last time. Warriors always kept them on their toes. 

This resulted in Celtics making a lot of mistakes, as Celtics turned the ball over 11 times during the first two quarters of the game. 

The defense of the Warriors looked more in tune in this game, as they were properly coordinated, putting the pressure on the edge of the box, not letting shooters like Al Harford and Marcus smart who turned the game around in Game 1, to score 2 points each. 

Warriors worked hard for that win, and the performance yesterday will surely put a smile on their faces.
