While it's important to understand climate change and its impact on the world, most importantly how humans contribute to it, it's also just as important to recognise which humans are in fact to be blamed for it.

In all honesty, individuals are almost blameless. Or at least, have to bear a lot less blame. Climate change is a gift of industries. It is a planetary issue and individuals have little hand in it.

According to research, only 100 corporations have been responsible for 71% of worldwide emissions since 1988. Surprisingly, over the same time period, only 25 firms and state-owned enterprises were responsible for more than half of worldwide industrial emissions.

Oil producing companies, Animal Agriculture Industry, mining industry etc are to mostly be blamed. Not to mention, rich countries polluting poor countries for fashion, exotic food etc. Putting the blame on the public who's barely managing on its own is not the solution. The rich and the government must make substantial changes.

It's not to say individuals shouldn't do anything because some responsibility falls on us too. Like trying to avoid supporting these industries as much as possible, reducing your meat intake as much as possible or straight up eliminating it, avoid fast fashion and stick to sustainable ones, support BIPoC organizations fighting climate change against the rich countries in the Global South. Small changes make big difference.
