India’s long history is a saga of cultural fusion. The Indus Valley and
Harappan Civilization had covered a vast area of the country. Even now,
the last word has not been said on the true extent of this civilization. The creative energies of the people of the Indus Valley found expression in
architecture and sculpture. What followed is an unbroken history of five
thousand years of cultural evolution. The Indo-Aryans, a pastoral people
who migrated to this land from Iran after the decline of the Indus Valley
Civilization, enriched the cultural and religious life of India through their
profound thoughts and ideas on man and his existence. The fusion that
took place between the descendants of the Indus Valley Civilization and
the Indo-Aryans was the most momentous event in the history of India.

The India that was born out of this fusion gave mankind a profound and
versatile philosophy that is eternal in its appeal. The core of this philosophy
is: ‘Truth is one, but wise men say it differently.’ The pluralistic instinct
of Indians is shaped by this philosophy. The assimilative spirit of the people
of this country is a manifestation of the profound influence this philosophy
had on their minds. India became a veritable melting pot in which different
human races merged to form one people. Naturally, different strands of
thoughts and ideas became the warp and woof of the Indian cultural fabric.

Hindu religion, which is the dominant religion in the subcontinent, is
itself a kind of amalgam of different faiths. Hinduism and the other religions
that originated here – like Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism – are in fact
the true inheritors of the culture that evolved over five millennia in this
land.
