Tottenham Hotspur are arguably the most baron club in the PL s Big six The last time the Spurs won a trophy was back in when they won the EFL Cup But going into the season the North London club could finally end their trophyless run Here s Why The Spurs signed Antonio Conte after sacking Nuno Espirito Santo in November At that time the North London club was struggling in the league and looked set to finish outside the European spots However the Italian tactician steadied the ship and helped them finish th in the Premier League Finishing in the Champions League spot certainly brought its fruits The Spurs owner Daniel Levy spent big in the summer Tottenham signed the likes of Ivan Perisic Richarlison Djed Spence Clement Lenglet Yves Bissouma and Frazer Forster in order to boost their squad With Harry Kane and Hueng Min Son firing on all cylinders Tottenham seem to have covered all the pieces of the jigsaw To add to this Antonio Conte organised an intense preseason for the players starting from early July itself This showed how serious the former Premier League winner was as he wanted to justify his role at the club Can Tottenham win the Premier League this season Well the Spurs do have an outside chance but Liverpool and Manchester City would remain the favourites heading into the league However we can expect the club to go deep in the FA Cup and League Cup as we expected them to play their strongest XI in the latter stages The writer certainly does think so But It has to be seen if Spurs can actually be the wildcards this season
