Everyone has occasionally gazed in awe at the stunning red and orange of the sunset. These everyday marvels make us feel at peace. Ever so often, pink and purple hues take over for the reds and oranges. This change in colour makes for an even more impressive sky. 
But why does this happen? How does the sky turn pink? 

Rays of light travel through 30-40% more atmosphere during sunrises and sunsets, as well as more dust and water vapour, before the light reaches the human eye. 
In the spectrum, the shorter violet and blue wavelengths disperse outside of the range of human vision. The longer yellow, orange, and red light wavelengths do not scatter as much light, though. As a result, the sky adopts a yellow, orange, and red colour scheme.

You might be wondering how the colour "pink" got its name because it isn't a visible spectrum wavelength and only appears when red and white are combined. Pink is viewed by experts as a red wavelength variation.
When it comes to the science of the pink sunset, it all has to do with the peculiar tricks that light can play with colour. Also, how far sunlight must travel and how many "atmospheric particles" it must pass before reaching our sight. The more airborne particles there are, the more light is scattered, making the sky appear more colourful.
Studies indicate that more aerosols need to be present in the atmosphere to get a red or pink sky. Fine solid or liquid particles in the air known as aerosols can come from both natural and man-made sources.

So next time you see a pink sunset, you know how those vivid colours came to be.
