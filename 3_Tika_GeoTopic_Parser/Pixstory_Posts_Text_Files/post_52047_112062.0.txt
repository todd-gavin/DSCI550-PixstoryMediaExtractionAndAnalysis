Tilly Monaghan got very used to being called a "hippy" when she and her husband first bought and moved into their off-the-grid property in central NSW almost a decade ago.

But these days, she's no longer copping derisive remarks and is instead fielding detailed questions about how they manage to live disconnected from water, sewerage and electricity services.

"People are a lot more interested in it and are always asking things like, 'How do you cook? How do you boil water?'" Monaghan said.

Soaring house, food and energy prices - as well as fears over climate change - appear to have made off-the-grid living an increasingly attractive option, with many people who once considered it too alternative now considering taking the leap.

Facebook groups dedicated to the lifestyle have reported large influxes of new members.

Bek Morris helps run the popular "Off-the-grid Australia" Facebook page, which now has almost 200,000 members.

"This year alone has seen the group nearly double in numbers," she said, adding the interest started during the pandemic and just kept going from there.

"Ever since COVID hit, I've noticed a lot of people trying to get away from the city and go rural.

"The cost of living has also driven people out to this way of life, as well as the rental crisis, and more people want to be self-sufficient."

'You can't just flick on a kettle'

Monaghan said she and her husband, Enda, fell into off-the grid living almost by chance, but the affordable lifestyle was definitely a drawcard.

"We had been looking for a property to buy for a long time and we've been really struggling to find something within our budget and something that we both saw potential in," she said.

"We came across this property and we both fell in love with it. 

"It just so happened to be not connected to the grid."
