 Bielsa forces his team to concede a goal An act of sportsmanship from Bielsa saw when Leeds United scored a controversial goal through Mateusz Klich whilst a rival player was injured on the pitch and was waiting for the medical team Although Mateusz Klich didn t stop and score a goal this agitated Aston Villa s bench but Bielsa ordered to let Aston Villa score a goal after an unfair goal by his player As the match ended but the game will forever be remembered for Bielsa s honesty Hazard kicks the ball boy We never imagined a Hazard calibre player would do a discomfiting thing in football Hazard made headlines for all the wrong reasons on his first day as Chelsea player in a FA Cup match against Swansea City the Belgian was trying to get the ball back from the ball boy who was not in a mood to give him back and this fuelled Hazard who eventually kicked the boy and this escalated in opposition confronting him as he earned a red card and received a lot of criticism Newcastle players fighting each other On the pitch fights have become common in football and you ll notice these things often But what is strange is players from the same team getting involved in a physical fight and it happened in in Newcastle when pair Kieran Dyer and Lee Bowyer went head to head However many did not know the reason for the fight and when the ball was in Villa s half the two players were already kicking each other It took opposition to separate the two of them Ali Dia transfer a scam in Premier League A prank that made headlines in Europe in as it was labelled as one of the worst signings in Southampton history Southampton signed Ali Dia a Senegalese international after being recommended by their legendary player and Ballon d Or winner George Weah But it later turned out to be a prank when Dia made his debut and without doing any research Southampton learned it was someone else pretending to be George Weah suggested them with this Alia Dia thing
