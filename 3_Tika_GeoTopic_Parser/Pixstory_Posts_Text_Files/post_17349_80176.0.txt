PSG’s Lionel Messi surprised former Manchester United youngster Angel Gomes at the end of their clash against Lille.

Lionel Messi was one of the stars during the 5-1 victory as he set up Presnel Kimpembe in addition to scoring a trademark lob in the 38th minute. Angel Gomes enrolled in the Manchester United academy at the age of six and joined Lille in August 2020 after refusing to sign an extension.

Gomes has scored twice for Lille this season but is yet to open his Ligue 1 account despite having 13 appearances under his belt. The 21-year old Portuguese was given a huge surprise when Lionel Messi stopped him to exchange jerseys after the game. The two set of players were on their way to the dressing room when Messi stopped Gomes.

The duo shook hands and hugged before going their separate ways. Angel Gomes decided to leave Manchester United despite being offered a contract extension. The Portuguese attacking midfielder believed he was ready for more regular gametime. However, he was deemed not ready for the Premier League considering his overall physique.

On the other hand, Messi will be happy to kickstart his Ligue 1 campaign after scoring what was only his second league goal.
