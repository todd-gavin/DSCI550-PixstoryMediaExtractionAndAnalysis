My mom doesn t bake much nor is she a desert person which is why this dish was so over the top A raspberry cream cheesecake My mum knows I love raspberries more than anything so she went outside her comfort zone to make me something I love This makes the food even more special every bite I took it was filled with a caring mother s love and that s a feeling one may not get to see everyday
