Familiarised with the condition dementia a lot more studies about it is sprouting in the field. A new study was published in the Journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia and it reports that by consuming multivitamins daily it could help in cognitive decline. 
The study included more than 2,200 people who were above 65 without any signs of Alzheimer’s disease at the beginning of the study. Each of these participants assigned a group consuming: 
• Multivitamin
• Cocoa extract supplements
• Multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements
• Placebos
The participants agreed upon taking the supplements daily for three years. They were assessed annually for overall cognitive, memory and other executive functions. 
The researchers said that by the end of the second year, the benefits started showing up. Those who took the multivitamin showed an improvement in the memory and executive function which is compared to the others in the group. The multivitamins slowed the cognitive decline by over a 60% or 1.8 years.
“The use of a multivitamin for patients with memory loss is something I routinely do in my neurology practice,” Dr. Clifford Segil, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, told Healthline. “This study is refreshing to read as it attempts to quantify the potential benefits of multivitamins in patients with memory loss.”
