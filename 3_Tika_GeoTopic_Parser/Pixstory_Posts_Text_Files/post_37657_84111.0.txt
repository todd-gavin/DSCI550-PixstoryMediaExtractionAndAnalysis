After sealing the two-match T20I series 2-0, India will aim to sweep the series when they take on Sri Lanka in the third and final game at the picturesque HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala. Shreyas Iyer smashed a fifty before Ravindra Jadeja whacked 45 in 18 balls to help India defeat Sri Lanka in the second T20I by seven wickets on Saturday. Sanju Samson also chipped in with a 25-ball 39, accelerating at the right time to keep the required run rate in check. With plenty of talent in the wings, Rohit Sharma went with a different starting eleven and named four changes from the previous T20I win. Opener Ishan Kishan sustained a head injury in the previous T20I. The left-handed opener has been ruled out of the game and we could see a fresh opening pair. The team management has got Sanju Samson, who has the ability to start the innings and bat in middle-order as well. India would be aiming to get the 12th consecutive T20I win to equal Afghanistan's record for most T20I wins consecutively by a Test-playing nation. And they have a realistic chance of achieving the feat with their wide talent pool.
