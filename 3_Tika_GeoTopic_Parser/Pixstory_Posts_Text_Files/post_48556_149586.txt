Parents go through a lot to raise children It s not wrong to make mistakes They can t always be perfect Yes they sometimes have to be firm with their kids but that doesn t mean we don t love them Telling your kids that they shouldn t be taking things their parents do for them for granted is not wrong It is a part of parenting They deserve to know that life doesn t come easy Children should understand that their parents are also humans and we can make mistakes They need to learn to forgive They can t just leave their parents when they grow up that s just ungrateful Somebody invests their entire life in you and you leave them when they need you Children should be taught gratitude from a young age They should be taught that their parents never mean wrong for them
