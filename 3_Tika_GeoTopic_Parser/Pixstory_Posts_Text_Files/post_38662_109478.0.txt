Making dizzy and fast runs, dribbling opponents at ease. Being a wing-back, he has fewer defensive duties. His main defensive duties come to foray in 1 vs 1 defending. Raum is a good player, but due to his sloppy footwork and bad body positioning which usually leads the opposition attacker to come inside and take a shot. He is not a complete defender and he can certainly look forward to improving his game.

Defensive Acumen


Looking at his defensive side of the game, it’s safe to say that the German needs to improve the defensive side of his play. He is not very active in gaining possession. He does decently in engaging in defensive actions. He ranks 3.56 in his defensive actions. He has made 109 defensive actions, which puts him behind Stefan Posch who has made 112 of them.

He is an attacking fullback and he seems to forget his defensive duties as he has made very fewer goal-line clearances and blocking players. He has made 1.66 of these both respectively per 90. 


One thing to note is that what he lacks usually, he makes up for it with his attacking intent, running up and down the pitch. He is one of the attacking fullbacks if not Europe, he is behind Trent Alexander Arnold who betters him.

Goal Scoring Threat


Along with 11 assists, he has scored 3 goals for his team. He takes the opportunity to score whenever there is an opportunity.
