Well today I m here to share one of the most annoying yet memorable moments with my sibling elder sister To start with like every other sibling even my sister have narrated that fish seller story to me One day out of the blue she started saying that I don t belong to this family And they got me from a fish seller who came to our house to sell fish The fish seller was absolutely careless that when she left she had forgotten to take her child along with her Out of great sympathy daddy mommy and I chose to look after you from then onwards After listening to the whole tale I broke down and the emotional pain was huge when my mommy chose to side with my sister while narrating this incident And when dad came I asked him about this incident and his reply was indeed savage and legit comforting He said that my mom and sister are the ones who are actually adopted and that s the reason why they re trying way too hard to pass on the embarrassment to a different person And years later when I recollect all such witty incidents from my childhood all I could do is nothing but laugh really hard thinking how embarrassing and sensitive I was back in my childhood I m sure that all of you have had such witty yet heartbreaking incidents back in your childhood Do share so that all of us can have a hearty laugh Thanks for reading Wishing you all good health happiness and prosperity
