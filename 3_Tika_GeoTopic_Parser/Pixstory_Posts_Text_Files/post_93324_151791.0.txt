In 2014, Nigerian government passed Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, which bars queer relationships or public signs of affection between queer folks, with punishments of up to 14 years in prison.

Now, All Progressives Congress (APC) party, has introduced a bill as an amendment that would make it illegal for a person to wear clothes in public that do not ‘match their gender assigned at birth’, or in photos or videos for a private event. 

This bill targets transgender and non-binary people primarily, and revives the archaic concept of ‘cross-dressing’ to police trans and nonbinary folks. 

Trans rights advocates believe that if the bill is passed, it can increase the number of harrassment and attacks against trans folks.
