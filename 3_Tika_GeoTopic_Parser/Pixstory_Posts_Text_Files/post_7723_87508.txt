The Oscar season is here and this year its gonna go down to the wire In this post I ll be giving my predictions for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role but before that lets take a look at the nominees Penelope Cruz former oscar winner thoroughly deserves this nomination for her amazing performance in Parallel Mothers Madres paralelas She plays the role of Janis in the Spanish movie Kristen Stewart is one who many movie fans want to see winning the award for her role as Princess Diana in Spencer She portrays her role to perfection in the movie and earns her first Oscar nomination Jessica Chastain has been nominated for the movie The Eyes of Tammy Faye She just won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for this role She did an amazing job of playing the role of Tammy Faye in this biopic She has been nominated twice but has never won an Academy Award Olivia Colman has again been nominated for an Academy Award and this time again she is one of the favourites She has been nominated for her role in The Lost Daughter its a poignant performance and might as well give her a second academy award She won the award in for her role in the movie The Favourite Nicole Kidman has been nominated for playing the role of Lucille Ball in Being the Ricardos this nomination comes almost after years of winning her only Academy Award She was brilliant in the movie and with her two co actors also being nominated in other categories it seems the Academy likes the movie which make her chance to win the award pretty good I think that Kristen Stewart might be the one to take home the award for her magnificent performance in Spencer She has delivered the performance of her lifetime and deserves to be recognised with this award It would an amazing feat for her to win the award with such brilliant nominees all of whom have been tremendous in their movies
