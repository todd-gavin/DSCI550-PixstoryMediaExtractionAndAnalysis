Nellie Bly, was an American journalist, industrialist, inventor, and charity worker who was known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she worked undercover to report on a mental institution from within.

In 1887 Cochrane left Pittsburgh for New York City and went to work for Joseph Pulitzer’s New York World. One of her first undertakings for that paper was to get herself devoted to the asylum on Blackwell’s (now Roosevelt) Island by pretending insanity. Her exposé of conditions among the patients, published in the World and later collected in Ten Days in a Mad-House (1887), accelerated a grand-jury investigation of the asylum and travelled to bring about needed improvements in patient care. Similar reportorial gambits took her into sweatshops, jails, and the legislature. She was far and away from the best-known woman journalist of her day.

She was a pioneer in her field and initiated a new kind of investigative journalism. Her first articles, on situations among working girls in Pittsburgh, slum life, and other related topics, marked her as a reporter of ingenuity and interest. At a time when a woman’s contribution to a newspaper was generally constrained to the “women’s pages,” Cochrane was given a rare opportunity to report on wider issues. In 1886–87 she travelled for several months through Mexico, sending back reports on official corruption and the condition of the poor. Her sharply critical articles outraged Mexican officials and caused her expulsion from the country.

In 1998, Bly was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Bly was one of four journalists respected with a US postage stamp in a "Women in Journalism" set in 2002.
