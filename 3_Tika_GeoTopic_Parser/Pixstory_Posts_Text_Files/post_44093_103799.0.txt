According to reports, Spanish side Sevilla are reportedly considering a bid for English midfielder Harry Winks. Winks, who is deemed as surplus to requirements at Tottenham can leave the club for a fee of between £20m-£25m.

Winks, who has made 200 appearances for Spurs and 10 English caps, has fallen down the order with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentacur shining in the midfield for Spurs since January.

Many had touted winks to be the long wanted replacement for Luka Modric at the heart of Tottenham’s midfield. And when he burst onto the scene, he seemed set for greatness. Winks started training with Tottenham’s senior squad back in 2013-2014.

Primarily a center midfielder, Winks is versatile - which lets the manager play him in front of defense or in an attacking midfielder role when needed. He has drawn comparison to Andres Iniesta in the past, which demonstrates his potential. Mauricio Pochettino has fondly referred to him as "Little Iniesta."

Winks likes being on the ball and controlling the tempo of the game, leaving the role of being the disruptor to more defensive minded midfielders in the team. Due to his size, he is often able to dribble past defenders and win fouls, helping create pressure on opponents and drive the team forward.

Winks drifts all over the field, as evidenced by his average position map for Spurs. While this means that the team is more susceptible to being caught out on the counter attack, in possession Winks remains a threat.

Physically however, Winks often gets bullied off the ball due to his thin frame. Winks also does not score enough goals or get into goal scoring positions that might be expected of a player in his position in the modern game. In a slower league, with more focus on technique, Harry Winks might thrive.
