Today we celebrate International Lefthanders Day Being a left hander was never an easy journey for me Not because I ain t equally capable and efficient like my peers who are righthanded but because of the fact that I live in a world that s designed for righthanders Right from kindergarten to college I have had quite a lot of people asking me the same set of questions Didn t your parents notice that you are lefthanded Why didn t they correct you from a young age Why didn t they take an effort to make you a righthander And whenever I googled about lefthanders I got to read a lot of myths and a few scientifc facts which portrayed the sunnyside of being a lefthanded person Myths or facts over the past many years such random facts have instilled a lot of confidence in me and I take immense pride in being a part of the rare percentage of world s population While in school during Informatics period almost all of my classmates were able to use computer so effortlessly except for or lefthanders including me And back in my school days out of great passion for music I joined a violin class in my locality Unfortunately that s when I realized that all instruments like violin guiter etc are designed primarily for righthanders If a lefthander wanted to be good at such instruments then they should be either ambidextrous or they should re tune the strings Inspite of all these odds I m a proud lefthander and i don t regret my parent s decision of not changing me into a righthander Instead I m indeed happy for they let me live the way I m And the best thing is that now I m ambidextrous Dear lefthanders out there You are equally good Someday if you re feeling low just think about Barack Obama Mark Twain Angelina Jolie Albert Einstein Leonardo da Vinci and the list goes on on Thanks for reading Wishing you all good health happiness and prosperity
