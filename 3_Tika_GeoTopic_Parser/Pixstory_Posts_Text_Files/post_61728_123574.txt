Spirituality is understanding what makes you restless You have to understand what it is that makes you feel restless Whatever makes you restless is not your real nature You are not born to be restless Find out what keeps you restless and what will really help you get rid of that restlessness Restlessness is right now The change that you want you want that change right now So restlessness is right now So we have said two things One it is certain that we are dissatisfied there is restlessness this restlessness is evident in every action It is evident in the way we walk we eat and we talk to others It is evident in the way we use the mobile phone it is evident in the way we approach our career It is evident that we are restless This is the first thing The second thing is that we have found false solutions false treatments for our restlessness Those false treatments will not work Find out the real treatment And when you try to find the real treatment you will incidentally discover that there is no real disease The real disease is that you want treatment in the future You look at the mind and it becomes silent Right now as you are listening to me there is no problem You are alright You are fine But the moment the mind starts wandering again there will be lots of problems This lack of attention is the problem Nothing else is the problem
