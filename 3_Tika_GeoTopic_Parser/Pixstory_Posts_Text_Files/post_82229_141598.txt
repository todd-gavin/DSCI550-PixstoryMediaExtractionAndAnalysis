What is that one book which makes you forget that you are reading instead just living in the world between the pages For me it was reading Sherlock Holmes All the novels and short stories were like reality and I was watching from the side when Sherlock was sitting in his armchair in his apartment on Baker s Street or walking down foggy London streets gathering facts or chasing a criminal Each and every scientific detail was well put from knowledge of rare poisons to simple but telltale details Such abundant knowledge made me want to learn more of the author I was impressed by his scientific logical scheming But actually despite all his scientific logic Doyle was a big follower of Spiritualism the belief that the dead are able to communicate with the living through an earthly conduit or medium He spent a large part of his life researching fairies ghosts and paranormal However in December Sir Arthur Conan Doyle unwittingly have credence to existence of fairies He published his article on fairies in the Strand Magazine with pictures These pictures were taken by two young girls Elsie Wright and her cousin Frances Griffith At first it was nothing just a family puzzle But when Polly Wright Elsie s mother presented it to Bradford Theosophical Society it garnered attention and debate Doyle got the pictures checked by various experts including Kodak The company s expert technicians inspected the pictures but couldn t detect any sort of tampering This made Doyle even more sure of his claim According to him when our fairies are admitted other psychic phenomena would find a more ready acceptance But alas after his death Elsie and Frances declared that they had actually faked the photographs People criticized Doyle for being so easily taken in Doyle emerged from a time where he could use anything to get a respite from the cruel reality especially after losing his son in the Great War Was the grief and disappointment in reality what made him believe in the supernatural Or did he try to bring life into the fictions he was weaving by asserting these strange claims
