Josh Radnor's "Liberal Arts" is an almost unreasonable pleasure about a jaded New Yorker who returns to his alma mater in Ohio and finds that his heart would like to stay there. It's the kind of film that appeals powerfully to me; to others, maybe not so much.

Liberals arts is one of those movies that stay with you for a long time. It's a great story of how two individuals mature beyond their age have a hard time fitting in with the people of their age groups. 

It's a silly little flick with a great message that we should try to live our life and not look forward to or not look back and reminisce any parts of our life. 

Just enjoy where you're at and be happy
