 Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film maker and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot In a voice over commentary Cutter an elderly deviser of magic equipment and a respectful very knowing artisan among artists explains that a magic performance unfolds in three stages The first is the Pledge wherein we re shown something the second the Turn centres on a disappearance in the climactic third part the Prestige a person or object is miraculously brought back leaving the audience stunned and delighted This sequence of events informs the structure of the film as well as the tricks the most significant of which is known as the Transported Man Angier and Borden come to have different competing versions of this legendary trick The two men begin as friends then when an act goes lethally wrong they become rivals and increasingly deadly enemies The movie beautifully creates the world of stage illusion and the workshops in which the tricks are created as well as looking at the ethos the ethics and the ambitions of the performers Angier is a second rate magician but a brilliant showman Borden is a magician of genius but poor at presenting himself Their relationship in some ways resembles that between Salieri and Mozart in Amadeus The rivalry drives both men towards acts of madness and the film asks what it is that produces this urge to deceive and to puzzle and why the public delights in being manipulated fooled and astonished It s certainly a movie that is worth your time
