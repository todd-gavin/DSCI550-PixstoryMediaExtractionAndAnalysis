FIFA's president sought Monday to dispell lingering doubts about Qatar's rights record ahead of the World Cup as the footballing body said it is negotiating measures to help migrant workers on the Gulf state's construction sites.
Gianni Infantino said "Qatar has delivered amazing" results with the multi-billion dollar stadiums, metro system and huge construction projects prepared for the tournament that is expected to bring one million fans to the Gulf state from November 20.
But rights groups have stepped up pressure on FIFA in recent weeks to set up a special fund to compensate workers, mainly from South Asia, who were killed, injured, or lost wages on construction projects.
Repeated concerns have also been expressed, particularly in Europe, over the rights of women and the LGBTQ community.
Asked about the establishment of a fund, FIFA spokesman Bryan Swanson told a press conference that the global body was talking with the Qatari government, the UN's labour agency and international unions. He promised an announcement "in due course".
"FIFA remains in positive ongoing dialogue with the International Labour Organisation and the International Trade Union Confederation and all relevant authorities in Qatar over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup," Swanson said.
Qatari officials at the press conference did not comment on the talks.
Amnesty International and other groups have demanded that FIFA set up a $450 million fund for migrant workers and their families who suffered during the decade of construction leading up to the World Cup.
Under pressure from international groups, Qatar has embarked on major changes to improve conditions for the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers on the huge construction projects that have transformed the energy-rich state.
