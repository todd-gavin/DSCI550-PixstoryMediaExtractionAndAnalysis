The European football season is close to completion and it is the awards season in both men's
and women's football. As declared on the official Twitter handle of the UEFA Women’s
Champions League, the Barcelona women's skipper, Alexia Putellas wins the UEFA Women’s
Champions League best player award for the 2021/22 season.

The star midfielder inspired the team to register the title without any competition. Alexia Putellas
also led the team to the finals of the UEFA Women’s Champions League but failed to win the
title. The French outfit, Lyon trumped Barcelona 3-1 in the showpiece finale held at Juventus
Stadium.

Alexia Putellas' performance in 2021/22:

The Blaugrana midfielder was the highest goalscorer for the side with 11 goals to her name in
the Champions League. Also, she scored in the 41st minute to make it 1-3 against Lyon in the
first half. However, she could not take the team over the line in the final. Alexia Putellas also had
two assists to her name in the competition.

Also, Putellas scored 30 goals across all competitions for Barcelona Femini in the 2021/22
season. She is once again the contender for the Ballon d'Or Feminin after winning it for the first
time in 2021. Barcelona won the La Liga Primera Division by a staggering 24 points. They were
ruthless in front of the goal as they had scored 159 goals in the entire season.

Henry wins the Best Goal of the Season award:

Lyon midfielder Henry was awarded the "Goal of the Season" for her long-range effort in the
final against Barcelona Feminin at Juventus Stadium. She scored the screamer in the 6th
minute of the UEFA Women’s Champions League final to set the stage on fire.

Henry’s club
colleague, Selma Bacha was rightly awarded the "Young Player of the Season" as the
21-year-old had eight assists to her name in the competition.
