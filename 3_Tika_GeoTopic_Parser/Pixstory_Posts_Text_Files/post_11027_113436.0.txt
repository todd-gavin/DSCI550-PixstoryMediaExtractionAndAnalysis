For nine days in May 2022, Lakshmi Devi, 22, toiled under a broiling sun, hoping to earn Rs 231 per day, joining others like her, desperate for work, in digging a pond, a job offered to them as an economic safety net under India’s national jobs-for-work programme.


Lakshmi Devi needed the job and money, and so she enrolled under the scheme and currently walks 4 kms daily to reach her work site  at 6 am, working for the next 6 hours. Since the pandemic struck in 2020, her husband, a private construction worker who earned Rs 300 per day, had been in and out of work. The money would help her run her household and care for her two-year-old daughter. 


“She needs milk everyday and I need oil [to cook], it has become so expensive now,” she said. 


In her village of Kukar Khera in the southern Rajasthan district of Rajsamand, over 300 km south of the capital Jaipur, she worked under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 between 1 and 15 May. A muster roll, which is essentially a list of names of workers at a specific site put together to mark their attendance was prepared and Lakshmi Devi’s name was included in it. 


When pay day came, Lakshmi Devi was shocked: she was paid Rs 920  instead of Rs 2079, payment for four days of work, not nine.


Distraught, she approached the “mate” or the site supervisor who registered the attendance of the workers on the National Mobile Monitoring System App using her smartphone. It is compulsory for mates across the country to register the attendance of 15 crore active NREGA workers through the app, a new feature introduced by the Centre in May this year.


“I asked her why she cut my attendance, but she showed me the [physical] muster roll where she marked it,” said Lakshmi Devi.
