Former WWE wrestler Dalip Singh Rana, better known as The Great Khali, has been accused of slapping a toll worker in Ludhiana following a heated argument.

A purported video of the incident in which Khali can be heard arguing with some of the toll workers has gone viral on social media. However, the clip does not show the former wrestler slapping the toll worker.

Meanwhile, Khali has accused the Ladhowal toll plaza employees of "blackmailing" him.

According to police, the incident took place on Monday when Khali was on his way from Jalandhar in Punjab to Karnal, Haryana

A police official posted at the Ladhowal police station on Tuesday said no complaint was lodged by either of the two sides.

In the video, a toll plaza employee could be heard asking the former wrestler why he slapped his colleague when an identity proof was sought from him.

"You were asked to show your ID card, show the ID card,” the toll employee tells Khali to which he replies, “You are blackmailing me”. The employee then says, “We are not blackmailing you. Why did you slap him? Show the ID card if you have it.”

Khali later posted a video message on his Instagram where he refuted all such allegations. Moreover, Khali said he was ill-treated by toll workers as they allegedly demanded selfies to let his vehicle pass through toll barricade. The wrestler also said that such people should be penalised so they do not ever misbehave with celebrities.
