7 Obafemi Martins
Martins was signed by the club's youth team and scored 23 goals in his first season, pavingthe way for him to join the senior team. Despite the fact that he was not a regular starter andwould come on as a substitute, he did score when given the chance, which led to himreceiving a long-term contract from the club.

He was a huge success at the club, scoring 28 goals in 88 league games and 11 goals inEuropean competitions, but he was sold after Inter brought in two new strikers to replacehim.

6 Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡

Ibrahimovic was a nightmare for many defenders, a threat in the box, and his long-rangeshooting abilities made him a potent striker in Europe. Despite only spending a short timewith Inter Milan, the Swede was a prolific scorer in all of his seasons there, scoring 22 goalsin 2008 and 29 goals in 2009. He won three Serie A titles and left his mark with 66 goals in117 appearances.

5 Samuel Eto'o

Eto'o was a pivotal player in Inter's treble-winning season, a vintage striker who madescoring goals a routine, revealing how good he was when he had the ball and would beat 3-4defenders to score. Eto'o not only scored many important goals in the Champions League,
but he was also a playmaker who was awarded the most Champions League assists atBarcelona.

In just three years, he demonstrated that he is still the best striker in Europe, scoring 53goals in 102 games.

4 Mauro Icardi

Icardi's start to his new life was hampered by an injury that kept him out for an entire season,but when he returned, he picked up his form and did not stop, hitting double digits inconsecutive seasons and winning Serie A player of the year in 2018. However, Inter werenot a competitive team at the time and could not win any trophies, but the Argentine left theclub with 124 goals in 219 appearances.
