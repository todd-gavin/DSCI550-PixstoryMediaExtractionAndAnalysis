If you are feeling bored or you didn’t yet decided what to do this weekend then don’t worry because I am here to tell you about the new content that is releasing tomorrow, either in theatres or on OTT platforms.

So, here’s the list of all the movies and web series releasing tomorrow-

1. Bhool Bhulaiyaa 

After doing “Dhamaka” on Netflix last year, Kartik Aaryan is back in cinemas with “Bhool Bhulaiyaa.” This movie is a sequel to the movie with the same name where Akshay Kumar played the lead role. One thing which is promising about this movie is that the director of both the movies is the same.

2. Dhaakad 

After “Thalaivi,” Kangana Ranaut is also returning to cinemas with “Dhaakad.” After good acting, Indians knew Kangana because of her controversial remarks on various topics but while promoting Dhaakad, I also saw the hypocritical side of Kangana Ranaut.

3. Love, Death and Robots 

If you are fond of Anime, then this series should be on your watchlist. To watch the third season of Love, Death and Robots, you don’t have to watch the previous two seasons because each episode is a different story all together. You can watch this anime series on Netflix.

4. My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman

If you are fond of watching interviews of famous personalities in their particular field then this chat show should be on your watchlist. My next guest…. become superhit in India when David Letterman interviewed Shahrukh Khan in 2019. You can watch this chat show on Netflix.

5. RRR 

RRR needs no introduction and after the humongous success at the box office and winning the hearts of the audiences, RRR will be available on Netflix from tomorrow.

6. Jersey

After getting good reviews from the critics and earning very less money in cinemas, Shahid Kapoor’s Jersey will be released tomorrow on Netflix and one thing which I can predict is, that Jersey will trend on Netflix India for weeks for sure.
