Renewable energy sources and technologies have potential to provide solutions to the longstanding energy problems being faced by the developing countries like India Solar energy can be an important part of India s plan not only to add new capacity but also to increase energy security address environmental concerns and lead the massive market for renewable energy Solar thermal electricity STE also known as concentrating solar power CSP are emerging renewable energy technologies and can be developed as future potential option for electricity generation in India Solar energy refers to the energy which the sunlight contains in the form of photons It is not possible for life on earth to exist without solar energy All kinds of microorganisms and single celled organisms came into existence with solar energy s help Plants have been using this energy ever since the beginning We can trap solar energy in a lot of ways One of the most efficient ways to do this is by using solar power plants The design of these power plants is such that it helps to produce electricity on a larger level Other appliances which work on solar energy are solar cookers solar heaters and solar cells The solar cookers are said to be the most innovative methods of cooking nowadays It is a great alternative to conventional fuels like gas kerosene and wood Finally we have solar cells They operate by directly converting solar light into electricity In areas where supply from power grid is less available solar cells are quite popular The electricity which solar panels produce also stores in rechargeable solar batteries major advantage of solar energy is that it is a renewable source Thus it will be available to use as long as the Sun is present Further using solar energy can assist in reducing our electricity bills Using this energy will not result in pollution and thus it won t harm the environment As a result air pollution will significantly decreaseThis way it can become the future of our world It will make the world a greener and cleaner place as well So we must all try to switch to solar energy to make the world a better place
