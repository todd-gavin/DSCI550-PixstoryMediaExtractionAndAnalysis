Sonakshi Sinha and Zaheer Iqbal is one couple that has kept us confused about their relationship status for some time. Few days back, Sonakshi Sinha flaunted a ring and everyone began wondering if she was engaged. Well, it was Sonakshi Sinha's birthday on June 2 and Zaheer Iqbal has wished her a belated happy birthday. He shared a video of them gorging on food and captioned it, "Happy Birthday Sonzzz...Thank You for not killing me...I Love You ...Here’s to a lot more food, flights, love and laughter...P.s - This video sums up the entire time we’ve known each other." This is indeed a kind of confirmation that they are indeed dating.
