The NBA’s early-entry deadline for the 2022 draft elapsed Sunday night, finalizing the pool of eligible players as the predraft process begins in earnest. As I see it, there were no massive surprises this year in terms of college prospects deciding to test or return to school, but per usual, some intriguing names opted to defer their draft decisions to next season.

Tyrese Hunter, PG, transfer portal

Last week, Hunter became the most wanted man in the transfer portal after announcing his plans to leave Iowa State. He flew relatively under the radar in high school for a four-star prospect and never had a full national recruitment until now, with heavy hitters already lining up offers. Hunter won Big 12 freshman of the year, then broke out in the NCAA tournament and led the Cyclones to the Sweet 16, putting himself on the map nationally and in the minds of NBA teams going into his sophomore year. In my mind he projects as the top returning guard prospect at this point in time. Hunter doesn’t turn 19 until August, and another year of development in college should ultimately help him quite a bit and solidify him as a legit first-rounder.

Hunter potentially has quite a bit to offer as a prospect, and to me the discussion begins with his exceptional mental makeup, particularly for a teenager. He leads and makes decisions with the type of poise that older teammates follow, he doesn’t take plays off, and he defends with tenacity. He’s also exceptionally fast, which helps cover for what he gives up in terms of size (he’s listed at 6' 0”). While still learning to distribute in the halfcourt, Hunter is an unselfish passer, takes great care of the ball, and doesn’t get sped up easily. His floor seems pretty secure right now as a high-quality NBA backup, with the potential to be much more than that. Teams will want to see him improve his three-point shooting next season (his 27.4% from long range will likely tick up, but it’s a matter of how much).
