I always talk about trying to achieve that state of creative innocence the designer reveals to struggle to stay close to that person who has fallen in love with fashion and its chances of not succumbing to cynicism or the wear and tear of the world I hope this spirit emerges from the collection I hope those who see it will understand how passionate the team and I were in making it I hope the joy we took in creating something in making precious objects that people will always remember is evident in every coat, dress and accessory with the thought that accompanies them A Sometimes we get defensive when critics accuse us of only wanting to do beautiful things. glamorous not so easy But a privilege I am aware of and very grateful for every day Daniel Roseberry creative director
