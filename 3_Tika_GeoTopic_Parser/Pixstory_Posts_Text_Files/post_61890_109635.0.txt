After the Supreme Court sent shockwaves through America on Friday morning  by overturning Roe v. Wade and showing the world that there is no level that USA won't stoop down to, to cater it's votebanks, the nearly 50-year-old case that protected a woman’s federal right to have an abortion, many women are feeling everything from heartbreak to anger to fear including Taylor Swift.

And the woman that everyone wanted to hear from has finally spoken up. The 32-year-old grammy award winning artist took to Twitter the day of the court’s ruling to condemn the decision, writing: “I’m absolutely terrified that this is where we are – that after so many decades of people fighting for women’s rights to their own bodies, today’s decision has stripped us of that.”

USA has lost all the moral high ground today and Taylor Swift has rightly called them out for it.
