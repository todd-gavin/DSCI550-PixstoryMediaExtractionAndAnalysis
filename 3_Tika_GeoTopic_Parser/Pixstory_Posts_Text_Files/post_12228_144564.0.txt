And here's how our college fest, technitude went. 
It was a two day long event, with many games, activities, food stalls, and the most important technical highlighted events. It was an event which unites, all the college departments, students and staff. 
My department of Computer EngineeringÂ  organized 5 main events :
1. Upside down - A treasure hunt event, along with a puzzle Maze.
2. Word face off - where in group of two teams were competing.
3. Escape out - all quizzes and crossword.
4. Light out - A coding event in dark mode.
5. Lock and key - An English themed game with keys to each level. 
6. Ideabition- An event for presenting ideas for the future.
7. Room 2050 - Event for presenting Iot projects. 
It was indeed a fun, enjoyable, fest with tons of learnings. Will miss technitude 2022
