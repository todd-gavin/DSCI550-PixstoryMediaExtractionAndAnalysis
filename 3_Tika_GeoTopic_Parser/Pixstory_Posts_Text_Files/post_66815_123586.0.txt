While Mary is right, that talking to ourselves always helps us in deciding the right course of action, it is nowhere close to the clarity that meditators have. 

Meditation is a God's gift to mankind and it sucks how people don't practice it nowadays. Self talk is great, but meditation puts you in touch with the deepest of your emotions and that's why the decisions taken then, are always the best ones. 

Meditation helps you listen to your instincts and make the best decisions for yourself out of every situation
