Kurma, the second avatar of Vishnu, is depicted in the water holding up Mount Mandāra, chosen as a churning rod upon which Vishnu himself is seated. The snake Vāsuki, coiled around it, serves as a rope which is being pulled on the left by the gods Brahmā, Vishnu and Shiva, and on the right by three demons.
