His photo is still on the champions wall in the Augusta National press building, nestled between Trevor Immelman and Phil Mickelson. However, his seat at the champion's supper on Tuesday night was unoccupied, and no one saw an invitation to play in the Masters this year. 

US News reported that Angel Cabrera is being held in an Argentine prison as the Masters takes place this week. He's currently serving a two-year term for domestic abuse, with the possibility of receiving an even lengthier sentence. 

2009's glory had never appeared so far away.
“A lot of kids grow up without a role model and make some bad decisions, their anger within them takes over,” said Charlie Epps, a Houston golf pro who has a father-son relationship with Cabrera. “But it doesn’t justify doing the wrong thing.”

Cabrera started out as an unlikely champion, a street urchin who grew up without parents and never received a formal education. When he returned home after winning the 2007 US Open, he was met by a large throng and a parade was held in his honour. 

Then, in 2009, he won a three-way Masters playoff to become a two-time major champion – and the first South American to do it. His golf future appeared to be limitless. 

But what was once a happy narrative has turned sour, and no one knows when Cabrera will be able to play golf again.
