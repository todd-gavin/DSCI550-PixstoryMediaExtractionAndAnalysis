Monsoon is, indeed, a heavenly season for food lovers and so for me as well 😋. What can be more relaxing than waking up from your sleep in the evening and seeing the rainfall which just turn your mood on.

What adds more to my monsoon temptation is a hot cup of aromatic tea with ginger and elaichi and bhutta roasted by mom and your entire family then sits on the balcony enjoying the butta with the sip of tea watching the rain.🥰

And if you are a chicken lover just like me, you will surely be getting tempted to have hot sizzling chicken chilli in your mouth😍😻🙈

And after all of those eating tasty foods, you can't resist to end the day with tasty monsoon sweet dishes and combos. 🫰😌What can be more good in monsoon to have the classic combo none other than Kesar ka dudh with Jalebi that  just makes you feel so warm and relaxed that you wish the monsoon to stay forever.

These are my comfort foods❤️What are your monsoon stories and comfort foods which you also crave for?😍
