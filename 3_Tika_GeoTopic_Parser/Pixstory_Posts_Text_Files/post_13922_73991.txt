In the first games of the season Steph Curry looked like he was on the path to a near unanimous MVP campaign However Steph s recent slump has resulted in a drop from No in Kia MVP Ladder to not even making the top In his last games Steph is averaging PTS REB AST on shooting splits This brings his FG and P to a career low excluding his game injury season in Kevin Durant is also part of the MVP conversation averaging PTS REB AST on shooting splits He is leading the league in scoring and currently the Brooklyn Nets are the rd seed in the Eastern Conference However on Jan th Kevin Durant was diagnosed with a sprained MCL in his left knee and will return in weeks which does hurt his MVP case unfortunately Nikola Jokic is having one of the greatest statistical seasons in NBA history Jokic is averaging PTS REB AST on shooting splits Jokic has a PER of which is not only a career high but it is the highest PER by any player in NBA history and the only reason he is not no in the race is because of Denver being only the th seed in the Western Conference due to injuries to Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr In my opinion the frontrunner for the MVP currently is Giannis Antetokounmpo as he is averaging PTS REB AST BLKS on shooting splits Ignoring voter fatigue Giannis has been dominant as usual this season on both ends of the floor and is currently one of the favorites to win the Defensive Player of the Year award While the Bucks are the th seed in the Eastern Conference due to battling various injuries from Khris Middleton Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez this season there is no denying that Giannis is having yet another MVP caliber season
