Former Bayern manager Niko Kovac sung Gnabry’s praises, saying, ““He’s world class.

There’s nobody else with his abilities in the Bundesliga. He can shoot with his left or right foot, but he could exploit his pace better in the final third and go deeper every now and again, as he’s a real weapon there. He’s a great guy.”

Gnabry can play on both wings, deliver a cross or cut inside and shoot as well. He is a fast and 
strong dribbler, and has little to no problem in easing past opponents. He can also hold up the 
ball on counter attacks, bringing his teammates into play before breaking away at full speed.

Arsenal are looking to get rid of Nikolas Pepe - Gnabry would be the perfect replacement for the club at RW. While Gnabry would not replace Saka at RW, he could easily start at LW or ST even given Arsenal’s lack of quality players in that position.

Getting Gnabry onboard will unlock an immense amount of flexibility for Arteta, and will be an important key in Arsenal’s team for years to come. Scoring a paltry 61 goals in the previous Premier League campaign, Arsenal need to add firepower if they want to be serious contenders for the top 4 as all other teams will be strengthening as well.

If Arsenal want to build an incredibly technical and talented squad to challenge for the title, Arsenal will have to do their most to bring on world class players who would lift the level of everyone at the club. While a romantic reunion might be unlikely, it would be one to behold if it were to come true.
