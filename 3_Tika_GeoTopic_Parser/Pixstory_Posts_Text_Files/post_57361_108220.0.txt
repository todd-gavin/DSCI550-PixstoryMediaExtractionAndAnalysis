"Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder formerly called manic depression," says Stephanie G. Thompson, director of clinical operation for Lightfully Behavioral Health, a Thousand Oaks, Californiaâ€“based mental health treatment provider.
"It's characterized by extreme mood swims, AKA opposites, in that an individual will experience periods of extreme highs or excitement known as mania followed by periods of severe sadness known as depression." There may also be periods of a "normal," or balanced, a mood that is not extreme.

Manic Episodes: Despite the common misconception, manic episodes are not necessarily "happy" times for the patient. Instead, they're periods of extreme energetic energy that can sometimes be frightening for the patient. These episodes can last for weeks or months if they're not treated.

Manic episodes may include symptoms such as high energy, reduced need for sleep and loss of touch with reality. Depressive episodes may include low energy, low motivation and loss of interest in daily activities. Mood episodes last days to months and may also be associated with suicidal thoughts.
Treatment is usually lifelong and often involves a combination of medications and psychotherapy.
