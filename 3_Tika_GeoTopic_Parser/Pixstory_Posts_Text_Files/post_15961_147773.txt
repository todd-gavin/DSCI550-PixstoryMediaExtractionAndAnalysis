Abstract Objectives To determine the association between type diabetes T D and pulmonary function tests Methods After conducting an exhaustive literature search we performed a meta analysis We employed the inverse variance method with a random effects model to calculate the effect estimate as the mean difference MD and confidence interval CI We calculated the heterogeneity with the I statistic and performed a meta regression analysis by age sex body mass index BMI smoking and geographical region We also conducted a sensitivity analysis according to the studies publication date size of the T D group and the study quality excluding the study with the greatest weight in the effect Results The meta analysis included studies one longitudinal case control and three cross sectional ones with patients with T D and control participants The pooled MD CI for the predicted percentage of FEV FVC FEF PEF and DLCO were CI p lt CI p lt CI p CI p and CI p respectively There was no difference in the ratio of FEV FVC CI p There was considerable heterogeneity The meta regression analysis showed that between studies heterogeneity was not explained by patient age sex BMI smoking or geographical region The findings were consistent in the sensitivity analysis Conclusions T D is associated with impaired pulmonary function independently of age sex smoking BMI and geographical region Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate outcomes for patients with T D and impaired pulmonary function Sources
