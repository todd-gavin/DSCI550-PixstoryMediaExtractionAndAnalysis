Jill and I believe that our nation has a sacred obligation to America s veterans and their families Among other things this means providing veterans with the tools and resources for economic opportunity security and dignity My Administration s approach is working today the unemployment rate for veterans is percent tied for the lowest rate on record and down from an average of percent in Veterans of all backgrounds are finally being cut in on the deal Unemployment rates for white Black Asian and Hispanic veterans male and female fell and were the same or lower than their nonveteran counterparts in And the unemployment rate for veterans with a service connected disability declined to percent This historic progress is the result of my Administration s efforts to rebuild America s economy from the bottom up and the middle out We are continuing to build on this record with initiatives to bring veterans into critical industries like trucking and ensure they are good paying quality jobs And we are continuing our work to reduce the costs veterans and working families face
