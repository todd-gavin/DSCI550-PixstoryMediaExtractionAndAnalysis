The farthest human made object from Earth NASA s Voyager probe appears to be a little perplexed about what is going on in interstellar space Vice reported that the long lived probe and its twin Voyager set out on their epic space missions in becoming the first spacecraft to reach interstellar space which is the vast cosmic region beyond the Sun s primary influence According to a NASA statement made on Wednesday Voyager has recently been relaying invalid data concerning its trip into this uncharted territory The problem is impacting the probe s attitude articulation and control system AACS which orients the spacecraft and ensures that its communication antenna faces Earth during its journey While the AACS system is correctly pointed toward Earth it has started babbling random telemetry data and other gibberish about the probe being in positions that are not possible NASA said A mystery like this is sort of par for the course at this stage of the Voyager mission said Suzanne Dodd project manager for Voyager and at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the statement The spacecraft are both almost years old which is far beyond what the mission planners anticipated
