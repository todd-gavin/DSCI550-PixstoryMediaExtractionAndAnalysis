I can think of two action movies from the last decade that had an actor throwing an entire motorcycle at someone. The first is the Marvel sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron, which was released in 2015. Captain America (Chris Evans) flips his bike and flings it against an armoured tank while battling bad guys in a snowy woodland. But the moment is tossed aside; Cap mutters an unrelated joke, and his incredible achievement is quickly undermined, adding an eye-rolling punctuation to a frantic but drab fighting set piece.
