Always upto doing something crazy(day dreaming basically). And This is me Neeraj, not Neeraj Chopra ðŸ¥º.
Travelling is my hobby at least on paper ðŸ¥². These concrete jungles and this air mixed with slow venom are gently taking my breath away(literally). 
Wanna run away from this rat-race as fast as an employee who is late for his job.Whoever said, "First you struggle to be a slave and then in slavery" I couldn't agree more with. 
Anyways, I might sound like a total depressing guy but that's not always the case. My mind changes like the faces of Moon ðŸŒ›. 
FYI this is the jolly Neeraj writing ðŸ˜Š.
I wanna make NEW FRIENDS on this platform.
So don't be shy, Just say Hii ðŸ˜‚
