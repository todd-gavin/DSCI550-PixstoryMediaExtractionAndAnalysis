Stephenson wrote “Many years after this happened, the spirit of the place appeared to a Bengali in a dream, and informed him that there was immense treasure buried under the pillar in copper handis or vessels bound with chains. The spirit requested him to take a journey or pilgrimage to the spot and possess it. The Bengali travelled to the place, and found the pillar a few feet above the ground, in the middle of a large jungle, inhabited by wild beasts of every description. 
However, notwithstanding the danger, he began to clear away the jungle, and dig for the treasure. At a great depth, he came to a well or small tank, on the surface of which floated a large silver choki (or seat), and through a hole in the middle, the pillar descends down into the water into an unknown depth. By the side of the well are stationed two swams (large black bees), the size of a man’s fist, to protect the treasure. The Bengali entered this sanctuary, disappeared, and was never heard of more. The pillar after this affair rose to the height of two tadi trees, and has since been sinking at the rate of an inch annually. 
Many years after the Bengali’s disappearance, an English gentleman came to the place and dug down to discover the base of the pillar, but when he came to the silver choki he was attacked by two swams, one of which stung and killed him on the spot: since that time, no one dare venture to dig below the pillar, which has subsequently remained unmolested.” Stephenson conjectures to relate the legend with the attack by porcupines who were seen in the vicinity having dug up their dens, and who could have infact killed a man with their sharp armour.
