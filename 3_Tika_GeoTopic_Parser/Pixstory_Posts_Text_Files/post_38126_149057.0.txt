Paul Pogba has recently been in the news due to the accusations of his brother Mathias Pogba. The Juventus player's brother has gone on to even claim that the French midfielder had asked a witch doctor to use black magic on Kylian Mbappe. But would this make Didier Deschamps keep Pogba out of the squad?
What has happened?  
As per Get French Football News, Paul Pogba's brother has recently tarnished the midfielder in the media. As per the report, Mathias Pogba has gone on to claim, "At the request of Paul, the witch doctor was told to neutralize Kylian Mbappé who back then was on a rapid rise, far outstripping Paul’s fame. It was strange to see that during that match Kylian was a shadow of himself against a reserve side.”
“The issue is that at the same time Paul was doing everything he could to get closer to Kylian, as we could see in the media, supposedly liking him and calling him his friend – he would often call him, we would see them arm in arm. It went so far that Kylian almost made it a condition for his PSG contract extension that the club would have to sign Paul, without knowing that behind his back Paul was engaging in witchcraft to sabotage his matches.”
Matthias has claimed that Paul Pogba paid around €4m for the witch doctor for this. If proven, there is a chance that the French manager could keep Pogba out of the squad for the World Cup. Deschamps had earlier sidelined Karim Benzema for the Euro 2016 and the World Cup 2018 teams after the striker was involved in a "sex tape controversy" with fellow teammate Valbuena. 
Paul Pogba has also had injury concerns over the last year. The Frenchman joined Juventus in June 2022. But a meniscus injury is expected to keep him out of action at least till November. This would give Deschamps even more reason to drop Pogba from the French squad. 
Without Paul Pogba, the French midfield would truly be tested at the global event later this year in Qatar.
