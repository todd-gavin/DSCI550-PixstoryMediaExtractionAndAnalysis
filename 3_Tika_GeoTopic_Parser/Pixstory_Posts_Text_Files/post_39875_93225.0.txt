Food and stories are co related, where there is food there are histories and stories.
Sandwiches were actually an accident, if it wasn’t for John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich we would wouldn’t have gotten this delicious combination of bread, cheese, meat or veggies.
 From culinary point of view sandwiches are salads concealed by 2 pieces of a loaf or a bread, we different types which are Submarine, Club, BLT(Bacon, Tomato, Lettuce) and ofcourse Grilled Sandwich which today is all about. 
Sandwiches have long been the domain of the pantry department, along with salads and other cold preparations. However, when you consider that the most popular sandwich today is the hamburger, you realize that sandwich preparation is as much the responsibility of the short-order cook as it is of the pantry cook. 
Grilled Sandwiches, also called toasted sandwiches, are simple sandwiches that are buttered on the outside and browned on the griddle, in a hot oven, or in a panini grill (see sidebar). Sandwiches containing cheese are popular for grilling. The basic meaning of the Italian word panino (plural: panini) is “roll,” as in bread roll or dinner roll—liter- ally, “little bread.” By extension, panini are sandwiches made of small rolls plus fillings. Also Panini is a bread that you might have seen at Subway. 
The widely popular Cuban Sandwich is also  a variation grilled sandwiches comprising of  a ham and cheese that likely originated in cafes catering to Cuban workers in Tampa or Key West. They are much more than cigars. 
My sandwich story would be the mid-night craving one, where I couldn’t sleep at nights during lockdown and a sudden craving at 3:00 Am in the morning came up just for a slice of cheese grilled between 2 breads. Since in India we only use Amul cheese, and we live and breath brown bread of Harvest. That’s my “Guilty Pleasure”food, first and foremost.
