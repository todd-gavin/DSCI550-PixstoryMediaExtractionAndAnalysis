In this recently made public image from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the galaxy NGC 1961 unfolds its stunning spiral arms. The dusty spiral arms that wrap around the galaxy's burning centre are dotted with glittering, blue regions of young, brilliant stars. The galaxy NGC 1961 is an AGN, or active galactic nucleus, and it has an intermediate spiral shape. Because they lack a clearly defined bar of stars at their centres, intermediate spiral galaxies fall between "barred" and "unbarred" spiral galaxies. At specific wavelengths of light, AGN galaxies have extremely brilliant centres that frequently significantly outshine the rest of the galaxy. Supermassive black holes at the centres of these galaxies are probably responsible for the brilliant jets and winds that influence their evolution. NGC 1961 is a type of AGN that AGN that emits low-energy-charged particles.The data used to create this image came from two proposals. One studied previously unobserved Arp galaxies, while the other looked at the progenitors and explosions of a variety of supernovae.Located about 180 million light-years away, NGC 1961 resides in the constellation Camelopardalis.Source: NASA TV
