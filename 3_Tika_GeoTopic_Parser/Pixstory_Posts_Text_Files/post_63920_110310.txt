Themes and scores are a very integral part of a movie as the score plays a powerful role in shaping the movie s overall character The biggest most momentous scenes are not nearly as powerful if the background score accompanying the scene is weak unaccommodating or otherwise unfit for the scene For example the most memorable scene in Empire Strikes Back is the I am your father scene It wouldn t nearly be as epic if the music behind it were not good enough And just like it is with movie directors the music composers need to have a strong vision to create a compelling score Those composers who are able to compose a score which not only makes the scene a powerful one but also makes the audiences remember both the scene and the piece of music in the background are rare and an example to behold for all composers Creating a truly compelling score in all aspects almost falls under the ratio of a probability Some of the best Hollywood movie scores ever created include Lord Of The Rings trilogy Howard Shore Ben Hur Mikl s R zsa Star Wars episodes John Williams Gladiator Hans Zimmer The Godfather trilogy Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola Braveheart James Horner Rocky Bill Conti and Vince DiCola Blade Runner Vangelis Psycho Bernard Herrmann The Sound of Music Richard Rodgers Oscar Hammerstein and Irwin Kostal The Batman Michael Giacchino Jurassic Park John Williams Hugo Howard Shore Lawrence of Arabia Maurice Jarre Joker Hildur Ingveldard ttir Gu nad ttir Jaws John Williams The Lion King Hans Zimmer Pirates of the Caribbean Hans Zimmer The Good The Bad and The Ugly Ennio Morricone Titanic James Horner
