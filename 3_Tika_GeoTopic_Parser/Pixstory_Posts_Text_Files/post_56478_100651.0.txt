Blackpool striker Jake Daniels has become the first active professional male footballer in England to come out as gay in more than 30 years.

The 17-year-old said he was inspired by the example of Adelaide United midfielder Josh Cavallo, who became the first openly gay male player in a top-flight competition when he came out last year.

"I've hated lying my whole life and feeling the need to change to fit in," Daniels said on Blackpool's website.

"I want to be a role model myself by doing this. There are people out there in the same space as me that may not feel comfortable revealing their sexuality.

"I just want to tell them that you don't have to change who you are, or how you should be, just to fit in. You being you, and being happy, is what matters most."

Daniels said his teammates at Blackpool had embraced his sexuality after he confided in them several months ago. Club spokespeople said they were "incredibly proud that he has reached a stage where he is empowered to express himself both on and off the pitch".

The announcement has been met with a similar wave of support to what Cavallo received last October.

England's Football Association said Daniels was an "inspiration".

"This is a hugely positive step as we strive to build an inclusive game that we can all be proud of," the governing body tweeted.

"We are with you and we hope your story will help to give people across the game the strength and encouragement to be their true self."

Former England footballers Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher described it as a "historic" moment, while other organisations including the Premier League, FIFA, and FIFPro all expressed their support for Daniels.
