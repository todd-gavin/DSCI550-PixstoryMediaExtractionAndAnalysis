Today is Father s Day the ideal moment to thank all of the fathers out there We often overlook our father s sacrifices and contributions to our life The concept of a special day to honour and celebrate fatherhood originated in the United States Father s Day has been observed in the United States since June Every year on the third Sunday in June it is commemorated My father s name comes to me whenever I think of a real life hero People usually talk about a mother s love and affection whereas the love of a father is sometimes overlooked The love of a mother is frequently spoken but what we forget to recognise is the power of a father which often goes unrecognised
