# Trailers this week. 

This week has been great for movie and series trailers, from the Star Wars fans to the Boys fans. All the fans got served. We break down some of the major trailers dropped this week. 

Obi Wan Kenobi- The Star Wars legend is getting his own series. Set after the events of Revenge of the sith, the first trailer of Obi Wan Kenobi is incredibly dynamic and hypes up the show a lot. The fans are definitely in for a treat. The show drops May 25. 

Deep Water- As disgusting as that story seemed to me, for the “adult generation” who have their minds opened, this sure is one to watch out for, i mean after all who wouldn’t like their wife seducing other men and women in front of the husband while he watched from the upstairs window. 

The Boys- This show is genius, it is pure genius since its first season and the third season has got everyone super excited. Watch out for the show as it is everything the anti hero squad needs and this season looks better than ever. 

All the Old knives- i will not say much about this except that this looks extremely intriguing and a movie that you would love to watch. So watch out for it.
