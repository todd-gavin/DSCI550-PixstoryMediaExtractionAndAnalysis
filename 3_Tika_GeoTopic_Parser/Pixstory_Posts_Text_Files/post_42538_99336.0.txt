Just watched the trailer of Akshay Kumarâ€™s new movie, Prithviraj, and one thing I want to say is that Yash Raj Films tried something that they never put their hands in.

Prithviraj is a period drama movie based on the life of Prithviraj Chauhan. The Star cast of the movie includes Akshay Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, and Sonu Sood and the lead actress of the movie is Manushi Chhillar, who wins the Miss World back in 2017.
