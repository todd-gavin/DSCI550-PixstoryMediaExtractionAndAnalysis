If it were the World Cup instead of the Nations League, it would be a complete debacle for France, the world champion. Instead, five months after the start of Qatar, there is still time to put a national team back on track capable of triumphing in Russia. the Nations League and Deschamps&#39; men did really badly After matches France were placed in the group with Croatia Denmark and Austria last in the standings with just points Last night the last defeat against Croatia To condemn the French Modric with an opening goal from a penalty of match Then he played better France shot more but it didn&#39;t help much at the triple whistle the second defeat arrived Deschamps at the end of the game he said he was not worried but he will certainly have to discuss things with his staff Worried about the World Cup I&#39;m not but worried about nature Reflect with my staff There will be many more things needed if we are to maintain our standard Overall there is a desperate lack of freshness It will be necessary at the start of next season to do much more to prepare for the World Cup
