Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening Whose woods these are I think I know His house is in the village though He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake The only other sound s the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake The woods are lovely dark and deep But I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep What a soothing poem to read it s because of its pleasant diction and the euphony it gives Frost wrote the poem in June at his house in Shaftsbury Vermont He had been up the entire night writing the long poem New Hampshire and had finally finished when he realized morning had come He went out to view the sunrise and unexpectedly got the idea for Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening He penned down the new poem about the snowy evening and the little horse as if I d had a hallucination in just a few minutes The poem is written in iambic tetrameter in Rubbiyat stanza created by Edward Fitzgerald
