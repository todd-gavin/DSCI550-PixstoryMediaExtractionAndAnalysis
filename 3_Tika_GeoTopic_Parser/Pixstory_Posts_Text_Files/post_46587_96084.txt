The World Health Organization WEF believes that cybercrime generates over trillion in annual revenue That s about the same amount of money as the United Kingdom the world s tenth largest economy and the cybercriminal nation is perhaps more organised According to a recent report published by Cyber Crime Magazine the economic impact of cybercrime will be above trillion per year by if current trends continue This will put the cyber crime nation on par with the world s fourth largest economy in terms of annual revenue But why is cyber crime so rampant in US According to ISA all of the economic incentives favour the attackers which is the main cause for the proliferation of cybercrime Cyber attacks are low cost easy to acquire and extremely profitable and the business model is excellent Defenses on the other hand are burdened with being in a reactive state almost all of the time having to play a flawless game against attackers while safeguarding an increasingly fragile system of systems and the issue of demonstrating return on investment for defensive measures Moreover simply detecting the attack and discovering the crime might be challenging due to the subtle nature of new attack methods Agents may have to cope with a variety of tactics used by criminals to mask their identity once the attack is revealed such as virtual private networks VPNs and proxies A court order to search may be necessary causing the inquiry to be further delayed It can be considerably more difficult to acquire the warrant if the culprit is located overseas as is frequently the case There may also be jurisdictional concerns particularly if the case is international necessitating extradition This in turn creates its own set of issues Therefore dealing with cyber crimes in US is not as easy as it seems
