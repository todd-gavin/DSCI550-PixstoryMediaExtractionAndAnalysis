The Row perhaps the most interesting brand around beyond the splendid dresses the story behind their creation to ensure that they always remain on the lips of fashion enthusiasts Behind the now ten-year-old brand are the two ex-girlfriends of America the girls my growing generation laughs the Olsen twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen have abandoned their film career years ago they studied for a long time and then ten years ago they launched their brand An anonymous name no logo, surname and information that could lead back to them The clothes not who draws them must speak They took inspiration from the great minimalists such as Calvin Klein and Jil Sander from what we can consider their putative mother Phoebe Philo Very clean lines oversized fit a very narrow neutral palette very luxurious materials high quality and prohibitive prices this is the conception of luxury extremely European that the twins have been an integral part of their brand&#39;s heritage For this Fall Winter collection they slightly expanded the traditional codes we see of color usually only blue appeared sneakers and a greater attention to casual elegance Beautiful suits oversized baggy sweaters and shirts to combine with one or more vests The perfect styling that perfect combination of minimal snob that makes you want every photographed garment A collection that is perhaps more easily understandable and commercial than the previous ones also considering the post-pandemic drop in sales which we hope will revive the brand now the only one in circulation to tell a sober and effortless elegance
