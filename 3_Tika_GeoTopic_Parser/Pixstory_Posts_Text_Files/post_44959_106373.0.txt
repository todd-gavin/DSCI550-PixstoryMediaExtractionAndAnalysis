Montenegro vs Bosnia and Herzegovina: Prediction


Having achieved better results away from home than back in Bosnia over the past 12 months, the visitors will expect to take at least a point from their trip across the border.


With greater depth of experience at top-level European clubs, they should have the edge over Montenegro this weekend, and could even take top spot in Group 3 depending on how Finland fares in Romania.


Prediction : Montenegro 1-2 Bosnia-Herzegovina
