John Driskell Hopkins is best known for his role as a founding member, vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter for the Grammy Award-winning group Zac Brown Band.
According to multiple reports, Zac Brown Band bass guitarist John Driskell Hopkins has been diagnosed with ALS.

ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, is a progressive nervous system disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, eventually causing loss of muscle control, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Hopkins said that he had noticed issues with his balance for several years and that his hands would become stiff. Finally, he said he met with doctors, and "after careful analysis by some of the country's top neurologists, I have been diagnosed with ALS."

The Zac Brown Band musician then addressed what this means as far as his future with the band. "Because my symptoms have been slow-progressing from the start, we believe they will continue to be slow progressing going forward," Hopkins said and added, "God willing, I plan to be rocking with these amazing people for many years; to come."

In the video announcement, Hopkins and his bandmates revealed they had launched the Hop on a Cure foundation to support ALS research and work toward a cure.

"The technology and research surrounding ALS research has been advancing, but we still don't have a cure. Thanks so much for your prayers and support in helping us cure ALS," Zac Brown said in the clip.
