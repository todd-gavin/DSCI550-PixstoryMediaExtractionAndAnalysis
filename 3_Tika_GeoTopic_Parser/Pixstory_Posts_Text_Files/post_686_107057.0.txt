Last year my cousin was in hospital with a liver condition, the hospital wanted four units of blood. Since I was one of the relatives, I decided to donate blood. The hospital required blood of any group and would have in-return given the required blood group which was needed. 
Although the surgery was thankfully avoided but we decided to still go ahead with the donations. 
The blood which we donated must be hopefully circulating with the veins of people who are not known to us. It doesnâ€™t matter what the name, colour , religion, caste, gender of the person would be. I am sure him/her/they would surely have not asked about the credentials of the donors. The blood needed to be disease free and from healthy individuals. 
What can be a better act of solidarity. More so in such troubled times where who you are, what you eat, whom do you pray to, has suddenly become more important than the fact that you are a human being. 
In the milieu like this, when you donate blood you donate it for a human being, just to save lives. 
More recently, infact only yesterday a fraternity colleague from Kashmir appealed for blood donation on twitter for his 32 year old daughter who was fighting a life threatening condition in a Delhi hospital. As the day ended, the same person shared a heartening message thanking people known to him and unknown who donated blood for his daughter. I am sure the donations surpassed the required 10 units. 
In a time when people are spewing hate, this gives me hope. Hope that no matter what the selfish want, people will still believe in humanity. For a Muslim woman in Kashmir hundreds irrespective of any identity, were ready to donate blood in Delhi. 
Donating blood is a selfless act, which is surely and act of solidarity and generosity like nothing else. 
Trust me when I say, it is a good feeling . 
Donate blood it will bring you peace.
