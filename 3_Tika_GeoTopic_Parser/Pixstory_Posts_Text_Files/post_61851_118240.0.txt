Snoop Dogg and Eminem’s relationship goes way back to the 1990s when Dr. Dre signed the then-burgeoning rap star to Aftermath Entertainment. Aside from collaborating on The Marshall Mathers LP single “Bitch Please II” in 2000, they also toured together as part of the Up In Smoke Tour that same year along with Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and Xzibit.

Twenty years later, the two rap titans finally joined forces again, this time for the single “From The D 2 The LBC.” Serving as the lead single from Eminem’s upcoming greatest hits album Curtain Call 2, the track bridges finds both Hip Hop pillars spraying their bars like uzis. On Wednesday (July 20), Eminem shared a clip of himself and Snoop in the studio in which the D-O-Double-G admits Slim Shady pushed him to level up his bars.

The clip begins with Eminem telling Snoop, “Yeah, but you killed it though, bro,” to which Snoop replies, “You challenge me Marshall. You put me back in my karate school days, where I used to be a young MC and, you know, loved the challenge of having to try new styles and new cadences.
