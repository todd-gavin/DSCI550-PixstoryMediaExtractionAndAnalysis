Addiction is the only disease that convinces
you that you don't have a disease. It's cunning, baffling, and powerful.✔️
Addiction is a chronic disorder, not a personal failure. There is a human face behind every example, and there is real hope that addiction recovery can change your life.👏👏
Anddd you know whatttt comebacks are better and actually they are best than the setbacks ✔️ this is what my opinion is. 
And you need not make sense to anyboday except to yourselffff ❤️
I would say to anyone who thinks they have a problem: There is hope. Don't give up on it. You are loved. You are somebody✔️✔️❤️❤️
