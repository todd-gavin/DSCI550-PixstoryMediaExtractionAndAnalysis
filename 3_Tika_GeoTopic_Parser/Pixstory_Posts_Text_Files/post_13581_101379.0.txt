A document has been found showing the group instructing farmers in Balkh province not to "harvest their crops without the presence of an agricultural representative."

The document calls on farmers to cooperate with the group "in performing one of the five duties, namely zakat."

In a letter from the address of the Taliban Department of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock in Balkh province, he instructed the districts of the province to communicate this order to all farmers in Balkh province so that they "consider the materials separately."

A copy of this letter has been sent to all districts of Balkh province.

The Taliban issued the order after the United Nations said Afghanistan was on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe due to drought and economic crisis.

Last winter, the United Nations called on the world to donate $ 5 billion to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan.
