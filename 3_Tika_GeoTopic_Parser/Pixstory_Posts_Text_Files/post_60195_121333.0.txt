India and Pakistan will compete in a Group A match at the upcoming Asia Cup in Dubai on August 28. The competition will start on August 27 and end on September 11 with the title game. Earlier, it was announced that Sri Lanka will host the Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates. Due to the ongoing economic crisis, the tournament was relocated from Sri Lanka.

India's first encounter at the Next Asia Cup would be against Pakistan, and following that clash, the Rohit Sharma-led team would play a Qualifier. There would be a Super 4 phase following the group round matches, and the top two teams would advance to the finals.

The UAE has hosted the Asia Cup instead of Sri Lanka. The decision, as per Jay Shah, president of the Asian Cricket Council, was inclined by the circumstances in Sri Lanka. said Shah. "Every effort was made to have the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka, and only after serious consideration was the decision made to move the venue to the UAE.

India vs Pakistan is the most anticipated match among the fans as the two teams only play during multi-national tournaments. Pakistan defeated India in their last encounter in the 2021 T20 World Cup at the same venue. While I fully stand by the ACC's decision to shift the Asia Cup to UAE considering the current context and the magnitude of the event, Sri Lanka Cricket will work closely with the ACC and Emirates Cricket Board to ensure that we still have an exciting edition of the Asia Cup," Sri Lanka Cricket chief Shammi Silva said.

India, the defending Asia Cup champions, will enter the competition as the favourite. They were the 50-over format champions four years prior. The last T20 tournament, which was held in 2016, was similarly won by India under MS Dhoni.

The event will be exciting, though, because both Pakistan and India have recently been in strong T20 form.
The countries will view the event as a crucial practise match for the upcoming T20 World Cup in November and will be looking to finalise their lineups.
