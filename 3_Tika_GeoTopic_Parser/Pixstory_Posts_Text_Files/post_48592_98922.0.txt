For the 12th straight season, the Knicks have the most expensive ticket in the NBA. The team's prominence and attractiveness for hoops visitors eager to visit Madison Square Garden is undeniable, yet a group of four paid $937 to see one game during the 2021-22 season.

The Knicks not only missed the playoffs this season, but they've only made the playoffs once in the last nine years and haven't won a championship since 1973. Despite this, they placed eighth in the NBA in average attendance (18,621), demonstrating the devotion of their core fan base.

If this doesn't speak enough about the sheer popularity and craze The Knicks have, what does?
