The film opens on a human male named Dennis kidnapping three adolescent girls, two of whom are popular and conventionally attractive and one of whom is a loser but is also conventionally attractive. Only it just so happens that Dennis isn't Dennis at all. He's Kevin, and Kevin has 23 personalities, one of whom is Dennis, and none of whom are Kevin. Once the girls are all good and kidnapped, they meet some of the other personalities, such as Irish singer-songwriter Sinead O'Connor and Hedwig. Hedwig reveals to them that they will be sacrificed to a secret, even more powerful 24th personality called The Beast.
Casey, the outcast girl, tries to find a window so she can ride Hedwig's feathery wings to freedom, but he's too young to get the reference. Dennis goes undercover pretending to be a personality named Barry -- which on Earth was always short for Barack -- but his therapist Dr. Fletcher senses something awry and demands to see his long form birth certificate. This seems as good a time as any to turn into The Beast, so that's exactly what happens. Then The Beast kills Dr. Fletcher. Old Beasty is just about to polish off a couple of flies when out of nowhere Casey starts shooting him just to be mean. The Beast doesn't take it personally though, and spares her life on account of her chill body art. Elsewhere, Dennis, Sinead, and Hedwig flap their gabs about what a beauty The Beast is. 

The themes of Split centres around the human psyche, a delicate and ultimately pointless mutation. The film is set mostly in an underground labyrinth, which reflects the subconscious -- just as the girls are trapped in the basement, so too are they trapped by the whims of Kevin's freshly buffed chrome dome.
