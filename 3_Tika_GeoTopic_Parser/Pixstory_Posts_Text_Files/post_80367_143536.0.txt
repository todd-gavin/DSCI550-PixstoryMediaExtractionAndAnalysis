PSG weren't a notable team in the late 90s until many great players joined them and made them a relevant European club. Since then, we have witnessed PSG have landed many great players from Europe and especially forwards. 
But their weakness has been indicated through the defense as they used to concede many goals in a game, and it became a concern for the team; if we see many top defenders, we may find very few top-class defenders at PSG's disposal. 
But in past years, the Ligue outfit has made many top-class defenders who came through the academy; below; we look at the top 10 PSG defenders.Â  
#10 Mamadou Sakho
Sakho started his career at PSG at just 17 age, he first played as a striker, but due to fewer defenders in the team, he was shifted to defense and changed into the best center-back for PSG. He won many MVP awards in PSG and established a solid backline. 
His consistency made him captain of the team and the youngest captain in club history. Sakho's six-year at PSG were fruitful as he led the club to glories and made 201 appearances, winning one Ligue 1 title. 
#9 Christophe Jallet
Jallet was acquired to form a defensive pair with Ceara and make a formidable backline. The players were successful in doing so, and PSG were the club least conceded a goal during their time at the club. 
He was a dynamic defender and had great technical knowledge. He won two Ligue 1 titles and made 143 appearances for PSG before leaving for Lyon.
