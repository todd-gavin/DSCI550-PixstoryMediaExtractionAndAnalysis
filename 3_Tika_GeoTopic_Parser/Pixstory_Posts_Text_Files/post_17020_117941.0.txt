Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput are quite active on social media and are often seen sharing beautiful pics from their mushy moments and family time with kids Misha and Zain. The power couple had recently flown to Europe for a long family vacation and they have been sharing beautiful pics from their trip. And now, Mira has once again treated fans with yet another beautiful pic from the vacation.😍🥰

In the pic, Shahid exuded charm in an all white coloured outfit while Mira looked beautiful in a purple coloured sweatshirt which she had paired with white trousers and white sneakers. Interestingly, the power couple was seen recreating the popular train scene from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge as Shahid was seen giving his hand to Mira who was acting as if she was trying to catch the train. She also shared another pic wherein she was seen in a relaxing mode sitting on a chair. Mira captioned the post as, “Acting chill // also cheesy”.😍
