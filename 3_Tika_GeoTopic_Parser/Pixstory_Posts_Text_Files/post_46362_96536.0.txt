I don't have to tell you that dating today is the most complicated it's ever been ! Especially in the age of digital dating when every text and social media post can be painfully analyzed. Between the awkward mixed signals and shy conversations .

We all , ( Including me ) have Many things in our mind which we always wanted to tell or say to our partners ! And Its Equally important for our partner to know all this too !  Of course, everyone should have their own set of dating rules, cherry-picked to their own wants and needs . 

So if Im Dating , i want him to know all this ...

1 Please Do Not Feel Afraid to ask me Questions .

2 Tell me If You feel uncomfortable With where i go , or who i hangout with .

3 Communicate Your feelings with me daily , and in a Clear way .

4 Please Never stop Sending me Selfie .

5 Do Not Fall asleep angry at me .

6 Please Trust Me .

7 Let's have a Room date , With Netflix and food instead of Going out in Resturant .

8 Give Me Bunch Of flowers Instead of Giving me Expensive gifts .

9 Remember , I'm always here with you whenever you feel low or you are going through something .

10 Let's Hug each other in good time and Let's Wipe each other's tears in bad time .

11 Let's talk about Our future Together .

I feel like , a True relationship is Something which " Allows you to sleep peacefully at night " . 

Girls , we aren‚Äôt the only ones who love a little sweet talk every now and then. Our boyfriend / partner is also human ! Like us , he has days when work sucked and he needs a pep talk. He probably also has moments when he is deep in his feels and wants your support .

Do tell me in Notes if i missed any pointü§ç ! Your Suggestion are welcome !‚ú®
