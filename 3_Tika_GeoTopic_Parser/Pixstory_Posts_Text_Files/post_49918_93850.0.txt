‌Opinions, news anything there should be an edit button as deleting is not only the option. The restricting feature of the edit option is much needed as there is some undesirable attention the posts receive. This feature should restrict the same.

‌But is it a better solution? Tesla CEO Elon Musk had bought a 9.2% stake in the company, his first significant tweet was to poll his followers on if the company should add the edit button. Let's not forget that he did tweet much criticism about Twitter. He did delete many of his posts! 

Twitter was like a notice board for many people. Politicians used to make statements, and announce a sense of evidence for the journalist and a major source for newspapers. There is a risk an edit button could be weaponized to deceive or manipulate. It would allow people to manipulate the statements once said and neglect that they even said that. People who post menaces could rewrite their tweets to try to hide what they've done. This would alter the use of Twitter as a medium. This could only make the platform more confusing. Deleting one post is like accepting that the statement was wrong but editing would bring upon a very smooth manipulation of negative statements.
