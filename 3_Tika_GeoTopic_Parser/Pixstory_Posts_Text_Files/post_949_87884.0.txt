The tech giant has closed its $8.5 billion deal to acquire MGM, the home of the Bond franchise and one of the most iconic movie studios in Hollywood history, Amazon announced Thursday.

The move looks to bolster the company's position in the entertainment world while giving its streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, even more content to fill its already extensive library. This should help Amazon challenge rivals such as Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+ in the hyper competitive streaming market.

The deal, which was first announced in May, brings MGM and its more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows under the Amazon umbrella. None of which is bigger than the James Bond franchise, which has racked up billions of dollars over the past 60 years. The suave British spy's latest film, "No Time to Die," has earned more than $770 million globally since its October release.
