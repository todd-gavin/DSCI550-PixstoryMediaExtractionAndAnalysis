What s wrong with you Why you don t want kids I have heard this very often let s break this old and rusty stereotype So what s wrong with women who don t want children Women who don t want babies Are not selfish are not immature or do not hate kids Some women don t want kids because they know they can t handle that kind of commitment Some are too focused on their careers Some just don t want to for financial reasons Being a mother is a full time job and if you re not ready for it you re going to live your whole life with the consequences I have seen so many kids suffer from the lack of attention and love they need from their mothers because they re either too busy or too wrapped up in their own problems Every women have a valid reason for this decision and it s time to praise them for their self awareness and honesty instead of judging them It s time to stop making women feel incomplete just because they don t have kids because a woman can always complete herself with her work with her hobbies with her friends with her passion She doesn t have to nurture a child to feel complete Of course it s a wonderful blessing to be a mother but it s not all she was born to do It s time to break stereotype and stop judging them It s time to stop making them feel guilty because they re choosing not to reproduce It s time to stop assuming that it s a problem they need to solve it s a choice It s nbsp her choice and she has every right not to I have more respect for women who decide not to have It s time to nbsp give these women more respect for being honest about where they are in life and understanding their limitations instead of being unfit mothers Just like having kids is a commendable choice not having them should be too
