The confidence Biden has and the challenges he had to face are getting bigger. He has acknowledged that the country is down with soaring prices and the pandemic and its after-effects. 
‌
‌His confidence roots in the fact of his 5-year career as the president as well as his promise that he will restore the soul of America. Moreover, his progressive thoughts at his age are a hope that people embrace changes.
‌
‌He once said "Because I am confident," he said. "We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact."
‌
‌When he talks about the positive side we cannot forget the growing economic pain of the citizens. Biden has become helpless in certain areas like passing a gun control bill with republicans roaring against it or bringing inflation under control. These would affect him and the democratic party badly because the economy affects day-to-day life and act as a daily reminder of how they struggle and the democrats can't offer help. 
‌
‌In a way, people are forced to choose republicans. The President has to be more open about his frustrations - particularly on inflation to show voters that he shares their interests and to cast Republicans and their policies as impediments to addressing these issues.
‌
‌Instead, he ponders on confidence, and if he fails people will lose faith in him and probably forget all the good things he did.
