Flight bookings to Qatar are booming for the soccer World Cup being held in November and December, with particularly strong demand from the UAE as fans work around a shortage of accommodation in Doha, a study showed on Tuesday.
Flight bookings to Qatar from the UAE and nine other countries have risen 10-fold compared with before the pandemic, travel analysis group Forward Keys said.
From the UAE, they have rocketed 103 times compared with 2016 â€” the last year before the UAE halted direct flights to the country. Flights resumed in early 2021.
