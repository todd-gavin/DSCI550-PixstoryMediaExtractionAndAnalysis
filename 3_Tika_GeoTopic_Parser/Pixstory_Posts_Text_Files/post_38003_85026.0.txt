As per SPORT, Real Madrid midfielder Isco Alarcon will be leaving the club when his contract expires in the summer. The Spaniard has reportedly agreed to a deal with fellow LaLiga club Sevilla. 

Isco joined Real Madrid in 2013 after an exciting couple of seasons with Malaga. Since then, the Spaniard has made 350 appearances for Los Blancos in all competitions. In these, the midfielder has scored 53 goals for the club. 

The 29-year old has been relegated to the bench in the past few seasons. Isco fell out of favour under Zinedine Zidane's management. And he couldn't gain the trust of Carlo Ancelotti as well. 

As per the report, Sevilla had made contact with Isco's agent. Things have escalated since then and as per the latest news, the midfielder has agreed to join the LaLiga side at the end of the season. 

Sevilla are having a wonderful season under the former Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui. They are currently placed second in the LaLiga table and are just six points behind the league leaders Real Madrid. 

Los Blancos have generally not allowed their players to leave to direct Spanish rivals. But the Spanish giants won't be able to have a say in Isco Alarcon's condition. The midfielder becomes a free agent at the end of the season hence he is free to negotiate with any club. 



Other European clubs are also interested 


As per the report, other European clubs were also interested in signing Isco. Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan, and West Ham United were said to be in the running to sign the midfielder as well. 

But Isco Alarcon has supposedly decided to stay in Spain rather than move out for now. Hence it has to be seen if the Spain international manages to revive his career once he leaves Real Madrid at the end of the 2021/22 season.
