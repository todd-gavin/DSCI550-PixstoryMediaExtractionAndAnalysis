The French international leaves the Gunners after five years in North London and now
has completed a move back to Ligue 1.

Alexandre Lacazette has completed a move back to Lyon, returning on a free transfer
after leaving Arsenal.

The French striker’s contract at Arsenal was set to expire on June 30 and he has been
allowed to leave the club.

Lacazette said in April that he had been in talks with “a lot of clubs” and Lyon was the front-runner to sign him for some time.

What contract has Lacazette signed at Lyon?

Lacazette has penned a three-year contract to return to Ligue 1 until 2025. The France international came through Lyon’s youth academy to make 275 appearances for the senior team before Arsenal signed him in 2017.

Did Arsenal get value for money from Lacazette?

As reported by GOAL, it is really difficult, to sum up, Lacazette’s time at Arsenal. There
were plenty of good moments for the striker and his form in the 2018-19 season
deservedly saw him voted the club’s player of the year.

Yet, there will always be a sense that the Frenchman failed to live up to the hype. His
highest scoring tally was just 14 and that came up in his first-ever season in North
London. For someone, who costs what was then a club-record fee of 46.5 million euros,
that is not big enough.

Who will Arsenal sign to replace Lacazette?

Arsenal is due to a shake-up in attack this summer. The Gunners saw Aubameyang
leave for Barcelona this January and now Lacazette heads for the exit.

Meanwhile, Eddie Nketiah’s contract is due to expire at the end of June but he is now
too close to penning a fresh deal at Emirates.

Regardless of Nkeitah’s future, Arsenal will look to invest in new forwards ahead of the
2022-23 campaign.
