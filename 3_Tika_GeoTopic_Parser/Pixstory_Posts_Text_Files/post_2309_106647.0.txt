The apples season in Kashmir is between September and November. 

For the past few years, the growers have suffered as they could not sell their produce the way they used before the Covid pandemic. 

The annual production of apples in the Kashmir Valley ranges from 1.5 million to 1.8 million metric tons and the total cold storage capacity in the Valley is 1.20,000 to 1.30,000 MTs. The valley’s biggest economy, Rs 10,000 crore apple industry, provide a livelihood to around 3.5 million people in the region.

Initially, Kashmir’s apple economy faced a major crisis after the Centre imposed restrictions on public movement on August 5, 2019, to thwart possible protests against the abrogation of Article 370. With no labourers around, the delayed harvest that year led to losses.

Then followed the Covid pandemic and the Apple economy went for a toss.

Hopefully, 2022 will be a bumper year for the apples in terms of harvest and market.
