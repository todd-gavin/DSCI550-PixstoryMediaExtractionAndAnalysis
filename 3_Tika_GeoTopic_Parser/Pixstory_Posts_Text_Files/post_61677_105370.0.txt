Cody Rhodes has become a major attraction of WWE. 

The American Nightmare Cody Rhodes upon his return at The showcase of immortals Kickstarted a rivalry with The Visionary Seth Rollins. The duo faced twice before last night, with Rhodes taking home the wins on both the occasions. 

A fitting conclusion to the rivalry was shaping up, as both men were meeting each other for one final time inside Hell in a Cell. 

Unfortunately, fate had other plans, as Rhodes while brawling Rollins on the go home episode of Raw, had a minor injury as he suffered a tear in his pectoral muscles. The injury got worsened, when Rhodes was in a Weightraining session on a Saturday, where he completely broke the Pecs off of a tendon. 

Despite WWE being ready with the alternative plans, Rhodes insisted on fighting Seth Rollins in the demonic structure, as Rollins had crossed one too many lines to with Rhodes. 

Facing a veteran like Rollins inside Hell in a Cell with a very serious injury is nothing short of a career ending mistake, but Rhodes isn't the one to back down, and nor did he, Rhodes entered the cell on his own two feet and he left the cell on his own two feet. 

Rhodes pinned Rollins sweeping him with a 3-0 victory in their triology, which is being held as a modern day Clasico. 

The American Nightmare tweeted out "For the love of the game" when fans were left wondering why Rhodes was adamant on competing at Hell in a Cell. 

Cody has certainly delivered a performance of a lifetime for the fans, and  certainly made his father Dusty Rhodes, proud by not withdrawing from the matchup. 

Cody's entrance song 'Kingdom' has the perfect lyric to describe the situation

'My father said, when I was younger, 
Hard times breed better men, BETTER MEN'

Rhodes delivering a bone chilling performance while fighting a career ending injury is an absolute testament that HARD TIMES INDEED BREED BETTER MEN.
