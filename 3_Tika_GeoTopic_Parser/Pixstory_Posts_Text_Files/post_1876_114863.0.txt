Gulshan Rai, who had turned producer with Johny Mera Naam (1970) was planning a big film. He liked the script written by SJ immensely & got Yash Chopra on board. Yash Chopra was known for his romantic hits. This film had no romance. Instead it had an antihero who was like a lone ranger. But Yash Chopra liked it. He asked SJ & SJ strongly recommended Bachchan. They said only Bachchan could do the central role. Chopra asked them, in jest, whether Bachchan paid them for these strong recommendations.

What Chopra did not know that SJ had managed to sell Bachchan to the Sippys as well, for a film that had a police inspector hiring two ruffians to catch a dreaded dacoit. That film had started & was now well into its production. 

Deewar was released on 24th January 1975 & this time, it was clear that not only was the film a big hit, the popular tastes had turned too. The people now had no time for the romantic stuff, and the mushy songs, and the goody-goody hero. They wanted to see the hero all fired up, angry & bashing up the baddies. 

As always, this change in popular taste was swift, brutal & completely unanticipated. 

In 1975, Bachchan had multiple releases: Deewar, Zameer, Sholay, Faraar, Chupke Chupke & Mili. Such was the draw of his popular appeal that all, except Faraar, succeeded commercially.

Bachchan now had long hair & a fuller body to support his deep voice & gravitas. He looked the most well-placed actor to succeed in this post-1975 action films era. 

The Big B era had arrived. Finally. After 6 long years during which he was written off multiple times. 

A definitive biography of Amitabh Bachchan would be a fascinating read.
