“Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there.” - Arthur Fleck (Joker)

The innocent perspective,
Upon life can change in a blink,
We all aren’t born inventive,
So we receive another kick,

Into the gut by these societies,
Which loves to please their deities.
We are all alone,
Some of us literally so,

While other pretend to be so,
No one is made of stone,
Yet no one is nice,
All I can hear are cries.

Abandonment isn’t the sole issue,
It is just the tip of the iceberg,
Which leads to the drowning of this titanic belief,
That there is no such thing as grief,

Too busy in our own selves,
Not even checking up on our loved ones.
The first act of liberation,
Be it in anyway possible,

Seems to be the only truth,
That keeps us away from submission,
To this cruel society of sadists,
Who live for the fall of others.

The silence is pleasing,
The laughter in it is pure,
For you are all you need.
Keep on wondering,

The different plot lines of this story
Let your imagination do the killing.
Passing along familiar,
Yet strange hallways,

Dancing down stairways,
Conscious is finally clear,
It wants to seek chaos,
Lies cannot hold peace any longer.

Ask your questions,
The answers never mattered,
As everyone has already decided,
Right or wrong is based on popularity,

There won’t be an escalation in tensions,
As this glass holding equilibrium just shattered.
An anarchist is born,
When all his life is torn,

By the injustice of this humorous world.
Tragedies built upon comedies,
Grief still has no remedies,
Lets just try to put on a happy face.


This is a poem inspired by the movie, "Joker."
