Smart glasses are set to be the next big thing in technology, but for now, they're an interesting experiment that puts cameras and headphones into what look like normal sunglasses. Some can even work as basic augmented reality devices, projecting a computer screen into the corner of your eye.

Best Smart Glasses Overall: Vuzix Blade

This newly upgraded version of the Vuzix Blade offers tons of advanced features in a surprisingly compact set of glasses. Itâ€™s powered by its own processor and Android OS - the same system found in Android phones. 
The Blade features a full-color display on the right lens that overlay digital graphics onto the real world. These glasses also have some great hardware features, the most notable being a built-in 8MP camera that can record HD video. Noise-canceling microphones also allow you to take calls and use the voice control features. These also have full UV protection, and are available with prescription lenses for an additional cost.
