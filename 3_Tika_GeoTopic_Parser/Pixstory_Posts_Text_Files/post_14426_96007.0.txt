We have definitely felt and have heard people say that they feel a satisfaction while they help someone now a new study proves that it does. 

A study published in the Journal Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience states that people who donates charity for others increases one's production of oxytocin, which is a mood enhancing hormone which is associated with reproduction which was thought to decrease a person's ages. 

100 participants between the age of 18 to 99 were called for the study and they were shown a video about a little boy with cancer. The researchers looked into the oxytocin level of the participants before and after watching the video. 

The participants were given an option of contributing for the cancer charity in the film and the results found were that the hormone that was released was most likely to give. The participants who attended the study were older as well. 

The study author Paul J Zak, Ph.D, the director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California shared to Healthline that the study that took place is something that shows for the first time about the connection and the increase in oxytocin among elder adults. 

“What was surprising… was the strength of the relationship [between doing good acts and releasing more oxytocin],” Zak said. “It is so strong in older people, it’s really one of the most ‘wow’ and bullet-proof [results] I’ve seen in 20 years of being in the lab.” 

Zak had previously looked into various other studies in many years which looked at the impact of the oxytocin among younger people. And the results did show how prosocial behaviour increased the production of the hormone. He wanted to check if it had the same impact among the older adults. 

The experts said that it is “consistent with our intuition as well." It also suggests that those who give they have a possibility of staying happy for longer periods.
