I am here I am here And so is the beach the sand and the sky All I want is to lay here with you and together we shall forget the world The garden will burst into life The garden will burst into life We have travelled our roads to get here All I ask of you is to lay here lay here It doesn t matter if you have a halo or a horn All I ask of you is to lay here lay here You came at last you laid here Now all I ask is if you would forget the world with me
