It's useful to know that whatever you're living with
isn't actually normal. Realizing the difference
between a healthy vs an unhealthy household
environment can really open your eyes. I feel like it's
the first step in become self aware and reflecting
about what's really going on.

Alot of the times when kids grew up in a
dysfunctional toxic household, they feel like whatever
they have been living through is normal so when they
talk to friends about, say about a family routine,
these friends will be wondering why things seem
sooo abnormal hearing it. (Something that's
happened to me, which let me to start question
everything).
