It's very true and common - for a long time , no one really want to talk about depression . But to all those people who don't want to talk about depression , i want to say that - Nobody wants to be depressed . Understand this straight up ! 
But now some people are taking depression seriously and working hard to change the thinking . The point is - we all should learn how to talk about depression and what to say to a depressed person . It's very important to control our words . We can’t help someone with depression in any meaningful way without talking to them about it . That’s why it’s so important to have the courage to speak up and find your words ! 🧠✨
Let's discuss what to say to a depressed person ; ✅
1 No one can imagine how you feel , but I’m here for you if you need me . 
2 Give a silent hug to them .
3 We all care about you .
4 I’m sorry . I know that was important to you .
5 If you want to talk about it , you can . 
6 Things are difficult right now , but I have confidence in you . 
7 Is there anything you need from me ??
8 Remember - You’re enough and you’re not weak .
Don’t ask people why they are depressed even though everything in their life is sorted . When you ask a depressed person why he was depressed even though life was joyful , It is like asking why pneumonia patients suffocated while the air was there !‌‌
Often the simplest way to initiate a conversation is to be direct . Show your support , ask them what they are feeling , remind them that effective treatment are available . 
Make you mental health as your priority . 🧠❤️
