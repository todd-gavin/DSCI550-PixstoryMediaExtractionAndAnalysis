Then we come to the ending, we see Obi Wan finally at peace with himself having rid himself of the ghost of his past, including the trauma, the guilt and the fear he had burdened himself with for over ten years. He dawns new whiter looking clothes, moves out of the cave he was living in symbolizing his peace. 

Vader however is still not at peace, his anger, hate and obsession with Kenobi have only increased since his defeat and he is more determined than ever to find his former master and kill him.

 However, we soon get a surprise appearance from Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, who questions Vader’s motives concerning his old master, detecting in him conflict, confusion and normal than usual agitation which even makes him guess his loyalty.

 Ultimately Vader denounces his hunt for Kenobi after swearing his loyalty to Palpatine. Then of course we get one of the best scenes of all time where Obi Wan lets Luke have a childhood, and Owen finally lets the old Jedi Master meet his soon to be apprentice.

 Of course Obi Wan says one of the most treasured lines in the Star Wars community to greet the future Jedi Knight, “Hello There!” I felt a great surge in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in joy, and then would not stay quiet.

 Afterwards, riding off in the desert sun , Obi Wan is greeted by the spirit of Qui Gonn with Liam Neeson doing the role for the first physically since Phantom Menace, telling Kenobi how he had always been there, only that his apprentice was not ready to see him before telling him to come with him, thus indicating the beginning of Obi Wan’s training to become a Force Ghost like his old master.
