When Julius Caesar was captured by a group of pirates, he laughed in their faces. Caesar soon collected the ransom and sent his men to brimg enough silver to free him.

As he waited, Caesar won over the pirates, though treating them as minions. He gained so much trust among the pirates, that they didn't believe it when he proclaimed that he would come back and kill them all. 

Caesar did go back later, cut their throats, and crucified them all.
