United, who are vying for a place in next season's Champions League, were reportedly planning to approach Enrique, according to the Daily Mirror. The club is reported to be eager to appoint a new manager before the start of next season.
However, rumours in Spain citing Enrique prior to his national team's friendly match against Iceland tonight imply he plans to stay in his current position. And Enrique intimated that nothing would make him happier than to lead his team to victory at this year's World Cup in Qatar.
"In Qatar, I will be with Spain, and whatever comes, we will see," the 51-year-old coach, who led his country to the Euros semi-finals last July, told Marca.
“Is there any more doubt? Do I have to repeat it more times?
“There is no position that excites me more than representing my country in Qatar.”
During Enrique's three-year tenure as Barcelona's manager, the club won eight major trophies.
In 2014-15, he guided Catalan to a treble, winning La Liga, the Champions League, and the Spanish Cup.
Manchester United is said to have interviewed Ten Hag, who is widely regarded as a serious contender for the manager's job. Former Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal, on the other hand, has publicly advised that his compatriot should not take on the post.
The Netherlands chief said: "Ten Hag is great coach.
"A great coach is good for Man Utd. But they are a commercial club.
"Those are difficult choices for a coach. He should choose a football club, not a commercial club."
The Old Trafford giants have been heavily connected with Mauricio Pochettino, amid reports that the Argentinian could leave Paris Saint-Germain in the near future.
