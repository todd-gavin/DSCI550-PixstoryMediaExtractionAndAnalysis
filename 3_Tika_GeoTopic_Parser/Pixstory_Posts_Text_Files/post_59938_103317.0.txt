Sidhu Moose Wala was also known as one of Punjab's most controversial musicians, openly supporting gun culture and praising gangsters in aggressive songs.
On Sunday, May 29, unidentified assailants shot and killed Punjabi musician Sidhu Moose Wala in Jawaharke village, Mansa district.
This comes only one day after 424 individuals, including Punjabi artist Sidhu Moose Wala, were detained by Punjab Police.
Sidhu Moose Wala ran for the Punjab assembly on a Congress ticket from Mansa, but was beaten by AAP candidate Vijay Singla by a whopping 63,000 votes. Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann recently fired Vijay Singla amid allegations of corruption.
Sidhu Moose Wala stirred a controversy last month when he used his new song 'Scapegoat' to mock the Aam Aadmi Party and its fans. In his song, the performer allegedly branded AAP supporters "gaddar"  .
