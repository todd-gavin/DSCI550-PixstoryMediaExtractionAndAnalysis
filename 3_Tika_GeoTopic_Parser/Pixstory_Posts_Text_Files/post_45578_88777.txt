I am looking forward to this year s NOLA Festival I have been attending this since I was a little girl with my dad but this year it is even more special as my favourite author Tennessee Williams is being celebrated As Brad Rhines said It s been years since Blanche Dubois hopped on an old rattle trap streetcar named Desire poor and desperate and forever changed American theatre The Broadway premiere of A Streetcar Named Desire a clash of romance and realism that introduced the world to iconic characters and established Williams as a distinct voice whose landmark plays have been in heavy rotation on stages around the world for more than three quarters of a century had an immediate and lasting influence The Tennessee Williams New Orleans Literary Festival this year honours the diamond anniversary of A Streetcar Named Desire by paying respect to the playwright s best known work while also highlighting some of his lesser known works The festival will feature a diverse mix of speakers and panel discussions as well as performances throughout the weekend that highlight Williams breadth and depth of work I can t wait for it
