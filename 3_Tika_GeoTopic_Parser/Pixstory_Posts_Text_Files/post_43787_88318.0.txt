The businessman had publicly expressed his desire to purchase the club, but a misunderstanding has taken him out of the running.

Muhsin Bayrak, a Turkish millionaire, has confessed that a mix-up over an email account caused him to miss the deadline to buy Chelsea.

After sanctions were imposed on owner Roman Abramovich as a result of the oligarch's ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is currently supervising an invasion of Ukraine, the Blues were put up for sale.

Bayrak had announced his intention to buy the club in recent weeks, but he claims he missed the deadline to submit an offer on Friday.

What's been said so far?

Bayrak alleged to Reuters that his company, AB Group Holdings, was unable to contact Raine Bank, the entity conducting the sale, in a timely manner.
He said: “There was a misunderstanding with the lawyers about the auction procedure of AB Group and we missed the deadline as a result.

“There was confusion over an email address and we couldn't lodge the offer we wanted to buyChelsea.

“I'm really sorry for the confusion that has occurred.”

What does Chelsea's future hold?

Nearly 30 groups are understood to have shown an interest in purchasing the Stamford Bridge club, with the number due to be cut down in the coming weeks.

The UK government is involved in the process and has stated that the club will be sold to whoever is assessed to be able to contribute the most value to the club, rather than the highest bidder.

It is still uncertain when the new owners will be revealed, although all parties involved are thought to be eager to close the purchase as soon as possible.
