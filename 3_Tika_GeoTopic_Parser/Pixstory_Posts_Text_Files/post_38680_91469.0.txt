According to Manchester Evening News, Man Utd could turn to Gakpo, for an attacking option if Cavani departs for another club. He could fill in the void left by the Uruguayan. In 37 matches he has bagged 16 goals and 37 whopping assists. Incoming manager Erik Ten Hag is very impressed with his performances and may try to lure him. 


But getting his signature won't be any cakewalk, as Arsenal are after the  £42 million rated Dutch international. Barcelona, Liverpool, and Bayern Munich are circling around like hungry sharks, looking for an opportunity to get to their club. PSV technical director Jong De Jong has recently said that Gakpo will leave one day for greener pasture. This summer he may be on the lookout for a new club. So watch this space.
