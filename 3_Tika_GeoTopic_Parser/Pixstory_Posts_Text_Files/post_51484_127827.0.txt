Premier League side Manchester United have potentially identified Brazil and Real Madrid defensive midfield star Carlos Casemiro in recent times - per a report from Spanish journalist José Félix Díaz of news outlet MARCA. 

The Reds even after securing former Ajax manager Erik Ten Hag as their new head coach are yet to see some kind of improvement in performance as well as in results. United have made a nightmare start to their 2022/23 Premier League campaign after losing quite embarrassingly to Brighton and Brentford. They are seeing a repeat of the 1992/93 PL season where Sir Alex Ferguson's men lost their two opening matches and sat rock bottom of the Premier League but later they did redeem themselves by winning the inaugural PL title.

United have been lack lustre both in their performances recently as well as in attracting big names to join the club and the snub from Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong despite both the clubs reaching an agreement is no exception.

Now, Ten Hag is on the lookout for reinforcements for his team, especially in the midfield which has shown a dilapidated form since last season. According to the report from MARCA, the name of Casemiro has come up a few times among the Old Trafford atmosphere with the Ajax manager reported to be contemplating a move for one of the best defensive midfielders in the world. 

There is no official offer from Man United for the Brazilian yet but anything can happen until the transfer deadline. 

It is a possibility that the Reds will be looking to play on the new introduction of Aurelien Tchouameni at Real Madrid who is expected to replace Casemiro in the near future. 

However, it is unlikely that Real Madrid will let go of their star man who has been a loyal servant to the club since he came from Sao Paulo for a €6 million fee back in 2013.
