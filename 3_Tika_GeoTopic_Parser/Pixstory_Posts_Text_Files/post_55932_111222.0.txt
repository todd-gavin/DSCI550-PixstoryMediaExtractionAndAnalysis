Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has been sworn at the Supreme Court being the first Black woman to serve on the highest court in the US. She is proudly making history. 

She is receiving the two required oaths: First, which is being administered by Chief Justice John Roberts-Constitutional Oath, and the other by Justice Stephen Breyer-the Judicial Oath.

She has been nominated by Joe Biden fulfilling his promise to be inclusive in administration and judiciary affairs. Biden wanted a great record along with professional and demographic diversity. 

Jackson was been tailored for the job- she had a great resume that included Harvard degrees and federal clerkships, but her lived knowledge was rooted in public service being a public prosecutor.

Biden had pledged to make history by naming a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Such a historic move would promote a group of female potential nominees who have broken the barriers to reaching the top of the legal profession. 

She said during her confirmation hearing: "I've experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am, and that might be valuable," she said. "I hope it would be valuable if I was confirmed to the circuit court."

 Last June, the Senate confirmed Jackson to that post by a 53-44 vote. She also brought out the traps of launching a career in the law and suggested recent studies that show that lawyers of color — both male and female — constitute only 8% of law firm equity partners nationwide.
