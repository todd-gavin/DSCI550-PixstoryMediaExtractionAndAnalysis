The Kia MVP Ladder is published every Friday during the season with an in-depth look at the top Kia MVP candidates. But with multiple players still in the mix for the award this season, NBA.com is also publishing a daily MVP Tracker detailing the game-by-game performance of each player.

It’s probably long overdue, but let’s welcome Boston Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum to the chat.

Named one of the NBA Players of the Week on two occasions already this month, Tatum scorched the Utah Jazz on Wednesday for 11 of his 26 points in a virtually flawless opening frame, as Boston started the game shooting 15 of 19 from the floor and 7 of 9 from deep to capture its 21st victory in its last 24 outings by way of a 125-97 stomping

“We could’ve made excuses coming off a long [four-game] road trip (that Boston finished undefeated, winning three of those games by 20 points or more) and had a slow start, but we didn’t want to,” Tatum told NBC Sports Boston while clutching his son, Deuce, in the postgame on-court interview. “We wanted to come out and prove a point.”

Simultaneously, Tatum vaulted himself into the thick of today’s edition of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, making his top five debut at No. 4 in this hotly-contested battle behind new leader Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Just 54 days ago, the Celtics defeated Miami behind a combined 49 points from Jaylen Brown and Tatum to improve to 27-15, leaving the team sitting at ninth in the Eastern Conference standings.

Now, Boston owns the longest active winning streak in the East (five games), holds the fourth spot, and threatens to creep into the top three.

“We’re clicking on all cylinders,” Tatum told NBC Sports Boston.

Since the All-Star break, Tatum has lifted his scoring average from 25.7 points to 32.1 on 50.7% from the field and 43.8% from long range to go with 7.1 rebounds and 4.6 assists on the way to becoming the league’s current total plus-minus leader.
