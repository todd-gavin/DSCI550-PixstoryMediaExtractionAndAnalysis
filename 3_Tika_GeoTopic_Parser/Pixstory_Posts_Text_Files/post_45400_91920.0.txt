The former England international has set his sights on becoming the Blues' head coach in the
long run. Former Chelsea midfielder John Terry has stated that becoming the club's manager is
his ambition.

Terry was a member of Chelsea's senior squad for 19 years after graduating from the club's
youth programme. He has returned to Stamford Bridge as a coaching consultant, although he
aims to advance to the post of head coach in the future years.

“Yeah, that’s my dream," Terry told Stadium Astro when asked if his aim is to become the Blues
boss.

“Obviously, when you’re a kid you want to play in the first team. As a coach, I’ve shifted this way
now.

"The long-term ambition and goal is to be Chelsea manager, of course. That feels a little bit
funny saying that because someone’s in the job and listen, we are still talking 10, 15 years down
the line maybe.

“But I have to have an end goal and that’s it. It’s my dream. Hopefully, it happens. I’m on the
process of doing that but a lot of things in between that have to go very well for me.
“So, I’m being very patient in the decisions I’m making in my next step in terms of management.

“But being back at Chelsea is very pleasing for me. It was quite emotional when I first drove in."

Terry left Chelsea in 2017 to join Aston Villa, where he won five Premier League titles and a
Champions League trophy among other honours.

Terry was named assistant coach of the club after a year in the Championship, when he
assisted Villa in gaining promotion to the Premier League. He left in July of last year before
starting his new job at Chelsea in January of this year.
