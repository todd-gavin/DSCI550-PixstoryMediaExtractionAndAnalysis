Last month, US President Joe Biden signed a landmark gun-control bill into law. The legislation passed with bipartisan support has limits while it was a step in 
America's efforts to tackle growing gun violence. What is the future of gun laws in the US?

There are 19 states and Washington DC that have red flag laws. Only two of those states - Florida and Indiana - have Republican-controlled legislatures.

The law just passed by Congress does not establish a national red flag law, but includes $750m in incentive payments for states to set up their own.

What are these red flag laws? Red flag laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders, allow police to temporarily seize legally owned guns from people who a judge has ruled to be a danger to themselves or others. More states might be willing to set their red flag laws with the funding of the federal government.
However, these laws will only be effective if high-risk individuals are quickly identified and firearms removed from them.
