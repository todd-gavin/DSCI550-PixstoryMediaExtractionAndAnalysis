While some audiences may view the film as a clich d boy meets girl romance it is more about two people helping each other to be better versions of themselves rather than just a love story The film poignantly shows love and compromise in a realistic way making it worth seeing Before We Go features a dialogue driven storytelling method that is typical of this genre The film begins with Nick Vaughan Chris Evans a trumpet player practicing in Grand Central Terminal at a m He notices Brooke Dalton Alice Eve an art consultant closing a big deal in town missing her late night train Although financially strapped himself Nick offers to help her get home Secrets linger as the two traverse New York City Nick is supposed to attend a wedding reception where his ex girlfriend is present and Brooke must be back in New Haven Conn before her husband gets home so she can get rid of an angry letter she wrote him and save their marriage Both Nick and Brooke have suffered severely in their love lives and still carry huge emotional burdens This movie isn t a love story between Nick and Brooke it s a story of how their lives intersecting gave them not only the ability to deal with their emotional baggage but also make room for reconciliation Nick and Brooke both needed someone who would just listen to them and that s what they found in each other It s a beautiful movie which I m sure everyone would love to see
