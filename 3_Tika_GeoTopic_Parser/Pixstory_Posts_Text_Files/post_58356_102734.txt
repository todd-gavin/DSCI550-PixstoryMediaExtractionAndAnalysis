Clouds are cool I know the weather is not grami hai yr But Clouds are cool The moon is too beautiful I m looking at the sky Gazing it s beauty by eyes The stars and their absence but But I am waiting for them to twinkle and mark their presence The darker it grows The more beauty it holds The loneliness with sky is not a beast It s such a living peace The more I turn around The more I want to be on this ground Waiting to be found But still I am bound Sky s limitlessness My recklessness Matches the level Clearer it get Clear the mind Even it s dew and hue Still give the ideas maybe a lot or a few What more a writer needs Leaving the world s greed Grateful to survive Grateful to strive And to thrive Under this sky which makes me insignificant But so significant
