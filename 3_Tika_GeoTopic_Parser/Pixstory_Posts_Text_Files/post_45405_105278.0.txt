Croatia and France both faced shock losses and will be looking to do better when they square off in
Group 1 League A UEFA Nations League in Stadion Poljud.

The 2018 World Cup finalists meet once again, with Denmark and Austria for company in their group.

The two sides would be considered favourites in their group, but both have lost their opening matches.

Croatia will be looking to fix a leaky defence, with the two conceded two goals for the fourth match in a
row in UEFA’s Nations League fixtures.

While France are gifted with a truly wonderful team with great firepower, injuries to Mbappe and Varane
have provided a setback to the team.

Croatia vs France: Probable Playing XI

Croatia: Dominik Livakovic (GK); Duje Caleta-Car, Domagoj Vida, Josip Juranovic, Borna Barisic, Luka
Modric, Mateo Kovacic, Mario Pasalic, Nikola Vlasic, Mislav Orsic, Andrej Kramaric

France: Hugo Lloris (GK); Lucas Hernandez, William Saliba, Jules Kounde, Jonathan Clauss, Theo
Hernandez, Adrien Rabiot, Aurelien Tchouameni, Antoine Griezmann, Christopher Nkunku, Karim
Benzema

Croatia vs France: Predictions

Despite their recent injury woes, France still hold enough quality to be able to beat Croatia easily.

Croatia’s poor form and defensive woes do not help them coming into this fixture.

Prediction: Croatia 0 - 2 France
