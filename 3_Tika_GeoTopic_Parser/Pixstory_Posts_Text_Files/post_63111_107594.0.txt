Zendaya took to Twitter after a bizarre TikTok video suggesting she was pregnant went viral, and she addressed the allegations directly. 

To be clear, Zendaya is not expecting a child. However, during the early hours of June 15, when a video purporting to show her sonogram went viral, many on Twitter were sceptical. Zendaya, on the other hand, put a stop to any conjecture with a post on her Instagram Story. "Now you see why I don't use Twitter," she wrote. "Weekly, I just make stuff up for no reason." Anyway, let's get back to shooting."
