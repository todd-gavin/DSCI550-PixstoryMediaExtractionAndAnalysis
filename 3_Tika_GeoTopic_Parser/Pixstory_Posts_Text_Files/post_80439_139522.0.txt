Domenico Tedesco has been fired as RB Leipzig's head coach following their Champions League loss to Shakhtar Donetsk by a score of 4-1.
On Wednesday morning, the Bundesliga team released the following statement: "RB Leipzig has parted ways with Domenico Tedesco effective immediately." Assistant coaches Max Urwantschky and Andreas Hinkel have both departed the team. In due course, RB Leipzig will reveal his successor.
Donetsk's Marian Shved scored a brace on his dream debut, while Leipzig's Mykhailo Mudryk also scored to shock them on Tuesday night. Mudryk is a transfer target for Arsenal. Despite having a depleted roster with the loss of the majority of its foreign players as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Shakhtar managed to score on four of its five attempts on goal while playing in Leipzig.
Reporters could see Tedesco's displeasure following the loss. Following such a game, Tedesco stated, "It's incredibly tough to find the correct words for this; it's impossible to convey." "It kind of captures a lot of what we've been through the last several weeks," the speaker said.
Tedesco was appointed by Leipzig nine months earlier after managing Spartak Moscow for two years.Last season, Tedesco guided Leipzig to its first major championship in its 13-year existence, the German Cup. However, the Bundesliga season has not started well for Leipzig, and on Saturday, they were defeated 4-0 by Eintracht Frankfurt.
Oliver Mintzlaff, the chief executive of Leipzig, stated after the German Cup victory, "For this, Domenico and his management team deserve our appreciation. Timo Werner was added during the summer, but the 36-year-old manager's fortunes this season have been very different. But given our weak start in the Bundesliga with just five points from five games, as well as our recent losses to Eintracht and Shakhtar, we think a managerial change is the best course of action to immediately turn things around.
