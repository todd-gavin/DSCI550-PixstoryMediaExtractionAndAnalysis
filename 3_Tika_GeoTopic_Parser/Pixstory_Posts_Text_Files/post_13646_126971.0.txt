From Everyone I asked told this goal in different languages ​​- it was to be able to live in the shadow of independence and freedom. This slogan "Independence, freedom, my country" was the voice of the people and the people wanted this. to state how this great country, its rulers and its leaders got independence; How to eradicate alien and arrogant powers
Independence means that the nation and government no longer have to accept the imposition of foreign powers. Whatever the foreigners wanted, be done according to their wishes; If they sacrificed the interests of the country, the government should not blame; If they encroach on the country's national resources, no one should speak; If the nation disagrees, the government will hit it in the head! We ourselves touched it with our skin, flesh, body and soul. The independence movement of India came and made the nation, the country and the government independent. Today, no power in the world can influence the issues of our country and force us to do something. The officials of the country look and do whatever they deem expedient. The nation is the spectator and judge of the actions of the officials; If you like them, you will stand behind the authorities; If you don't like it, it will change them; Authority is in the hands of the nation
One of the values ​​is political, economic and cultural independence. People wanted this country not to be condemned by the European regime politically; From an economic point of view, its economy should not be dependent on global companies that can do whatever they want with this country. Culturally, with its deep and rich culture, it should not blindly obey and follow foreign culture.

What we have understood, what is our duty, what we know our God wants; We say it, we choose it and we go that way. No one can influence our nation, government and system. This is political independence and we have achieved it.
