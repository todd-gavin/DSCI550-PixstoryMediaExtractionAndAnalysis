In the end we all are the same we have similar stories which is why most of us have relatable stories or characters in our lives We might have experienced different types of heartbreaks from different people We might have cried for different reasons We might have had toxic relationships with partners parents children or bosses We might have been toxic at some point We might have healed yet broken We might we struggled but differently We all have similar yet different journeys So empathise lift each other if possible and be kind Happy Life Happy Day
