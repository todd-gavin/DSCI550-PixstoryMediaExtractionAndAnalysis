It’s time to rejoice for F1 fans like me! Celebrities such as Michael Jordan, David Beckham, and 'The Rock' are set to attend Formula One's maiden Miami Grand Prix, as the sport's popularity in the United States soars to new heights. 

Deccan Herald reported that following a succession of fruitless attempts in the 1980s to break into the American market, the country appeared to be a lost cause for the world's most popular motor racing series, with fans preferring NASCAR and the local IndyCar open-wheel series. 

Despite this, many in Formula One, including seven-time world winner Lewis Hamilton, believe that the times have changed.

“Growing up knowing how amazing the sport is and seeing that there was still quite a disconnect between the US and the rest of the world in terms of the passion for this sport, it's really amazing to see that we've cracked it and there's a growing love in the States”, said Mercedes driver Hamilton. 

The Miami race, which quickly sold out, is the fifth round of the season and one of two in the United States this year, along with the long-running race in Austin, Texas. There will be three in 2023, with Las Vegas being the first.
