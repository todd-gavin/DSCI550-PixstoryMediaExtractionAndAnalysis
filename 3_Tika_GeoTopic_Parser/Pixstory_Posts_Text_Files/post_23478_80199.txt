Day Waking up with a super amazing view from the window birds chirping sunlight peeping in and the aroma of freshness in the air It was a bliss It was our first morning in Manali We had no particular plan or itinerary designed It was more of a leisure trip and we wanted to relax and enjoy our time there rather than packing our bags and running to places I made breakfast for everyone then we decided to go on a walk in the garden Later we went on a drive to explore the place We stopped by some local shops shopped for very pretty handmade goods a bottle of fresh honey which tasted so pure and different As we were busy exploring so we didn t bother enough to sit and have lunch The plan was to enjoy our evening at the very famous The Johnson s Cafe situated just km from The Mall Road The place had a beautiful garden surrounding the cafe along with outside seating options If you want to soak in the feeling of being in Manali with some nice cocktails pizza and great ambience then The Johnson s Cafe is where you should be The cafe overlooked the scenic beauty and chilly mountains of Manali giving it an amazing aura The decor was colourful and peppy which adds to the character of the cafe The cocktails were just amazing especially the ones with cinnamon in it The ambience was great with all the fresh air and aroma of the most yum pizza I have ever had getting baked We sat for a little longer to enjoy the live music and danced for a while too We called it a night and went back to our home away from home To be continued Pictures by Bhumika
