According to data from the CML Centro Meteo Lombardo network of control units, the Lombardy plain is thirsty as never before in over half of the places in the plain equipped with rain gauges this year not even the millimeters of rainfall have been reached, i.e. less than a third of the accumulated rains that normally they fall between January and June The most serious situation concerns the rice-growing plain between the provinces of Pavia and that of Lodi Things are not better on the Apennine hills of the Oltrep where the streams are dry and in various centers of the Valle Staffora supply is starting to be rationed water But what is more serious is the lack of supplies from the Alpine basins which in this period should still benefit from the thaw waters the snow this year has disappeared for some time even at the highest altitudes and with the heat pushing the freezing point to altitudes above meters what is melting a month and a half ahead of time is the snow and ice that are no longer perennial In any case these are largely insufficient contributions to meet the thirst of the fields According to data periodically updated by ARPA Lombardia the mountain basins of large rivers on which the majority of agricultural and industrial needs depend have an unprecedented rainfall deficit since the beginning of the year in the Adda mountain basin mm of rain has fallen which has gone a little better in the Orobic chain where mm have been measured on average By comparison in the last few years the precipitation measured in the same period of the year was approximately mm in the Adda basin and in those of Brembo and Serio Overall, since the beginning of the year, a rainfall deficit has accumulated in the Alpine basins which can be estimated at around billion cubic meters of water
