Try to change what is changeable and the things that in your hand otherwise Whatever it s just accept itttt and let it be whatever it s work hard as much as i can bcz i need yourself self if i care if I be sad nothing will be change but if I work hard if I fight if I struggle will be happy by thinking that yes I m a strong girl After years what I want to see a loser woman who couldn t come out of depression cuz of the problems Or a strong woman who will say that yhhhhhhh i did it i never gave up I m a solider Now I see I suffer i struggle and i ACCEPT cuz i know everything happens for a reason from our almighty Allah who im to not accept what Allah want I m working hard I m trying even a single and small thing that i do for my future it makes me happy because at least im trying im not giving up sometimes i become sad tired hopeless but i stand again because everything pass so don t we pass it with hope With smile It s not impossible life is not easy but you can make it easy and not letting it make you weak We are Muslims we blv that Allah see what we suffer how we suffer and how we put our tawakal to him This feeling this blv make us more strong I don t say that yeahh im happy No I m not ok I m not happy but I m not that weak girl as i was before I feel better than before I accept what comes what go and what s going on i blv that my lord knows better than us and nothing will happen till it s not for our goodness I proud of myself and anyone who is strong who is not giving up and who blv to lord s plan To be continued
