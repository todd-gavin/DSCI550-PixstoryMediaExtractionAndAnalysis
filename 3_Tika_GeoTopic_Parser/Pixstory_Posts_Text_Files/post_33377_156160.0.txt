The bearing of these stupas from the garden of Amradarika was not stated; but Cunningham mentioned that since the mass of the existing brick ruins lied to the westward of the southern entrance of the fort, the whole of the monuments should have been situated in this direction. 
He further mentioned that of the six stupas described by Hieun Tsang, it was probable that only two were of any size, namely, that erected on the spot where the Buddha had announced his approaching nirvana, and that which contained the relics of Ananda. Cunningham mentioned that the site could not be excavated further due to the existence of religious shrines (tombs) on the top of the mound, which could have revealed the purpose of the erection of the stupa. The stupa of the relics of Ananda at Rajgir is mentioned by Hieun Tsang as being superb. Cunningham mentions that an annual fair used to be held at the site of the Besarh stupa, in the month of Chaitra, attended by thousands of persons who assembled at the shrine of Mir Abdal.
 Since the occurrence of the fair was regulated by the solar reckoning of the Hindus, he concluded that the fair must have been established long before the arrival of the saint. He thus conjectured that the festival may have been held in the honour of the Buddha or of one of his disciples. He mentioned that two ornamented stone pillars of medieval date were found during excavation at the foot of the mound, some time back.Â The stupa containing the holy relics of the Buddha was excavated later in 1958 and are presently preserved at the Patna Museum.
