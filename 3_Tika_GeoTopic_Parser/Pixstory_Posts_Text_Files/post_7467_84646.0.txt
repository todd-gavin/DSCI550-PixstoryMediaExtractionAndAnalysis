A speeding driver and his two passengers died early Monday after he veered off Manhattan’s Henry Hudson Parkway and their BMW plummeted onto the Amtrak tracks below, bursting into flames, cops said.

The 39-year-old driver, Edgar Valette — a father of four who ran an elevator business and was expecting the birth of a son — was headed downtown when he lost control near W. 178th St. in Washington Heights and struck a concrete barrier, police said.

The luxury vehicle crashed through a railing near 181st St. about 1:40 a.m., cops said, soared off the parkway and landed on railroad tracks about 500 feet below near the George Washington Bridge.

The driver was ejected and died at the scene as the car erupted into a fireball.

After first responders extinguished the blaze they found a dead woman inside the vehicle, burned beyond recognition. The victim, identified by sources as Kimberly Martinez, 28, was so badly charred cops were unable to initially determine the gender.

Police found a third victim, a man, under the BMW, also dead.

Valette’s wife, Gina Alegria, 35, said the male passenger, Michael Santos, 30, was a close friend of her husband. She didn’t know the female passenger, or where they were coming from.

“He was a very loving person. He wanted to help everyone. He built elevators from scratch and repaired them,” Alegria said of her husband. “His dream was to become a millionaire and empower his people. He wanted to teach them to be financially free.”

Valette and Alegria had two sons together, ages 4 and 2, and she’s nine months pregnant with their third son, she said.
