My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains My sense as though of hemlock I had drunk Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past and Lethe wards had sunk Tis not through envy of thy happy lot But being too happy in thine happiness That thou light winged Dryad of the trees In some melodious plot Of beechen green and shadows numberless Singest of summer in full throated ease O for a draught of vintage that hath been Cool d a long age in the deep delved earth Tasting of Flora and the country green Dance and Proven al song and sunburnt mirth O for a beaker full of the warm South Full of the true the blushful Hippocrene With beaded bubbles winking at the brim And purple stained mouth That I might drink and leave the world unseen And with thee fade away into the forest dim John Keats
