What s with this growing movement among you all to use gender neutral pronouns Some of you truly believe that this will make everyone transgender and what you like to refer as cisgender alike feel more comfortable in the world It s important to be careful not to normalize their usage too much Doing so may lead individuals who still identify with the traditional male or female genders to become insecure about their identity It s unfair to have your entire existence focused on your gender Instead of focusing solely on your gender identification there are other areas where you can simply enjoy life Most important there are worse issues in the world to worry about I don t care what people do with their life but don t impose this bizarre practice on those who don t want to use it
