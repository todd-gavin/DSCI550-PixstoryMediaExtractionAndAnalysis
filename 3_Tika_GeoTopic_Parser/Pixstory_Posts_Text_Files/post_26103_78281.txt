Were you also in love when you met Geet for the first time while watching the classic Jab We Met She was indeed a much loved character and was an inspiration for all of us Sikhni hoon mai Bhatinda ki that Sikhni Swag that made the opening scene The power in her speech and the confidence definitely made all of us her huge fan She was indeed a unique soul had a charming personality Tumhe uthakar museum mein rakhna chahiye ticket lagni chahiye tumhe dekhne ke liye At times I wish I could be just like her going with the flow The best part was her craze for shaadi Bachpan se hi naa mujhe shaadi karne ka bahut craze hai by god Leaving aside all the backbiting and not caring about the society she just followed and did what she really felt like doing which was loved by all of us Her statements like Aisa lag raha tha jaise kuch galat ho raha ho jaise koi train chhoot rahi ho Actually seemed real like we were actually facing that situation She had this thing ek hi life hain jo karna hain karlo you shouldn t have any regrets Helping Aditya come out of his depression and teaching him what life actually is about it s not an easy task but for her it was like a cakewalk And yeah how can one forget about the different kind of romance between Aditya and Geet Her craze for living in the moment and grabbing every opportunity coming her way was indeed commendable GEET a name that brings a smile on everyone s face will remain in our hearts forever this classic can never get old and will continue winning hearts my thoughts Aiman
