You must have heard of “Jack of all trades, Master of none…”, that is precisely me. Fun fact, this quote doesn’t end there as you must have originally heard, it is in fact, “Jack of all trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one.” 😉
I’m Keya and I like to describe myself as an optimistic, open-minded, and adventurous person. As a true believer in learning from experience, I like to view every experience as an opportunity for growth. I love interacting with diverse people and getting new and refreshing perspectives on various topics. Being inquisitive, I like picking up different hobbies (…and sometimes leave halfway…). Generally, I’m drawn toward learning new languages, painting (beginner), learning musical instruments, nature photography, etc.
