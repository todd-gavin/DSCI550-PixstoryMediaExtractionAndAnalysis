The inscription as well as the ruins, are generally believed to belong to the fourth century. Prof Banerji took the year 30 to refer to the Harsha era commencing from 606 AD, and assigned the epigraph to 636 AD, which was also included as the date in the original Gazetteers of Shahabad in 1906 and 1924. Dr. Banerji’s view was however not shared by others. Mr N G Mazumdar studied the palaeographic peculiarities of the inscription and referred to the year 30 to the Gupta era 318-19 AD, and held the date of the inscription to 348-49 AD. Dr D R Bhandarkar also considered the inscription to be much earlier than the fourth century AD.

According to some scholars, the inscription which has a reference to Udaysena,is associated with a satrap of Pataliputra in "shak samvat" year 30 whom the Kushanas had made the ruler. Shak Samvat year 30 when juxtaposed with the Christian calendar coincides with 108 AD by that account. Further, the script also corresponds to the Shaka times, and prior to the Gupta age.

Buchanan also knew of an inscription on a loose stone at some distance from the temple referring to the name Mundeshwara; but it is not clear whether he is referring to the same inscription as reffered by Bloch. This is a point which is to be verified by the drawing of his inscription taken by Buchanan.
