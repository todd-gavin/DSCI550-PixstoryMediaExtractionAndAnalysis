Change in food patterns has played an important role in making children overweight and obese as observed in the recent years. It has become a matter of concern since one in five children studying in schools of Delhi, have been reported obese or overweight.These overweight and obese children have 70% risk of becoming Overweight/ Obese Adults.
Obesity and Diabetes are becoming synonymous and this is known as 'Diabesity'.
Delhi Diabetes Research Centre (DDRC) , Dr Ashok Kumar Jhingan (Senior director BLK Max) and his team , Conducted a study to observe the Effect of Food habits  on children in 8 schools in Delhi. 
In this study 1155 children studying in Class 3rd, 4th and 5th were included and a regular follow up was done. A questionnaire was prepared to know about food habits, choice and change in food habits. 
The analysis of data tha eyed during the survey revealed some disturbing facts about eating patterns and preferences for fast foods. It was observed - 39% of children preferred fast foods like burgers, pizzas, french fries as compared to 11% who liked eating fruits and 44% of the children drink one soft drink per day. 
Class 3rd children - only 11 % preferred fast  food 
Class 4th children -the percentage remarkably increased to 39% preference for fast food.
Class 5th children - alarming observation was that in Class 5th the percentage rose to 66% in these children for preference to fast food.
