Paris Saint Germain were knocked out of the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid The second half collapse at the Santiago Bernabeu resulted in an early exit for the Parisians The PSG fans have turned on their team following the Champions League exit Both Neymar and Lionel Messi were heavily booed in the Ligue game against Bordeaux The Argentine has had a torrid time at PSG scoring just goals in appearances Even though Paris Saint Germain managed to beat Bordeaux the result did not change the mood of the fans The PSG dream team have lost out of the Super Cup Coupe de France and now the Champions League this season The Parisians were being considered the favourites in the Champions League courtesy of their summer signings But their front three have not gelled and have been heavily criticised for being lazy and not pressuring the opponent Will the Argentine return to Barcelona As per Marca Lionel Messi s father and agent Jorge Messi has contacted Joan Laporta The Senior Messi reportedly enquired the Barcelona President about a possibility to return to Spain Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez had also reportedly talked to Lionel Messi after PSG s loss to Real Madrid last week The Spaniard reportedly did this to send a message of encouragement to the PSG player Even though Lionel Messi has not had the best of seasons It is unlikely that Paris Saint Germain will let him leave Messi signed a two year contract with the Parisians hence the chances of him leaving are quite low Kylian Mbappe is likely to be leaving PSG in the summer Hence the Ligue club would not want to deplete their forward line completely To add to this PSG didn t let Mbappe and Neymar leave in previous seasons even though they clearly wanted to Owing to this we can expect Lionel Messi to stay in Paris at least one more season
