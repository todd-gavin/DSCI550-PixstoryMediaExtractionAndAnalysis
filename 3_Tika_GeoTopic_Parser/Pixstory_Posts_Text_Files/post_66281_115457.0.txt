Darjeeling is a town and municipality in the Eastern Himalayas in India, lying at an average elevation of 2,045 meters (6,709 ft) in the northernmost region of the state of West Bengal. It is best known for its scenic vistas, a signature tea and a late 19th-century mountain railway. Geologically, Darjeeling's landscape shows a record of active faults and tectonic uplift. Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, rises in the north at a distance of 74.4 kilometers (46.2 mi), and is prominently visible on clear days. The Teesta river, which flows through the Darjeeling region, has high surface runoff and landslides can occur during the monsoon. Administratively, Darjeeling is the headquarters of the Darjeeling district, a semi-autonomous region administered by the Gorkhaland Territorial administration.
