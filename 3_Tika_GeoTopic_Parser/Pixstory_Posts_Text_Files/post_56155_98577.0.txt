‌People in Britain had done their part now the result will decide local authorised across the country.  Polling stations open at 7 am and will be open till 10 pm. Results are crucial for the future of the PM as he wrestles with the fallout from the party scandal.
‌
‌Opinion polls indicate that the conservatives will lose hundreds of seats in the election. If so it will be an indication of the effect of the scandals. 
‌
‌In Northern Ireland, voters are electing a new 90-seat Assembly, with polls suggesting the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein could win the largest number of seats, and the post of the first minister, in what would be a historic first. Moreover, the Porn Scandal in parliament has already broken the image of the conservatives. 
‌
‌Another problem that the voters would consider will be that across the UK, the elections are dominated by increasing prices for food and fuel and rising household bills.
‌
‌Even though Johnson apologised for breaking the rules I don't think people have forgotten about it. He was the first prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law in office. He was fined £50 by police for attending his surprise birthday party in June 2020 when lockdown rules barred social gatherings.

He faces the possibility of more fines from other parties – police are investigating a dozen gatherings – and a parliamentary investigation into whether he deceived lawmakers about his behaviour.

The prime minister also faces discontent within his party. A bad result for the governing party on Thursday could lead Conservatives to try to replace Johnson with a leader with a better image.
