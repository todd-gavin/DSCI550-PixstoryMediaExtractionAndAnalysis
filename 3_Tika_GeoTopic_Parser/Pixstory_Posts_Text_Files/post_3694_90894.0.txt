Increased number of matches and inflation-based ad rate hike may double the cost of sponsorships in the upcoming seasons of the League. BestMediaInfo.com asks marketers what they want to tell the broadcaster who wins the rights

BCCI has floated the tender for IPL media rights for five seasons from 2023 to 2027. This year, with the league adding two new teams, IPL is already a 74-match tournament in 2022 in comparison to last year’s 60 matches. The number will gradually increase to 84 matches in 2024 and 2025, and will further increase to 94 matches in 2026 and 2027.

The increased number of matches is set to bring in revenues to the tune of Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 crore. And all this will make IPL unaffordable for many brands for picking sponsorships.

In effect, a brand that was paying Rs 150 crore for Co-presenting sponsor title on TV for 60 matches until last year, is now paying in the excess of Rs 200 crore for 180 seconds FCT per match. The brands were given an option to pick co-sponsorship with 150 seconds FCT per match that costs them Rs 160 crore.

Given the 10-15% inflation linked ad rate hike every year and number of matches going up by around 50%, a brand may have to shell out around Rs 400 crore for the co-sponsorship title.

Whichever broadcaster wins the IPL media rights this time will have to pay at least double of what Star India paid in the previous bidding. This also means that the broadcaster will ensure doubling of revenues by the end of five years.

Would brands be able to afford such rise in sponsorship cost?

Piyush Nangru, Co-Founder, Sunstone Eduversity, (one of the associate sponsors of Lucknow Super Giants), said, “While ad rates keep increasing, brands can always find smarter ways to deploy their monies around this property and ensure the brand gets impactful visibility like at no other time of the year.”
