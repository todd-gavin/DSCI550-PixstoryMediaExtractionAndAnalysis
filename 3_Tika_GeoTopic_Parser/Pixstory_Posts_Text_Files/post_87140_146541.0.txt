8 Gary Cahill
Chelsea's greatest ever defender, he worked well with John Terry to build a strong defense for the club. He was at Chelsea for 7 years and teamed well with John Terry. An undisputed Chelsea king who left a legacy.
He won every domestic championship with the Blues and led the club to the Champions League final. When Terry left, he became captain and inspired the club to many memorable games before leaving for Crystal Palace. He made 290 appearances for Chelsea.
7 Thiago Silva
Many questioned Silva's age when he joined on a free transfer at the age of 35, but he had a significant impact on the Premier League and provided stability at the back under Tuchel. He did something that impressed fans in every game, and he was compared to John Terry.
His performance demonstrated that a young defender has been at the heart of Chelsea's defense and Silva made it look easy; despite being 37 years old, he is still the club's most important defender. Although the Brazilian CB has only made 89 appearances, his outstanding performance in the Club FIFA World Cup earned him the Golden Ball award as the tournament's best player.
6 Antony Rudiger
Rudiger, who was brought in for an initial fee of Â£29 million during Conte's tenure, had a difficult start to his Premier League career and appeared to be a liability for the club as he failed to perform well and was benched for the majority of his playing time. His move to another club appeared to be imminent, but the arrival of Tuchel reinvigorated his career, he transformed into an aggressive defender and became a pivotal player.
Real Madrid has now signed the 29-year-old. He appeared in 202 games for Chelsea, not to mention his outstanding performance in the Champions League final.
