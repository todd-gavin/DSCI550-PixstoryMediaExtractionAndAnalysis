PV Sindhu requires no introduction to Indian sports enthusiasts. Pusarla Venkata Sindhu is the most successful Indian to compete in the World Championships, with gold, two silvers, and two bronze medals to her name. Add her two Olympic medals to the list, and she is probably one of India's top athletes. The Commonwealth Games in Birmingham start in a day’s time so let us take a look at the 5 games which has defined her career. 

2016 Rio Olympics Quarterfinals vs Wang Yihan
Saina Nehwal suffered a dismal first-round exit at Rio 2016 due to an injury, and the news from the rest of the Indian Olympic contingent was also not encouraging. Against this backdrop, Sindhu delivered one of the most inspirational performances of her career. Wang Yihan, a silver medalist at the London Olympics in 2012, was her opponent. The best Chinese shuttler had no response to the tall Indian's smashes. Sindhu won the challenging match in straight games, 22-20, 21-19, cementing her image as China's nemesis and establishing herself as a household figure in India. She went on to win her semi-final clash as well and confirmed at least a silver medal for India. Sindhu reached the finals without dropping a single game.

After the final Sindhu acknowledged that it was Marin’s day, “I really fought very hard and gave my heart out. When I came to the final, I told myself just one match to go and I could win a gold medal. Give it your best, and I tried very hard. I feel it was her day.”

2016 Rio Olympics Finals vs Carolina Marin 

Although Sindhu had reached the finals without dropping a single game, the final was not going to be an easy one against the then-world champion. The Indian shuttler won the first game but Marin bounced back to win the next two games to take the gold. Using her big-match expertise and solid all-around performance, the Spaniard was able to neutralise Sindhu’s game. Sindhu lost the game by 21-19, 12-21, and 15-21. But she showed the world that she was here to stay.
