Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, an Olympic champion, began his Diamond League season with a tremendous throw of 89.94 metres on Thursday in Stockholm. 

The 24-year-old Chopra's throw beat his own national record of 89.30, which he had established earlier this month at the Paavo Nurmi Games in Turku.

In recent media interviews, Chopra had stated that he would not put himself under pressure to throw farther than 90 metres and would instead work to progressively improve before peaking at the World Championships in Eugene, USA, from July 15â€“24.
