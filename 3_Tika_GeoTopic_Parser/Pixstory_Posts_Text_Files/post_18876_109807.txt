Difficult renewal for Koulibaly with Napoli Supply and demand are distant the club has offered the year-old Senegalese defender a contract worth millions of euros a year with bonuses he wants a base of millions of euros Neither side wants to give in to the other and so it always seems it is more probable that after eight years the paths will be divided On the other hand, Koulibaly&#39;s contract expires in June and in six months he could already sign with any team and then move in July on a free transfer De Laurentiis also seems willing to negotiate his transfer but without make discounts They ask for millions of euros and there seem to be both foreign teams and Juventus in Italy on goal Chelsea and Barcelona are looking for an experienced defender and Koulibaly would be ideal for both teams The black and whites still have to untie the De Ligt knot and if should he perhaps leave for Chelsea, the Napoli defender would be the number one objective
