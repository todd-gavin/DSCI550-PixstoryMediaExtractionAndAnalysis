Dharmesh Parmar,the famous rapper popularly known as MC Tod Fod died at age 24. 
Gully boy was inspired from lives of different street rappers who had the potential to rap but was not supported that much.
MC TodFod was the  rapper of  song "India 91".

My deepest sympathies towards him and his family.
