Arsenal could not have asked for a better start to their Premier League campaign. Barring a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Manchester United, the Gunners have hardly put a foot wrong. Mikel Arteta's men are currently placed second in the league with 21 points from eight games.
In fact, a victory over rivals Liverpool on Sunday could propel them back to the top  spot. Liverpool have had a tricky start to the season, and it is not often that Arsenal come in as favorites for this fixture.
Given their strong start to the season, Arsenal have been considered as one of the favorites to win the league title. Former manager Arsene Wenger believes that the Gunners could win the title this season. Mikel Arteta was certainly delighted with the comments made by the veteran, but believes that his players have to show their potential on the pitch.
'Well, it's great obviously that the people who love the club so much and know the club very well, have such an opinion about it. Now, unfortunately, we have to show it, but you have to do it on the pitch. And hopefully, he's right. He's been right on many occasions," said Arteta.
Despite Liverpool's recent struggles, Mikel Arteta remains cautious of the threat that Jurgen Klopp's men hold. He believes that the Reds have been up there with the best for the past five years, but stated that he is not in a position to judge them.
"I'm not here to judge what Liverpool are. I'm here to talk about what we do. I think what they've done in the last five years doesn't need any presentation – it's clear. They've been up there in every single competition for the last five years, so credit to them," he added.
