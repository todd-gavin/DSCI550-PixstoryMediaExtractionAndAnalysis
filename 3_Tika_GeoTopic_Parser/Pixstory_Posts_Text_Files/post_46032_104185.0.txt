Margaret Yellowbird commutes to and from Minot as a teacher at White Shield High School. Her daughter attends Jim Hill Middle School, and her family recently relocated to Minot. 

When Yellowbird asked what clubs her daughter could be interested in, she discovered that she was interested in a Native American club. It's Jim Hill's first, and he's off to a great start with a group of about 40 kids. 

The Native American Club gathered on the front yard of Jim Hill Middle School on Friday morning to learn about the tepee's construction, structure, purpose, and breakdown. The Arikara tribe, or Sahnish, brought Thomas Plenty Chief from New Town to teach the club about the value of ceremonies, family, and Native culture.

Plenty Chief describes the ways and teachings of each tribe as being individual to each tribe. To the Arikara, “they say a tepee represents a woman facing the sun in prayer, that the tripod design of this tepee represents the base including the mind, body, and soul and each of the additional 14 poles act as the woman’s ribs, protecting her family, fire and life. Each of the pins, sealing the tepees’ opening represent the teachings of the home: honesty, integrity, perseverance.”

This is a good step towards increasing awareness in children about the culture of native Americans.
