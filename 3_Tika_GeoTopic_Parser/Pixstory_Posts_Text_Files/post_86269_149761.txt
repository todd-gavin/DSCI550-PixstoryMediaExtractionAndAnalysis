A couple of weeks ago I came across a beginners guide to Journaling and it has become one of my present hobbies and a stress releaser too So I would like to share some tips I came across that might be helpful for other beginners who are facing a problem in starting Try it out after reading Lets Learn Together JUST WRITE Even though it seems extremely easy I want to emphasise how difficult it is to make the first mark in a brand new notebook The first piece of advice is to simply begin It could even be your name It becomes much easier to continue once you get over the dread of making a mistake in your notebook STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS Set a timer or a page number goal and write whatever comes to your mind without censoring SUM UP YOUR DAY Often on busy days or when I lack energy to write much I write just a few words to sum up my day nbsp This could literally be just words or it could be short sentences or phrases to remember something Another way to do this is to write out a timeline of the day and try to remember what you were doing that day BE CREATIVE Sometimes there just aren t words nbsp The good thing is your journal doesn t need to be just words nbsp You can draw paint paste in pictures use stickers or really anything you d like nbsp You could take a pen and scribble on a bad day and just get your feelings out I find it rewarding to look back on prior journal pages and these can be lots of fun
