Afarwat Peak is one of the most gorgeous tourist destinations in the entire Gulmarg and Srinagar region, offering a scene that exudes utmost splendour and beauty. The location is incredibly high, at 4,200 metres above mean sea level, and lies within a few kilometres from Pakistan's Line of Control. Additionally, it receives a lot of precipitation, and for the majority of the year, it is completely covered in snow. The area is surrounded by snow-covered mountains and snow-covered meadows, making it the perfect honeymoon location. However, Afarwat's most well-known characteristic is that it serves as the location for the majority of Gulmarg's adventure sports activities. By ropeway, it takes 12 minutes to climb this spectacular peak, which provides adventure seekers with fantastic skiing, sledding, and snowboarding opportunities as well as breathtaking vistas. This well-known location in Gulmarg is where the renowned Ningle Nallah originates also from, and it is beautiful to behold.
