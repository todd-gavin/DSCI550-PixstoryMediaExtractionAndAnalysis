Scientists in Australia are testing printed solar panels with which they plan to power a Tesla electric car on a 15,100-km journey beginning in September.

According to a Reuters report, the Charge Around Australia project will power a Tesla electric car with 18 of the team's printed plastic solar panels, each 18 metres long. The panels will be rolled out beside the vehicle to soak up sunlight when the car needs a charge.

Printed solar is a lightweight, laminated PET plastic that can be made at a cost of less than $10 a square metre.
