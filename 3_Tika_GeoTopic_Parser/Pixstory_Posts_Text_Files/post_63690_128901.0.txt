Since its release, Spider Man Remastered has opened up with a slew of mods which lets players don the skins of various characters, such as Miles Morales, Kingpin, a black symbiote version of the webslinger’s Advanced Suit. 

But in the PC version of the gam, a very peculiar one has been added among the bunch of other existing mods which now allows players to swing their webs about in New York City as the legendary Marvel Comics writer Stan Lee. Now these are just skins, meaning that you can look like all of the mentioned characters but your voice and abilities will be that of the game’s original version of Peter Parker, but nonetheless, playing as Stan Lee in a Marvel game is awesome. 

To play as the late Marvel comics writer, players will need to download the mod created by tiffsomnniac in NexusMods. The mod replaces the Spider-Clan suit with Tuxedo Stan Lee. 

The Bagman Suit is now unmasked with Stan Lee’s head instead of Peter Parker. To unlock the Spider-Clan Suit, players need to complete all missions up to and including “Bring the Hammer Down” in the “Turf Wars” DLC. Bombastic Bag Man is a free suit that players will have access to. With this suit, players will get to see Stan Lee in a Fantastic Four outfit, thrashing criminals across the city streets of New York.
