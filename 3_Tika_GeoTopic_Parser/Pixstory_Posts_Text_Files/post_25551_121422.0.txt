Bill Russell, a dominating center who won a record 11 NBA crowns as cornerstone of a Boston Celtics dynasty, overcame racism to become the league's first Black superstar and civil rights activist.


Russell, who died Sunday at age 88, was a five-time NBA Most Valuable Player and captain of the 1956 US gold medal team at the Melbourne Olympics who revolutionized defensive play in the NBA, taking rebounding and shot blocking to epic new levels.

He won eight consecutive NBA titles from 1959-1966. As a player-coach in his final three seasons, Russell was the first Black coach in North American sport and the first to win a title, doing so in 1968 and again in his 1969 farewell campaign.

USF was the first major college team to start three Black players. They team coped with racist jeers at games and the refusal of hotels to accept Black guests -- which prompted the entire squad to stay in vacant college rooms.

"I never permitted myself to be a victim," Russell said.

Russell was snubbed for a regional top player honor after a 1955 US title run and turned his focus to team achievements over personal ones.

"That let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career, I would die a bitter old man," Russell said.

Russell delayed his NBA debut to play in the 1956 Olympics, leading an overpowering American squad with 14.1 points a game, then sparking the Celtics with an NBA-best 19.6 rebounds a game plus 4.7 points a contest for Boston's 1956-57 NBA champions.
