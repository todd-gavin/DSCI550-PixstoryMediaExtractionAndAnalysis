Wildlife photographers take a lot of pain to capture rare and stunning shots. They have to spend days - sometimes weeks - in deep forests or barren lands to get the perfect pose of an animal. Sascha Fonseca, a wildlife photographer, managed to capture one such shot of one of the most elusive animals - the snow leopard - and that is now going viral. It shows the big cat growling at the camera.

Mr Fonseca shared the amazing shot on his Instagram account, which he took in the mountains of Ladakh.

The snow leopard uses its white and grey coat as a natural camouflage to fit into its snowy environment. 

It is sometimes referred to as the ghost of the mountains.

Capturing this elusive animal's shot in the wild is a challenge but Fonseca managed to capture his images with the use of a motion-triggered DSLR camera trap

Note: In India, snow leopards are mostly found in the high-altitude, mountainous terrains of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.
