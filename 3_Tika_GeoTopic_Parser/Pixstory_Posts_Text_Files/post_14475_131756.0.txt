Women in England and Wales will be able to permanently access early medical abortions at home from 30 August.

New legislation will allow women to access pills for early medical abortion via a teleconsultation, and for both pills to be taken at home for gestation of up to 9 weeks and 6 days.

The update comes as all independent sector abortion clinics in England have been reapproved ensuring abortion services continue to be available to women across the country. All current approvals are valid until 31 July 2026.

Minister for Public Health, Maggie Throup, said:

The wellbeing and safety of women requiring access to abortion services is paramount.

With these measures women will have more choice in how and where they access abortion services, while ensuring robust data is collected to ensure their continued safety.
