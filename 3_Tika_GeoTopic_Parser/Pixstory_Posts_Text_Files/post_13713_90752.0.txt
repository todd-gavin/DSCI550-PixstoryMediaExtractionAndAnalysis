Loving animals and keeping some of them in human habitation has a scientific reason and has been one of the factors in human evolution.
"The popularity of new pets that are made and paid for by their owners, such as dogs, cats and Rabbit, seems to be nothing more than a new fashion. But the interest in pets is part of the progress of human civilization.

In Britain, about half of the country's families own more than 1 million Rabbit in their homes. The same number of cats and dogs are kept in pets. Keeping pets is expensive. Surprisingly, during the 2008 economic crisis in Britain, the cost of buying and keeping pets in the country did not change even slightly. "Sociologists attribute this to the fact that for pet owners, they are not a decorative device but a part of their lives and families."

"Genetic experiments on pets today say that they separated from their wild ancestors, who lived in forested areas, about 15,000 years ago and joined the first human-formed families at the beginning of human agriculture.
The birth and life of domestic animals among early human societies in ancient times have gradually been intertwined with human temperament and even influenced human genes, which today manifest themselves in the form of interest in animals and the preservation of their domesticated species. Gives."
