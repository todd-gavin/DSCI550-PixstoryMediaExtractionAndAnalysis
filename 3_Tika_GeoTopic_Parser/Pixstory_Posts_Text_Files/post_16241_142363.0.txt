The marketing and PR team of 'Brahmastra' has likely led you to believe that the movie is an out-and-out success. But film economics and the truth is more complicated than that. As mentioned above, the film's reported budget is Rs 410 crore or $51.7 million. This is just the production budget. Studios spend a lot of money on marketing and promoting the movie with trailers, advertisement campaigns, and so on. And behind 'Brahmastra' was Walt Disney Studios through its Indian subsidiary Star Studios. We do not know how much money was spent to make sure more and more people booked the tickets to the movie, but it was likely not inconsiderable.the film's Hindi iteration has grossed Rs 143 crore or $18 million until now as per reports. This figure does not count all the other language versions, only Hindi. Taking a cue from the big Telugu and Kannada releases, 'Brahmastra' was also targetted at moviegoers down south with dubbed release in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam.As per Dharma, the film opened with Rs 75 crore worldwide or $9.4 million on the very first day. Many suggested the figure was suspiciously 'proper' to be true. And indeed, studios and distributors have a history of sharing inflate figures to send a subliminal 'everyone else has seen the movie, and you're missing out!' message to potential viewers. But whatever the true figures, the film will almost certainly not break even with its budget . However, box office returns are not the end of the road for movies' earnings. Once the film is out of theatres, it gets an OTT release on services like Netflix, Prime Video, or ZEE5. In addition to that, there are satellite rights and music rights through which producers can recover their money. Or the star of the film may let go of their fees to recoup the losses. Recently, it was reported that Aamir Khan let go of his fees of Rs 100 crore or $12.63 million to compensate for the flop that was 'Laal Singh Chaddha'.
