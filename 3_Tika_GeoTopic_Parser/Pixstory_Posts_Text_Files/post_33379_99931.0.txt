When Buchanan visited the site on the 1st December of 1812, he found on the mound (i) the main temple in its centre, (ii) a very small Siva temple in its south west corner, with only parts of its walls standing and (iii) “three or four lingas, one of which is adorned with four heads”.  He mentions “I went rather more than 12 miles east to Deo to see the abovementioned ruin which has been a small mandir with a nath mandir, both built of brick and placed on an elevated terrace of no great size, also constructed of brick. The terrace, partly by decay partly by the fall of the buildings, has become a shapeless heap, on the surface of which, are 3 or 4 Shiva Lingas, one adorned with 4 heads. On the south west corner is a very small temple of Siva still containing the image, but only part of the walls remain. The chief temple was in the centre. The walls of the Nat mandir remain in part, but the roof is gone. In it is a stone leaning against the wall which contains an inscription very rudely cut and much worn, but most of the characters are still distinct enough. All the upper part of the shrine has fallen and the arch has given way, but the bricks and plaster still exclude the rain.”

Buchanan noticed images of Ganesh and Gadadhar and Surya near the main pedestal from which the main image had been removed. The lintel lying in the Nat mandir was having a seated female figure. About 100 yards north, or rather north-west, of the above group of temples, on the margin of the village mound, Buchanan had noticed “another small and more entire building of brick, which contains an immense linga, with a human face carved on one side of the phallus.
