Sun hat
Nothing says languorous poolside glamour like a billowy sunhat. The full-circle brim provides instant shade while elevating the elegance factor—be it with a one-piece swimsuit, a maxi dress, or short shorts and a tank.

Panama hat
Fun fact: Panama hails from Ecuador. This breezy, wide-brimmed number synonymous with Bond villains is perfect for hot, humid temps and beachside locales. 

Boater
A preppier take on the sun hat, this variation usually has a slightly more compact brim and works well for dressier occasions like garden cocktail parties. 

Visor
This is your go-to when you want to show off your killer ponytail, top knot, chignon, or braid while also protecting yourself from the sun.

Beret
Long a favourite among painters, poets, beatniks, and otherwise bohemian folk—oh, and '90s Michael Jordan—the beret is also beloved by the fashion world for its effortless sophistication. 

Beanie
Whether your vibe skews closer to après-ski or Brooklyn hipster, beanies are the secret to mixing up your cold-weather wardrobe.

Bucket hat
For many of us, bucket hats might bring back vivid memories of the '90s, but they first hit the fashion scene during the Mod era of the 1960s.
