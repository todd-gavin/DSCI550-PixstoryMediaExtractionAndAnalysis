It was my first time I celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi with my office colleagues Lord Ganesha is known as the God of New Beginnings The festival is celebrated with much fervor across the country It is believed Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated to worship the rebirth of Lord Ganesha In Hindu tradition and rituals the start of anything good and positive is done via worshipping Lord Ganesha The term Shri Ganesh in the Hindu language denotes the beginning of something especially something beautiful and positive Ganesha is associated with prosperity and positivity Well according to mythology there are multiple stories behind the worship of Lord Ganesha first but one thing I can say doing Ganesh Aarti and celebrating this festival felt really positive happy and peaceful Maybe that s what it is believed bringing Bappa does to your home and in your lives Ganpati bappa Morya
