They are the participants in the expedition of the National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics OGS who left New Zealand on Sunday to reach Antarctica aboard the icebreaker Laura Bassi to study the evolution of the polar ice cap in response to climate change. whose researchers will study the continental margin area in front of the Cook and Ninnis glaciers along the coast of Wilkes Land west of the Ross Sea in Antarctica to analyze the dynamics of glacier evolution at both the million-year and last thousands and hundreds of years starting from the last glacial maximum The objective of COLLAPS is to study the influence and effects of oceanic warming on the stability of this polar area which is still mostly unexplored today but highly vulnerable to climate change explains Laura De Santis, OGS geophysicist and project coordinator, adding that observations show that the West Antarctic ice sheet is thinning due to warming oceans, but we still know too little about East Antarctica&#39;s speed of response to climate change. Current observations show that there are apparently stable eastern areas which are highly at risk considering the climate forecasts for the next few years The numerical models actually predict that the melting of the glaciers in this sector would cause a rise in the global sea level of about meters but the only way to ascertain these hypothesis of collecting the geological archives of the past Thanks to the use of scientific instruments installed on board the icebreaker Laura Bassi, it will be possible to carry out a detailed mapping of the seabed, acquire seismic reflection profiles and collect sediment cores in an area generally covered by polar ice whose very low resolution morphology can be guessed from polar ice whose very low resolution morphology can be guessed from satellite data
