In the four years since a US supreme court judgement paved the way for all 50 states to offer it, Americans have wagered more than $125 billion on sports through legal gambling venues. 

Two-thirds of the states in the US have legalised sports betting on the anniversary of a ruling in a case brought by New Jersey. 

The Guardian reported that In just four years, the gambling business has infiltrated millions of Americans' daily lives, from those who wager money on a specific event to those who watch TV broadcasts with odds computations to those who suffer from gambling addictions.

You don't have to be a gambler to be affected - or even a sports fan: Advertising is nearly impossible to avoid, especially on television and radio, but also in other forms of media. The Associated Press, for example, uses FanDuel as its official odds source. 

On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in a case that began ten years ago in New Jersey as the most unlikely of long shots: a challenge to a federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, that limited sports betting to only four states that met a 1991 deadline to legalise it.
