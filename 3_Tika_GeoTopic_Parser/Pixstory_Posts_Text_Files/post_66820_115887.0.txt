Roger Federer is what you would call in OP's own words a "legend of the game"

A man that has become synonymous with Tennis and is surely one of the last of the dying breed of athletes who are also an upstanding human being that you can look up to. 

Roger Federer has been a trailblazer and an icon of Tennis for the last 2 decades. And if it is finally the time for the curtain call on such a glorious career, I have only 2 words to say to Roger 

THANK YOU!! 

Federer is a 20 time grand slam champion who is often dubbed as the Greatest of all time
