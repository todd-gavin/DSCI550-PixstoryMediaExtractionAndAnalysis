The FIA has delayed the announcement on the cost cap compliance for the 2021 F1 season.
It was supposed to be given on October 5, but in a later statement on the FIA's official website, the announcement will now be made on October 10 - a day after the F1Japanese GP.
The statement published on FIA's website said:
"The FIA informs that the conclusion of the analysis of the 2021 financial submissions of the Formula 1 teams and the subsequent release of Certificates of Compliance to the Financial Regulations will not take place on Wednesday, 5 October."
It continued:
"The analysis of financial submissions is a long and complex process that is ongoing and will be concluded to enable the release of the Certificates on Monday, 10 October. The Financial Regulations were agreed unanimously by all Competitors, who have worked positively and collaboratively with the FIA Cost Cap Administration throughout this first year under the Financial Regulations."
