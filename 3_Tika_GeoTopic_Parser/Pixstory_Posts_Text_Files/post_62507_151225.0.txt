Ticks! Who even likes those suckers?
If your dog catches ticks, it's probably one of the most frustrating things you'll have. And it's definitely not something harmless, neither for your dog nor for you. Right. Nor for you. Ticks can infect humans too.
The same illnesses that have already been discussed in dogs, such Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease, can also be extremely dangerous in people. If any symptoms appear, especially if the tick was attached for more than 24 hours, seek immediate medical treatment.
It's important to keep your dog clean of any ticks, and if they get it, remove it manually. Take your dog to a vet and they'd provide some anti-parasitic meds.
