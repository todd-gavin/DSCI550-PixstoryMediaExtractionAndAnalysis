Manchester United’s under-23 coach Neil Wood is the shock choice for the Salford City
job.

The League 2 outfit’s class of 92 owners see Neil Wood as the solution to their problem
after failing to land Michael Appleton.

It means Neville is searching for his fourth manager after Gary Bowyer failed to secure
promotion to League One.

The Sun reports, that Neil Wood has been lined up for the possible replacement of Gary
Bowyer after Salford missed out on former Portsmouth, Oxford and Lincoln boss
Michael Appleton.

Mark Wood has been working at Manchester United for the past three years after
spending most of his playing career there as a squad understudy. The former midfielder
has cut his teeth with the youngsters at Old Trafford and will now move upto a senior
level.

The links between Salford City and Gary Neville, Nick Butt and Paul Scholes and their
old club are strong and this could help sign players from United.

Gary Bowyer was sacked after over a season in charge but was replaced after failing to
deliver promotion.

Salford City finished tenth, seven points off the play-offs places.

A statement on the club’s official website said, “Salford City Football announces the
departure of First Team Manager Gary Bower from the Peninsula Stadium.

“A meeting was held earlier today and the club has decided to terminate Gary Bowyer’s contract along with Assistant Manager Billy Barr.

“The club would like to thank Gary and Billy for their hard work over the last season and
we wish them all the very best for their future roles within football.”

“An announcement regarding the role of the first team manager will be made in due course.”

Appleton was sounded out but did not commit.
