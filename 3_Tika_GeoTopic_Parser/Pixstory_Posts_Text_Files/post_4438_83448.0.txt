📍Russian President Vladimir Putin declared today that Russia will launch a military campaign in Ukraine to defend separatists in the Donbas region in the country's east. He made a surprise speech on television shortly before 6 a.m., saying, "I have made the choice of a military action." Weeks of frantic diplomacy and the implementation of Western sanctions on Russia failed to deter Mr Putin, who had gathered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops near Ukraine's borders.

📍Russia also demanded that Ukrainian forces lay down their arms, claiming a "genocide" in Ukraine's east as justification for the invasion. President Biden of the United States quickly threatened Russia with "consequences" and stated that the world would "hold Russia accountable" for its conduct. He predicted "catastrophic loss of life and human misery" as a result of Russia's action, while NATO's leader slammed Russia's "reckless and unprovoked strike" on Ukraine.

📍Russia also called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms, and justified the invasion by claiming a "genocide" in Ukraine's east.

📍The United States will present the United Nations Security Council with a resolution condemning Russia for its actions against Ukraine on Thursday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced Wednesday evening.
"The Council will need to act, and we will put a resolution on the table tomorrow," said Thomas-Greenfield, although an American official speaking anonymously later clarified that the vote, in which Russia holds a veto, will likely come on Friday.
