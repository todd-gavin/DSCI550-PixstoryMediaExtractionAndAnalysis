On Monday, Rayo Vallecano will play host to Elche CF in a La Liga match at Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas.
After losing to Athletic Bilbao in the La Liga by a score of 3-2, Rayo Vallecano is attempting to prevent a recurrence of their last game. The Rayo Vallecano team of Andoni Iraola has scored an unexpected 7 goals overall in the past 12 games, while also giving up 8 goals overall in the same number of games.
Elche CF will be attempting to get back on track this match week after losing quickly to Barcelona in their previous La Liga outing. Elche CF has scored only 2 goals in their previous 6 games, making it very clear that they have not been effective in front of goal. Elche CF had lost their previous five La Liga road games coming into this matchday.
The last league meeting between these teams occurred in La Liga Match Day 25 on February 18, 2022, with a result of Elche CF 2-1 Rayo Vallecano.
