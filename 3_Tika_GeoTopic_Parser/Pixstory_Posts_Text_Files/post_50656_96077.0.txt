The Catholic Bishops of Australia are urging voters to consider the problems at hand in light of their Christian faith as campaigning heats up ahead of Australia's federal election on May 21. 

Environmental concerns, improved palliative and elderly care, rising poverty, asylum seekers' and Aboriginal peoples' rights, religious freedom, and Catholic school choice are just a few of the issues raised by the Bishops. 
 
Vatican News reported that the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference, Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane, highlighted his worries in a statement released on Tuesday, just over a month before election day. 

The Bishops recall Pope Francis’ appeal for “a better kind of politics, one truly at the service of the common good.” He said, “Our Christian faith calls us to be a missionary people bearing witness to the love of Jesus Christ for humanity. Our beliefs are not a private spirituality, but are realised through love expressed in action.”

According to the Bishops, one aspect of being a Christian in a democratic society is to consider "the good they may do for their community by exercising their vote for the betterment of their community."

Extreme weather, the consequences of Covid-19, and the war in Ukraine have all highlighted the necessity to safeguard the political principles of peace, justice, and collaborative involvement in the years following the last election in 2019. 

The Bishops call for a "new social contract" that promotes the common good without leaving any person or social group behind as the country seeks economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic.
