Amr Zedan, a Saudi investor born in Los Angeles, is the latest person to make an offer to buy Chelsea, according to GOAL.

The 47-year-old is the chairman of Zedan Group, a Saudi Arabian company involved in the energy and petrochemical sectors, as well as a stake in horse racing through Zedan Racing Stables.

He, like other bidders, is thought to have sought additional funding after the deadline passed and is thought to have an outside chance of winning. This is true even when his ties to Jordan's royal family, as a result of his marriage to Princess Noor Bint Asem, are considered.

Chelsea's board of directors will ultimately decide who the new owners will be, but they will be advised by Raine Group, a New York investment bank initially appointed by sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich.

Raine Group is falling behind in their efforts to narrow the field of potential future owners down to a small group of "preferred bidders."

They are, however, attempting to complete a process that normally takes several months in less than a week, with additional checks on every aspect of any consortium to be performed in the following phase.

The Blues had hoped to find a new owner by the end of March, but that appears to be impossible now, with the process expected to take longer.

It comes amid concerns that the ownership situation is causing a distraction for Chelsea's sports team, as well as cash flow issues.

The UK Government is involved in the process but will not impose its will on decision-making, aiming only to ensure that none of the proceeds from the Chelsea takeover process end up in the hands of owner Abramovich.

Chelsea has eight known options to work through as they finalise this phase of their new owner selection process.
