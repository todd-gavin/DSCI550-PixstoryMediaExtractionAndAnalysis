The world is on a sinusoidal circuit This is why sometimes we feel happy and sometimes we think we are the worst person on earth One day we love life with all our being and one day our hearts want to put a point in front of our lives We have experienced days in life when we felt like living and considered ourselves the happiest person in the world and we had days when we were constantly talking about how miserable we are and why this life does not end It is a natural fact that sorrow and joy go hand in hand Joys come so that sorrows do not overwhelm us and sorrows come so that joys do not become uniform for us Only by knowing the transience of these states of sorrow and joy can we console ourselves and in the words of the poet And as soon as that moment of joy has passed sorrow passes The sad thing is that sometimes the persistence of this grief in us or those around us becomes too much and the grief becomes a constant guest and we gradually get used to this process and make no effort to drive away this grief Have you ever wondered why most young people today despite the excitement they should have are constantly depressed withdrawn and complaining The economic issues of the country are important but sometimes I myself add to some depressed and depressed conditions Have you ever thought about the reasons that make me feel miserable all the time
