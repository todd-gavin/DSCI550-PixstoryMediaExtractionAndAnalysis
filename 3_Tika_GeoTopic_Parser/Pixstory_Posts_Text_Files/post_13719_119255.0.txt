The situation of women in this country is an alarm for all women in the world, Afghanistan is not the only country in the world where women's rights are neglected, but what is happening in this country is an alarm for all women. Because it shows how decades of progress for gender equality and women's rights can be wiped out in a matter of months.
 The fight for women's rights in Afghanistan is a global fight and a fight for women's rights everywhere, what everyone does or fails to do for women and girls in Afghanistan is the ultimate test of who we all are as a global community and for what. We are standing for something."
Even I and many women and girls in Afghanistan now feel that we are now invisible and the world has forgotten us.

 The shameful silence of the international community towards Afghan women will go down in history
 Closing girls' schools means tomorrow's disaster

  Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls are prohibited from going to school.
Girls' schools were supposed to reopen at the beginning of this year after being closed for months; However, the Taliban's Ministry of Education announced on the same day that girls' secondary and high schools will remain closed until further notice. It has been almost 310 days since the girls did not go to school.
Also, the Taliban have imposed restrictions on women's work and after the dominance of this group, women employees in government offices have stayed at home.
