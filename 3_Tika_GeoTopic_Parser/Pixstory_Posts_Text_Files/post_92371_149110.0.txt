Kendall Jenner isn't afraid to grin and bare it — especially when it comes to fashion. In a new interview with Vogue, the model and reality star is looking back at one of her more controversial looks: the sheer, nipple-baring sweater at the 2014 Marc Jacobs fashion show.❤️‍🔥🥰✨️
"This was my first high-fashion show, and it was for Marc Jacobs," she said during the publication's Life in Looks video series. "I actually could not believe I was there. I was pretty chill, even though my boobies were out."
