Once more, Nick Cannon is a father.
The rapper, 41, and model Bre Tiesi, 31, welcomed a son as their first child together on Monday, Tiesi wrote on Instagram. This is Tiesi and Cannon's eighth child, their first.

Tiesi posted a video on YouTube chronicling her "pregnancy, natural induction, labour, and delivery" along with a number of moving photographs from her "all natural, unmedicated home birth."

"I did it. a home delivery that was entirely unmedicated. The most humbling, limit-pushing, enlightening, and wholly liberating experience I've ever had. I'm extremely grateful to my team for delivering my kid safely "She wrote. I couldn't have hoped for a more fantastic and encouraging companion, and this experience has transformed me for the better.

She said, "Cannon." "For us, Daddy showed the f up. I couldn't have accomplished it without you. He is here, and I can't believe it."
