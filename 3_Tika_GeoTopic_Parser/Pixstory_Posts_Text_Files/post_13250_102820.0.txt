Try to change what is changeable and the things that in your hand, otherwise Whatever it’s just accept itttt and let it be whatever it’s, work hard as much as i can bcz i need yourself self, if i care, if I be sad nothing will be change. but,if I work hard, if I fight, if I struggle  will be happy by thinking that yes I’m a strong girl. After 20 years what I want to see a loser woman !?who couldn’t come out of depression cuz of the problems!? Or a strong woman who will say that yhhhhhhh i did it, i never gave up. I’m a solider! 
Now, I see, I suffer , i struggle , and i ACCEPT( cuz i know everything happens for a reason from our almighty Allah, who im to not accept what Allah want!?) , I’m working hard I’m trying even a single and small thing that i do for my future it makes me happy because at least im trying im not giving up, sometimes i become sad, tired, hopeless but i stand again because everything pass so don’t we pass it with hope!? With smile! It’s not impossible life is not easy but you can make it easy and not letting it make you weak. ☺️
We are Muslims, we blv that Allah see what we suffer how we suffer and how we put our tawakal to him! 
This feeling this blv make us more strong, I don’t say that yeahh im happy. No I’m not ok I’m not happy but I’m not that weak girl as i was before I feel better than before I accept what comes, what go and what’s going on i blv that my lord knows better than us and nothing will happen till it’s not for our goodness!
I proud of myself and anyone who is strong who is not giving up and who blv to lord’s plan!
🙂
