Built by the British, the building was made as a summer retreat for the Indian President. But it was passed on to the nation by Dr. S Radhakrishnan, the then President of India, as an institute to promote advanced studies in arts & humanities. The grand architectural beauty and the soothing surroundings make it one of the popular tourist attractions in Shimla. And the colonial building is perfect for some wonderful camera shots
