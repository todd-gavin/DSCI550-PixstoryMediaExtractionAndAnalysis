There s a big difference between entertainment and education Entertainment is designed to provide you with a good time while education is meant to help you learn something new and improve your skills There are a few reasons why fiction can actually be less effective than facts when it comes to education For one fiction often relies on stereotypes and generalizations which makes it difficult for students to understand complex issues Secondly fiction can be extremely misleading particularly when it comes to matters of morality and politics Finally while fiction can make learning fun and enjoyable it cannot always teach factual information in an accurate way In short you should not rely on fiction for information in your school curriculum instead use factual sources that are easy to understand and follow This will help students gain the understanding they need in a timely fashion without sacrificing accuracy or quality
