Pizza is the most popular fast food in the world. It's something we consume at home, at restaurants, even on street corners. In the United States alone, three billion pizzas are sold each year, with an average of 46 pieces per person. However, the history of migration, economics, and technological progress is revealed in the story of how the modest pizza grew to enjoy such global supremacy. 

Pizza has been consumed in some form or another for ages. Pieces of flatbread topped with savouries served as a simple and enjoyable supper for individuals who couldn't afford plates or were on the road as long back as antiquity.

However, the pizza as we know it today originated in late-eighteenth-century Naples. Naples had grown to be one of Europe's largest cities under the Bourbon kings, and it was developing quickly. 

As the city's economy struggled to keep up, an increasing proportion of residents sank into poverty. Because their ragged look resembled that of Lazarus, the most destitute of these were known as lazzaroni. They numbered roughly 50,000 people and subsisted on the meagre wages they received as porters, messengers, or casual labourers.

Always rushing about in search of work, they needed food that was cheap and easy to eat. Pizzas met this need. Sold not in shops, but by street vendors carrying huge boxes under their arms, they would be cut to meet the customerâ€™s budget or appetite.
