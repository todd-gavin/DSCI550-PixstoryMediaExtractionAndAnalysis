NASA's Resilience Researchers said Thursday that the Mars rover has gathered and stored samples of rocks made composed of minerals and chemical substances that, on Earth, would probably preserve remnants of previous microbial life. CBS reported that the soil samples were collected near the base of an old river delta that spread out from the lip of Jezero Crater. However, it won't be until a NASA-European Space Agency mission at the end of the decade that researchers will be able to gather any of these "possible biosignatures" and bring them back to Earth for in-depth laboratory examination."The samples that we've collected as we presented here today ... have ingredients for life in terms of the environmental setting," said David Shuster, a Perseverance return sample scientist at the University of California."If these conditions existed, I think, pretty much anywhere on Earth at any point in time over the last ... three and a half billion years, I think it's safe to say, or at least assume, that biology would have done its thing and left its mark in these rocks for us to observe."And so that's really why we're so excited to be able to address these questions upon returning these samples to laboratories here on Earth," Shuster said. "We have all of the right ingredients here."We are getting closer to discovering life on Mars!
