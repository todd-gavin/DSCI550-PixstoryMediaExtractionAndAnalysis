Carlo Ancelotti met the press today to discuss about Real Madrid's upcoming Laliga clash against arch-rivals Atletico Madrid. With Barcelona going top of the table from their winÂ  against Elche, pressure is piling up on Los Blancos for the Madrid Derby who will look to regain top spot. 
Unlike Barcelona and Real Madrid, Diego Simeone's side have build a pleasurable start but a win against their bitter rivals will surely pave the way for a potentially lustrous season. 
Ancelotti aired his thoughts about various points of discussion in the build-up of the Derby including team stability to the recent racial comments made on Spanish television directed towards Vincius Junior. 
The Italian manager kicked off the press conference by stating Karim Benzema's injury status, he said: "Benzema won't be there tomorrow but he has started working alone." Ancelotti has plans in an attempt to adequately replace the Frenchman tomorrow but he didn't reveal his intentions as he said: "I have an idea but I won't say it."
Real Madrid are yet to drop points from a game in all competitions since the start of the season so Ancelotti believes that the momentum he's team has set up will help them a lot in the Derby, he said: "We arrived well, on a good run, against a strong rival, it is a special match and that is how we prepare for it."
The next question which popped up during the conference was to aim the point of discussion towards the recent controversy surrounding Vinicius's dance moves but Ancelotti swiftly answered: " He's fine as usual, he wants to play and win this match. He and the club have issued a statement so now let's talk about football, and it should be noted that in Spain I don't see any racism."
