Wolves have officially announced the signing of Diego Costa on a free transfer until the endof the season.
The move came following the injury of summer signing Sasa Kalajdzic, who suffered an ACLinjury on his debut against Southampton last weekend.
Confirming the move, Wolves chairman Jeff Shi said:
“We are absolutely delighted to welcome Diego Costa to Wolves, and back to the PremierLeague. A serial winner with a wealth of experience at the highest level, Diego will bringsomething unique to our dressing room and on the pitch, and we look forward to his impactat Molineux and Compton this season.”
This will be Costa’s second life in the English Premier League as he has already represented Chelsea earlier. During his three-year stay at the Blues, he won two leaguetitles in three seasons. He went on to become a prolific scorer and one of the most fearedstrikers across Europe.
Good move or not?
Although the move is being welcomed by the fans, it’s not that simple as it looks. TheSpanish international has been without a club ever since leaving Serie A side AtleticoMineiro. On top of that, he has not featured in a professional game since December 2021.
This means he is not arriving in top-notch fitness and form. It would require him some time to regain his rhyme back. However, Wolves are not in a position to afford many mistakes,especially against the Giants sides in the upcoming fixtures.
It remains to be seen if he will be picked for Saturday’s (September 17) game against Manchester City at the Molineux Stadium. For now, Diego will bolster the attacking options
for manager Bruno Lage.
Moreover, an experienced Costa will give some competition to star performer Raul Jimenezand recovery time to Sasa Kaladjzic, who will require some time to get match-fit again.
