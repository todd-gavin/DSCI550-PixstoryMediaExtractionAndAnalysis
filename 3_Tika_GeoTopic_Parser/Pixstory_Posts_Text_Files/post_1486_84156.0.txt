NATO was founded by 12 nations in 1949 and today has 30 member states, including three former Soviet republics and 11 former Eastern Bloc nations.

At the end of the Cold War, NATO began expanding eastward. While then-Secretary of State Secretary of State James Baker told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in February 1990 that “there would be no extension of NATO’s jurisdiction for forces of NATO one inch to the east.”

Even though NATO was founded as a defense against the Soviet Union, the alliance did not undertake any military operations during the Cold War. Since 1990, NATO has engaged in two actions related to the first Gulf War, two related to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya.

In 2014, NATO members agreed to each spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. However, only one-third of its members currently meet that target: Greece (3.82%), the United States (3.52%), Croatia (2.79%), the United Kingdom (2.29%), Estonia (2.28%), Latvia (2.27%), Poland (2.1%), Lithuania (2.03%), Romania (2.02%), and France (2.01%).

NATO currently recognizes three nations — Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine — as under consideration for membership.

These countries partner with NATO in certain areas of mutual interest but are not party to the formal Article 5 defense pact. A nonbinding referendum on NATO membership in Georgia in 2008 passed with 77% in support, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned against it, stating that “NATO approaching our borders is a threat to Russia.” Similarly, polls show broad support for NATO membership in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but opposition in the pro-Russian Republika Srpska region, which makes up about one-third of the population.
