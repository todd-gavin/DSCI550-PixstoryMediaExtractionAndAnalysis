Throughout the day, amidst inconclusive proof of liabilities( something finance idk)a classic-impending-doom warning is brought about by the alpha-universe version of her husband, the only twist here is the antagonist- Jobu Tupaki, is a version of her daughter who has harnessed the ability to move her consciousness to navigate the ridiculous barrage of probabilities in the multiverse. In her search for meaning( all objective truth seems lost in this vastness) she puts everything on a black bagel with a white centre signifying a zero, a nothingness. Which might seem absurd, but works so well as a symbol( littered in the backgrounds of innumerable scenes). It also contrasts with the googly eyes (with their inverted colour scheme)- evoking the duality of yin and yang, which her husband has a tendency of sticking everywhere- foreshadowing his relentless optimism as the sort of solution to this feeling of impending doom. Absolutely visionary sequences follow ( and even set artists were actually paid instead of CGI effects put in by non-unionized, exploitable digital artists as Evelyn learns the same truths, the same process of multiversal jumping achieved by bizarre actions such as eating lip balm- and uneasiness from the reality that she is the worst version of herself in the universe. 

It is precisely this that allows her to gain this newfound ability, however and with this,  allows Jobu to reveal to her that she created the bagel only to annihilate the crushing pain of her own existence, in classic nihilist-passive-suicidality fashion. She confesses that she was hoping that her mother, despite all her faults, would offer a different perspective or at least companionship of sorts as they obliterated themselves( in an absolutely heart-wrenching, soul-draining scene- a first since Classof 2013, Mitski). And, thatâ€™s it, really . At its core, the movie is about this complicated, messy, impenetrable relationship that mothers and daughters come to weave - between cultures and times, between escaping each-other, between choosing the other over yourself, between an unconditional love and a strenuous understanding of the other.
