Sally Morgan is an Aboriginal author and artist descended from the Bailgu people who was born in Perth. My Place, her first novel, covers the narrative of her Indigenous family's past, as well as Australia's dark historical roots and the terrible treatment of Aboriginal Australians when white settlers arrived. 

In 1987, the work received a humanitarian prize from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Morgan also creates traditional Aboriginal landscape dot paintings, which can be found in private and public collections around the world. 

As per Goodreads, this autobiography My Place explores political and societal challenges within Australia's indigenous culture by looking at the perspectives and experiences of three generations of indigenous Australians. Sally Morgan set out to find out more about her family by visiting her grandmother's hometown.

She uncovers that she is not white but aborigine—information that was kept a secret because of the stigma of society. This moving account is a classic of Australian literature that finally frees the tongues of the author’s mother and grandmother, allowing them to tell their own stories.
