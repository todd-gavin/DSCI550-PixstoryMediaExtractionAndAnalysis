Many Milan fans raised eyebrows this morning while reading Donnarumma s interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport where he once again explained why he left Milan as a free agent in the summer Everyone is blaming me without thinking what happened on the other side the year old said The last call from Milan was to tell me that they had signed another goalkeeper That is how it ended This version of the story is quite new and sounds like an unnecessary justification for his decision to leave his boyhood club for nothing Yes Milan called to inform him about the signing of Mike Maignan but can you really blame Paolo Maldini Co The Rossoneri had been trying to extend Donnarumma s contract for several months failing to reach an agreement with his agent Mino Raiola who reportedly demanded huge commissions to extend with the Rossoneri Donnarumma omitted that part of the story partially blaming Milan for the end of his time at San Siro What was the club supposed to do Wait until PSG announced his signing Make an offer that they could not afford Of course the Rossoneri would want to keep the goalkeeper at San Siro or at least see him leave for a fair sum not for nothing The goalkeeper has taken a legitimate yet difficult decision opting to join one of the best clubs in Europe playing with some of the best footballers in the world It s an appropriate professional choice regardless of the money PSG put on the table Dollarumma has nothing to do in this case Gigio probably didn t pick PSG because of the money they offered but because he could take a step forward in his career Nobody can deny PSG are an upgrade compared to Milan although the Rossoneri are obtaining outstanding results under Stefano Pioli Donnarumma is one of Italy s brightest stars Perhaps he is the best football player in the country He had the right to go somewhere else chasing trophies and personal glory That s absolutely fine What s not ok is to point the finger at someone else for an entirely personal choice
