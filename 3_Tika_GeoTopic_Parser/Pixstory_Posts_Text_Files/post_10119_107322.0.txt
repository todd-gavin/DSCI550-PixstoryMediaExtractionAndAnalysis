Saw these beautiful people, some of which were playing with their own little world, some were attempting to make others laugh, and still others were attempting to sell the toys in order to generate money and feed their children. Everyone was occupied UN every nook and cranny. 

Children, in particular, were having a good time and laughing with their siblings and friends. 

It was interesting to watch how people spent their time with their loved ones.
