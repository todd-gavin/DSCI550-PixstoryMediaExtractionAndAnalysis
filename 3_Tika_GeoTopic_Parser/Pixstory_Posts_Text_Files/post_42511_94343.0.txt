In football, one thing that every footballer wants to avoid is injury and the second thing they want to avoid is to miss any match, either because of injury or his/her form.

There were/are/will be many players whose careers will get over because of two reasons that I mentioned above. There are two prime current players which played brilliant football but after the transfer to a new team they missed many games because of injury and bad form and those two players are Neymar Jr. and Eden Hazard.

But today I am here to talk about one footballer who didnâ€™t miss even one game for last six years and in six years, he played 224 games and the name of the player is Inaki Williams.

Inaki Williams plays for Athletic Club and in the last six years he successfully avoided injuries, he never got suspension because of his behavior and he remains in good form and because of that, the manager of the club never left him out from the squad list.

He is and will be the inspiration for upcoming footballers and he should tell the secret of his fitness and dedication on and off the pitch.
