Louis Tomlinson is one of my favourite artists. Louis' music is obviously one of the reasons I admire him. His music and albums are incredibly underappreciated, and I adore all of his tracks. The way he sings them and what they mean. I adore his distinct singing and speaking voice. He, like many other artists, is an amazing lyricist, but his lyrics particularly appeal to me. He always know how to express his feelings and how to write it beautiful for a song.

I think Louis is incredibly underrated too. All of his songs are incredible, but I think 'Two of Us' is my favourite because of the song's purpose and how honest and transparent the lyrics are. The song means a lot to him since it's very personal, and many fans can identify to it because they've gone through similar circumstances. Just Hold On, Miss You, and Walls are some of my other favourites.

His composition credits for One Direction too, where he has written a slew of incredible songs both with the band and on his own.
