Imagine if you came back from the gym and were told to repeat your leg day at home too instead of giving your muscles some much needed rest? Sounds bizarre doesn't it?

We understand how important it is to give your body some rest after a productive day, then why don't we get the same thing when it comes to the minds of kids? Why are they forced to keep them working without any rest? Rest is important. It's that simple. A human mind is made for a lot of things and forcing children to limiting it to only one is tyranny.

There's substantial research that tells how homework works against children, and not the other way round. Especially today. The homework is not productive. It just is, just exists for the sake of existing. It is just "memorize the table of twenty four", "write this 15 times" etc. That is only waste of time and energy. Homework should make kids learn, instead it just puts them in a position where they don't have time to learn.
