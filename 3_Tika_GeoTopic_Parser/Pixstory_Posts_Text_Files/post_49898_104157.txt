Any statistics do not support the claim that violent video games cause mass shootings or any other form of violence Millions of people play video games full of fights and shooting yet only a small fraction succumbs to violence Just because people some people become violent how can we restrict everyone from playing games Let s not forget about the video games culture we have wherein many people make money out of it through live streaming and they now have an audience When we consider the psychology of the attackers we might come across violent gaming as one of their hobbies It could also be loneliness addiction to violent aspects and many more Banning violent video games is not an option for that most of the youth play video games Finding that a teen who committed a violent crime also played a popular video game such as Call of Duty Halo or Grand Theft Auto is as foolish as pointing out that the criminal also wore jeans Even though US gun violence is high the nine other countries with the highest video game usage have some poor violent crime rates and eight of those countries spend more per capita on video games than the United States As sales of violent video games have significantly heightened violent juvenile crime rates have considerably decreased in many reports as these are stress busters to the youth Moreover the issue of supply and demand exists Teens need it so the companies provide them with these games
