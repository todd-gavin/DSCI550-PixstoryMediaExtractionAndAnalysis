The image of Kamala Harris in media is an unique one. She is portrayed as champion on women and especially black women. She is portrayed as the feminist we all need and a VP that will turn the tables. But is she really everything America dreamed of?

Lest we forget, failed to explain why she didn’t prosecute Steven Mnuchin’s bank. As reported by popular democracy, she vaguely acknowledged The Intercept’s report about her declining to prosecute Steven Mnuchin’s OneWest Bank for foreclosure violations in 2013, but offered no explanation.

“It’s a decision my office made,” she said, in response to questions from The Hill shortly after being sworn in as California’s newest U.S. senator.

“We went and we followed the facts and the evidence, and it’s a decision my office made,” Harris said. “We pursued it just like any other case. We go and we take a case wherever the facts lead us.”

Moreover, keep in mind that Mnuchin was Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Treasury Department, and served as CEO of OneWest from 2009 to 2015. 

The statement Harris made after this never explained how involved she was with the decision to not prosecute, or why the decision was made. She also did not say whether the revelations would disqualify Mnuchin for the position of treasury secretary. “The hearings will reveal if it’s disqualifying or not, but certainly he has a history that should be critically examined, as do all of the nominees,” Harris told The Hill.
