Inter sporting director Beppe Marotta always said he was positive for the renewal of Ivan Perisic&#39;s contract last night man of the match in the Italian Cup final against Juventus But when the interested party spoke to Mediaset microphones the question did not seem so obvious, on the contrary The renewal I don&#39;t know yet With the great players we don&#39;t talk at the last minute a dig thrown with the trophy still in hand and with a party to start All with the victory of the scudetto still in the running Perisic years at Inter since with whom he has played more than one match In a period on loan with Bayern Munich with whom he won the Champions League but from which he was not redeemed His return to Inter was positive but now the roads risk parting forever
