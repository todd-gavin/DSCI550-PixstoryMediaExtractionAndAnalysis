Qatar’s FIFA World Cup stadium precincts are delivering a tangible legacy for the country’s growing population.
Since the country won the bid to host the mega-event – which will kick off on November 20 – an integral part of legacy plans was to create vibrant community hubs around the stadiums.
Eng. Ghanim Al Kuwari, Deputy Director General, Technical Services, Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, said the project began with consultations with local communities.
“Our goal was to build venues that local communities would use,” said Al Kuwari. “Before we broke ground, we consulted communities to ensure their needs were implemented at the design phase. Every stadium has a distinct design and facilities that are unique to its community. And over the last few years – thanks to Al Bayt Park, Al Janoub Park and others – we are seeing these facilities being used. This is FIFA World Cup legacy in action before the big kick-off.”
Three stadium precincts in particular —Al Janoub, Al Bayt and Ahmad Bin Ali — have become major community hubs. On Qatar National Sport Day 2020, the SC opened public parks at Al Janoub and Al Bayt, illustrating the country’s legacy commitment to inspire health and fitness. 
Covering an area larger than 30 football pitches, Al Bayt Stadium Park boasts vast green spaces, children’s play areas, exercise stations and restaurants, plus tracks for cycling, running and horse and camel riding. For the VIVA Running Club, the facility offers the perfect backdrop for training.
“The facilities here are great for running because they offer tremendous space. To look over and see scenic green spaces and the gorgeous Al Bayt Stadium tower over us is a plus. It is a unique experience,” said club member Khalid Al Buhendi.
Al Bayt Stadium Park is also home to the Quodorat Centre, a community space for the preservation of cultural heritage, and Nomas, an educational youth centre led by the Ministry of Culture.
