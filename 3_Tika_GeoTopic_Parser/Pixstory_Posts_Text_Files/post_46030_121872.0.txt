American Indian students at UNC Pembroke enrolled in the undergraduate Sustainable Agricultural program may be eligible for a scholarship through the Native American Agriculture Fund.

The Native STEPS Agriculture Scholarship application deadline is April 15, 2023. It funds student expenses up to $4,500, which covers books, tuition, room and board and supplies for up to one year. 

The scholarship also includes an eight-week paid summer internship in which students will learn hands-on techniques with local agriculture professionals or at the UNCP Ag Demo Farm. Recipients will be required to attend agriculture and financial literacy workshops offered at the Thomas Entrepreneurship Hub and meet with program mentors.
