A woman in Michigan filed a $10,000 lawsuit against a potential suitor for skipping a date. A video of the woman getting into a heated dispute with the judge at a Zoom court hearing over her belief that he was insulting her intellect went viral. The lawsuit was not immediately dismissed, but rather dismissed and moved to a different court since the court in which the woman filed it was improper.

It is easy to find humor in these circumstances. After all, this is preposterous; a woman is suing a man for $10,000 for emotional distress after he stood her up on a date.  Yet, the man's feelings in the video reveal a different story; they reveal that he is being dragged through a system he has no control over by a person he hardly knows who is clearly determined to tarnish his good reputation. That is no laughing matter.

Reports indicate that this is not the first time this woman has done something like this.  Since 2000, she has filed at least a dozen lawsuits, including a $300 million claim against the Flint Police Department for assault and harassment and a lawsuit against AT&T, according to court documents. Those two cases were thrown out.
