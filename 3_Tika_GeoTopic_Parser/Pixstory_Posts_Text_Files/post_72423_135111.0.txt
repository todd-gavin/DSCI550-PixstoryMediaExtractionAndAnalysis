Shilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra have begun celebrations of the Ganesha Chaturthi festival by welcoming Lord Ganesha home. Shilpa and Raj, who bring an idol of Lord Ganesha home every year for the festival, were pictured by the paparazzi as they brought an idol home this year as well. 

Shilpa Shetty, who recently fractured her leg while filming for an upcoming project, could not join her husband as he went out to bring the idol home. However, she walked out with the help of a walker as the car carrying the idol arrived at their home. A video of this was shared by a paparazzo account on Instagram.
