This is the first time they are meeting in the Euro. In 1989, 1991 and 1993 European Championships, both represented their respective nations.

She received the best FIFA Women's coach award in 2017 and 2020 for this. 

Germany are coming into semi final and final after a short gap. The record winning team's previous semi final entry was in 2013, when they beat Norway in the final to clinch the title for the 8th time. 

If England can beat Germany, it will be a sweet revenge for thrashing in the final at Finland in 2009. In that Euro final, Germany beat England 6-2. Inka Grings scored 2 in the final to take her goal tally to 6 and take the golden boot. This time, Alex Popp is in terrific form for Germany, who scored twice in the semi final, from half chances. She has scored in all the matches in the tournament so far. Meanwhile, England play a team game, with attack as strength. Players like Ellen White, Beth Mead, Alessia Russo as spearheads. Alex Popp and Beth Mead are the top scorers of the championship with 6 goals each.
