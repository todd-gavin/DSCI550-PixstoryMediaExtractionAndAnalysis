New stills from Andrew Dominik's "Blonde," which stars Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe, have been made available by Netflix.

The film's international debut will take place in competition at the Venice Film Festival and is based on Joyce Carol Oates' best-selling book. In the movie, Marilyn Monroe's turbulent early years as Norma Jeane, as well as her ascent to fame and personal relationships, are reimagined. Bobby Cannavale, Adrien Brody, Julianne Nicholson, Xavier Samuel, and Evan Williams make up the supporting cast.

Some of the brand-new images, which were only revealed in Vanity Fair in France, include de Armas and Adrien Brody, who plays her husband Arthur Miller.
