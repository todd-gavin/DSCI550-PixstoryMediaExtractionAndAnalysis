A collage of three men hanging from the ceiling is being widely shared on social media platforms. As per the post, three students who had been preparing for competitive exams died by suicide after the Samajwadi Party (SP) did not come to power in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh.

[Viral text in Hindi: हताश प्रतियोगी छात्र. सबसे बड़ा झटका हम प्रतियोगी छात्रों को ही लगा है.. समाजवादी पार्टी ना आने से प्रयागराज में लगाई तीन भाइयों ने फांसी।]

This photo is massively viral on Facebook. 

Fact check
Alt News found that at least two out of the three images are old. Furthermore, Prayagraj police has denied these incidents took place after poll results were announced.

The details of this image were found on a news site named Sanjeevani Today. On November 24, 2020 a man going through a financial crisis died by suicide in Ramgarh. The man is identified as Randhir Kumar from Bokaro, son of Tara Mahato.

We did a reverse image search on the second image and found a link to an article that identified the person as Nayab Najir from Begumgang, Lucknow. The incident took place on February 25, 2019. The article is no longer accessible but can be read on Google cache and the image comes up on Google reverse search. Dainik Bhaskar had also reported on the suicide case three years ago.

We could not find any details of the third image. But we found a tweet by Prayagraj police on March 11 that stated no such cases of suicides have been reported in the past 24 hours. The results of UP elections were announced on March 10.

Thus, old images were shared with the false claim that three people died by suicide after SP lost UP polls.
