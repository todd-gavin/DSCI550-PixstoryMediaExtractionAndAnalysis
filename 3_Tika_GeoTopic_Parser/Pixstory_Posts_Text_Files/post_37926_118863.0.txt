Paulo Dybala recently moved to AS Roma on a free transfer after Juventus decided not to offer him a new contract. But as per Paul Pogba, he asked the Argentine to stay at Juve instead of making a move out of the club this summer.

Pogba was asked about his friend recently and he said, as quoted by Corriere Dello Sport: “I talked a lot with Paulo, I asked him why he wasn’t staying here to play a little longer. together, he replied that he had already gone away and that I had to call him first.”

But as stated earlier, Dybala leaving Juventus was not completely his decision. Following the signing of Vlahovic, the Argentine was no longer part of the Serie A giants' plans. Though Juventus earlier offered a contract to Dybala, they would later take the extension off the table, hence sowing the seeds for his departure this summer. 

Now at Roma, Dybala is already making shockwaves at the club. The Argentine's signing has been nothing short of spectacular for the Jose Mourinho-led club. Roma have reportedly sold more than 500,000 Dybala jersey's in the first 24 hours of its signing. Hence it has to be seen if Dybala can live up to the buzz that has been created at his new Serie A club.
