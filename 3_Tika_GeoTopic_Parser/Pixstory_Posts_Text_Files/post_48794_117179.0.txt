Every person has the right to a safe, supportive and inclusive environment and this is especially true in case of young LGBTQ+ kids. It is very important for children to develop empathy and respect for all people, irrespective of their identities and schools play a big part in inculcating knowledge among them. In addition to helping queer kids understand themselves better, helping them accept themselves, developing a welcoming environment, thus reducing alienation, it will also sensitize their cishet peers towards their classmates and reduce incidents of bullying, name calling and kids dropping out because of unsafe enviroments. It also helps children exploring themselves more, and not forcing themselves to stick to preset rules of gender expression and sexualities and ways they navigate the world. Having knowledge about sexualities and various identities also develops and helps children understand the need to be politically aware, keep up with the news and also sets the ground for proper and appropriate political prioroties revolving around the well being of fellow citizens and human rights.
