Satisfy your sweet tooth and boost your protein intake with this fruit soy smoothie. Soy (as well as tofu, which is made from soy) is a natural source of high quality protein and healthy fats, and there is some evidence that it may even reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

The best part? Soft tofu blends effortlessly and tastelessly into smoothies, increasing the creaminess factor.

➖Ingredients
▪️1 cup regular or nondairy milk
▪️5 oz. silken tofu
▪️1 banana
▪️2 cups fresh strawberries
▪️1 tsp. honey

Blend together until smooth. If you’re looking for a thicker consistency, add a few ice cubes before blending. If you’re trying to eat less sugar, omit the honey.
