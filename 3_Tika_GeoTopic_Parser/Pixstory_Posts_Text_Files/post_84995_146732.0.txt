For the 2022–23 season, Barcelona expects to earn 1.255 billion euros in revenue and 274 million euros in profit.
The Spanish squad has had considerable financial strain in recent years, but this summer's series of transactions gave them financial flexibility and allowed them to bolster the roster.Barcelona is currently valued at $5 billion. The club announced on Monday that its board of directors had authorized a 1.255 billion euro operating income budget for this season after the financial year ended with 1.017 billion euros.
Their anticipated income for the upcoming season has increased from last year's turnover of 1.017 billion and a surplus of 98 million due to these arrangements as well as the influx of fans who returned following low attendance the previous season. Barcelona suffered a loss of 481 million in the 2020–21 campaign, which they attributed to their inability to keep Lionel Messi on board after his contract expired, causing him to join Paris Saint–Germain as a free agent.
Barcelona was rescued from a spending deficit earlier this month when LaLiga increased the club's expenditure cap by 800 million euros. This was done after the Catalan team had sold off some of their assets to shore up their finances. Barcelona transferred 25% of their regional television rights to American investment group Sixth Street for the following 25 years in 2 deals totaling more than 500 million euros in order to offset losses and adhere to LaLiga's fiscal fair play requirements.
The club signed a long-term sponsorship agreement with streaming juggernaut Spotify in March, and also raised an incremental 200 million euros by selling a total of 49% of its shares in Barcelona Studios in two different transactions. This allowed Barcelona to sign Robert Lewandowski, Rapha, and Jules Kounde in the offseason for more than 150 million euros, while Andreas Christensen, Franck Kessie, Hector Bellerin, and Marcos Alonso all signed free transfers.
