What are you doing if you have not watched Firebite As Guardian puts it in the revisionist vampire series by Warwick Thornton and Brendan Fletcher bloodthirsty demons are dispatched to hell with boomerangs to the chest Prior to the arrival of head vamp The King Callan Mulvey Tyson Rob Collins and his adopted daughter Shanika Shantae Barnes Cowan patrol the borders of Opal City keeping this mob safe Death by boomerang is just one small example of how Firebite breathes new life into tired genre clich s through the lens of an Indigenous perspective This creates fascinating political allegories such as the one where vampires boarded the first fleet Similar to Firebite another project with parts filmed in and around Coober Pedy has a production style that is slightly reminiscent of the show s grimy junkyard setting Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
