Mohamed Salah is close to signing a new deal with Liverpool that will keep him at the club till the end of his career. 

A change of heart from the 29-year-old Egypt international has boosted Anfield's prospects of finally putting an end to the long-running dispute surrounding his new contract, giving Reds manager Jurgen Klopp a major boost.

Salah's owners were fearful that if he turned down new terms that would have paid him £400,000 per week, he would let his existing deal expire, leaving him a free agent in the summer of 2023. This would have put him open to summer offers from big-name clubs like Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona.

Salah is now willing to compromise on his initial demands of matching Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo's £500,000-a-week wage package. Salah appreciates the affection for him on Merseyside, which was once again displayed this week in Liverpool consoling him over Egypt's failure to qualify for the World Cup finals.

That may mean an extra year on top of the three years previously planned, thereby allowing him to finish out the prime years of his career with the club he joined over five years ago.

Salah's readiness to commit his future to Liverpool will be welcomed by the red half of the city and will provide a crucial boost to Liverpool's quest for an unprecedented quadruple.

Salah has always maintained that he enjoys his life at Liverpool, but he wants his status as one of the best players in the world to be replicated with a pay to match. After a change of heart, he is now prepared to accept the offer that has been on the table for quite some time.

Klopp said last month: “This season everyone is completely committed. It is a clear commitment for the team for this season and then we'll talk about the rest - future, immediate, further. Mo is not a guy for that, not at all. If I don’t line him up then his mood goes down. That is possible, but not against the team or whatever.
