The upcoming Pokemon game created by Game Freak titled Pokemon Scarlet and Violet released a new trailer highlighting the game’s treasure-hunting story and revealing a trio of new Pokémon. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players will take on the role of students enrolled in a Paldean school, and they’ll embark on a treasure hunt study project.
Along the way, they’ll encounter competitors in Gyms, search for a rare ingredient called Herba Mystica with a fellow student named Arven, and challenge Team Star, “a group of delinquents.” Gameplay-wise, Scarlet and Violet will feature a “Let’s Go!” mechanic that lets players explore the Paldea region with a Pokémon by their side. Players can then send out that Pokémon to adventure independently, picking up items and engaging in Auto Battles with nearby Pokémon.
As more information about the game comes out, the list of Pokemon up for grabs grows. Generation 9 sees a brand-new region, 4-player multiplayer, and of course, plenty of new Pokemon. The full list of Pokemon has not been revealed yet, but quite a large number of them have been confirmed thanks to trailers, Nintendo reveals, and other sources.
