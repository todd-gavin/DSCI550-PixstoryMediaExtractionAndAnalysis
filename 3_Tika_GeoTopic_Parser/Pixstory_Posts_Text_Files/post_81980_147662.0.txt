Scrunchies are better for your hair💁‍♀️❤️. Unlike hair ties, scrunchies don't cause hair breakage🤧🌼. 
The layer of fabric between the elastic band and your hair serves as a soft barrier to protect your precious locks from direct friction✨! 
Scrunchies also don't have to be wound as tightly around your hair❤️.
