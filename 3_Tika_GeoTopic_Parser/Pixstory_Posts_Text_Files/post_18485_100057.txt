Juventus presented their new shirt, the one they will use next season but which they will also wear in the last two Serie A matches starting from Monday evening against Lazio. It is a completely different shirt from the current one with a black very similar to gray at least seen from a distance The shirt is always black and white but the black is made up of many small triangles which appear more faded to the eye From the Juventus fans tremble, rejoice, embrace, get excited and experience great emotions together with their champions in a stadium that is more than a stadium a home The Allianz Stadium is the inspiration for the new Home Kit created by Juventus and adidas Football, which will make its debut on Saturday during the match of the new Italian women champions against Milan and then two days later on Monday evening in the Juventus stadium on the occasion of the last championship at home against Lazio In particular, the kit is made up of the most iconic Juve colours, black and white, using graphics that start from the shape of the triangle, that same geometric figure which is an integral part of the architectural structure of the stadium. The new kit already divides the fans on social media who have been asking for classic black and white stripes for years like in the uniforms of the past
