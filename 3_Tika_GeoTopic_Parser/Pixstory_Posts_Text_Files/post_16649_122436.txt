In a recent conversation with The Beer Biceps Janhvi was asked what she has gained from her mom Sridevi The Good Luck Jerry star said that she often wonders about it but feels that people may think of her as arrogant if she draws parallels with her mom Janhvi said This question always makes me wonder I think if she was around I would have been able to answer it a lot more freely But now that she is not I keep thinking people might think it s arrogant of me to draw parallels between me and my mom It s my mom right But people will never perceive it like that because to them she is Sridevi Kapoor but to me she is my mom Further discussing what she has similar to Sridevi Janhvi said The way that I walk across the corridor in the morning apparently I walk like her Apparently when I eat food and the sounds I make are exactly like her Apparently my voice is very similar to hers Apparently I cry like her I am needy like her I think I m a little switch on and switch off in front of the camera like her I think I m sensitive like her
