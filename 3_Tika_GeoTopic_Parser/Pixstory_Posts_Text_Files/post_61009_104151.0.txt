Step 1: Get an A-4 size paper. Fold the top right corner of the paper downwards to meet the left side. Unroll it, then do the same to the opposite corner, but don't unfold it. Fold the top part of the paper down horizontally to cross the intersection in the middle. After that, unfold it. Pull the left and right sides toward the middle of the paper (where the horizontal crease is). The other two creases should also be folded as you pull them. Pull the two sides together until they are touching.


Step 2: Fold the upper triangle's bottom-left corner to meet the top point. To meet the diamond, fold the sides over. Fold the entire thing vertically in half, then unfold and flip it over. Fold the two bottom corners upwards so that they meet in the middle. Fold them so that the vertical line running down the center lines up with what was originally the bottom edge. 

Step 3: Fold the large triangular flap at the top as far as it will go before meeting a horizontal line. There should now be three distinct flaps at the top, two small ones and one large one. Fold the large one in half. Fold the top points down and tuck the corners. Using the gap in the main flap, tuck the corners of the flaps in.
You should now have an origami heart.
