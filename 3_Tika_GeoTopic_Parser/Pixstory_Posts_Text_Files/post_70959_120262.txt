The movie industry loves to cover up a weak script with an all star cast Unfortunately it doesn t do much in terms of reviews Shamshera is proof that a good script is just as important if not more so than a good cast Along with Vaani Kapoor Ronit Roy Saurabh Shukla and Ashutosh Rana Sanjay Dutt plays the antagonist in the movie which also stars Ranbir Kapoor in a dual role The story which takes place in the s centres on a dacoit tribe and its struggle for independence from British domination Viewers had a lot of opinions as to why the movie didn t do well Reasons such as excessively lengthy run time repetitive use of similar scripts throughout the movie industry lack of memorable songs and the list goes on Many felt the movie couldn t evoke emotions and had too many irrelevant scenes with an extremely predictable storyline With an all star cast the general public expected to do well but were completely let down Many viewers claim Ranbir s acting could have been the movie s saving grace but the role was completely wrong for him The weak script didn t help either Sanjay Dutt had great potential in Shamshera but he s constantly being typecast as the same old hardcore villan Viewers felt Ronit Roy s character was wasted due to the feeble writing Many viewers felt the script was too similar to Agneepath and Baahubali combined the lack of emotion had them begging for the movie to end halfway through Shamshera is a clear example that strong writing and creativity is important for a successful movie Cowering behind a star cast is a coward s tactic and a failed one at that Have you watched Shamshera Drop a comment below if you agree or disagree
