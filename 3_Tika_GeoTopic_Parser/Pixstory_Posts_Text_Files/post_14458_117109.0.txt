Walking have been a great form of exercise and studies now prove that it can reduce the risk of death for those who have trouble in their blood sugar. 

People who had diabetes in the study were diagnosed by a doctor or they had a fasting blood glucose level that's higher than 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). People who were prediabetes in the study was also diagnosed by a doctor or they either had fasting glucose level from 100 to 125 mg/dL. 

In order to monitor and get the results of the study, the people wore an accelerometer on their waist to count on their steps for 7 consecutive days. The experts adjusted the age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol use, diet and use of diabetes medications.  

For over 9 years, 200 people with prediabetes and 138 with diabetes died. A follow up was conducted based on those who survived and walking for nearly 10,000 steps per day was best for reducing the risk of death from any cause for people with prediabetes and diabetes.  

20 percent of the people were removed from the study as they had invalid accelerometry data. Adults who were healthy enough to walk 10,000 steps may have different rates of death from those who aren't according to the study authors. 

The study authors suggested that if 10,000 steps is a huge task, it is best to approach the doctor to find the best routine that works for one.
