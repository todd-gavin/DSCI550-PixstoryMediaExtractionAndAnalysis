How do people expect to live peacefully in America?  What can people do if the law enforcement officers who actually need to protect the citizens, torture them and kills them? This is not the first incident here. Let's not forget George Floyd. The police department in Grand Rapids, Michigan is facing serious criticism with massive protests. The incident has spurred protests across the city and demonstrators demand justice for Patrick Loya. This is not the first time people black people are being harmed by the officials. Doesn't this prove the systemic racial hate that propagates in the country? According to Washington Post, there have been 255 police shootings in the United States this year. Isn't it high time strict actions be taken against police officers to stop this violence?
