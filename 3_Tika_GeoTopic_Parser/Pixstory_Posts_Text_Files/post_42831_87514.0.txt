Greetings from the Finance and Investment Cell, Shri Ram College of Commerce!

Well, if it can be thought, it can be done, a problem can be overcome.” – E.A. Bucchianeri

With Episteme' 22, FIC SRCC brings to you one of its amazing flagship events, Shri Ram Case Cognition, a four round case competition which not only analyses your problem solving skills but also tests whether you are a finance fanatic or not.  

We always think that there's enough time, but are you quick enough to make decisions capable of bringing huge changes?
Will your instincts save you before you fail?

Don't worry, we bring to you a platform to test the same.
