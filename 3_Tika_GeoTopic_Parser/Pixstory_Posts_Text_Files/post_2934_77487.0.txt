Caste is a form of discrimination in India that survived progress on all other fronts for millennia. In villages, it’s still the most dominant reality for people born in the castes considered lowly among Hindus. But should it be considered a ‘protected category’, like race and gender, on American campuses?

California State University, the largest four-year public university system in the country, voted unanimously this week to include caste in all its anti-discrimination clauses. The demand had been raised by Equality Labs, a Dalit civil rights organisation, though at least 80 professors of Indian origin had opposed the move: https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/cal-state-s-trustees-vote-to-include-caste-as-a-protected-category-122012600126_1.html 

Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs, said: “Caste oppressed students, community members, and the labor movement stood shoulder to shoulder to tell our truths and secure this win.” 

But Praveen Sinha, professor of accountancy, said: “The addition of caste is a misguided overreach given the existence of comprehensive policies that already protect against various forms of discrimination.” Critics argue that there is a higher form of discrimination because this category would apply only to Indians and people of South Asian descent. (Is that a fair objection?)

The caste hierarchy, advanced in scriptures, was (or has been) among the most exploitative and inhuman social practices in history. Post-independence, ‘untouchability’ was made a crime, and a host of steps were taken to bring the previously untouchable castes (“Dalits”) on par with others. On one hand, at least in urban India, caste is largely perceived as a non-factor. Yet, every day newspapers bring reports of atrocities against Dalits in villages: https://www.news18.com/news/immersive/documenting-violence-against-dalits-one-assault-at-a-time.html 

At UN and other forums, Dalit activists have often sought to draw comparison between race and caste, though the matter may not be so simple. In 2020, Isabelle Wilkerson’s highly acclaimed book, ‘Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents’, had drawn on similarities in the exploitation of Jews in early 20th century Europe, Blacks in America and Dalits in India: https://www.npr.org/2020/08/04/898574852/its-more-than-racism-isabel-wilkerson-explains-america-s-caste-system 

When Indians come to the US and participate in this relative young and more modern society, don’t they leave old prejudices behind? Apparently not. Reports say even Silicon Valley is strife with incidents of caste discrimination: https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/explosive-report-reveals-caste-discrimination-in-silicon-valley-30-dalit-engineers-call-out-indian-bosses-1735792-2020-10-28
