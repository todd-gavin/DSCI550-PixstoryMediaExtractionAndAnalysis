Once someone is convicted you expect a sentence maybe even an option to choose between two kinds of sentencing But can being asked to join the military one of them That s the choice Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate gave to a former Kentucky jail guard year old Brandon Scott Price who was convicted of sexually assaulting a female inmate The other option given is jail If you don t enroll in days you can report to the Franklin County Regional Jail You are under the gun young man You gotta do it You re getting a huge break the judge said That is rather surprising Price previously served in the army and that might have been the reason for the unusual choice His lawyer said it is very typical in Franklin County and a number of other counties in Kentucky for judges to include terms of probation which are specific to the individual before them Still offering an option of military service is rare as part of a probated sentencing Jails are getting overcrowded Therefore considering some other form of punishment that can serve correctional purposes might have prompted the judge who did not reveal his reasoning The trouble is the military won t accept those convicted of sexual assault An army spokesman said in a statement Any applicant who received a conviction for a sex offense is not eligible for enlistment or appointment No waivers are authorized Army Regulation The lawyer said Price had started the process of reenlisting but he might be rejected after all and may spend time behind bars No update was available after the Jan sentencing Yet the probation terms are debatable indeed Is joining the army seen as a kind of punishment or a penance and service to society If it is putting a convict to good use for the nation then military authorities should review their ban and indeed create separate facilities where convicts can chip in and shoulder duties A senator proposed that in a bill just last month The victim meanwhile may see this alternative as an unfair easy way out for the perpetrator Backgrounder
