Erling Haaland has taken the Premier League by storm ever since making a permanent move to Manchester City in the recent summer transfer window.
Haaland, who was already scoring goals for fun, unleashed a newer and more dangerous version of himself. He has netted 20 goals in just 12 appearances in all competitions so far this season.
The Norway international has failed to find himself on the scoresheet only once. However, City still managed to win that game 4-0. This shows how brutal Pep Guardiola’s side are and what they are capable of.
City will next lock horns against arch-rivals Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday (October 16) at Anfield. Ahead of the game, defender Virgil van Dijk revealed how his side will be tackling the firing Erling Haaland.
Speaking to TV2, the centre-back said that the Reds will do their best to cut off passes to Haaland and defend at the highest level.
"We have to try to stop the balls going to him, defend at the highest level, and be at our best, and that’s what we always have to be against City and that’s not going to be any different on Sunday”
It’s not me vs Haaland: Van Dijk
People love to draw player battles and other stuff from the clashes. However, the 31-year-old is not a big fan of it and believes it’s a team game.
“It’s something we should look forward to, it’s definitely not me against him, it’s all of us versus all of them. It’s the outside world that creates battles, one versus one and all this stuff. We want to stop them scoring, regardless of who it is on the pitch. But we know he’s quite good,” he added.
While City are enjoying second position in the domestic points table, Liverpool are struggling in 10th position. The encounter will be crucial for both sides given what lies ahead of them in the coming weeks.
