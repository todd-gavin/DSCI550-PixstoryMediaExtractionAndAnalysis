Brazil is a nation known for producing exceptional football players over the years with the likes of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Kaka, and many more. The Premier League has not been blessed with many Brazilian stars up until recently. It is without a doubt that the Premier League is the best league in the world and due to this, Brazilian players have been attracted to the league. We will look at the top 5 Brazilian players in the Premier League currently.
#5. Phillipe Coutinho
Phillipe Coutinho is now playing for Aston Villa under former teammate Steven Gerrard in what is his second stint in England.
Coutinho enjoyed an extremely successful spell the first time round at Liverpool which earned him a dream move to Barcelona. The 30-year-old bagged 33 goals and 23 assists at Liverpool over the space of four years and emerged as one of the best-attacking midfielders in the world. His move to Barcelona proved to be underwhelming where he was sent on loan to Bayern Munich and played well there. Steven Gerrard brought his former teammate back to England in the January transfer window and in 25 games Coutinho has produced 8 goal contributions (5 goals and 3 assists).
#4. Gabriel Jesus
Gabriel Jesus made his move to England in 2016 when he joined Manchester City. The forward proved he has immense talent by scoring 58 goals during his time at City. The 25-year-old has also emerged as a mainstay in Brazilâ€™s national team after his good performances in the league. Jesus now plays for Arsenal after struggling for consistent game-time at City under Pep Guardiola. He has made a fantastic start to life at Arsenal with 6 goal contributions (3 goals and 3 assists) in the opening 6 games.
