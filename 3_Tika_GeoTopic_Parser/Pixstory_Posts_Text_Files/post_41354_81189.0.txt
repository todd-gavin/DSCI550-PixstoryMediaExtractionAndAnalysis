Former President Donald Trump came up with an interesting take on the Truckers Protest going on in Canada. On Saturday, he suggested that the "Freedom Convoy" trucker protests in Canada would be more “influential” if the demonstration began in the US.

Now, how much truth this speculation holds cannot be determined but the nature of this “Freedom Convoy” can be. This convoy is made up of Canadian truckers who have been protesting vaccine mandates since late January, blocking major thoroughfares in the country as well as trade routes across the US-Canada border. 

Business Insider reported that Trump said - "I see they have Trump signs all over the place and I'm proud that they do," during a "Fox & Friends" interview Saturday morning. "But that's what happens, you can push people so far and our country is a tinderbox too, don't kid yourself. And there are plenty of [people from] our country up there right now. When you look at what's happening in Canada — our country, I think, is far more of a tinderbox than Canada," added.

Additionally, last week Trump was supporting this convoy. He said that they were peaceful protesters protesting against the harsh “left politics” of Trudeau. Clearly, Trump is against the covid mandates. 

In America, several protests of the similar kind can be seen wherein people claim that taking vaccines or wearing masks is a “personal choice” and any mandates for the same is a violation of their bodily autonomy. 

Turns out, covid is not the only thing the government has to deal with in this pandemic.
