 Lack of a goalscorer will hurt the Gunners Probably the biggest reason why Arsenal won t make it to the top four is the fact that they don t have an in form goalscorer Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe are the current top scorers for the club with goals in the Premier League Arsenal let Pierre Emerick Aubameyang leave in January But the Gunners took a massive risk and did not sign a replacement for their former captain Hence it looks like this would come and haunt Arsenal at the end of the season Alexandre Lacazette and Edward Nketiah are the available forward options But both the strikers are out of form Hence the Gunners could really struggle to find goals in the rest of their Premier League games Upcoming fixtures are not easy The Gunners have played Premier League games Hence they still have seven more games to salvage their season But it is not going to be easy from here on for the North London club Arsenal s next three Premier League games are up against Chelsea Manchester United and West Ham United They are also scheduled to play against Tottenham Hotspur on th May Hence it looks likely that the Gunners could drop points against their top four rivals Owing to this their losses against Brighton Crystal Palace and Southampton look costly With every game a potential must win the pressure would be immense on the manager and the players Too much pressure on the young squad Mikel Arteta has himself admitted that the players are down following their loss to Southampton The Spaniard also added that the players don t understand what they have to do to win Hence as stated earlier the pressure on the Arsenal players would be immense in their upcoming games Owing to this we could see the Gunners suffer and commit even more mistakes The majority of the Arsenal players are aged years or under Owing to their inexperience they may not know how to deal with such immense pressure and expectations Hence this could eventually lead to Arsenal s downfall in the top four race
