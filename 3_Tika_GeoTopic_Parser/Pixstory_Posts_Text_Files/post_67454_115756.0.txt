My favourite canteen meal has less to do with the food and more to do with the memories. 
My canteen had an extensive menu, but only a handful of items were actually available. My friends and I learnt what to eat and what to stay away from in the first week itself. The fried rice with chilli chuttney quickly became our go-to meal. 
After a particularly grueling day of classes, we went to the canteen and shared a hot plate of fried rice. This time was special, because the chilli chuttney was freshly made and still piping hot. The chuttney was strong and peppery; we could barely taste anything over the spice. And we loved it! 
The spice gave us all an instant tummy ache, and we were clutching our stomachs all the way to the hostel. We couldn't stop laughing and loving the heat and the pain. 
The fried rice wasn't particularly flavourful, but to this day it is my favourite dish in my college canteen. The memories make it taste a million times better.
