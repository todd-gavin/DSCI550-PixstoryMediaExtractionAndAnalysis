What did the text books tell u which was wrong. 
When I went to school some 40 years ago, the history books taught us about Rani Padmini and Johar- today historians dispute that. 
The fights between Akbar and Rana Pratab or other Mughals and Rajput/ Maratha kings were always between right and wrong.  It was never one king fighting another , we knew Rana Prataps horses name as well .
Aurangzeb was painted the way he was by history books . 
What is it that history books haven’t told u.

Partition was painted like only people were killed by Muslims . Have you ever heard about the Jammu Massacre - go search and find out how many lakhs of Muslims were killed . Biggest thing that history books have not taught you. 

So tell me what is it that history written by historians of Nehru era didn’t tell you. 

Muslims after generations were still invaders who looted temples.
Did any history book talk about temples of Buddhist Era where did they disappear. 
Yes they told you Muslims took part in freedom struggle in large number , which can’t be disputed . How 1857 mutiny had more Muslims than Hindus protesting and getting killed. 

So the hate has also been planted then , it only got amplified .  Give him that much credit please . 

Regarding economy and other things that can be a separate post. 

I don’t agree that there was fault in his vision of India but history give him credit.
