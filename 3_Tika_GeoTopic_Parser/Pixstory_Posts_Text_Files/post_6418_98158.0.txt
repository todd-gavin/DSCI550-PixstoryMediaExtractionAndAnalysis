This is an amazing story. I have been lucky to witness this bonding and share it with many people. 

For, in the midst of turbulence in our society and the need to celebrate religious plurality, this story is a must watch. 

Its all about caring and communal harmony between a Bishop and his Muslim help. 

Always my visits to Bishop Joseph Mar Barnabas Saffragon Metropolitan is filled with with warmth, love and sumptuous food prepared by our dearest friend Mohammed. 
Eid Mubarak....
