Developed in the early 80s, thrash metal is a subgenre of heavy metal which was born with the mixture of two equally rebellious and looked down upon genres of music, heavy metal and hardcore punk. The style emerged by blending the heaviness and technical proficiency of classic heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Saxon with noise, speed and aggression of hardcore punk bands such as Minor Threat, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits etc.

The genre came about as a response to the pop influenced LA glam metal scene led by bands such as Motley Crue, Ratt and Quiet Riot. In the United States, Canada and Europe, thrash was spearheaded by bands such as Overkill, Exodus, Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Kreator, Megadeth, Testament, Annihilator, Tankard, Sodom, Voivod etc.

Thrash metal is one of the more extreme genres of metal, and unlike the more polished style of standard heavy metal such as Judas Priest, thrash is far more raw and aggressive, in both production and composition making it hard to get into.

Furthermore, most thrash has a tendency of being rather similar, even if it is different which can even make it annoying at times. Though some metal bands have merged thrash with other styles such as industrial, groove metal, extreme metal, progressive metal and metalcore, but on the whole thrash’s standing points have always been about rawness, speed, heaviness, loudness and aggression, making it not for everyone.
