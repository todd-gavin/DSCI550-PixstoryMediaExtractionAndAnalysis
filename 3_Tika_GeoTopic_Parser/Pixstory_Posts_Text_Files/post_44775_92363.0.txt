Do Gemstones Work—No They
Don’t for 90% of the People

This is a combination of the above two clauses. However sometimes this clause goes to really weird levels. An individual who came to consult me was wearing a Blue Sapphire in the middle finger of right hand in silver and a Ruby in the ring finger of right hand in Gold. I really could not fathom that why were these were being used in conjunction unless the objective was to heal a physical disease. I asked him to enlighten me on this unique combination. 

He said that the Blue Sapphire was supposed to bring in wealth and the Ruby was to make Government officials favourable to him as he was primarily into earning through government contracts. I do not know whether these objectives were met but this individual was suffering from chronic depression, high blood pressure, water retention and gained weight rapidly after using these two gemstones together.

I just asked him to remove both the gemstones for a period of minimum 42 days and revert back. The result—barring his weight problem all his health parameters improved including a stabilized blood pressure level. Till today he is not wearing any gemstone and still thanks me for the best gem recommendation—A recommendation which did not prescribe any gemstones!Conclusion: This is the most unfortunate scenario and leads to many horror stories associated with gems. The so called mythical bad effects of Blue Sapphire are less due to Lord Saturn and more due to use of bad stones full of flaws.
