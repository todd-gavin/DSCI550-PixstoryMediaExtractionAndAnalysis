In an interview, Jackie Shroff had unknowingly made Tiger and Disha's relationship official. My boy started dating at the age of 25 and they are really great friends. I have no idea what they decided for their future. But I’m sure about one thing that Tiger is extremely focused (on) his work. For me, it’s his first work. Nobody – whether it’s his mom, dad, sister or girlfriend – matters more than work to him. Nobody can come in between him and his work. He is too focused on his work which is good.❤️❤️


Tiger and Disha made it quite obvious when they jetted off to Maldives to ring in the New Year, away from the paparazzi. While they have refrained from sharing pictures together till date, their individual posts clearly hinted that they were together.❤️❤️

Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have been in denial when it comes to making their relationship official.
