Leicester City were held to a goalless draw by Crystal Palace in matchday of the Premier League The fans at the King power stadium had a frustrating time as they saw their side fail to gather the three important points despite putting on a fairly good show throughout the majority of the game The problems for the home side have risen higher with this draw as they re stuck at the bottom of the table at th place with just points in matches Crystal Palace are in a considerably better position as they sit th in the table currently with points in matches Palace came close inside the first minutes from a free kick only for it to end as an off target shot Around minutes later Barnes replied for Leicester as he combined brilliantly with Daka to open up the opposition defense but his shot was blocked eventually Daka was denied once again by Guaita who saved a powerful shot from the forward although he was flagged offside eventually Leicester continued to create chances and attack the Palace goal with vicious runs but majority of them went in vain Around the minute mark Maddison came within touching distance of opening the scoring from an appealing position but his right footed shot was horribly wide A few minutes later Edouard forced a good save from Word after his shot was traveling with some force towards the bottom left corner Maddison had another chance to make it after making Palace pay for sloppy work in front of their own goal but his shot once again was an absurd one which landed straight into the gloves of Guaita Guaita made another good save in the th minute as he stopped a good shot from Ilhenacho who cut inside brilliantly with a brilliant bit of skill Maddison who barely had a good day made it worse for himself after he got booked minutes into the stoppage time forcing him to miss Leicester s next match vs Leeds United
