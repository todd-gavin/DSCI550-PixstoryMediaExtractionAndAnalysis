A slim majority of Australians appear opposed to Prince Charles becoming king when Queen Elizabeth II dies, according to data from the ABC's Vote Compass.

The results suggest 29 per cent are not at all supportive of the Prince of Wales becoming the Australian head of state.

Twenty-four per cent are not very supportive, while only 11 per cent are very supportive.

Of course, voters do not get a choice in the matter.

Under the current Australian laws of succession, which are inherited from the United Kingdom, the throne will pass immediately to the heir upon the death of the monarch.

The coronation of a king or queen is a symbolic event, which usually occurs several months later, after a period of mourning.

"Theoretically, Australia could choose to alter its rules of succession so that it ends up with a different monarch to that of the United Kingdom," constitutional law professor Anne Twomey said.

"But this would be likely to give rise to legal disputes about changing the meaning of the term 'queen' in the constitution and it is unlikely that anyone would want to provoke that argument."

More Australians now support a republic

The Vote Compass data shows there has been a slight increase in the number of Australians who support becoming a republic since the 2019 election.

About 43 per cent of people strongly or somewhat agree that we should cut ties with the monarchy.

That's up from about 39 per cent in 2019 and about 37 per cent in 2013.

About a quarter of Australians say they are "neutral" on the topic and about 30 per cent somewhat or strongly disagree the nation should become a republic.
