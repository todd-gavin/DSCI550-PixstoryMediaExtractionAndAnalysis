Ingredients

ðŸ‘‰1 quart whole milk, preferably organic.

ðŸ‘‰1 cup full-fat plain yogurt, preferably organic.

ðŸ‘‰Mixed berries, such as raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and red currants.

ðŸ‘‰1/2 cup honey; more as needed.

Preparation

Without scraping the bottom of the pan, transfer the yogurt to the strainer, and let it drain, refrigerated, for 2-1/2 to 3 hours. 

Discard or reserve the whey for another use. Store the yogurt in the refrigerator in a large resealable container for up to 5 days. Whisk before serving.

To assemble the dessert, set out 4 shallow bowls, and dollop 1/2 cup of the yogurt into each. 

Divide the berries among the bowls, and top with a drizzle of honey.
