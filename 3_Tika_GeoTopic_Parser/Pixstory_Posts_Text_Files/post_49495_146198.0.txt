Chris literally just gave the answer to that. 🤦‍♂️
It's because not all parents are supportive, Clay. Many kids go home to toxic and even abusive families. Many many people are transphobic in our country who would make their children's lives a living hell if they got to know about their gender identity or preferred pronouns.
I think the responsibility lies with the parents here. They need to make healthy and trusting environment at home. If a teacher is having to tell them what the child should tell them, the fault isn't with the kid but the parents.
If a child wants to keep something like this from their parents, they should be allowed to.
