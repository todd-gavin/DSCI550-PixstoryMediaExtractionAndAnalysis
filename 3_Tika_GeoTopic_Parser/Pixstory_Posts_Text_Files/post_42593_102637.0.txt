Last night, Jose Mourinho wins the UEFA Europa Conference League as a manager of AS Roma and with that, he made history to become the first-ever manager to win all UEFA’s major trophies which included the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.

Jose Mourinho wins his first UEFA Super Cup trophy (now known as Europa League) with FC Porto in the 2002-2003 season and the next season he wins the first UEFA Champions League trophy with FC Porto.

After that, he managed Chelsea FC but didn’t win any UEFA trophy.

But When he joined Inter Milan, he wins the UEFA Champions League trophy in the 2009-2010 season after beating Bayern Munich by a 2-0 scoreline.

After this, Mourinho had to wait for seven-year to win any UEFA trophy and in between, he also managed Real Madrid but in the 2016-2017 season he wins the UEFA Europa League with Manchester United where Manchester United beat Ajax by 2-0 scoreline.

After this, Jose Mourinho managed Tottenham Hotspur but because of undisclosed reasons, Tottenham Hotspur sacked Mourinho.

But when he joined AS Roma in 2021, he brings the joy back to all the Roma fans because, in the very first year, Jose Mourinho wins the UEFA Europa Conference League after beating Feyenoord by a 1-0 scoreline.

Jose Mourinho is “The Special One” for a reason and his trophy collection proved it.
