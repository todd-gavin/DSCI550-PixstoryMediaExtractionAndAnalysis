I found a shelf full of beautifully illustrated post cards at this bookstore in Kolkata One of my best finds The ink illustrations that depict scenes and building from around Kolkata are simple but eye catching Samir Biswas is the artist and the collection is called Portrait of Kolkata If you find yourself around Parkstreet then it d be a great idea to visit the Oxford bookstore and check these illustrated cards
