Health solely doesn't depend on the internal factors and the mental health alone, there are factors that could trigger and distort our peacefulness and so in a world full of rush and conflicts, having a peace of mind is like meeting a friend whom you meet once in a while. 
Peace of mind is really important as it is what contributes to our mental and to our physical health as well. And so it is the inner calm which is the internal state of tranquility. When you experience mental peace, you would feel: 
• Being at ease with yourself 
• a sense of self-compassion 
• Calm yourself down with the day to day worries 
• Being open to whatever awaits in life and whatever comes your way. 
We might think that we can oy find peace of mind when we are out of problems, but that not the case. 
Finding inner peace can boost our overall contentment and feelings of happiness, regardless of the amounts of challenges you are facing. 
Finding peace of mind isn't a challenge as we may think, we can find peace of mind by: 
• Accepting that we can't control everything 
• Forgiving ourselves and others 
• Being focused on what is at hand 
• Going into yourself 
• By journaling your thoughts and emotions 
• Getting in touch with mother earth
