The harpy eagle is a large, powerful bird that is found throughout much of the world, except polar regions. It's one of the best predators in the animal kingdom, and its diet includes anything from small mammals to large prey like deer and wild boar. They hunt wide variety of prey, including other birds, small mammals, and even large reptiles.

Harpy eagles are excellent predators and are capable of catching prey up to twice their weight. They also have a powerful talon that they use to capture their prey with ease.

They are notorious for hunting in large groups, which makes them even more formidable predators. Harpy eagles usually hunt in packs of three or more and will work together to take down their prey.

Harpy eagles are also one of the most intelligent birds on earth. They're able to learn tricks quickly and use them to their advantage â€“ for example, by catching prey that's beyond their reach or by avoiding danger. They're also incredibly social birds, so they often live in colonies where they help care for their young. They are also monogamous and mate for life. Since they have a lifespan of 35 to 45 years, this means a bonded pair may stay together for 25 to 30 years.

Funnily enough, they can hunt and eat a human. They can crack our skull open by one hit of their beak and we're there. Remember, they are apex predators of the sky. However, we are nor convenient enough for them to airlift to a safe spot where they can dine on us, so they show us some mercy.
