 Kentucky judge has been removed from the bench as she used her power to influence criminal cases involving her adult son She had tried to arrange for the release of her son and tried to influence both the judge and prosecutor in his case to get the outcomes she wanted Parents are concerned about their children but it is okay to abuse the prestigious position they have been entitled to Isn t it breaking the trust of people who expects only justice from the judiciary We can understand that judges at humans and they have their weaknesses but protecting their son is neglecting the whole ethics that they strive with Moreover they are in one way or other rejecting justice for someone who deserves it this is not the first case we see We people have faith that the judiciary would stand with justice that is why we seek justice They are the ones we approach above everything if something goes wrong If they show favouritism whom would we trust Is justice far off from reality
