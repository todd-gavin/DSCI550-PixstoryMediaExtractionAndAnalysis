Totally in support to your words I realised this very moment as we all hit pandemic and since I was locked in my home the only thing to see changing everyday around me were skies and specially at the times of sunsets which made me fall in love with it even more Everyday I sat in my balcony for half an hour to notice and capture the changes in the colours in the skies and its the utter moment of calmness positivity relief I found I believe instead hogging on what s visible on social sites and appreciating it if we start looking more around us there s even more beautiful moments and things to capture in our own way
