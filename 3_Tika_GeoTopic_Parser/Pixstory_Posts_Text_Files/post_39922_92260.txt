There will be a solar storm that will hit the Earth on Wednesday and Thursday because the Sun has been getting more active People at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s Space Weather Prediction Center have made the prediction NOAA The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA said on Twitter that a coronal mass ejection CME came from a filament that was about degrees long It was on March It is because of that that the geomagnetic storms will hit the Earth late on April Wednesday NOAA said that the storm could last until Thursday April However NOAA says that the geomagnetic storm that is going to hit the Earth is going to be a small one and it will be called G The geomagnetic storms are ranked from G to G with the strongest one being G These storms could also have an effect on electrical systems such as power grids and power plants radio and satellite communications and navigation systems A second filament eruption took place on March but it doesn t look like the CME from that event will hit Earth A geomagnetic storm is when there is a lot of electricity in the Earth s field According to NOAA it is a big change in Earth s magnetosphere that happens when there is a lot of energy coming from the sun and going into the space around Earth These storms are caused by changes in the solar wind This causes big changes in the currents plasmas and fields in Earth s magnetosphere Life changing events would happen on Earth if there was a strong geomagnetic storm such as G or G Anything that runs on electricity could be harmed A geomagnetic storm isn t the first time this year that the Earth will be hit by one A geomagnetic storm hit Elon Musk s Starlink project hard in February causing of its satellites to break down This was a big setback for the project
