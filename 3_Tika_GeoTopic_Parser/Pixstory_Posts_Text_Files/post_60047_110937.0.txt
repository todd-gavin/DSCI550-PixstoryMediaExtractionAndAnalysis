SnapChat's premium subscription service, SnapChat+, has received formal announcement. For $3.99 per month, Snapchat+ will offer a selection of unique, unreleased, and experimental features.

"This subscription will enable us to introduce new Snapchat features to some of the most dedicated members of our community and enable us to give premium support," claims SnapChat.

Only the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates will now provide SnapChat+. with future development into other nations.

According to Snapchat SVP Jacob Andreou, the initial exclusive features are basic and include the option to customize the app icon, see who re-watched a story, and pin a buddy to the top of your conversation history as a "BFF." BFF is one of those features that will only be accessible to subscribers; however, other features may also make their way into the main Snapchat app.
