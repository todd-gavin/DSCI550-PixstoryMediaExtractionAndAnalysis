To open off our Europa league campaign this season Arsenal will be flying off to Zurich for an early kick off which should be a nice reminder of what European football is like after a year of having midweek off Despite Zurich sitting th in the Swiss league on just points it s important to remember that they had the quality to qualify for this competition so shouldn t be dismissed and further as a team that is struggling to find league form they will be desperate to prove themselves in front of their home fans Due to some injury issues and a small squad which unfortunately wasn t dealt with on deadline day we re going to have to play some starters where resting them would feel the ideal option Breaking down the team I think Matt Turner should and will be starting in goal giving him a chance to prove himself after some unwarranted criticism seems to have fallen his way due to a few nervous moments in pre season In defence I d like us to line up with Tierney Tomiyasu Holding Cedric which speaks volumes about the improvement in depth we ve made in this area as this back being one that you could ve easily seen starting in the league last season As for the midfield due to a lack of alternatives I think we should continue with Xhaka Lokonga but provide Vieira his first start in an Arsenal shirt something myself and other Arsenal fans have been anticipating greatly Finally in the front I think Nketiah will be at the spearhead of attack something he s more than deserved with Brazilians Martinelli and Marquinhos on either flank next to him As for how I feel the game will go Arsenal will dominate the ball and continuously probe to break down a resolute Zurich block Despite the defensive efforts it won t take too long for the deadlock to be broken and then against a team who ve conceded in and lack any form of confidence the floodgates will open I m predicting a Arsenal away win with Nketiah x and Martinelli scoring the goals PixstoryArsenal Arsenal
