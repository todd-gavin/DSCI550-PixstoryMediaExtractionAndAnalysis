Padmavat ' s album was indeed amazing üòç. From Ghoomar, Nainowale and Ek dil ek jaan all the songs were fantastic. But for what stood out the most was Binte dil . 
Sung by Arjit Singh the song is beautiful love ballad . It fits with unhinged character of Allauddin. With lyrics by AM Turaz and music by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, it is magical song which transports you to another world . With its arabic touch , it will make you feel you are in Egypt.
