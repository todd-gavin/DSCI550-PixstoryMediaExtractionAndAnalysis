Manchester City raced off to a fantastic win over Manchester United in the much awaited Manchester derby as they registered a thumping victory at the Etihad stadium Pep Guardiola s men displayed supreme team work and were overall the more dominant side on the pitch clearly as they had the upper hand in a high pressure game Manchester United on the other hand were at fault for majority of the occasions as they ended up succumbing to a thrashing defeat away from home Here are the player ratings of all the players from today s game Manchester United David De Gea Managed to hang on to some of the shots from the opposition attackers and was mostly let down by erroneous defending from his team mates Diogo Dalot Couldn t really do anything in order to resist City s crosses and their attackers building up chances one after the other Was also booked in the second minute itself Raphael Varane Couldn t have any impact over the game as Erling Haaland literally rushed past him to complete his brace after finding de Bruyne s cross Lissandro Martinez Just like his team mates couldn t contain City s attackers and failed to assess their movements in and around the Manchester United box Tyrell Malacia Was totally clueless in regard to clearing away the crosses due to his poor positioning Was subbed off in the meantime City build up their lead Scott Mctominay Gave it his all to keep the game early on but later on succumbed to trouble just like rest of his team mates who never really managed to come in the way of the attackers and the crosses Christian Eriksen Failed to position himself properly which allowed Foden to open the scoring Poor performance by his standards Antony Scored an outrageous goal to pull one back for United in the second half Showed good resistance against the press in City s half of the play
