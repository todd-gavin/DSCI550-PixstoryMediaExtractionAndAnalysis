ABSTRACT Objectives To describe placental changes occurring in women with pre existing diabetes To determine if elastography can detect placental changes in vivo Data sources PubMed Embase Medline and Cochrane were searched to identify English language studies published until July Study Eligibility for key question Any study that described histopathological changes in placentas from women with known diabetes Study Eligibility for key question Any study that described structural placental changes detectable by elastography in high risk pregnancies e g complicated by pre eclampsia and or fetal growth restriction Study appraisal and synthesis methods For key question we grouped placental pathologies using the Amsterdam International Consensus Group definitions For key question we conducted a meta analysis including all data from studies reporting placental stiffness in metres per second m s or kilopascals kPa Mean difference CI was calculated using a random effects model Results Data were extracted from studies of placental histopathology in women with known diabetes In this group a wide variety of placental histopathologic changes are described though none are considered pathognomonic Histopathological changes were divided into three broad categories based on presumed aetiology including maternal vascular malperfusion fetal vascular malperfusion and or infectious inflammatory other changes studies reported placental stiffness scores for women with a high risk pregnancy versus normal pregnancy Only one study reported stiffness scores for placentas of women with pre existing diabetes N lt women Pooled analysis of studies with available data included high risk pregnancies and control healthy pregnancies Maternal derived pathologies resulted in higher placental stiffness with mean difference kPa CI compared to control healthy pregnancies Fetal derived pathologies also resulted in higher placental stiffness with mean difference of kPa CI compared to control healthy pregnancies Conclusions Shear Wave Elastography may provide in vivo approximation of placental histopathology in women with some high risk pregnancies A high risk pregnancy may involve maternal and fetal derived pathologies Further studies particularly in women with pre existing diabetes are needed to confirm this observation Sources
