Undoubtedly chai pakoda combination is an universal favourite when it comes to monsoon I guess it has some connection with our taste buds rains does brings cold air and the feel and the taste of pakodas and samosas in this perfect weather and the mitti ki khushboo is a dreadful combination According to me this is one of the best experiences which can only be felt but not explained Genuinely speaking I am not a person who loves rain but I love having chai and pakodas during this season How about you tell me in the notes section
