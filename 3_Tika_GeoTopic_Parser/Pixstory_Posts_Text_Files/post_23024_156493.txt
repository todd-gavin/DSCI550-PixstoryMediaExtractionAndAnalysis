Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium has seen some spectacular battles in the FIFA U Women s World Cup and yesterday was no exception as Germany upset New Zealand in Goa to win their third World Cup game A fantastic game in which VAR played a significant role finished in an unusual manner When additional time began Germany had a advantage and the game was almost over Just before the end of stoppage time General Coordinator Jessie Dai entered the field to advise referee Bouchra Karboubi that the match must be called off because of thunderstorm warnings in the area Fatiha Jermoumi and Soukaina Hamdi the two assistant referees also got involved to investigate the situation Leon Birnie the head coach of New Zealand and Friederike Kromp the coach of Germany both participated Bouchra Karboubi blew the full time whistle to signal the end of the game after a protracted debate One would have accepted the choice at that time since as the proverb says It is better to prevent and prepare than to repent and repair Players and officials from both teams entered the playing area to congratulate one another and express gratitude to the supporters The referee and her assistants entered the field just as the broadcast was about to conclude and instructed the players to pick up where they left off while telling the replacements and coaching staff to return to their respective dugouts The game was restarted with seven minutes of extra time Instead of attempting to score a goal the players on the field chose to throw the ball around to one another A somewhat strange conclusion to a rather exciting game
