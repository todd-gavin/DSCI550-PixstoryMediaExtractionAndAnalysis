Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson may have broken up and gone their separate ways last month, but Kanye West doesn't seem to be over it yet.
Just as he posted regularly about the couple throughout their relationship, he's apparently not done -- and this time, he's accusing Davidson of being a "pawn sent here to antagonize" him.
In a new post shared to his Instagram page on Saturday, West doesn't specify who "sent" the "Saturday Night Live" alum, but he did share a startling theory as to motive.
The largest portion of West's caption was presented as if it were a message written to his two eldest children, North (9) and Saint (6), by Davidson. Kanye utilizing his favorite nickname for the comedian, Skete, wrote: Hi North I'm Skete. Look at my Tattooooos.
Kanye West has continued his feud with Adidas over his Yeezy brand, as well as his frustrations with where his kids will be going to school. He shared his frustration an then what appears to be a screenshot suggesting options for their education with the caption, "This is co-parenting". The message concluded with another dig at former West collaborator Kid Cudi.
