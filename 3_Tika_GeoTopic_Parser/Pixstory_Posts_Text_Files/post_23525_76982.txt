On January BTS posted a video where Jungkook adorably mispronounced the world Chipotle as Chicotle Well if ARMYs thought it was cute Chipotle couldn t seem to agree more and even changed their username on Twitter to match what Jungkook said It seems as if Chicotle has much more of a ring to it than first expected Yet from there it seems as if the popular brand continued to showcase just how much of an ARMY they are On their social media they definitely picked the right person to run the account because they were radiating BTS in their tweets Well it seems as if the love didn t end there On January one ARMY wanted to see how much Chipotle loved BTS and cheekily asked Chipotle discount code exclusively for ARMY when Although it was a long shot Chipotle replied Tomorrow and although many didn t believe it it seems the brand stuck to its promise On January US BTS ARMY proved that the brand had kept its promise sharing that they were partnering with Chipotle to give ARMYs a free Chipotle bowl its BTS world and we re all just living in it
