It is said that people learn a lesson from all evil that falls on them, but why is the US government not capable of learning a lesson from these gun massacres?
The political protection for guns is unique in the United States.

Other countries like Scotland banned handguns in 1996 when Dunblane Massacre killed 16 primary school pupils and teachers.
There are strong gun laws in Australia, including a ban on most semiautomatic and automatic weapons. After the Utoya massacre in Norway in 2011, the government banned semiautomatic firearms, persevering with the legislation despite years of opposition from a well-organized hunters' lobby. After the Christchurch shootings in 2019, New Zealand's government passed stringent new restrictions on gun ownership and announced a buyback program.

But the scenario remains unchanged in America; despite countless examples of mass shootings and gun attacks, the government has not been able to make some stringent laws for public safety. The gun control laws in the United States are so subtly protected that Republic politicians embrace gun rights to portray their conservative bona fides to voters. The political game has not ended so far, and the repercussions are all endured by the country's people.
