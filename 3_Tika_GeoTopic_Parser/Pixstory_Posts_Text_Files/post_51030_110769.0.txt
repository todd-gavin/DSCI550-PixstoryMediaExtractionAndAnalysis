Best places to have south- Indian food in Delhi NCR .

Basically South Indian cuisine usually encompasses the five Southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Telangana, and Kerala. all regions have typical main dishes, snacks, light meals, desserts, and drinks that are well-known in their respective region.

Some well known and loved foods include South Indian chicken curry, Kulambu (South Indian fish curry), Idlis, Dosas, Vadas, ​Sambaar, Uttapams, Rasam, and Payasam.

I just love south Indian cuisine (Specially Dosa) as it is super light and tasty at the same time😍 

So you guys tell me in the notes do you love south indian cuisine and tried it at any of the outlet mentioned above ?
