After one very exciting season after such a long time, Real Madrid won their very much deserved 14th Champions league and they did it with style too. Jaime Carragher former Liverpool player didn’t rate Madrid to win the trophy this season and even went on to say that “this Real Madrid have no chance of winning the Champions league”. The childhood Toffee backed the Reds to win the trophy who ironically lost the final to Real Madrid for the second time in the past 5 years. Lets just say that Mohammad Salah didn’t get to take that revenge he desired so bad. Real Madrid impressed everyone with their comebacks again PSG, Chelsea and Manchester City; Madrid wasn’t expected to win any of these matches. 

Fast Forward to this season, Manchester City and Liverpool have added Erling Haaland and Darwin Nunez to their squad respectively and Bayern Snapping up Mané from Liverpool. Real Madrid have added Tchoumeni to their squad to continue having the best midfield in Europe. Tottenham have made some very good signings most notably Richarlison and Bissouma, they are also expected to sign Djed Spence from Middlesbrough who enjoyed a very successful season at Nottingham Forest helping them get back to the Premier League after decades. Chelsea are also chasing world class players like Sterling, De Ligt, Raphina and Milikovic-Savic.
They are also frontrunner to land Cristiano Ronaldo who asked to leave Mancheseter United a few days ago since they have failed to get addition for Erik Ten Hag to rebuild that awful United Squad.

But the question is who will win this years Champions League?
