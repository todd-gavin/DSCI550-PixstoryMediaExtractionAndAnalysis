Komodo National Park, which is located around 250 miles east of Bali, is where you may see Komodo dragons. That's the name of the island, Komodo Island. If you want to witness these remarkable lizards in their natural environment, visit the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, and probably some of Flores.

There are just some things you have to keep in mind and I mean, really keep in mind. Don't go visiting Komodo without a profession guide. Seriously, don't take this lightly. A lot of people go with the locals to see them, to save money of course. But there's no point keeping your life on the line to save a few dollars. You've managed to make a trip to that so you can definitely afford a guide. While these instances are rare, Komodo Dragons will eat you given a chance. Their bites are venomous. One bite and you will die in a few hours without proper medical assistance. So, keep that in mind.

Another thing to remember is that menstruating people are not allowed to see Komodo Dragons. May sound a bit extreme but it isn't. These lizards smell the blood from afar and get aggressively attracted to it. A series of menstruating women have been attacked by them on the island many times.
