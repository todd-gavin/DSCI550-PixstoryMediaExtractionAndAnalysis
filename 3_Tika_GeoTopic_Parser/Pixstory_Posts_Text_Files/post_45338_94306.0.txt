For the youngster, it was his first senior game in Black and Yellow. Tom Rothe, a teenager at
Borussia Dortmund, says his record-breaking Bundesliga debut gave him "goosebumps" when
he became the league's youngest player to score in their first game.

 The up-and-comer made
history when he scored the opening goal in the Black and Yellow's 6-1 thrashing of Wolfsburg on
Saturday at the age of 17 years and 169 days.

The adolescent stated later that the experience had been "amazing," and that he struggled to
express his emotions following a fantastic first taste of top-flight football.

"When you run out here yourself, it's awesome," Rothe told Sky Sport Germany following his
impressive debut.

"[You get] goosebumps. [It is] indescribable."
The teenager was modest in his understatement on his performance, simply adding in good
humour: "It went quite well!"

Dortmund boss Marco Rose meanwhile wanted to focus on only player as Today it doesn't make
any sense to talk about individual players, except about Tom Rothe.Of course we've had Tom on our list for a long time and know his qualities. 

He was at the
training camp in the summer and is generally doing an excellent round. It was time to throw in
such a boy.

With the goal he probably got even more security. As I know Tom: â€œHe has a very cool game
made for his age. That inspires more, I hope. It's also very important for the people here to be
able to keep adding youngsters to our first team."
