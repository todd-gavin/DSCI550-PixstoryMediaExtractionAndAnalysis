The Uruguayan wouldn't fit well in the manager's system, according to the newly hired manager of the MLS team. Wayne Rooney claims that DC United should not sign free agent Luis Suarez because he favours players "who are hungry." When questioned about potential signings after taking over the MLS team this week, Rooney said he would focus more on developing players to enhance his group.

Ahead of the 2022 World Cup, Suarez, 35, is searching for a new club after leaving Atletico Madrid at the end of the last campaign. He recently said that as he thought about his future, he had received multiple MLS offers.

Although Luis Suarez is a phenomenal player and is greatly respected by Rooney, Rooney prefers guys who are hungry.

The club is working very hard to identify the right profile of players we want to bring in, and Rooney is confident that they will have an announcement to make on new signings in the near future. Rooney wants players to join this club who are hungry and who want to come to the club but who also have a lot to give and are capable of playing every game and attending every training session.

The Uruguayan sensation had a standout season in 2020–21, scoring 21 goals as Atletico Madrid sprinted to the league title. However, his form dipped the next year. In 2021–2022, he made 10 fewer starts and scored 10 less goals.

It would have to be for January, according to Suarez, who claimed that the MLS market is quite complicated and that some clubs want you but don't have the openings. Other teams are interested in you right away, but he must determine whether they stand a chance of making the playoffs.
