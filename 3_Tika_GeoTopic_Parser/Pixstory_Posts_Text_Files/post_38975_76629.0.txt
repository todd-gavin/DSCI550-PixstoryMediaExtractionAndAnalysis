This year, India  celebrated its 72nd Republic Day as it prepares to memoralize the date on which the Constitution of India came into effect in 1950. Historically, this day is observed by festivities such as the well-known Delhi Republic Day parade at Rajpath, which honours the Indian military forces and our rich cultural heritage. Usually, the parade is a lively event with more than 100,000 people attending but the celebrations will be toned down this year due to the pandemic. Here is how Republic Day will be celebrated in the midst of a pandemic. 
There will be no chief guest this year, making it the first Republic Day parade without a chief guest in 50 years. Initially, British PM Boris Jonhson was invited to come to India. However, he was forced to cancel his visit due to the outbreak of a new Covid strain in the UK. Before this, India didnâ€™t have a chief guest for the parade in 1952, 1953 and 1966.
This year the spectators have been limited to 25,000 compared to 150,000 last year. Similarly, the number of media representatives has been cut from 300 to 200. Children under the age of 15 will not be allowed to attend.
