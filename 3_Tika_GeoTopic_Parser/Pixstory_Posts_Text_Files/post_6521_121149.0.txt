A video of a man threatening a young woman with a knife while another stands behind her crying is viral on social media. She tries to reason with the perpetrator as he continues to threaten. The word ‘Indore’ can be seen superimposed on the screen. It is being claimed that the man hails from the Muslim community and this was another case of ‘love jihad’, a conspiracy theory according to which Muslim men are trained to ‘trap’ women of other faiths.

Twitter user Kajal Hindustani tweeted this video, claiming that a ‘love jihadi’ was entrapping Hindu girls by force. Hindu fundamentalists often use the word ‘Jihadi’ on social media to target Muslims.

Mukesh Kumar, channel head of Sudarshan News, quote-tweeted Kajal’s post, calling for the castration of such individuals. At the same time, he used a pejorative word for transgenders in the tweet.
