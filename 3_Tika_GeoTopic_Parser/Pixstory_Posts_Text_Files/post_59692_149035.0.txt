Siddhant Pujari Talks About His Journey
Being an entrepreneur is in my blood and a way of life. It's about becoming fully immersed into what you're doing and how you're doing it. It's a life-calling mission that gets into your bloodstream and overtakes how you think and operate. I can't wait to go to bed at night, hurry up and sleep, and wake up in the morning to do it all over again.
Everyone spends time researching Steve Jobs' success and reads the financial pages looking into what Elon Musk is working on, saying, "I wanna do that." All well and good, but I suggest you flip that playbook and look at it from a different perspective. For every successful entrepreneur out there, there are many more that have failed. Study them.
Why? Because you'll know what pitfalls to avoid when you're ready to start your own business. Most of the mistakes entrepreneurs make are common ones that can be avoided if we have the foresight to study, not just what's worked, but what hasn't.
His advice: Put your toe on that line, but don't cross it. Push the limits; don't break the rules.
