33 years ago, my mom left Tiananmen Square after reporting for Dan Rather and CBS News about the peaceful Chinese student protests for democracy. After 8 weeks of coverage, she and other journalists left the square not fearing for their safety- rather because the protests were waning and, in the eyes of the producers, it wasn’t ‘news’ anymore. 

That’s exactly what the brutal Chinese government wanted. They waited until the western press left Beijing so they could roll in their tanks and murder innocent students peacefully looking for a more open society. 

One day in China, let’s hope the Chinese government calls these students ‘heroes’ not ‘hooligans’.  #goddessofdemocracy  #china #cbsnews
