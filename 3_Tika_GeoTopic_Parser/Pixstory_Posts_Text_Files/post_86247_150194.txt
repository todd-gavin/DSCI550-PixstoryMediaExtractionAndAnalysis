I m from Shimla Himachal Pradesh and it is a very nbsp beautiful place and there is nothing like I want to change but many tourists visit Shimla during Summer and Winter season I have no problem with tourists but problem we face during these seasons regarding water scarcity is very very bad You guys can t even imagine what we guys go through during that time We get water after days sometimes even after a week and that is the only thing I want to change about Shimla I don t want anyone to face these issues in future again and again every year because I know how much difficult it is to survive without water for one day I know we can t reduce number of visitors but atleast we can tell them not to use so much of water I know hotels also face water scarcity problem but they can afford a water tanker but normal people aam janta can t Keeping these things in mind I want to aware each and every person reading this that if you re visiting Shimla in future please use water in limit we don t want you guys to suffer also but don t make us suffer also Thank you
