According to recent studies, loneliness is linked to brain and cardiovascular disorders. According to a study published in the journal Neurology last month, loneliness is connected to an increased risk of dementia.
Increased Dementia Risk
The authors retrospectively evaluated data from the Framingham study's population-based cohorts that were obtained prospectively over a 70-year period for this study (1948 through 2018). The sense of loneliness on three or more days in the previous week was considered as loneliness.14 percent (329) of the 2308 participants (average age 73 years; 56 percent women) who did not have dementia at the start of the study developed dementia within 10 years, and 6 percent (144) met the loneliness requirement. According to the estimations, lonely persons had a more than 50% higher 10-year dementia risk than non-lonely ones (age-, gender-, and education-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.54; 95 percent CI, 1.06 - 2.24).The estimates suggested an even larger risk for lonely people younger than 80 years old who did not have the APOE-4 genotype (a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease) (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.03; 95 percent CI, 1.63 - 5.62). Further research has connected loneliness to decreased executive function, a smaller overall brain volume, and more white matter damage.

Loneliness as a Way of Life
Loneliness has been studied scientifically for a long time. Even Hollywood's affluent and beautiful have taken up the challenge. Journalist Michael Allmaier wrote in the weekly newspaper Die Zeit a few years ago that the lone wolves howled at us through every medium. Hundreds of Hollywood stars are said to have played the enigmatic stranger or the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed single person. Authors of lifestyle books praised the new "life feeling" as well as the "path to inner liberation" and the "art of enduring.‚Äù
