Between March and April of this year nine mass shootings have occurred leaving dead suffering from gunshot wounds and others injured in the rush to escape We have two sides one talking about their rights to hold guns and others including children who are living the fear of shootings that can occur anywhere at any time In there were gun deaths in the United States not counting suicides alongside a total of mass shootings most of which disproportionately affect Black and brown communities We endorse campaigns for the health of the minorities and can anyone sees the targeted violence and systemic racism that roots in anything and everything And what about mass shootings and at least mass murders in What does this all prove Gun owners in America can t keep a gun safe Argue with me but after reading the articles of children getting killed by guns of their parents What unity does America have in this We see some stating banning ghost guns we see some states training civilians on how to use guns Until and unless you see how a household or an entire family can suffer due to a gun how the very gun you use for self protection becomes a threat to yourselves you will scream for lenient gun laws Remember you are promoting violence and that s not any kind of heroism I see attitudes of America even a recent incident by a law enforcement official harming and shooting an individual I lose hope still rant through these pages and I want peace of mind to sleep at night like many Americans
