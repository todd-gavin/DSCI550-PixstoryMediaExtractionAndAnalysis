What was meant to be a day of celebration for our nation's independence in Illinois ended tragically when a disturbed 22-year-old with a firearm opened fire on a crowd of operators from a rooftop, killing six and injuring dozens more. The individual accused of perpetrating these unsettling acts has been apprehended.

As of yet, no motive has been identified for this incident.

According to reports, this man - if he is even deserving of any pronoun - was apprehended by the police without incident. But I, along with many others, desire that there had been an incident during his arrest, and that he was made to suffer for his heinous acts of violence on a day of celebration - that he met his end on the side of the road.

This situation will inevitably serve as political fodder. But make no mistake, what transpired during this parade was the work of a person devoid of morality; a soulless, unprincipled creature with no honor. He is a person who has made his own bed and will sleep in it for the remainder of his natural life. 

He will undoubtedly excuse his conduct by pleading insanity and justify it by blaming anyone other than himself. If there was an iota of remorse in him, he would have stopped after the first shot. It  was he who squeezed the trigger and decided to take the lives of 6. For these actions, the state must take his life.
