The 33-year-old has committed to a two year deal with the Premier League side after completing a medical and will reunite with Antonio Conte. 

Tottenham has completed the  of Inter winger Ivan Perisic on a free transfer. The Croatian international will officially join the North London club after the expiration of his contract at San Siro this summer. Perisic, 33, who has committed to a two-year contract, has become Antonio Conte’s first signing of the summer. 

His signing will mark a departure from Tottenham’s usual transfer policy of signing young players with a sell-on value and is a further signal that they are giving their full backing to the Centre. 

Why has Perisic joined Tottenham?
 As per reports, Tottenham became the favourite to sign Perisic last week after talks between the player and Inter did not go well. The breakdown in negotiations allowed the Spurs to move into a pole position to get him, presenting Perisic with the prospect of reuniting with ex-coach coach Conte. 

Perisic won the Serie A title with the Italian manager in the 2020-21 campaign. He was one of Inter’s most productive players again in 2021-22, scoring eight and assisting seven goals in 35 Serie A appearances for the runners-up. 

What has been said about Perisic’s move to Tottenham?
A statement from Tottenham read, “The vastly experienced Croatia international will join the club on July 1, following the expiration of his contract at Inter and has agreed to a deal that will run until 2024.”

Perisic, who has 113 caps for Croatia and was part of the squad which reached the 2018 world cup final, will join up with his new Tottenham Hotspur team for the start of pre-season.
