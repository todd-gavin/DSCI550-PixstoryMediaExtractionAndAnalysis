Mumbai City FC registered their first win of the season against Odisha by 2-0 in the Indian Super League on Saturday. 
Both the teams remained silent in the first half as neither side posed a threat to the opposition's penalty area. Defences were on their mark in both the teams and the failure of finishes led this game goalless till the first half time.
But in the second half, Odisha FC's defence got worried as Mumbai finally broke the deadlock by an own goal. The own goal came in for Mumbai by odisha player Shubham Sarangi who tapped the ball into his net itself. Mumbai got their lead in the 50th minute as Greg Stewart set up Lallianzuala Chhangte with a low cross and the in-form winger wiggled past a defender and got out a shot. Goal keeper Amrinder Singh saved the initial effort but the rebound was went into his own net by Shubham Sarangi to give Mumbai  the lead.
Odisha tried hard to find their equaliser but failed in it. Mumbai in the dying minutes of the game scored another as Bipin Singh gave them a 2-0 lead. 
Mumbai needed to learn from the opener and work on the weak links. The Islanders failed to hold on to its early lead and conceded two quick goals against Hyderabad in the previous games. Even though Mumbai’s relentless attack ensured that it managed to clinch a much-needed equaliser, the team management will have to ensure that it comes up with a Plan B for the home game. And it seemed Mumbai were capable enough today with the defence to maintain the lead. 
Mumbai need to keep their momentum with them as it might help them in the next matches of the tournament. Odisha needs to look into them on what went wrong with their attack and defence. Mumbai were awarded their deserving three points in the game and would now look to just escalate their position in the points table.
