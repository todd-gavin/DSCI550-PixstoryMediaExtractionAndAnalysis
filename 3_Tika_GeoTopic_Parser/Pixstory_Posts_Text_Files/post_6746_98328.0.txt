Communal clashes broke out during a Hanuman Jayanti procession on April 16 in New Delhi’s Jahangirpuri area. Following the violence, on April 20, North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) bulldozed several houses and shops in Jahangirpuri alleging encroachment. A gate of a mosque was also razed in the demolition drive. Prior to this, three temples were among the structures razed in an “encroachment drive” in Rajasthan’s Alwar, where the Congress party is in power. News18, Republic Bharat and Aaj Tak published false reports claiming that the Alwar demolition was carried out to “avenge” the removal of the masjid’s gate. Alt News’s fact-check on the false reportage can be read here.

In a show titled ‘News Ki Pathshala’, Times Now Navbharat similarly claimed that “Jahangirpuri’s bulldozing was avenged in Rajasthan”. It is worth noting that the Alwar district administration carried out the demolition of “encroachments” on April 17 and 18, whereas the bulldozing was carried out in Jahangirpuri on April 20. Anchor Sushant Sinha claimed that Bhanwari Devi’s home was razed down in Alwar, Rajasthan. However, no action was taken against the shop situated right next to it called ‘Zakir Khan Mattress’. Sinha accused the administration of discrimination along communal lines.

A clip of Times Now Navbharat’s broadcast is widespread on social media. The viral clip starts after the 8:49 mark in the broadcast. The channel has claimed that all the Hindu-owned shops surrounding ‘Zakir Khan Mattress’ were torn down. Bhanwar Pushpendra was reporting live from Alwar.

Retweeting Times Now Navbharat, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya alleged “communal profiling and targeted action” by the Ashok Gehlot government.

Alwar BJP MP Yogi Balaknath also tweeted the clip accusing the Congress-led government of unfairly siding with Muslims as it carried out the “anti-encroachment” demolition drive.
