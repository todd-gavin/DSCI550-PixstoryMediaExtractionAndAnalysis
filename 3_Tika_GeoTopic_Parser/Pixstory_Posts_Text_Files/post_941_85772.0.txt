Media organisations use random or systematic sampling methods -- usually based on votersâ€™ sentiment -- to predict election results before the vote-counting is done (which is set to be done on March 10 this year).
The reliability of exit polls depends on several factors ---sample size, geographical coverage and voters' statements. Usually, it's easy to predict the voters' mood when they exercise their franchise in clusters. However, when a section of people refuses to show their leanings pollsters get the numbers wrong. Thus, sometimes these post-poll surveys are right and at several instances, they had predicted the verdict of an election incorrectly.

*Exit Polls of 2012

In 2012, almost all the post-poll surveys had predicted a hung assembly with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party outperforming its rivals. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the BJP also were expected to perform better than the previous election but significantly short of the simple majority mark. However, when the final results came, the Samajwadi Party registered a landslide victory winning 2244 seats of the total 403. Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had managed to get 80. While BJP and Congress won 47 and 28 seats respectively.

*Exit Polls of 2017

In 2017, most of the exit polls were right as they had correctly predicted an absolute majority for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Driven by the Modi wave, the BJP had stormed to power in UP after 14 years, securing a three-fourths majority and demolishing rivals Samajwadi Party-Congress coalition and Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). While the BJP won 312 seats in the 403-member Assembly. Its allies Apna Dal(S) and SBSP had bagged nine seats and four seats, respectively, taking the total tally of the combine to 325. On the other hand, the SP has managed to get 47 seats while its ally the Congress got 7 seats. The BSP had registered victor on 19 seats, finishing a dismal third.
