You unintentionally send the message that you are entitled to anything if you don't express gratitude. People with extreme entitlement are viewed as the waste of space, and they truly are. Because of their victim mindset, they perceive any risk of pain as an assault on their freedom. Instead of taking responsibility for raising the bar on their own behaviour, they would point the finger at others for not doing enough. They even believe they are entitled to warnings that will reduce their danger of suffering so they won't have to be solely responsible for staying away from it.
By appreciating everything you have, practising thankfulness can help you relax. You might feel richer when you place a high value on even the little things in life. Being content without any inclinations toward materialism can bring happiness.
