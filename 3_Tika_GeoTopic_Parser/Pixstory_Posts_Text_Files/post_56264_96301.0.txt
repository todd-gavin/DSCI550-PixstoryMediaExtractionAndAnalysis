Spring has sprung, and even though it feels like spring is pretty much year-round in sunny L.A, there is something so special about exploring nature during this time of year. Flowers blooming, baby animals, seasonal allergies. What more could you ask for? So here are ten hiking spots to check out in the greater Los Angeles area as we roll into springtime.

1. Malibu Creek State Park
Looking for gorgeous views only minutes away from high-end shopping and exciting eats? Look no further than Malibu Creek State Park. Depending on which trail you take, the intensity varies.

2) Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
This park actually surrounds Malibu State Park, so if you’re feeling adventurous, you could make a whole day out of it and explore both. But be warned, it’s super dry up there so bring tons of water and loads of snacks (may I suggest cherry pop tarts?) A great resource to find trails tailored to your skill level is Alltrails. It’s like Yelp for hiking and biking, so you can read reviews from other mountaineers before you take on the trek yourself.

3. Silver Lake Reservoir Trail
This is the place for you if you don’t want to travel too far outside of L.A. The Reservoir Trail is a 2.2-mile loop, so it’s great for strolling and running alike. And it’s dog friendly, which is a huge plus.

4. Angeles National Forest
Only a 30-minute drive from downtown L.A., Angeles Nation Forest offers hikes varying in difficulty, gorgeous campgrounds and picnic areas, and breathtaking views. In January, I went on the Icehouse Canyon to Icehouse Saddle trail with my parents and absolutely loved it.

5. Joshua Tree National Park
Sprawling deserts, tumbleweeds, and relics of the wild west are only a 2-hour drive away from the city, making Joshua Tree National Park the perfect spot for a weekend getaway. My favorite part of the park is all the insane Doctor Suesian plants. Definitely Instagram-worthy.
