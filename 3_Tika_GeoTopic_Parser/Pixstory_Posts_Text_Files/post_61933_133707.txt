 We are all aware of that Sony Marvel deal over the rights of Spider Man but did you know that the former company had the chance of owning the superhero franchise The MCU has become not only one of the biggest franchises but also a successful one A lot of their films are box office hits Be it Avengers Endgame Spider Man No Way Home Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or more each has soared high commercially Not only that but Endgame is also the second highest grossing movie of all time But would it be the same if the rights to the comic book characters were with someone else and that someone else specifically was Sony It is said that the company had the chance of buying the rights to almost every Marvel character for million in However they only bought Spider Man for million As per The Wall Street Journal Sony Pictures executive Yair Landau thought that nobody gives a damn about the other Marvel characters That is a fine example of a true lapse of judgment But would the MCU be the same as it is now Besides the Tobey Maguire starrer Spider Man trilogy and Venom series the rest of the films based on the comic book characters have not worked well This includes Andrew Garfield s The Amazing Spider Man series and the box office flop Morbius Though the former has gained recognition over the years Fans have debated over the same and here is what they have to say about the MCU being under the banner of the Japanese production company They were correct mostly at the time and if they bought the rights it probably would have stayed that way a Reddit user wrote about the same Yeah Sony would ve sat on them and we wouldn t have got the MCU that we have today wrote a netizen They wouldn t have done anything worthwhile with that trove of characters MCU made most of them worth what they are today said a fan
