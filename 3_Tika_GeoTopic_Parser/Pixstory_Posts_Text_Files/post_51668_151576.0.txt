Man City destroyed Man United on Sunday at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League match.
Manchester City welcome Manchester United to the Etihad on Sunday afternoon.
Man City won the Manchester derby home and away last season and they ended the campaign as Premier League champions. 
Pep Guardiola's Dream team Manchester city have made an excellent start in their effort to defend the title and they are currently 2nd in the table.
The Blues have scored 23 goals in the Premier League, which is more than any other team, and their attack has been strengthened by the summer transfer of Erling Haaland, who Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez are expected to deal with.
United head into the Manchester derby with positive attitude under Erik ten Hag, as they have defeated Liverpool, Leicester, Southampton and Arsenal across their last four league fixtures, which has been a remarkable turnaround after an awful start.
John Stones has been ruled out of the game through injury while Marcus Rashford has been passed fit.
