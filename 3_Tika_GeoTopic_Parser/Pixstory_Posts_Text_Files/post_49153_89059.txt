It s not effective to teach boys that the premise of their identity is corrupt The term s use is likely to exacerbate gender tensions Teaching toxic masculinity according to one man I know is mental castration of men with the goal of creating a class of males obedient to Marxist feminist philosophy Another said it was women s stereotype of men and that he was resentful of being perceived in that way Lamenting toxic masculinity is the easiest method for women to condemn males as a group without openly blaming them However when women may hold all men responsible for the wrongdoings of another it maintains the oppressor victim paradigm that contributes to women s oppression in the first place You intimidate men by shaming them on a purely subjective scale which is exactly what the left and most feminists want they want to intimidate guys who go against the trend and reject the weak and neutered version of males that you see portrayed everywhere I believe that male antagonism is bad but I also recognise that it is not new Over the last years second and third wave feminists have bolstered a narrative that has become conventional wisdom males patriarchy and masculinity in general have been the source of women s suffering Women are socialized to blame men for everything that goes wrong in their lives In the end traditional masculinity has more positives than negatives for men why should they try to change it
