Fun day at different departments joyfully celebrating Teachers day on 5th of September. The craze of various events held by the students were top notch since we experienced this buzz after almost 3 years of pandemic and people almost forgot what student culture used to be in MSU. 
Events like dance, drama, karaoke, music, dumbsharades were arranged by students and although it seemed like we were vibing more than the professors but let's be honest, we cant be blamed either right? I mean 3 damn years and all the locked up creativity came flooded out today. 
Great day altogether!!
