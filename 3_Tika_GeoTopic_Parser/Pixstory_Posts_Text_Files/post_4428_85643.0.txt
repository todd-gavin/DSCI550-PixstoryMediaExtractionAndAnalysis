History was created at the recent Milan Fashion Week. 🥳



Avanti Nagrath has become the first Indian model to open the Versace show in Milan. The model from Delhi recently shared in an interview with ETimes that the model who opens the show is usually the one who leads the lineup, and for her to do it in the same show where supermodels including Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski also walked the ramp is truly a game-changer.


Avanti Nagrath said, "The feeling hasn't sunk in yet and I don't think it will, ever. Speaking to the Telegraph, Avanti shared “I’ve always wanted to be a model and my aspiration was to work with the big brands around world. So you could say I just kept chasing my dream.”


Bella Hadid, Vittoria (Ceretti), Gigi Hadid are Avanti’s favourite models. She also added “Being on time, long work hours and staying hydrated at all times!” has been her biggest learning from her modeling experience.
