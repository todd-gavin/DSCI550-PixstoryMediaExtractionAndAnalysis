The Italian giants, Juventus, have ended the season with a Champions League qualification for
the next season 2022/23 without the help of Cristiano Ronaldo. Massimiliano Allegri made his
comeback to the Italian giants at the start of the season after Andrea Pirlo left the managerial
reign. When people expected Bianconeri to struggle in the absence of the Portuguese talisman,
Juventus were able to achieve multiple heights despite not being their best season.

In the Serie A, Juventus were able to finish fourth on the points table with 70 points from 38
games. The team scored 57 goals in the 38 games and conceded 37 goals. The team ended
with a positive GD of 20 at the end of the season. In the Champions League, the team qualified
for the knockouts, whereas they lost the Coppa Italia finals to their arch-rivals Inter Milan.

Despite the absence of a clinical striker for the first half of the season, Massimiliano Allegri ran
the show with Alvaro Morata and Paulo Dybala.

The Spanish-Argentina pair accounted for 33.33% of the goals Bianconeri scored in 2021/22. Dusan Vlahovic arrived from Fiorentina and
was a success for the Italian giants. He scored seven goals for the side in a short stint of 12
starts.

Leonardo Bonucci and Matthijs de Ligt were key in the defense for the side, but the
former’s injury jeopardized the team’s top four chances.

However, the team was able to make comebacks in the crucial stage of the season to seal the spot comfortably.

Player of the Season:

The team did not have any single player who carried the team throughout the season.

Sometimes the goalkeeper carried the team, whereas in some the fullbacks and the midfielders
carried the game. Amongst the players, Matthijs de Ligt is the most appropriate choice for the
Player of the Season award. The former Ajax player has become the pillar of the Old Lady’s
defense. He also had three goals to his name and an assist in the Italian top-flight.
