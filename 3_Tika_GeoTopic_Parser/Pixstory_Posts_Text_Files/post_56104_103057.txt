No man is an island Entire of itself Every man is a piece of the continent A part of the main If a clod be washed away by the sea Europe is the less As well as if a promontory were As well as if a manor of thy friend s Or of thine own were Any man s death diminishes me Because I am involved in mankind And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls It tolls for thee John Donne s comparison of people to the continents is a strong remark on the anti isolation We have even seen the first line used during the Brexit debate We should feel a sense of belonging to the whole of the human race and should feel a sense of loss at every death because it has taken something away from mankind The other person s death is a reminder that we too will die one day The poem says that Nobody lives or exists alone and we are all part of something greater Each person is like a part of the mainland or a piece of a bigger continent rather than an island nation that is self sufficient and cut off from the rest The power of the passage is in the language Donne chooses to use In many ways it s a natural extension of his earlier metaphysical poetry which often solved a single idea thinking through the metaphor developing it taking it to its logical conclusion and occasionally deliberately taking it to absurd extremes
