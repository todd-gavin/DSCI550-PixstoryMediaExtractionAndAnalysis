Most of us know that WhatsApp allows us to send voice messages to our contacts. However, it is also significant to know that we can also send text messages to our contacts without even having to type them out. Yes, that’s right!
The dictation feature in WhatsApp allows us to dictate any text and the accuracy is pretty good. 

Here’s how to use the dictation feature on WhatsApp: 

1.  Open  the chat window of the person you want to send the message.

2. On your virtual keyboard, you will see a mic icon.

3. Once you tap on the mic icon, it will start recording whatever you speak. 

4. The dictated message will appear on your keyboard.

5. You can edit the same before sending the final message.

To all the people out there who feel lazy to type out lengthy messages, you guys are in luck!
