I once heard a fellow Christian say, "He sacrificed in order to serve. He served in order to sacrifice." And that is the absolute truth. Who, other than Jesus, could do that? He decided to die quietly, while everyone else was debating who was the greatest person in history. He prayed for His murderers, even the greatest saints have cursed their offenders but His kind heart didn't. He died for our sins. A merciless, painful death only for the greater good. Jesus had always been a staunch opponent of evil. When He strived against evil, He defeated all temptations to do evil. He exhibited through his life. He was a representative from heaven sent to reconnect us with the one who created us. He did everything in the name of love and through grace, even though no one deserved it. He arrived from the heavens. By preaching about God's Kingdom and providing them a glimpse of what it will achieve, he gave mankind real hope. There was no more hunger when he fed countless with a few loaves of bread and fish, and the dead rose again. Jesus Christ is undoubtedly the greatest man to ever live.
