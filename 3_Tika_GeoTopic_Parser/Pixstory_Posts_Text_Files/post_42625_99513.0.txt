Finally, the trailer of Adam Sandler’s new movie “Hustle” is out and one thing I want to say about the trailer is that the trailer will surely give you an adrenaline rush and the reason behind this is the story and background music of the trailer.

Hustle is the story of a coach who is struggling to become a successful coach in the Basketball league. One day he scouts a player from Spain and from here onwards the story of both the characters will begin.

Hustle will be released on June 8, 2022, only on Netflix. 

So, all the basketball lovers, Be Ready!!
