#5 Ben White
The England center-back had a turbulent debut against Brentford and was regarded waste of money when Arsenal made him their most expensive signing. But the player made a great redemption and has looked steady since under Arteta. 
White has settled greatly at Arsenal and is Arteta's most trusted player. He can play as center-back or right-back. In his two seasons, the youngster has appeared in 43 matches. 
#4 Gabriel Magalhaes
The Brazilian has been a positive part of the Arsenal team during their 2021/22 mediocre season. He possesses many great qualities and has turned up for big occasions. His outstanding performance saw him win three consecutive Arsenal Player of the Month awards.
Although there have been many bad performances, but the center-back has been persistent and looked comfortable for the Gunners. He has also dovetailed well with William Saliba. In his two seasons, Gabriel has made 77 appearances. 
#3 Thomas Vermaelen
During his 20s, Thomas Vermaelen was Europe one of the top defenders Arsenal had, and the player was also named in the PFA Team of the Year with his impressive display for the Gunners. Vermaelen's time at Arsenal has not been full of trophies, but the player had the best time in North London. 
He was later appointed club captain in 2012 and made 150 appearances for Arsenal, winning only FA Cup.
