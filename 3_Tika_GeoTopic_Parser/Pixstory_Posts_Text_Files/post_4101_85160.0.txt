Virgina Woolf is a modernist writer pioneered in stream of consciousness technique. She along with her intellectual friends formed Bloomsbury Group, a group wherein most important and revolutionary ideas were discussed. At the time when gender equality was barely discussed she was an outspoken advocate of feminism, anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism and a pacifist. Her 1938 book Three Guineas, was an accusation of fascism and what Woolf described as a recurring tendency among patriarchal societies to enforce repressive societal mores by violence.  Even before second world war or feminist waves she contended that women's experience, particularly in the women's movement, could be the basis for transformative social change. 

In her non-fiction essay, A Room's of One's Own, written in 1929, she writes, "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction." This is an open proclamation of financial as well as personal independence of a woman. During her time even in affluent families woman were discriminated from their siblings who are men and their only job was to find a person and marry. She argued to break the norms becoming an inspiration to many writers world wide. If we take the history of English Literature, their we're no woman for a long period of time. Women were not even allowed to write, if so they had to he under some pseudonym. She and the Bloomsbury group pave way for feminism to reach worldwide and became a inspiration to many writers.
