Thomas Tuchel might have found the perfect to his defence as he looks to add Brighton defender Marc Cucurella to his armoury.

football.london understands that Chelsea are close to a deal for the player with an offer of around £50m. The 24-year-old Spaniard has been on the club's radar for a while now and is rated by Tuchel for his versatility, with the options to play him as a left-sided centre-back, fullback, wingback and even winger.

This could leave Tuchel with a plethora of options in defence with Ben Chilwell and Reece James the first choice wingbacks but a transition to a back four could also be considered.

n a surprise announcement, Chelsea revealed that they had agreed a deal to sign Aston Villa and England U19 starlet Carney Chukwuemeka for £20m.

The midfielder will now undergo a medical in London as Tuchel bolsters his short-term and long-term options in the centre of the park.

The Blues managed to fight off competition from Barcelona and other top European clubs to secure the player of the tournament at the U19 European Championships earlier this year.
