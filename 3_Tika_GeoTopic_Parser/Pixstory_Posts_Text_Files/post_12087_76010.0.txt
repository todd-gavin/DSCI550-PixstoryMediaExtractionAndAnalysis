Boris Johnson is under renewed pressure after Downing Street admitted staff gathered inside No 10 during the first Covid lockdown to mark his birthday.
ITV News reported that up to 30 people attended the June 2020 event, sang Happy Birthday and were served cake.

No 10 said staff had "gathered briefly" to "wish the prime minister a happy birthday", adding that he had been there "for less than 10 minutes".

But a number of MPs have expressed criticism over this latest revelation.

Rules at the time - on 19 June 2020 - banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people.

ITV News said the birthday event had taken place in the Cabinet Room just after 14:00 BST that day, adding that it had been arranged as a surprise for Mr Johnson by his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, after he returned from an official trip to a school in Hertfordshire.

As well as No 10 staff, the interior designer Lulu Lytle attended, having been in Downing Street working on the refurbishment of the PM's flat.

And a source told the BBC that Chancellor Rishi Sunak was also in the room, but had arrived at the end to attend a meeting, rather than being invited.

Environment Secretary George Eustice denied ITV's claim that 30 people had gathered in the Cabinet Room, saying the number of staff present was "closer to 10" and it "was literally just a birthday cake brought in at the end of the day".

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, whose father was in hospital for four months during the pandemic, also denied as many as 30 had been present, telling BBC Breakfast the group had been working together all day.

He later told told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the gathering had been organised by the PM's office, rather than Mrs Johnson, but it had been "unwise given the circumstances
