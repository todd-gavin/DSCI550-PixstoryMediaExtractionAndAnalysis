Russia said on Tuesday that it has started a new stage of its 'special military operation' in Ukraine and intends to "completely liberate" the territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.

The announcement was made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had stated during his overnight video address that the "battle for Donbas" had begun.

"It can now be stated that Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time. A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive," said Zelenskyy.
