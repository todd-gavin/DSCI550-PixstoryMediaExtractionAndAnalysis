Budshah Tomb, also spelled as Badshah Tomb, is the final resting place of the mother of Sultan Zain-Ul-Abidin [1420Û° AD to 1470 AD].  During Sultan Zain-Ul-Abidin's rule and lifetime in Kashmir, which lasted for more than 50 years in the late th century AD and was renowned as one of the most tranquil and prosperous eras, his people affectionately and lovingly referred to him as the "Badshah." The Budshah Tomb is a superb example of the traditional Shahmiri architectural brilliance that has not yet been discovered anywhere in India. Near Zaina Kadal in Srinagar, on the right riverside of the River Jhelum, is the monument or memorial place. In comparison to other historic buildings and tombs, Budshah Tomb is therefore regarded as the only one of its kind in and around Kashmir. This Tomb is a brick structure in contrast to the conventional wooden Shahmiri architecture seen in Kashmir because it was built with bricks rather than wood during that period. With Shah Mir's migration from Central Asia to India in the middle of the 14th century, the Muslim dynasty was established. He played a key role in the establishment of this dynasty, and other successors, including Sultan Sikandar, followed. Due to traditional Muslim beliefs and in accordance with customary ceremonies, rites, and rituals, Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin devotedly had the Tomb of his mother, also known as the Budshah Tomb, created close to the Jhelum water basin.
