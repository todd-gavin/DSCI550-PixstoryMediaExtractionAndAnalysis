Lionel Messi could be in line for a sensational return to Barcelona after enduring a torrid time at Paris Saint-Germain.

The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner ended his long-standing, trophy-laden stint with the Blaugrana after the expiration of his contract on June 30.

He had agreed a pay cut to stay on at the financially stricken club, but Messi's new contract was not accepted by La Liga and he ultimately left for PSG on a free transfer.

Messi joined a dream attack consisting of Kylian Mbappe and his former teammate Neymar but the Argentine talisman has struggled in the French capital, managing a measly seven goals for his new team.

Both he and Neymar were booed in PSG's 3-0 win over Bordeaux following the team's elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid

And according to a fresh report from journalist Gerard Romero, Messi's father and agent, Jorge, has been in touch with Barcelona regarding a possible return.

Details are scarce but there have been plenty of reports in recent times indicating that Messi is not happy at PSG and regrets leaving Barcelona.

His farewell press conference saw Messi break down in tears as he explained why he was departing.

He recently headed back to Catalonia and had dinner with former teammate and current Barca boss Xavi Hernandez.

Messi joined Barcelona from Newell's Old Boys as a 13-year-old and went to become the club's record goalscorer and greatest ever player.

In 778 games for the first-team, Messi scored 672 goals and registered 305 assists for Barcelona since making his debut in October 2004 against rivals Espanyol.
