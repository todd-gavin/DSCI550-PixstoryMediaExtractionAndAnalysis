Hereâ€™s debunking a few unpopular fitness truths:  

If you don't take rest days, you're gonna either injure yourself or suffer from burnout.
Sure, take leisurely walks on rest days, but don't walk so quickly that you turn it Into a cardio workout.

HIIT isn't suitable for beginners. First, beginners don't have the necessary aerobic base needed to work at high intensity.
And second, they haven't yet learned safe exercise technique.

Combine a lack of aerobic base with a lack of knowing how to perform exercises safely, and there's gonna be an injury - especially in one of those boot camp style classes.

Fitness trackers are wrong. All of them. They tend to overestimate how many calories your burn. So stop relying on that information, and stop eating exercise calories.
