According to a number of reports, feeding free food to workers can put a significant strain on a company's operating expenses. This may have a negative influence on the overall performance of companies who provide free lunch to all of their workers.

In recent years, it has become quite costly to deal with. The majority of businesses are said to be spending millions of dollars annually on offering free lunch to their workers if it were to come to that. As a result, organisations may find it difficult to balance all of their expenses in a timely manner, perhaps resulting in a cash shortfall.

The availability of a wide variety of delectable free meals and snacks at work can lead to mindless eating and, as a result, an increase in employee greed.

Companies who use the concept of offering free food to workers as a working strategy should be aware that the majority of workers may begin to take unfair advantage of the situation. They may begin to consume an excessive amount of goodies or even begin discreetly transporting them back to their homes.

This might eventually lead to a tense work climate, which can negatively impact a company's overall performance.

So according to me, workers should earn the food and nor just get it for free. There would br exceptions of course. At most, if companies do provide them free food, ir should come with regulations.
