Rayo Vallecano defeats second positioned Barca for a single goal scored in the starting minutes of the game. All three losses happened at home Camp Nou. 



This Barca is surprising to all. After 10 undefeated matches, including a 4-0 win over Real Madrid in El Clasico, they lost again in La liga against 11th positioned Rayo Vallecano. On 15th April, they were defeated at home in the Europa league quarter final by German club Eintracht Frankfurt for a score of 2-3. After 4 days, 17th positioned Cadiz scored 1 goal to which Barca didn't have a reply and lost all three points. Before today's match, they had defeated Real Sociedad by the same score, thanks to the goal by Aubameyang. 


The decisive goal came in the 7th minute of the match. Palazon created the chance with a marvelous through ball after cutting Jordi Alba, which Alvaro Garcia put into the net with a low strike. 


After a bad first half, Barca tried hard to level and win the match. Gavi's shot after a corner clearance hit the inside of the bar but didn't go in. Later in the second half, Depay's shot was blocked excellently by Maras, which could have gone in easily otherwise. In the 89th minute, Catena fouled Gavi in the box. Barca players were desperately screaming for a penalty and Dembele also got booked in the process. But, replays said Gavi was offside before foul, and was denied. Pathe Ismail Ciss's 20 yard shot went off the post in the injury time. Dembele got a last opportunity to save the match for Barca, as Vallecano keeper Dimitrievski lost a free kick from Depay inside the box, which fell for Dembele, and shot was blocked by Ciss. 


Sevilla is also having 63 points from 33 matches after defeating Levante for a thrilling 3-2 on 21st. 4th placed Atletico Madrid have 61 points. Top placed Real Madrid have 78 points, after their 3-1 win over Osasuna. As we enter into the final month of the league, Barca's fixtures look easy, starting with Mallorca on 2nd May at Camp Nou.
