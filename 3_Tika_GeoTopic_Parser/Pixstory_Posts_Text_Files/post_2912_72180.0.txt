Once someone is convicted, you expect a sentence, maybe even an option to choose between two kinds of sentencing. But can being asked to join the military one of them? That’s the choice Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate gave to a former Kentucky jail guard, 28-year-old Brandon Scott Price, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a female inmate. (The other option given is jail.)

“If you don’t enroll in 30 days, you can report to the Franklin County Regional Jail. You are under the gun, young man. You gotta do it. You’re getting a huge break,” the judge said: https://www.state-journal.com/crime/former-fcrj-guard-sentenced-for-sexual-assault-on-female-inmate/article_e8d7f396-6fde-11ec-ba24-f75541ce076a.html

That is rather surprising. Price previously served in the army, and that might have been the reason for the unusual choice. His lawyer said it is “very typical” in Franklin County, and a number of other counties in Kentucky, for judges to include terms of probation which are specific to the individual before them. 

Still, offering an option of military service is rare as part of a probated sentencing. Jails are getting overcrowded. Therefore, considering some other form of punishment that can serve correctional purposes might have prompted the judge (who did not reveal his reasoning).

The trouble is, the military won’t accept those convicted of sexual assault. An army spokesman said in a statement: “Any applicant who received a conviction for a sex offense is not eligible for enlistment or appointment. No waivers are authorized.” 

Army Regulation 610-210:

The lawyer said Price had started the process of reenlisting, but he might be rejected, after all, and may spend time behind bars. (No update was available after the Jan 7 sentencing.) 

Yet, the probation terms are debatable indeed. Is joining the army seen as a kind of punishment or a penance and service to society? If it is putting a convict to ‘good use’ for the nation, then military authorities should review their ban and indeed create separate facilities where convicts can chip in and shoulder duties. (A senator proposed that in a bill just last month: https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/florida/os-ne-florida-lawmakers-discuss-military-duty-replacing-jail-time-20211222-zdchwebrpjfe5cjkbypjpqpwcm-story.html

The victim, meanwhile, may see this alternative as an unfair, easy way out for the perpetrator: https://jezebel.com/illinois-judge-reverses-conviction-of-18-year-old-rapis-1848344571
