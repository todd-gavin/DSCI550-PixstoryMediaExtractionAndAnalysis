Rahul Gandhi, a former leader of the Congress, claimed on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is only able to hear his "friends' voices and cannot hear what the people of the country desire. 
He made this statement a day after the government increased the maximum age restriction for recruitment under "Agnipath" from 21 to 23 years old, amidst young protests against the programme across the nation. 

Mr. Gandhi also mentioned programmes like the GST, noteban, farm legislation, and the current Agnipath, claiming that although they were marketed as being for the sake of the populace, the general public rejected them.
