The Olympic bronze medalist Bajrang Punia (65 kg) was eliminated from contention for the gold medal on Saturday after an unexpected quarterfinal loss, while Sagar Jaglan will compete for bronze in the 74 kg division at the Wrestling World Championships in Belgrade. Two-time Commonwealth Games champion Bajrang was defeated by American Yianni Diakomihalis, 23, in the 65kg quarterfinal match with a score of 10-0 technical victory. The 28-year-old Indian, who already has three medals from the World Championships, will now be hoping that the two-time cadet world champion Diakomihalis makes it to the final so he may compete for a bronze medal via repechage.
Alejandro Enrique Valdes Tobier of Cuba had earlier been defeated by Bajrang on points (5-4) in the preliminary round.
The 18-year-old Jaglan, on the other hand, advanced in his pursuit of a bronze medal at 74 kg by defeating Mangolian Suldkhuu Olonbayar 7-3.
Later on in the day, the Iranian Yones Aliakbar Emamichoghaei will square off against the bronze-medal winner from the World Under-20 competition.
Vicky was defeated 2-2 by Switzerland's Samuel Scherrer in the 97 kg qualification round. Along with Pankaj (61 kg), who lost to Assyl Aitakyn of Kazakhstan in the initial round, he was eliminated from medal contention.
