Faith is that road beneath your feet that you cannot see in the dark, but you're still supported by it. 

Faith saves us from many things, that we aren't even aware about. Faith has many forms, the one OP is talking about, is faith in the God, but you can also have faith in your fellow humans, your friends and family, your pet, hell you can even and should have faith in yourself. 

Faith is the proof of the things we do not see. Faith goes a long way, always have faith
