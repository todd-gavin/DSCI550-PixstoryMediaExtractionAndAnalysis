37 years young, with not an indefinite amount of time or options at his disposal anymore,
Cristiano Ronaldo has decisions to make in the coming time. His move to Manchester United
last summer was lauded by true football romantics, but anyone who saw logic was quick to
take note of the many possible ways it could go wrong.

With time, It's become increasingly clear that United are not the Formidable force most
would've hoped for. With or without a decent manager, the team lacks what it takes for a side
to compete for the Premier league's top 4-5 spots. Missing out on Champions League
football is now almost an overwhelming reality, unless we witness an incredible downfall on
behalf of United's rivals.

You see where this is going. Without Champions League football, Cristiano is unlikely to
remain in Manchester much longer. Former United winger Gareth Crooks believes It's time
for Ronaldo to bid adieu to European football altogether.

"I am a huge admirer of Ronaldo. His professionalism is beyond reproach and he has more
than fulfilled the expectations required of a 37-year-old player in the toughest league in the
world. However, he is still a young man who needs a purpose in life."

Garth remarked on a possible reunion with David Beckham, but fans know that the
Portuguese isn't too keen on straying away from the clenches of European football. It's what
keeps him going really, his drive and spirit can be attributed to the fact that he does it on the
biggest stage there is, and consistently so.

"The United States might be the place to establish that purpose. David Beckham and
Ronaldo would make a formidable partnership in Miami."

Lionel Messi's name was also in the papers not long ago, linking him to a similar move away
from PSG. Luring one or both of the game's two biggest names with a chunk load of cash
may not be out of question for Beckham's franchise, as per Crooks.
