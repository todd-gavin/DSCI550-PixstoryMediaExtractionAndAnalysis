I'm surprised people still think our education system works in favor of the children. Well, bursting your bubble, it does not. It couldn't care less about the children, it works for the capitalist baddies. It works in favor of providing them with race horses that could give them the money while those kids stay overworked, overstressed and underpaid throughout their lives.

There has been no empirical studies that proves homework help kids become better. However, there have been studies that tell how much against children it is. It puts undue pressure on them.

To address your concern about how the entire syllabus would be covered in school if students weren't put through that misery, I think it's worth noting that if teachers can't teach something in due time, students shouldn't be expected to do it in that time either.

You say that kids can work through that pressure, but another fact is that they can't. They don't get to sleep or eat properly. No child should be up till midnight just making sure they aren't reprimanded the next day for not being able to do the homework. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds, and a lot of it comes from the stress which schools either cause or add to. Hundreds of kids losing their lives every year is not "working through it."

Homework is the norm, so even when kids do find themselves in depressing situations because of it, they have to convince themselves that something is wrong with them, not the system.

You say kids learn their strengths and weaknesses through homework. But then what? Are they helped with their weaknesses? No! They are punished for it.

Homework, much like any other part of this system, is just powerplay. You do the homework, listen to the instructor, you're a good child. You fail to do it, you get punished.
