During a televised discussion at which Vice President Kamala Harris participated she and the other participants introduced themselves in a very unusual manner Each participant introduced themselves by providing their name pronouns the fact that they were seated at the table and a description of their attire So when Harris time came she said I am Kamala Harris my pronouns are she and her and I am a woman sitting at the table wearing a blue suit This bizarre spectacle drew ridicule online and a great deal of media attention particularly from the right which demonstrated how the culture of the extreme left has produced outcomes that seem to be from a dystopian fiction Yet proponents of these actions lauded them for enabling handicapped individuals particularly the blind and visually impaired to visualize events in more detail We have reached a stage where inclusion has been prioritized above rationality I understand the reasoning behind it and have empathy for individuals who need these sorts of descriptive statements Obviously they are only words they do no damage to anybody However the ridiculousness of the scenario demonstrates just how far international leaders will go to appease their supporters The far left controls the Democrats but the extreme right is nowhere near close to dominating controlling the Republicans If this were true Republican legislators would be blatantly vile racists though the extreme left would have you believe that they already are However it is quite clear that the far left has gained control of the Democratic Party almost every Democrat politician must walk on eggshells with every sentence they utter in order to fulfill the demands of the woke mob which is ready willing and able to cancel them for seemingly innocuous statements
