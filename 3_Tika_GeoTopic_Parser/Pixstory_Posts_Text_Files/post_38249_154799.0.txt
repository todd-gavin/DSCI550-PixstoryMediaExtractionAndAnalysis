Kylian Mbappe recently signed a new two-year deal with Paris Saint Germain. However, reports originating from the French capital now claim that the forward is looking to leave the club after the World Cup later this year. 
As per ESPN, the French forward is pushing for an exit after the relationship between the club and the player has broken down in the last few days. Mbappe reportedly does not enjoy a really good friendship with Messi and Neymar and this was evident in PSG's 1-1 draw against Benfica on Tuesday. 
Mbappe scored the penalty and celebrated with his teammates however Neymar was not very enthusiastic and barely took part in the celebrations. Earlier reports claimed that the Frenchman feels Messi and Neymar's close relationship has made the dressing room turn away from him. 
However, PSG official Luis Campos was quick to silence the rumours that broke before the UCL game. Talking to the media, Campos said, "I am very surprised because I spend all my days with Kylian Mbappe, and he never once asked me or the president to leave in January," Campos told RMC Sport.
"We have to be very clear that this isn't a declaration -- it is news that has come out a few hours before a very important match against Benfica."
PSG or Mbappe's attorneys are yet to make an official statement on the topic.
