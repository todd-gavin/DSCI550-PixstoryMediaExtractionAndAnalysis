According to various transfer reports, at least four La Liga clubs are interested in Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani. 

The veteran striker is set to leave Manchester United next month, marking the end of his contract. El Chiringuito's Josep Pedrerol reported that Cavani's entourage have spoken with Atlético de Madrid, Villarreal and Sevilla. 

With these four reportedly interested in Cavani, it seems the striker will continue playing in Europe. Cavani is coming off the back of a very disappointing campaign, scoring only 2 goals in the season. However, the striker still provides valuable leadership and guidance to young sides and can mentor young strikers. 

However, the striker has been plagued with fitness issues and any club bringing in onboard must account for the same. He made only 15 appearances for Manchester United last season, out of which 7 were starts. 

Fans still remember his first year at Manchester United fondly, with potential new clubs hoping that he could replicate the same heights for them.
