Real Madrid star Karim Benzema has revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure paved a way for him to adopt a different style of play at the club. 

Ronaldo plied his trade with the Los Blancos for nine seasons becoming the club’s all-time leading goalscorer   before moving to Juventus in 2018. He was in the catbird-seat during his sojourn at the Spanish capital while other players including Benzema were in the shadows. 

However, since the Portuguese’s exit, the French international has bursted into limelight as he his widely touted to win the Ballon D’or this year owing to his scintillating performances in recent years that saw him stir the Spanish giants to a record 14th Champions League glory in the just concluded campaign.

Speaking at the press conference ahead of Wednesday’s UEFA Super Cup clash between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt, Benzema said; 

“It’s true I’ve scored more goals but when CR7 was here we had a different style. 

I provided more assists and he helped me on and off the pitch. I knew I could do more [at the time] and when he left it was the time to change my game and ambitions, I’m doing that at the moment.”

Benzema scored 15 goals in the Champions League last season en route to Madrid’s success in the competition last season with Ronaldo being the only player to have scored more in a single campaign in the competition.
