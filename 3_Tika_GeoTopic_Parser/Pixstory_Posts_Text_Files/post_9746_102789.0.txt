Men’s Mental Health Awareness: The Factors of Mental Health Disorders in Men

Triggers in men vs. women mental health disorders can be vastly different. Men often develop mental health issues due to traditional gender roles and societal expectations. These factors often lead men to believe:

They must display “masculine” traits such as strength and control

Must be the breadwinner

They should rely on themselves, not others

They have to hide their emotions

Unfortunately, these traditional beliefs encourage the male mental health stigma and stop men from seeking much-needed treatment.

How the Male Mental Health Stigma Affects Treatment

Men who struggle with mental health issues such as depression or substance use disorders are less likely to seek treatment. According to Mental Health America, men don’t seek treatment due to the social norms going against them doing so. Men also don’t seek treatment because they want to downplay their symptoms. Men are also often reluctant to talk to someone.

The stigma between men vs. women mental health issues results in only 1 in 4 men seeking professional help, while as many as 1 in 3 men take medications for depression or anxiety.
