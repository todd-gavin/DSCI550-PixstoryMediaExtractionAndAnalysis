We all want to make good habits, whether it’s in business, in our hobbies, or in our personal lives. One popular method to build habits is called the 21/90 rule. The rule is simple enough.

Commit to a personal or professional goal for 21 straight days. After three weeks, the pursuit of that goal should have become a habit. Once you’ve established that habit, you continue to do it for another ninety days. If you can keep up something for three weeks and then ninety days, then it should become a permanent lifestyle change.

Here are some potential goals to pursue with the 21/90 rule.

Staying Positive Every Day

One thing that many of us have difficulty with is remaining positive. There is one way to stay focused, however. Find one notable positive thing in every day and write it down.

Find three things in your life that you feel need the most help. Focus on one at a time.

Find a task that brings you joy for just five minutes a day

We all need an escape, but it needs to be short and sweet enough that it doesn’t take away from our other pursuits and responsibilities. So try and find something that takes you only five minutes or maybe ten minutes each day, but that is something you can look forward to each and every day.
