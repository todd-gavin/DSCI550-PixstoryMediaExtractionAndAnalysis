Structured Abstract 

Background 

The use of exogenous insulin exposes the patients to sharps (insulin pen needles and lancets). Improper sharps disposal increases the risk of transmitting diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Human Immunodeficiency Virus and other blood borne diseases. 

Aims 

To assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of sharp disposal among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in the Northern Peninsular of Malaysia. 

Methods 

A self-administered, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study was conducted at nine health clinics in the three Northern Peninsular Malaysia states. This study (NMRR-20-1757-56045 IIR) was approved by Medical Research and Ethics Committee, Malaysia. 

Results 

A total of 312 subjects were recruited in this study. The majority (46.15%) of the subjects had moderate knowledge regarding sharps disposal ranging from 60% to 70% of the knowledge score. The majority (59.60%) of the subjects had a positive attitude towards proper sharps disposal and 13.30% of the subjects had a strongly positive attitude. Sharps disposal practices among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were poor since only two subjects reported correctly disposing of their used sharps. 

Conclusion 

The study showed that the majority of the subjects had moderate knowledge, a positive attitude and poor sharp disposal practice.
