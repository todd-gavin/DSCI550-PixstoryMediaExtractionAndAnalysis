Russian military have taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser. 

He stated that it's preposterous to suggest the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a Russian strike that was completely meaningless.

"This is one of Europe's most severe threats today," added Podolyak. 

This comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russian forces were attempting to take the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

Zelenskyy said on twitter that Ukranian defenders are dedicating their lives to ensure that the tragedy of 1986 does not repeat again. He added, "This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe ." 

The nuclear power station, which was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, is located 130 kilometres north of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.
