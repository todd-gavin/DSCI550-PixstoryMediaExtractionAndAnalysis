The lingering gender inequalities have always hindered the growth of women in many aspects of life Besides many claims that men could be better managers because they have the potential to do it but women have always proved it wrong This idea is a fallacy even research has proven that women could be the best managers This is because they have the capability to handle things rather more sensibly but at the same time pragmatically Since the patriarchal society has always inflicted women differently they have found ways to prove and wrong the opinions of people who think they aren t capable of some tasks This infliction and torture have made them more mature and revolutionized as a human Nevertheless mentioning the above point was necessary to state why women are the best leaders and managers They have abundant reserves of patience The most important quality you need when you re foisted upon by the duty to handle the whole company While men are not such a connoisseur when it comes to dealing with patience women managers tend to focus on the personal development of every single member of the team rather than looking at the team s growth and denying the choices and growth of individuals who lack at specific points Apart from this women are always good listeners and never have the knack of dominating or believing that what they say is correct which men often do Being the victims of inequality for a long time they understand how important it is to listen to everyone equally Moreover other qualities that make them the best manager is that they are more empathetic great communicators more organized and often tend to appreciate good work frequently instead of refraining from uttering kind words like men So all said and done women are connoisseurs in this art of managing it could be their family or a whole company they know how to do it correctly
