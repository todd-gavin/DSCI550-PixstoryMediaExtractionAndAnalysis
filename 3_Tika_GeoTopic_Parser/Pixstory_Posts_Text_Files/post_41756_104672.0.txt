It was intended to instil some much-needed confidence and unity in the Socceroos before of their World Cup playoff against the UAE on Wednesday. 

Fox News reported that despite  a lucky 2-1 victory in Doha, Australia's final warm-up encounter against Jordan ahead of the do-or-die qualifying fight was a harsh reality check for the struggling Socceroos. 

With a new-look Socceroos team including rookie Kye Rowles at centre-back and Jason Davidson returning for the first time since 2015, the issues that had caused Australia to win only one of their previous seven matches resurfaced. 

The Socceroos either lacked vision and inventiveness or were technically incapable of executing their plans. Australia appeared to be tame in possession, unable to put Jordan's defence under any meaningful pressure in open play or move the ball up the field from deep positions. 

In a nutshell, it represented the apex of the Socceroos' problems in recent months â€“ if not the summation of the team's problems for the past decade or more. 

"There's still a lot of work to be done," Arnold said, but he called it a "great game" for preparing for the exam next week.
