After the highly anticipated Netflix film Purple Hearts debuted on Friday, netizens have been discussing the relationship between Cassie and Luke on social media. The movie, which is directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum, stars Kendall Chappell, Chosen Jacobs, Sofia Carson, and Nicholas Galitzine as the two main protagonists who end up falling in love.

The official plot synopsis for the film states that despite their many differences, "Luke (Nicholas Galitzine), a troubled soldier, and Cassie (Sofia Carson), a failing singer-songwriter, agree to get married solely for military reasons."

When tragedy hits, the distinction between reality and pretence disappears. The movie was not well received by critics, who also thought it was cheesy. However, the corny and sentimental tone that the picture had was adored by the audience.
