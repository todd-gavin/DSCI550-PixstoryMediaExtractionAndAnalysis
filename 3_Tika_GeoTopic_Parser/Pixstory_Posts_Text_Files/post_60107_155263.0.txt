In Gurugram, a MOB of at least 200 individuals raided a mosque and assaulted the worshippers.
The police have taken a report in relation to the Wednesday night incident. However, nobody was taken into custody until Thursday night.
The accused allegedly broke into the mosque early on Thursday, assaulted attendees, thrashed them, closed the mosque from the outside, and then fled.
According to a complaint made by Subedar Najar Mohammad, there are just four homes for Muslim families in the village of Bhora Kalan. He added that the altercation started on Wednesday morning when a mob of about 200 people, allegedly led by Rajesh Chauhan alias Babu, Anil Bhadoria, and Sanjay Vyas, surrounded the mosque and went into the prayer room where they threatened to drive the namazis out of the area.
Following Mohammad's complaint, a FIR was filed at the Bilaspur Police Station under the IPC's rioting, attempting to incite religious conflict, and illegal assembly provisions against Rajesh Chauhan, Anil Bhadoria, Sanjay Vyas, and a number of other individuals.
The police also said that a squad had been sent out to keep the calm and prevent any clashes.
