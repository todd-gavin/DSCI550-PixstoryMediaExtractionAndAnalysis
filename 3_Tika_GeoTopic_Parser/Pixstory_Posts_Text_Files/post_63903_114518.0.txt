 
The events in One Punch manga are heating up. As the Garou arc is reaching its climax, we have seen a bunch of exciting developments, making the manga a significantly different experience from the webcomic. For one, we have now finally seen the S class rank 1 hero Blast, as well as his powers.
 
As of now Garou, who has evolved into a demonic entity has gained a significant boost in power from a mysterious evil cosmic entity, is now fighting Saitama, and is surprisingly able to hold his own. This is a dramatic shift in the fight from the way it was done in the webcomic.
 
With the launch of Chapter 167 under artist Yusuke Murata this week, we see Saitama continue his fight with Garou, who is no longer messing around, so if you want to see the Caped Baldy’s dark side, here it is.
 
The thrill of an exciting battle alone is able to make Saitama a scary presence, but making the invincible hero fight at his actual strength is a downright scary prospect, particularly when he is angry and no longer in a mood to mess around anymore. Things are now turning nuclear in One Punch Man in the coolest fight of the series since Saitama’s fight with Boros. What will happen now is anyone’s guess except for the fact that Saitama is going to mop the floor, though how, it remains to be seen.
