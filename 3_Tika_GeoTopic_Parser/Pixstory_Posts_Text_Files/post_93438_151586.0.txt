Laila Majnu is a classic tale of a tragic love story wherein the lover and his beloved never make it to a successful marriage owing to the disparity between their families. It’s a story that has been told and adapted repeatedly in different art forms including theatre and cinema, but there is something about Sajid Ali’s approach to this story that makes Laila Majnu one of the best romantic movies I have ever watched. The way the movie takes the romance to a spiritual level, where Laila, the love of Qais’s life becomes La – Illah (God) for him and is present with him even after being separated from him, makes the film unique. The cinematography is focussed on capturing reality and not just making the film aesthetic. Shot in “the heaven of earth,” the valleys of Kashmir make the film a visual delight, but in the scenes where Qais is being captured as a lunatic, he is presented as one, ungroomed and injured. The screenplay and acting is no less, the expressions speak louder than the words and the mood setting is also perfect. The music in the movie is like cherry on top of the cake, in fact the track ‘o meri laila’ has been trending on social media for a while now which has helped the film gain more traction over ott platform Zee 5, almost 4 years after its release. All in all, I recommend watching this classic tale retold beautifully online at least once.
