Kal ho na ho My Favourite The Romcom movie revolving around A Story of a Lifetime In a Heartbeat When it wasn t parroting a toxic positivity chorus of just be happy in the face of life s complex challenges the movie wanted you to believe that walking down the aisle with a grief stricken bride in love with your dying best friend was a good thing Actually Love may overcome all odds of our lives A girl with no clue of love finally falls into love with the most unexpected person of her life And that same love of her making all the efforts to make her love her bestfriend Rohit Due to medical conditions he decided to take up one last project up in his life making Naina fall in love with Rohit Because in this film agar tum meri nahi ho sakti to kisi aur ki toh ho sakti ho said by aman That days scheme of getting ladki in by Aman finally got successful And ending was as emotional as it cann Aman finally completing his last project keeping his promise of giving Naina to Rohit foreverrr and passes awayy P s movie might bring storm of tears in your eyes
