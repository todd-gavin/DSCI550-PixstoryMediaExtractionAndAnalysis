This is also called a surrogacy theory I read it once when I came across these lingering and vague ideas that suggest horror movies are a big saviour Surrogacy theory tells us that horror films allow us in a way to control our fear of death by giving us a surrogate experience this surrogate experience with the movies is tantamount to exposure therapy in which a patient is presented with stressors in a controlled environment to reduce their impact over time This genre has the ability to promote empathy and makes us know that we can face all the vicious monsters of our real life Most importantly the theory of feeling safe in a negative situation is a big relief because there you calm yourself by actually getting acquainted with the situation Although there this genre has faced much criticism from being a perpetrator of sadism to harming people s minds But besides all the lesser known facts horror movies are therapeutic and we all know that If this had not been the case then the making of horror movies would have long ceased and been banned
