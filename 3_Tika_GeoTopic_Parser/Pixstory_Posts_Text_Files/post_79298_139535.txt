Sport is a matter of perspective and opinions One coach might see a footballer as a central midfielder and another see this same player as an inverted full back Who is correct They both can be that s the beauty of sport The current state of social media wouldn t suggest this though If you tweet or post an unpopular opinion you can be met with a barrage of disagreement and abuse which often turns personal The lack of accountability on mainstream social media apps means it s all too easy to behave in this manner and get away with it As someone with a fairly large platform myself I have experienced this abuse firsthand and it s often made me shy away from speaking about other clubs business out of fear that tribalism will lead to me facing more Obviously that s not how things should be Speaking about another team shouldn t be seen as obsessed but rather just someone who wants to talk about all things football which I love to do At times this can even extend inside what you d assume as your own safe circle in my case speaking about Arsenal During the clubs harder recent period in which I stuck behind the manager this led to probably the worst abuse I d ever faced As a result of all of this I was delighted when I heard about Pixstory partnering with Arsenal with ambitions to make social media a safe space for all The app feels like an area in which I can offer my perspective on things and interact with others in a respectful manner In a time where social media has been seen to cause serious harm to people s mental health this is more relevant than ever I look forward to seeing the continued growth of the app and how it is able to change the landscape of people s online behaviour on social media
