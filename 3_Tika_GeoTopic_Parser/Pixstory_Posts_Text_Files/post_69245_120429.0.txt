A second Heart Center has been established by the Gauri Kaul Foundation in the Kashmir Valley to accommodate the growing number of patients with blood pressure and diabetes. 
The new facility, known as the Prasad Joo Khan Heart Center, was established in the Haal hamlet of South Kashmir's Pulwama area as part of the foundation's "No Heart Attack" campaign. 
In Kashmir, this is the third heart centre run by the Gauri Kaul Foundation, and it is the only one in the private sector in South Kashmir. A heart centre has already been established by the organisation in Srinagar's Chanapora neighbourhood and at Machil bordering the LOC. 
A year and a half ago, renowned interventional cardiologist Dr. Upendra Kaul founded the foundation in honour of her mother, Gauri Kaul Khan.
In an interview at the center's inauguration ceremony, Dr. Upendra Kaul, the founder director of Prasad Joo Khan Heart Centre and a well-known interventional cardiologist, said that the prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes in Kashmir valley is about 15% and 45%, respectively . 
Dr. Kaul remarked, "This is a scary condition, thus we need to have a facility to deal with this circumstance." He added in earlier days he used to visit places for awareness but simply raising public awareness of the problem was insufficient. 
He also mentioned that the UMEED foundation supported them and that they had approached ONGC about a CSR grant on their behalf. 
They have already worked together, according to ONGC Managing Director, Alka Mittal.
