My hopelessness was accompanied by a strong sense of not giving up I couldn t let my career end and so I went back to that robot I began by playing balls a day then then and so on I would cry as I played since it hurt every time but I learned how to absorb that pain After month of constant playing and physiotherapy I started to gain sensation I continued playing and got through the pain for months There was month left for the tournament season to start days before the tournament I went to the stadium Everyone was very shocked that I had come that early given my condition I was continuously advised against playing by my peers and doctors since there was too much at stake But this was different While I could lose my ability to continue my career would have ended if I hadn t played then I also knew that if I lost I would probably fall into depression thus risking everything I finally went into the tournament I had taken painkillers since my wrist was still not in the best condition and with that the games began I was nervous but I also knew what needs to be done I took a deep breath and began to play To everyone s surprise I managed to win every set I played Not only that I defeated a very senior player in the process This was just the beginning As time progressed I played in a lot of tournaments and won a lot of medals While my wrist still hurts I didn t give up then and won t give up now I currently have shoulder surgery but isn t this the life of a sportsperson I have a long career in front of me and I am ready
