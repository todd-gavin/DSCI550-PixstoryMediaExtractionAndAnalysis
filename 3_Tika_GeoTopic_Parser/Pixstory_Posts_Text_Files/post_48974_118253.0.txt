There are plenty of reasons many people can't eat traditional cheese. Some of them have lactose intolerance to thank for that, some have culture and others, their ethics – at least, for me it's the ethics. The process of making cheese is all sorts of cruel and once you know the reality of it, you're very unlikely to go back to consuming that. And if you can't or do not want to consume dairy based cheese, what else could you count on? What else ingredients are cheese made of? You can eat cheese made from soybeans, peas, cashews, coconut, or almonds, which are all plant-based. Vegan cheeses include cheddar, gouda, parmesan, mozzarella, and cream cheese, all of which are made using dairy free ingredients– duh! Many other common cheeses can be made vegan by replacing the milk with non-dairy milk alternatives such as almond milk, coconut milk, oat milk, cashew milk, and so on. Finding your best match is the fun part. There are so many varieties of vegan cheese available in the market that you'll probably not run out of options. Some may work for you, some may not. The best part is that the vegans have come up with hauntingly similar cheeses – in taste and texture – in the last couple of years thanks to the experimenting during the pandemic. Oh, and you could make a lot of them at home too!
