The Premier League winners have confirmed Erling Haaland's transfer to Manchester City, with the striker calling it "a proud day for myself and my family" and claiming he has "joined the perfect club."

After joining Dortmund from Red Bull Salzburg, Haaland scored 86 goals in 89 appearances. On Sunday, he scored two goals in Norway's Nations League match against Sweden, bringing his total to 20 goals in 21 appearances.

"Erling has everything we want in a striker, and we are confident he will flourish in this squad and system," City's director of football, Txiki Begiristain, stated. He's come a long way, yet he's still only 21 years old. His greatest years are still to come, and we're convinced that working with Pep will help him achieve even greater success.

"The wait is now over!" wrote Haaland shortly after the agreement was revealed. The Norwegian will lead a retooled City forward line next season, with River Plate forward Julian lvarez joining the side this summer after a Â£14 million January transfer.

Gabriel Jesus, a Brazilian attacker, is slated to leave the club this summer, while Raheem Sterling has been linked with Real Madrid and Chelsea.
