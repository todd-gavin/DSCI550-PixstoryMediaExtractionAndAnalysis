The transmission of power from Uzbekistan has been halted due to technical problems found in the electricity system that includes the Central Asian states of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kirgizstan.

Officials at Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) said they have linked to power coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.

They also promised to solve the electricity problems soon.

“Our technical team has made efforts to solve the loss of power in Kabul and other provinces,” said Hekmatullah Noorzai, a spokesman DABS.

According to DABS, technical teams are working to solve the problems found in the power system in Central Asia.

Some residents of the capital Kabul urged the relevant officials to stop depending on imported power and to begin construction of dams inside the country.

“They should construct the electricity dams in the country and prevent the importing of power. Then we can stop pouring our millions of dollars into the foreigners’ pocket,” a Kabul resident said.

Amid an economic meltdown in Afghanistan, the industrial factories complained that the lack of electricity has affected their operations.

“With the power cut, and lack of power in the industrial parks, the factories have stopped operating,” said Mohammad Karim Azimi, head of the Chamber of Industry and Mines.

Earlier, the residents complained about the shortage of power in the capital city of Kabul.

Afghanistan imports a great amount of electricity from its neighboring countries.
