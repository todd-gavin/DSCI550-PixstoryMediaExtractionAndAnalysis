SECOND HALF:

Barça didn't get off to a good start in the second half, and they continued to have the same issues as in the first, but they were awarded a penalty by VAR after Caroline Graham Hansen was booted in the box by Olga.

 Despite the fact that there wasn't much in it and the decision seemed harsh, Alexia Putellas stepped up to the spot and netted a fantastic penalty to tie the game.

Femen began to dominate possession more, and as time went on, Madrid was unable to maintain the same level of effort, seeming exhausted and creating larger gaps at the back.

As we approached the final ten minutes, Barça continued to be wasteful, throwing terrible crosses into the box and never creating a serious chance to go ahead.

But this Barça team is tenacious, and they were not going home empty-handed: with nine minutes left, Claudia Pina was quickest to the rebound after Aitana Bonmat's attempt was blocked inside the box, and she struck the bottom corner to put the away team ahead.

In the final moments, Madrid rushed forward in search of a late equaliser, but they couldn't get past Sandra Paos, and they conceded a third goal on the counter attack when Patri Guijarro found Alexia all alone, and the world's best player chipped the keeper to make it 3-1.

The final whistle blew, giving Barça the victory and a commanding lead heading into the second leg. They didn't play as well as they had all season, but wins are what knockout football is all about, and Barça won theirs. Now they return to Camp Nou in front of 90,000 fans, with the chance to prove their worth and book a place in the semi-finals. Is it already Wednesday?
