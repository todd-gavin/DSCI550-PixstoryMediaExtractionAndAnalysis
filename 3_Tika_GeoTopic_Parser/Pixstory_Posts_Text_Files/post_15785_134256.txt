House of the Dragon the prequel to Game of Thrones has garnered the largest ever audience for any new movie or series that has ever been streamed on HBO Staying true to the roots of Game of Thrones this series exceeded my expectations in the first episode itself House of the Dragon so far is as epic as GOT was during its prime This feels like a fresh start after the disappointing finale of Game of Thrones The first episode has everything that we ve loved about GOT be it the amazing Cinematography the soothing yet spine chilling music or the sheer tension of the plot The actors did a great job portraying the seriousness of their characters The CGI of the Dragons dare I say look better than anything cinema has ever offered us I am also very glad that they ve not altered the great music of GOT With a big budget they ve made sure that the world of Westeros is the best that we ve witnessed yet If you are a true fan of Game Of Thrones then you know George R R Martin is one of the best writers known to mankind and beyond
