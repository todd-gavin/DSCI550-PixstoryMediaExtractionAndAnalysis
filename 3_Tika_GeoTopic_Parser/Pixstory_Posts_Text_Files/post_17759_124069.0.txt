Thor: Love and Thunder has broken one of the box office records set by Thor: Ragnarok. The Chris Hemsworth-starring film has been in theatres for a month, and based on its ratings, it has done well. The Rotten Tomatoes score recently plummeted to 65%, making it the Asgardian's lowest-rated standalone film.

Not only that, but it has the second lowest rating in the entire MCU, just above Eternals' 47%. However, its box office performance has been better. It has already outperformed Chris Hemsworth's MCU character's first two independent flicks globally. Now, it appears that the film will also leave behind the 2017 film.

According to Box Office Mojo, Thor: Love and Thunder is just a few million dollars away from reaching the 700 million mark at the global box office. Taika Waititi's directorial debut has earned $698 million to far. This includes $316 million in North America and $382 million in other parts of the world.
