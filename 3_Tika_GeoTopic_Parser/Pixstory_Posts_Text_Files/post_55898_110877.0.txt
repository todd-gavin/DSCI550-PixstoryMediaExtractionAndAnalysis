Cassidy Hutchinson has testified that she heard a secondhand account of how Trump was so furious at his Secret Service detail for blocking him from going to the Capitol on January 6 that he thrust to the front of his presidential limo and tried to turn the wheel.

She said that Tony Ornato, then-White House deputy chief of staff, said that Robert Engel, who was the Secret Service agent in charge on January 6, frequently told Trump on their way back to the White House after Trump's Ellipse speech that it wasn't safe to go to the Capitol.

According to Hutchinson, Ornato recited Trump screaming, "I'm the f**king President. Take me up to the Capitol now." Trump then "reached up toward the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel,"  

Trump according to Hutchinson even defended the rioters who shouted for the hanging of then-Vice President Mike Pence! 

Hutchinson also claimed that Trump's conduct on January 6 was 'un-American' and 'unpatriotic' which triggered made many lawmakers and staff to run for their lives on Jan 6.
