Shoutout to all Writers in pixstory

We all spend a lot of time thinking about something than actually doing it.

It's because we somehow can't control our thoughts & our Brain likes our body to be at east, that's why we can't take action.

A simple solution for this is to simply do it, what you think. Just do it!
A simple tiny step towards the things you want to do. (Start small & Gradually increase intensity)

Suppose you want to write a novel, you can't write a novel just in a day. So start small, Start with just 1 page a day, if that is also a big challenge then write 1 para a day, if that is difficult then write 1 sentence a day, if that is difficult then write one word a day. 
Start small!

If you don't find doing this helpful then create your own solution, because you're the one who actually know your real problem. 
Be a person who solve problems not the one who create problems.
