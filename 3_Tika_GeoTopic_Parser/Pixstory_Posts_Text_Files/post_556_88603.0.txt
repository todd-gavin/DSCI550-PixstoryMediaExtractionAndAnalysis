Ishi Khosla talks about water retention and simple obesity as part of our in going series on nutrition month. 

Water retention :
It is one of the major issues related to obesity. 

There is extra water in the body if there is inflammation. We understand person has not eaten that much but has still retained water. 
Although there is nothing wrong in the calorie definition but to say that you're eating excess calories and that's why you're obese is not true. And we again as practitioners would always believe that the patient is not telling the truth and no one gains weight without eating.

The patients are not eating much but they are eating wrong which is causing inflammation and than water retention. It is not only fat, it's a lot of water. We need to recognize that being overweight is not and making fat, it's also about a lot of water . It causes puffiness, your extremities feel puffy. It is because of a lot of things, it’s water and also air .
In most cases you don’t even feel muscles because of retention of water and air . So simple
calorie counting doesn’t even work we have to address these issues . So I have come to the conclusion, with very great clarity that obesity basically can be of five types. And the most common one is simple obesity which was there perhaps before a lot of these complications came in into our lifestyles. 
Which was people who just ate a little extra just ate more than what they had to, not and hence put on weight.
This type of obesity is easy to treat. Emphasis would be on calorie count. If you eat, say 2000 calories and we'll bring it down to 1000 calories and you will lose weight. It works simply on calorie deficit. 
After our life got complicated , we got more complicated form of obesity .

We will discuss other forms of obesity in the coming days .
