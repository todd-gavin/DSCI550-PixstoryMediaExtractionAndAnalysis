Tottenham has got a chance to go up in the Champions league table. 
Spurs are in good shape under Conte with Son, Kane, Richarlison, Perisicin the squad. 
While Spurs face Sporting at Lisbon in the Champions league second matchday, the biggest threat will be an ex Spurs academy graduate Marcus Edwards. Marcus was praised by the then Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, “Ah, he's the best young player in the academy,”. Now, Marcus is wearing sporting number 10 jersey and leading the attack. He is just 23, scored against Eintracht Frankfurt in the first match, helping them to win 3-0. Trincao is another player in the attack, who could pose a threat to Spurs today. 
Spurs are confident. Their attack is supreme. Goal came a bit late for the English side against Marseille in the first match, even with the 18 total shots taken. Richarlison scored his first and second goal for the Spurs in the match, both with his head. On both occasions, crosses came from the left. 
Star player Son Heung-min is yet to score a goal in the season. He has been wonderful in the previous seasons. Spurs fans will be hoping him to score today. 
In other fixtures, Barcelona face Bayern Munich today at Munich. Liverpool will play against Ajax and Marseille will play against Eintracht Frankfurt.
