Purusha and Prakriti are two abstract entities as defined in the Sankhya philosophy and are one of the six main schools of Indian Philosophy also known as Shad Darshans.
It is a dualistic philosophy consisting of Purusha and Prakriti.

Purusha is spirit , person , self or consciousness , is inactive , universal and eternal and represents the male aspect of creation.

Prakriti is the entity defined by matter or substance. It represents the female aspect of creation and is active. The entire material universe is created of Prakriti or the fundamental matter. It is the union of Purusha and Prakriti that creates the universe.
