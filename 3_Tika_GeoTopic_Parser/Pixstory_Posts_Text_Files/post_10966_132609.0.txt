On 17 July, about 15,000 of India’s most disadvantaged community, tribals or Adivasis, from the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra gathered at the Mangarh Dham, a concrete obelisk on a hilltop in the southern Rajasthan district of Banswara. 


The men, most with a traditional white tauliya or towel wrapped around their neck or head, enthusiastically shouted  slogans: 


“Jai Johar ka nara hai, bharat desh hamara hai (Jai Johar is our slogan, India is our country).” 


“Ek teer ek kamaan adivasi ek samaan (One arrow, one bow, tribals are alike).” 


“Maan rahe sammaan rahe Bhil Pradesh ka naam rahe (May there be respect, may there be dignity, may the name of Bhil Pradesh remain).” 


“Leke rahenge leke rahenge Bhil Pradesh hum leke rahenge (We will take our Bhil Pradesh).”


They had gathered to demand “Bhil Pradesh”, a contiguous, imagined state for more than 30 million tribals who inhabit swathes of land in Rajasthan, where they make up 13.48 % of the population, Gujarat (14.8%), Madhya Pradesh (21.1%) and Maharashtra (9.35%). 


There are about 110 million Indians officially categorised as “scheduled tribes” requiring special assistance and representation. They are scattered across 25 states and five union territories, including the northeast, but about 4.4% of India’s Adivasis, almost all from the Bhil tribe and its sub tribes, who routinely occupy the bottom rung of development indices (here, here and here), live in these four states.


Adivasis in these four states are the poorest, most ill-educated and live the shortest and sickliest lives of any community. They are lower, said experts, on the ladder than even Dalits, lowest of Hindu castes, an assertion borne out by a series of studies over the years (here, here and here).
