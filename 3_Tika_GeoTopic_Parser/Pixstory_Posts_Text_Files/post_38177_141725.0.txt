Real Madrid winger Marco Asensio's frustration was for all to see against Mallorca on Sunday. Carlo Ancelotti decided not to bring on the Spaniard after asking him to warm up in the second half. Seeing the last substitution being made, the Madrid forward was not able to control his frustration. 
The said incident happened in the 70th minute as Dani Carvajal was brought in to replace Lucas Vasquez. This was Real Madrid's last substitution and hence drew an animated reaction from Asensio. The winger was warming up, but after the substitution, Asensio was seen throwing his training bib and kicking a water bottle before sulking on the Real Madrid bench. 
The Spaniard has played just 18 minutes for Real Madrid in total this season (10' vs Celtic - UCL, 8' vs Celta Vigo - LaLiga. Hence a lack of game time is being credited for the players' animated reaction. 
Marco Asensio was tipped to leave the club this summer after Carlo Ancelotti had publicly stated that Rodrygo would be starting over the Spaniard in the right wing. However, the Real Madrid #11 eventually decided to stay and fight for his spot in the team. Asensio's Real Madrid contract ends in June 2024. 
The player's response has generated a negative reaction from a lot of Real Madrid supporters that have even urged the club to "tear up his contract". It has to be seen if the player would win back a position in the starting XI or if he would decide to leave the club in the January transfer window next year.
