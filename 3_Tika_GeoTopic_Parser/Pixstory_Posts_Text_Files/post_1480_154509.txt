Late last month analysts at the investment bank Credit Suisse published a research note about America s new climate law that went nearly unnoticed The Inflation Reduction Act the bank argued is even more important than has been recognized so far The IRA will will have a profound effect across industries in the next decade and beyond and could ultimately shape the direction of the American economy the bank said The report shows how even after the bonanza of climate bill coverage earlier this year we re still only beginning to understand how the law works and what it might mean for the economy The report made a few broad points in particular that are worth attending to First the IRA might spend twice as much as Congress thinks Many of the IRA s most important provisions such as its incentives for electric vehicles and zero carbon electricity are uncapped tax credits That means that as long as you meet their terms the government will award them There s no budget or limit written into the law that restricts how much the government can spend The widely cited figure for how much the IRA will spend to fight climate change billion is in large part determined by the Congressional Budget Office s estimate of how much those tax credits will get used But that estimate is wrong the bank claims In fact so many people and businesses will use those tax credits that the IRA s total spending is likely to be more than billion double what the CBO projects And because federal spending tends to catalyze private investment that could send total climate spending across the economy to roughly trillion over the next years That s significantly more money flowing into green energy industries than the CBO projected though it s unclear if that additional money will lead to more carbon reductions than earlier analyses have projected
