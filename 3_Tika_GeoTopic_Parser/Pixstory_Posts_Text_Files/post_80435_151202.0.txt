Constant attempts being made saw Gabriel Jesus find the back of the net 4 minutes into the second half. Another fine cross from Bukayo Saka which was partly gathered by Lloris fell into Emerson's path who couldn't clear it away and left Gabriel Jesus with a chance to find the open net. What followed was even more peril for the visitors as Emerson who had mistakenly led to Tottenham conceding a second goal was shown a straight red for fouling Martinelli in the 63rd minute leaving his side down to 10. 
Martinelli who had to receive some treatment after the knock from Emerson soon was back on his feet and assisted Granit Xhaka for Arsenal's third goal. The brilliant counter attack from their own half saw Arsenal swarm around the Tottenham box in no time. Martinelli after skipping past two defenders lost the posession of the ball only to find his team mate Xhaka who executed a sublime finish and found the bottom left corner with a fine left foot shot. 
21 year old William Saliba proved to be Arsenal's Trump card with his brilliant work at the back beating the press brilliantly as he had won 100% Aerial duels won throughout the match. Gabriel Jesus with his brilliant bit of attacking gameplay also proved to be a nemesis for the opposition as he was the player with most shots in the opposition box. With this win Arsenal became the first side to hand Tottenham a defeat in this season of the premier league. This win also helped Artera's men maintain their position at the top of the table.
