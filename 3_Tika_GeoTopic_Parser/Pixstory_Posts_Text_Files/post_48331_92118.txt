As the awareness around the importance of mental health increases black women are once again conveniently left out of the narrative I am not implying that mental health of other people is not as important I am just saying that the struggles of a black women are different and rather harder so their needs to a separate strategy to tackle it Black women are at an increased risk of depression because of numerous factors Racism being one of the most crucial factors It is hard enough for an adult to experience racist behaviour but what happens when you face it as a kid or a teen I remember when I was merely years old when I first experienced racist behaviour from my classmates in school As a child it had lasting effects on me Not only it negatively affected my self esteem but for the longest of time I believed that there was something wrong with my skin colour The racism I faced as a kid gave me mental health issues And I am not the only one Research shows that black women who often encountered racism before age have an increased risk of depression In addition to this black women have to also fight against patriarchy and the internalised misogyny of fellow women This is only testimony to the fact that how every factor in society is actively working against black women There needs to be more conversation about this Black women should receive appropriate social support and guidance on how to overcome the problems Black women deserve to live the best life too physically mentally and emotionally
