It’s one of the most absurd conspiracy theories raging today across the US: a cabal of Satanic paedophiles, who run a global sex trafficking racket, control the US government, media and financial institutions. And, to restore the rightful leader, true American patriots have to wage a violent war. This is the central tenet of the conspiracist QAnon movement, considered a potential terrorist threat, fuelled by an anonymous author who signs his messages with the alphabet Q, spread through the social media.

For the believers of this theory, former President Donald Trump was recruited by top military officials to fight against the shadowy cabal. The theory that originated in 2017, during the presidency of Trump, thrived and got amplified, but quite surprisingly it still continues to attract hordes of Americans, long after his departure from the White House.  In fact, the movement turned into a cult, and now it’s a political movement, spreading to other countries advocating white supremacist domination across the world.   

A recent series of surveys by the think tank Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), 16% Americans – that is 44 million – still firmly believe in the theory, 22% believe a QAnon predicted “storm” is coming and 18% think violence may be required to save the country. Four different opinion polls by PRRI also revealed that Republicans (25%) were more likely to agree with the conspiracy theory than Democrats (9%) and independents (14%).   

QAnon was expected to lose its steam after Trump’s defeat in the election, but instead it keeps flourishing. Investigations have revealed many of the Capitol right perpetrators who invaded White House in January 2021, were QAnon adherents. Experts believe QAnon will influence the upcoming midterm election in the US  

QAnon followers and influencers were recently found celebrating Russian President Putin’s Ukraine invasion, falsely believing it is part of a battle against the “deep state.”
