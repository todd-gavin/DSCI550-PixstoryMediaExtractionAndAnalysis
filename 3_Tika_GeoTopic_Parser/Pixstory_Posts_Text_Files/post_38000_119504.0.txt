Cristiano Ronaldo and his agent met with the Manchester United representatives on Tuesday to discuss his future. In the meeting, the Iconic number 7 reportedly made it clear that he wants to be released from his Manchester United contract! 

As per the Daily Mail, Cristiano Ronaldo has asked to be released from the final year of his contract. He has 12 months remaining on his Â£360,000-a-week deal at Manchester United. Talks between the club and the player have failed to change the 37-year-old's mind about wishing to leave but he will carry on professionally. 

The Portuguese superstar did train with the squad on Tuesday and he even watched the friendly game between Manchester United and Wrexham that was held behind closed doors. The Red Devils' management had even brought down Sir Alex Ferguson in an attempt to make CR7 stay. But reports suggest that Ronaldo has already made up his mind to leave.

As of now, there have been no offers made by any club to sign the striker. Chelsea, Bayern Munich, and PSG have all been linked with Ronaldo. But all the mentioned clubs have distanced themselves in the past weeks. 

Atletico Madrid is another club that is being discussed as a potential option but it has to be seen if Cristiano Ronaldo would be willing to go there as this could tarnish his Real Madrid legacy.
