The feminist movement has not been a perfect one and has had many problems that we must tackle to make it more inclusive of all women One such issue is what we refer to as White Feminism Now what is white feminism White feminism refers to the kind of feminism and feminist acts that empower white women while ignoring or failing to address difficulties that minority groups particularly women of colour and LGBTQ women confront The term usually describes the type of feminism that is mostly practised by white women who while supportive of feminist ideas may overlook the plight of minorities or underprivileged groups within the feminist movement The first two waves of feminism the first dealing with suffrage the second fighting for increased equality on all fronts have been considered examples of white feminism They largely excluded women of color women from lower economic backgrounds and LGBTQ women Where did the term come from The phrase white feminism was used as early as in Paula Gunn Allen s text Who is Your Mother Red Roots of White Feminism It was used during the third wave of feminism which began in the s and was focused with diversity identity and intersectionality Bell Hooks for example challenged white feminism by writing about the challenges of excluded communities What can you as a white woman do to dismantle it White feminism is a result of a system that keeps white people above BIPoC It is a no brainer that women benefit from white privilege and despite having their own fair share of struggles with patriarchy If you re a white woman willing to make the movement more inclusive the first thing you have to learn is to not speak over women of color when they are narrating their experiences with racial or cultural misogyny You do not know about their struggles more than them so it s only fair you let them have a safe space where they socialize amongst themselves BIWoC talking about the struggles they face or have faced because of white feminism is not an attack on you Let s make the feminist movement intersectional and welcoming for ALL women
