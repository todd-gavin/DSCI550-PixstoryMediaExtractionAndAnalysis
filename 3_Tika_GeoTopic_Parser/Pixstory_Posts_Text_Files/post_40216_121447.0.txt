The "largest-ever" image of the Andromeda galaxy put together by the Hubble Space Telescope was released by the American space agency NASA on Sunday. The image of our neighbour in space was obtained seven years ago, and it is the sharpest huge composite image ever. 

According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the image provides a clear glimpse of more than 100 million stars over a 48,000 light-year stretch of the Andromeda galaxy. In the Instagram picture, the panoramic image is split into three halves, with the final section displaying a belt of blue stars with countless stars dispersed across the image.

â€œThis image is split into three images. The first image shows a bright spot emanating from the lower left portion of the Andromeda galaxy with bands extending out in all directions. The light recedes in the top quarter of the image to primarily black and bits of blue space with countless stars. The second photo has light dissipating with bands of purple and blue giving way to the blackness of space," NASA wrote in the caption.
