Extraordinary images captured by James Webb Space Telescope show the last moments of a star as it delivers a final performance of light, gas, and dust before bowing out of the universe, what we know as its ‘death’.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) continues to release awe-inspiring images of the universe as it was billions of years ago with the help of the latest James Webb Telescope. In the latest images, the telescope has revealed stunning details of the Southern Ring planetary nebula that were previously hidden from astronomers.

The Nasa led the telescope's development in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).
