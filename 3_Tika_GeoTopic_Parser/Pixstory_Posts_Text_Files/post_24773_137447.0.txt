Teun Koopmeiners - That's his name. 
The 24-year-old Netherlands midfielder is in his second season at Atalanta — and has already matched his output of four goals in all of the 2021-22 campaign. The previous Dutchman to score a hat trick in Serie A was Marco van Basten, who had a four-goal performance for AC Milan three decades ago. 
Koopmeiners is also known for his leadership qualities, and has captained AZ Alkmaar despite his young age. He has spent 5 seasons at AZ before joining Atalanta. 
Koopmeiners scored his first goal of the season against Verona to help Atalanta win the match. Having converted a penalty in first-half added time, Koopmeiners added another two minutes after the break when he controlled the ball outside the area and placed a low shot through traffic that took a slight deflection on its way in. Koopmeiners sealed the match with another penalty just inside the right post. The win helped Atalanta reach top spot alongside AS Roma. 
“He’s a midfielder but he can assert himself. He can provide defensive coverage, if he gets space he knows how to attack, he’s got a lot of power, he’s a complete midfielder"- Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said of Koopmeiners. 
Koopmeiners has also started in all four matches of Atalanta so far, playing full games in all four.
