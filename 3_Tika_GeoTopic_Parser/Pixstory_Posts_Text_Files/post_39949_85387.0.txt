MILK CHOCOLATE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING

MAKES 1 ¾ CUPS
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, slightly softened
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, slightly softened
⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt
3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted, still slightly warm
2 cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted
1 tablespoon whole milk, plus more as needed
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, butter, and salt on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly add the melted chocolate and beat for 1 minute more. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the confectioners’ sugar until just incorporated, being careful not to beat too much air into the frosting. Add the milk and vanilla and beat until just blended. If necessary, add more milk 1 tablespoon at a time until the frosting has a spreadable consistency but is still thick and fudgy.”
