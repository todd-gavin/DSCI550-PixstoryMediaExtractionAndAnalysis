In the end, a familiar script played out at the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party's so-called decision making body, that sat for four hours on Sunday to discuss the reasons for the poll debacle and a way forward. 

The marathon meeting ended with the CWC rejecting an offer by Congress president Sonia Gandhi that not only she but even Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are ready for any sacrifice and step aside from leadership roles if required for the revival of the party or if the leaders and workers so desire. 

The only proposal that was floated at the meeting and was promptly accepted is to hold a chintan shivir (brainstorming session) after the culmination of the ongoing budget session of Parliament.

As usual, there was too much hype around this CWC meeting but no fireworks or any concrete suggestion on how to make the organisation a fighting fit poll machine once again. 

It's not that the CWC meetings in the past were all futile. Old timers recall how the CWC would guide the party out of any crisis situation. In fact, a CWC meeting on May 15, 1999 saw Sonia Gandhi resigning from the party chief's post after three senior leaders - Sharad Pawar, PA Sangma and Tariq Anwar -- raised her foreign origin issue. She took back her resignation only after the party expelled them. 

A change in the script also came at a CWC meeting on May 25, 2019 when the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post following the resounding defeat of the party in the Lok Sabha elections. That move further plunged the Congress in deep crisis and is unable to come out of that mess since then. 

There are several other examples but over the years the CWC seems to have lost its relevance. One of the major reasons for that is the dilution of its authority due to the nomination culture that has replaced the elections. The last there was an election to the CWC was way back in 1997 at the Kolkata plenary.
