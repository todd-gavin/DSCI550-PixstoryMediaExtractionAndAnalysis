Manchester United fans are outraged following an embarrassing 4-0 away defeat to Brentford on August 13 in a game Cristiano Ronaldo returned to the starting XI.

Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse for United, it does as they are thrashed by the Bees.

The United fans were left seething, who were expecting some change in performance after Ten Hag took over the reins, but i dont think there will be much change in the way they have been performing! 

De Gea's mistake in keeping resulted in the opening goal, and it was pretty much downhill from there on. The Bees scored 4 goals in the first half. United had a comparatively better second half, coz any decent football you play would be better than that disastrous first half. 

Ronaldo seemed visibly frustrated at De Gea as his lack of intent in keeping cost the team 4 goals. Days like these really make you wonder whether Ronaldo is right about leaving Manchester United
