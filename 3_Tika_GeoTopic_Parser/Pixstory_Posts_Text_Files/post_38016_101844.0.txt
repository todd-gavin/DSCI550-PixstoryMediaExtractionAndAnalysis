As per Express UK, Paris Saint Germain have reportedly offered Barcelona a chance to get Neymar back in the summer transfer window. 

After giving a huge setback to Real Madrid by giving Kylian Mbappe a new contract, PSG might be set to add to Los Blancos' misery. For this, the French champions are reportedly offering Neymar a return to Barcelona.

Neymar joined PSG from Barcelona back in 2017. The Parisians reportedly paid €222m to secure the services of the Brazilian. But his stint at the club could be over. 

As per the report, "With Mbappe now choosing to stay, the French champions don’t consider Neymar to be ‘untouchable’ behind the scenes. PSG have now, therefore, offered Neymar to a host of clubs as they look to get him off the wage bill."

Neymar has scored 100 goals in 144 appearances for Paris Saint Germain in the last five seasons in all competitions. Though the Brazilian has his fair share of "highlights", he has struggled to find the same form that he displayed at Barcelona. 

The Blaugrana on the other hand would be willing to bring Neymar back with open arms. Lionel Messi had himself touted Neymar to be his successor at the club. Hence bringing the Brazilian back would certainly add a lot of fanfare.

It has to be seen what happens regarding Neymar's future in the summer transfer window!
