 Man is defined as a human being and woman as a female whenever she behaves as a human being she is said to imitate the male One is not born but rather becomes a woman Few tasks are more like the torture of Sisyphus than housework with its endless repetition the clean becomes soiled the soiled is made clean over and over day after day The housewife wears herself out marking time she makes nothing simply perpetuates the present Eating sleeping cleaning the years no longer rise up towards heaven they lie spread out ahead grey and identical The battle against dust and dirt is never won All oppression creates a state of war this is no exception
