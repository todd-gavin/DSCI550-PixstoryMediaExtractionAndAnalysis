Nigeria and Sierra Leone will clash to begin their African Cup of Nations Group A qualifying journey when
they meet at the Abuja National Stadium on Thursday.

Hosts Nigeria are on a poor run of form, winless in their last 5 appearances. Their last outting was a 1 - 0
loss to Ecuador. They will look to make it to the African Cup of Nations third time in a row.

Sierra Leone enter the match in good form, with two wins on the bounce - the latest one being a 2 - 1
over Congo in a friendly.
