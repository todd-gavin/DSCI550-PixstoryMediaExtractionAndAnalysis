Although the signatures should already be affixed by the end of this week, Investcorp and Elliott are very close to the transfer of ownership of Milan. May will be the right month for the acquisition for the sum of billions and millions of euros with the aim of bringing Milan back to the glories of the past and return to play in the Champions League maybe not from the first year as a protagonist No mention has yet been made of the names of premature players but the ambitious project also comes from an idea of Investcorp that of the owned stadium Elliott has been talking about it for a long time a dialogue has also been sought with Inter as well as with the Municipality of Milan Investcorp, on the other hand, thinks differently and future plans exclude the Nerazzurri cousins In Alardhi&#39;s mind there can be no sharing of what he considers a place of worship for the fans the stadium must be red and black in all respects it must welcome fans days a year it must be an exclusive and unifying place a meeting point for everyone and must satisfy the needs and possibilities of those who can spend a lot and those who can afford only smaller numbers
