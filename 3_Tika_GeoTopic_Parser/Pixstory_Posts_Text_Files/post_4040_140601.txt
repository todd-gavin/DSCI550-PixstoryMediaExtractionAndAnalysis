You come to me everyday After your visit to every part of this world You come with the gift of wind The winds you bring is the music to my hair It s the music to the dance of the branches They move their greeny arms like waving a good evening to me Your calmness brims in my soul Dear moon You spread your light to me Showing the paths I haven t seen in daylight Your brightness inspires the stars to shine Your whispers to shine like the diamond needs to be rephrased None can shine as brighter as you do Dear moon fill me with your light Adios From an ardent lover
