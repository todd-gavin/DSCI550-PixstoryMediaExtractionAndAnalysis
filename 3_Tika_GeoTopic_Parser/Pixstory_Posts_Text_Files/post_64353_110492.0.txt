It's always the season of exams and interviews. So as a person who has recently given interview and group discussion round I would like to share tips about dos and don'ts in a interview that I've learned.
~Attire. First thing first, to make a favorable first impression on your interviewer you need to look neat.
~Behavior. You need to make the other party feel comfortable, so be pleasant and smiling but still professional. There should be no awkward silences- if you don't know the answer to a question don't take too long to think about it so that there aren't any long silences. Sit straight and look confident. Do not talk over the interviewer, and don't be an over confident know all.
~Communication. You need to have good communication skills and fluency in English.
In GD remember it's not debate but a discussion don't cut others off, help each other and come to a conclusion together.
~Be ethical. Never lie on your resume or in the interview that you know this skill and that skill. Don't be all over the place. Only write what you can answer if the interviewer asks. As if you fail to do so it doesn't leave a good impression on the other person.
~Be Prepared. Always keep a pen and blank paper with you so if an interviewer asks you to solve something in front of them you don't have to get up from your place. Have a good stable Internet Connection, this is very important since you won't be clearly able to hear a question or while you are answering the interviewer would not get what you said. It's bothersome and interviewer might even get irritated.
This is all I have for today, if I remember more I'll be sure to add it here.
