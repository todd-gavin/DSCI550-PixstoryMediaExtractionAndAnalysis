2 Cesar Azpilicueta
When one of the best in the business, John Terry, left the club, many wondered who would takee over as captain. Azpilicueta, a man of great leadership, took over as captain and led the club to many glory days. He joined the club in 2012 and has produced high performance in every game. He drove the club to the Europa League in his debut season, and regardless of his age, he has made over 459 appearances, registering 15 goals and 56 assists.
He will be a free agent next season after winning two Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy, and two Europa League trophies with the club.
1 John Terry
John Terry was a proper leader at Chelsea and one of the best defenders in the club's
history. He currently sits at the top after being promoted from the club academy and making his first team debut early on. He joined the senior team in 2000, and the rest is history; despite numerous offers from big clubs, he chose to stay at Chelsea.
He rose to stardom and was a fan favorite; he not only played as a solid CB but his
leadership qualities helped Chelsea achieve the highest status in Europe.
Terry appeared in 717 games for the club during his trophy-laden career, scoring 67 goals and providing 29 assists.
The former captain won five Premier League titles and was named UEFA Club defender of the year in 2005. 2008 and 2009.
