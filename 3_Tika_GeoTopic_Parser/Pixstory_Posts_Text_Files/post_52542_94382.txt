Marvel Cinematic Universe s th phase has already begun And we have witnessed some amazing movies in this segment and one of them is Shang Chi Shang Chi has created a whole lot of buzz and a crazy fan following after its release This movie was fantastic The camera work was incredible and never boring to watch Visually it was a masterpiece of color and energy The action was the best we have had in the MCU since Spiderman took out Mysterio s drones The final fight scene finally escaped the trope of the villain and hero having the exact same power which was what I was expecting from the trailer going into the movie The movie also did such an incredible job splicing in backstory at just the right moment that it was engaging and made the characters more interesting instead of distracting from the plot There are some criticisms I have of the movie such as the reliance on the trope of a perfectly peaceful society that gets attacked as a backstory setting the trope of killing off the villain right when he is at the point of redemption and could have an interesting character arc and finally just the way that some of the jokes fell flat But as a whole this is undeniably the most unique and creative movie to be made this year and it was incredible to get to watch it in theaters with the full super hero experience Let s hope for the sequel and the introduction of Shang Chi into other MCU movies
