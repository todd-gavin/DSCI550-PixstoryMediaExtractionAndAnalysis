By Surinder Singh OberoiNew Delhi: On September 21, 2022, a few dozen Nepalis-Bhutanese got collected at Dag Hammarskjold Park in New York to bring the attention of the United Nations and the world leaders assembled at the UN headquarters to their plight.The protestors, carrying banners of peace and justice, organised a silent protest hoping to draw the attention of the World leaders collected at the UN headquarters in New York demanding a better future, reconciliation and a visit to their motherland.According to the Sampan news, around 110,000 Bhutanese were given refuge in the USA and around 15,000 in eight western countries when they were forced to leave Bhutan and live in Nepal refugee camps in the early 1990s.They showed concern for the family members who were considered Stateless living in Nepal and Bhutan with bleak futures and not allowed to meet their loved ones living in other counties.In a letter to Ambassador Doma Tshering, Bhutan Ambassador at UN in New York, the members and partners of Peace Initiative Bhutan suggested that "they are concerned about issues affecting the Lhotshampa community in Bhutan and the diaspora."We are worried about the pain and suffering caused by the family separation. Several Bhutanese still live in refugee camps in Nepal, and some political prisoners face life sentences."In Bhutan, around 50 to 100 Nepali-Bhutanese are in detention centres. Many detainees are punished with a life sentence. Some of the families of the detainees were allowed intermittently to meet their families.In 1989, Bhutan implemented a 1985 Nationality Law, conducted a national census and revoked the citizenship of the Nepali-origin community Lhotshampa living in the south of Bhutan.About 100,000 Bhutanese from the Lhotshampa community fled Bhutan in 1990 after several dozens were arrested by the Bhutan authorities or forced to leave the country. They tried to first settle in India. They then entered Nepal, where they were given refuge along Nepal's eastern border with India.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/analysis/the-invisible-face-of-bhutan-96835-96835.html
