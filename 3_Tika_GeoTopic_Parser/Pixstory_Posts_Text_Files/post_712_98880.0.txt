Sixty-nine percent of Indian households use improved toilet facilities, which are non-shared facilities that prevent people from coming into contact with human waste and can reduce the transmission of cholera, typhoid, and other diseases. Shared toilet facilities of an otherwise acceptable type are also common, especially in urban areas; 11 percent of urban households use a shared facility, compared with 7 percent of rural households. 
Nineteen percent of households do not use any toilet facility, meaning that they practice open defecation.
Eighty-three percent of households have access to a toilet facility; a much higher accessibility in urban areas (96%) than in rural areas (76%). Access to a toilet facility ranges from 69 percent among scheduled tribe households to 93 percent among households which are not scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, or other backward class households.
Among the states/UTs, access to a toilet facility is lowest in Bihar (62%), followed by Jharkhand (70%) and Odisha (71%)
