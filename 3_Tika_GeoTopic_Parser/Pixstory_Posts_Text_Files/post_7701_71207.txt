Literature always influenced me along with Cinema I was always intrigued by texts and how they were written that s why I chose to study literature in college I joined Amity University in I m studying B A English Hons Literature My expectations for college were pretty high and they lived up to them for the first semester I joined the Drama club of my department and we staged a play in first semester during the second semester we were practicing to stage another play but the practices were stopped when the first lockdown was announced Halfway into the second semester it all shifted to online One thing about literature for me is it s really fun to study in the classroom but as soon as it went online I just didn t have the same attention span Looking at a screen for hours straight isn t something for me I rushed back home to Kashmir while college was in Delhi From studying the poetry of John Donne and Milton in the classroom to studying Yeats online it has been quite an experience It did help me stay connected to my school friends but some of the new connections I had built did lose their meaning I remember me and one of my friends wanted to stage the movie The King as a play when we became the core members of the club Due to covid this just didn t happen The desire to read fiction has been tough to find as I can t believe what s been happening around me Escaping to my own imagination hasn t been the same for me as it was before I ve felt cramped in my own room Finally in the th semester I did go back to college for my exams It was a nice experience to see friends that lived far away and see the professors face to face again We were told classes would be held offline but then again due to the omicron covid surge classes have been made online It feels like we ll get a PDF of the degree and it ll be over my generation just couldn t experience college life in its true sense
