Jupiter has a lot going on, including enormous storms, strong winds, auroras, and extremely high temperatures and pressures. 

As per NASA Blogs, recently, new photographs of the planet were taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. Webb's views of Jupiter will provide researchers with considerably more information about Jupiter's interior. 

“We hadn’t really expected it to be this good, to be honest,” said planetary astronomer Imke de Pater, professor emerita of the University of California, Berkeley. De Pater led the observations of Jupiter with Thierry Fouchet, a professor at the Paris Observatory, as part of an international collaboration for Webb’s Early Release Science program. 

Webb itself is an international mission led by NASA with its partners ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). “It’s really remarkable that we can see details on Jupiter together with its rings, tiny satellites, and even galaxies in one image,” she said. 

As NASA reported, the observatory's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which has three specialised infrared filters that highlight the features of the planet, produced the two photos. The light has been mapped onto the visible spectrum because infrared light cannot be seen by the human eye. 

The shortest wavelengths are typically represented as more blue, whereas the longest wavelengths tend to appear redder. Judy Schmidt, a citizen scientist, worked with scientists to convert the Webb data into photos.
