When I see this image I remember an incident related to this .
 " One day a very famous scientist Dr. C.V Raman traveling from London to Kolkata and he observe the sea was blue and sky was also blue in the horizon when the sun was shining in the evening. He just asked why this happen?? and he got nobel prize that means he was pondering that why the horizon where sky and sea seems to meet looks blue?
And his research resulted the phenomena of beam velocitic scattering of photon in the light." 
So my point is nature is full of knowledge just need to observe it.
