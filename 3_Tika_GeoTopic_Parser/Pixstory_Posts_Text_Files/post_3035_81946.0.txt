Under normal circumstances, the Taliban don't allow protests in central Kabul. But the recent protests have been different. Hundreds of protesters have been calling on the U.S. to release frozen funds of the Afghan Central Bank for the use of the government in Kabul.

The Taliban have issued a statement saying that U.S. President Joe Biden's Executive Order on the frozen funds could result in The Taliban "reconsidering" their relationship with the U.S., although it didn't specify how. The statement says that since the 9/11 attacks had nothing to do with Afghans, seizing the money in the name of the terror attack was "blatant oppression" and against the Doha Agreement.

Last week, Biden signed an order according to which the U.S. will use $3.5 billion of the frozen assets to address the dire economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, but the other $3.5 billion could be used for compensating 9/11 victims.

The move by the Biden Administration seemed to have united several people with opposite views in Afghanistan. In a press conference on Sunday, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai criticized the U.S. and called on it not to "punish the victim,"â€”in this case, the Afghans.

Intellectuals, academicians, civil society organizations and others have written an open letter to Biden asking him to reconsider his decision. The letter says, "We ask you to reconsider this decision as we are still trying to heal what is left of us as a nation." (https://tolonews.com/afghanistan-176728)

The Taliban have been demanding ever since they came to power to release the locked funds in American banks. (https://nypost.com/2022/01/24/taliban-demand-release-of-10b-frozen-by-us-europe/)

It is for the first time that the Afghans are presenting a united face and The Taliban could be realizing this could straighten their hands more than ever before since their takeover of the country.
