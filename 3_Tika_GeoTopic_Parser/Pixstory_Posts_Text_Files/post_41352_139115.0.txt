A US official told CNN that Russia is currently acquiring millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use in the conflict in Ukraine. 

CNN has reported that according to the official, the purchase shows that there are still acute supply shortages for the Russian military in Ukraine, which is partly because of export restrictions and sanctions. 

According to the person, the US anticipates that Russia may try to purchase more military hardware from North Korea in the future. 

The deal was initially covered by The New York Times. The 1950s Korean War had established ties between the two nations, with North Korea benefiting greatly from the former Soviet Union's financial support of the state. The US and the West have been accused by North Korea of the war in Ukraine!

Moreover, the US recently concluded that Russia now has drones with the ability to carry missiles from Iran, likely for use in the conflict in Ukraine. The news of Moscow purchasing weapons from North Korea supports this conclusion.
