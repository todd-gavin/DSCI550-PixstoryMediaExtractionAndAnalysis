You're entirely right when you say that the work is degraded if not shown correctly, but that still doesn't validate that making movies should be avoided.
There are some great examples of movies adapted from great work, but they still manage to keep their original position pious and authentic.
Look at the whole Harry Potter movie series. I mean, who would not love it?
Only the ones who haven't seen it!!
Otherwise, it's the most phenomenal work; nothing feels as being distorted or put in the wrong way.
We love Harry Potter books and the Warner Bros adaptation of them.
Yes, the skills you are talking about here are of utmost importance, then I also believe that these great works should be kept in the hands of a connoisseur who can portray them accurately.
But yes, as I said above, this should not stop anyone from making movies because movies just give you a different perspective, and it is quite interesting to see anyone else's perspective of work.
Art gives you the freedom to do so, and one should be smart enough to use it smartly.
