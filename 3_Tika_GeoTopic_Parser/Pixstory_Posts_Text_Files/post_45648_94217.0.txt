I have always used social media as a medium of self expression. It is a place for me to pen down my thoughts, give my opinion on various topics and to just have fun. 

Before joining Pixstory, I was a twitter user. But one major flaw I found in it, apart from the edit button was the word limit. I often like to use long narratives to drive across my point. But in twitter, I hardly get to introduce my opinion much less talk about it in length. 

Some people said that creating threads is a good option but in my opinion, it just breaks the flow and not a lot of people have time or attention span to click on ‘show this thread’ every-time they come across one. Moreover, it is not always easy to break up your thoughts in exact numbered words. 

Yes, it maybe a great option for idle chit chat but it just didn’t work for me. Pixstory, on the other hand, gives me ample space to create a narrative without making it too long and tedious. So, all in all, I am enjoying Pixstory more than Twitter at the moment!
