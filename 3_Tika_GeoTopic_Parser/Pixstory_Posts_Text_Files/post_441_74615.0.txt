Television had already entered every household when we were kids in 80s-8 to 10 pm slot was family TV time. 
While some of the elders in the family hated those commercial breaks immediately after that crucial twist in the serials- the OTT generation who can binge watch a 15 part series in a day would be unable to imagine this. 
As kids we would however look forward to the advertisement, we would know what new treats have come to the market. And on any given day when our parents were in good mood, the treats were due. 
When the chubby little girl would sip that orange concentrate from the goblet and say “ I love u Rasna”( the goblets were also a novelty in culturally non alcohol liking kashmir. I took fancy to them as well) . 
Anyways coming back to the story, every one wanted that sip. 
I remember when we got Rasna home for the first time. A trial drink was made to test the right amount of sourness. It was quite a day of activity actually.
Than there was Maggi - the two minute noodles. Even before ads hit the television, the companies would come to schools ( mostly the elite convent ones where they though parents have the spending power, to distribute their products for free). 
So when I got a packet and my brother got the same in the boys wing of the school, we didn’t know what to do with them. My mum knew “sevaiyan” but had never tried anything Chinese. Trust me after making it to perfection by completely following instructions, I found it yucky. Who would imagine years later it would become my “on the run staple “ during early journalism days . 
There is a story associated with Kisan jam as well. After days of virtually begging for it. We finally got the great looking Kisan Jam. Both my brother and I were so excited that we dropped the fresh bottle on the tiled kitchen floor and it broke into pieces . Had to wait for a month till the jam was replaced.
