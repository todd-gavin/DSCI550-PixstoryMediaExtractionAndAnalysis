Coca-Cola might be one of the best-known brands in the world today. However, that wasn't always the case. When the company first started in 1886, it used coupons for free drinks to raise interest in the product. In 1892, marketer Asa Candler finalized the purchase of Coca-Cola from inventor Dr. John Pemberton. Candler's original advertising budget was $11,000. He used items such as calendars, soda fountain urns, painted wall signs, napkins, pencils, and clocks to advertise Coca-Cola. By 1895, Coca-Cola reports that the beverage is sold and drunk in every U.S. state and territory, beginning its market saturation around the world.

The first celebrity to ever endorse Coca-Cola was music hall performer Hilda Clark in 1900. Hilda was an American model and actress, known as the basis for the character depicted in the early-20th-century Coca-Cola advertisement 'Drink Coca-Cola 5¢'.

As a young adult Clark moved east to Boston to become a popular music hall singer and actress. However, Clark became famous as a model in 1895 when she became the first woman to be featured on a tin Coca-Cola tray. Hilda Clark remained the advertising "face" of Coca-Cola until February 1903 when she married Frederick Stanton Flower in New York, taking the name Hilda Clark Flower.
