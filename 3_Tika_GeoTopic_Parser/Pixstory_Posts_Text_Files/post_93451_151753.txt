Do you go for late night parties Do you drink or smoke If you re a college student you might have come across these questions from your college friends Talking about myself I don t like doing the above things because it s my choice not to involve in it Also there will be a lot of your friends who will urge you to at least try and experience them all once in your college life Again I ve a different take on this Many people believe that college is all about adventuring new things partying and enjoying In reality though this is not the case It all depends upon your choice and priorities If your friends are into this then it s fine because it s their choice altogether However if they re forcing their choice on you then it s not fine It s better to leave such people behind Because college is also about meeting new people from varied backgrounds and accepting them as who they are and not becoming what they want you to be Choice matters and more than that respecting it too Have you ever faced such situations how you deal with them
