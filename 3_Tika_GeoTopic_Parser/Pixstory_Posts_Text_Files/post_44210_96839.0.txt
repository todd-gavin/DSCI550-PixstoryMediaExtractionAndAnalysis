The surmounting pressure over the heads of Roman Abramovich and co. is there for the 
world to see, as Chelsea football club nears It's final weeks under the Russian's ownership.

Investors from around the globe have sought out the opportunity to purchase parts of the 
English football club. With the bank 'Raine' of England given authority to host the auction for 
the club's sale, a never seen before 'clause' (of sorts) has been inserted in the laws for 
purchase.

That being, that any new bidder must assure full retention over ownership for another decade at the very least. Raine, the merchant bank in authority of the auction believe it will help sustain the club's period of success after a glittering spell under Abramovich, who took over 18 years ago.

The clause/statement released by Raine readâ€”"Bidders for Chelsea must guarantee that they will not sell a controlling stake for at least a decade as Roman Abramovich's tenure as owner nears its conclusion."

It isn't unusual for a previously successful owner to grant rights to a new bidder that's likelier to secure the rights for the foreseeable future. It remains unclear as to which of the three bidders is the strongest candidate, but the odd one out will have to ply with the rules. This coming after a period of stability for Chelsea.

The football club suffered invariably during 
what has been a period of instability, change and unpredictability.

The first consortium is headed by Boston Celtics part-owner Steve Pagliuca and Larry Tanenbaum, the NBA chairman and Toronto Maple Leafs owner. The two have publicly 
committed to "lifetime ownership" of Chelsea.

The other bid is said to have been through Sir 
Martin Broughton, the former British Airways and Liverpool FC chairman. Athletes Serena 
Williams and Sir Lewis Hamilton are said to have invested millions of pounds into this deal.
