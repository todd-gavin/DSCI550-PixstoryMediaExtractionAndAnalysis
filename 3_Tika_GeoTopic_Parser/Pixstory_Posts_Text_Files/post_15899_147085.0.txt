Abstract
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as a non-communicable disease imposes heavy disease burdens on society. Limited studies have been conducted to assess the effects of short-term air pollution exposure on T2DM, especially in Asian regions. Our research aimed to determine the association between short-term exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and outpatient visits for T2DM in Chongqing, the largest city in western China, based on the data collected from November 28, 2013 to December 31, 2019. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied, and stratified analyses were performed to investigate the potential modifying effects by age, gender, and season. Meanwhile, the disease burden was revealed from attributable risk. Positive associations between short-term NO2 and daily T2DM outpatient visits were observed. The strongest association was observed at lag 04, with per 10 μg/m3 increase of NO2 corresponded to increased T2DM outpatient visits at 1.57% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48%, 2.65%]. Stronger associations were presented in middle-aged group (35–64 years old), male group, and cool seasons (October to March). Moreover, there were 1.553% (8664.535 cases) of T2DM outpatient visits attributable to NO2. Middle-aged adults, males, and patients who visited in cool seasons suffered heavier burdens. Conclusively, short-term exposure to NO2 was associated with increased outpatient visits for T2DM. Attention should be paid to the impact of NO2 on the burden of T2DM, especially for those vulnerable groups.
