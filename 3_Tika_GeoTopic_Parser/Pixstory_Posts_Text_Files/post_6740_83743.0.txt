A 30-second-long video clip of a man getting stabbed by three people is widely being circulated on social media with a communal claim. The video is being shared with a caption that alleges that in Dasna, Ghaziabad, a Hindu man was ruthlessly killed by “peacefuls” (pejorative term used for Muslims).

The video is massively viral on Twitter.

The video has also been posted on Facebook by multiple users with the same claim.

False communal spin
Alt News rummaged the replies under one of the viral tweets and noticed that Ghaziabad police replied to the tweet refuting the claim.

We also had a close look at the video and observed that the victim is not only getting stabbed but is also being hit with a steel chair. Taking that as a clue, we performed a keyword search on Google and came across a news report by Hindustan Times that had the same visuals as seen in the viral video. The report was published on December 31, 2021.

As per the report, Shahrukh, 24, was stabbed to death by Zuber, 30, Zafar, 20 and Aditya,18. All of them are residents of Delhi’s Seemapuri. According to the investigating officer, this was a case of personal enmity since Shahrukh was allegedly having an affair with the sister of Zuber.

The only “Dasna, Ghaziabad” connection, in this case, is that the victim Shahrukh allegedly had a history of criminal activity and he was released on bail from Dasna Jail just a few days before his murder. The full statement of DCP Shahdara can be found on Facebook.

Hence, a video of a killing of a young man last year due to personal enmity was shared with a false communal spin.
