By Kinjal An minute long video clip that purportedly shows a kidnapping attempt is viral on social media In the video we see a woman getting out of an auto rickshaw with a child As she is speaking to the auto driver another woman standing in the vicinity picks up the child and flees Meanwhile two men recorded this act on their phones They inform the child s mother and head in the direction of the alleged kidnapper The mother along with those who had filmed the act get into a physical altercation with the alleged kidnapper During this scuffle one of the men slaps the alleged kidnapper several times In the end she confesses and apologises Social media users have shared the video and claimed the mother was deaf and dumb Hence she did not notice when her child got kidnapped A Facebook user posted this video with the same claim Archived link Link Another user also amplified the video on Facebook Fact check A disclaimer appears at the mark of the viral video It states that the video should be considered for entertainment purposes only Upon further investigation we found the same video posted on June by a Facebook page called Ankur Jatuskaran Ankur Jatuskaran is a video creator who often makes prank videos and shares them on his YouTube channel and Facebook page We examined the Facebook page closely and discovered that it has previously posted several such scripted videos link link link Apart from this we noticed that the man seen in the viral clip is Ankur himself He features as an actor in most of the videos To sum it up the viral video that shows child kidnapping is actually scripted In the past Alt News has fact checked multiple such videos which are actually dramatised or made for awareness However because the disclaimers are not being featured properly they are often mistakenly shared as real incidents
