The Sydney funnel-web spider, its relatives in the family Hexathelidae, and the redback spider are among the numerous highly venomous spiders found in Australia. Their bites can be excruciatingly painful and have historically been associated with fatalities in medical records. The majority of Australian spiders lack venom that is regarded as dangerously deadly. In Australia, there have been no reported deaths from spider bites since 1979. 

However, as per Wiki, there are sensationalised news reports regarding Australian spiders that fail to cite evidence.

Around 10,000 different species of Australian spiders are thought to exist. Fewer than 3,600 species have been described. Many species that have not yet been discovered are poorly understood. And, every year, new species are discovered.
