Have you ever fallen asleep before pm woken up around am felt well rested Have you ever fallen asleep around midnight slept in until am or later but didn t feel rested Have you ever woken up puffy or your symptoms felt worse in the AM The explanation for this is the sacred sleep window Between pm am your body does most of its healing If you re able to sleep during this period your body will heal at an accelerated rate Even if you only catch minutes those minutes are potent If you work night shifts or have difficulty lying down in this window you can nap or lie down with your eyes closed between am pm This four hour daytime window is the equivalent of the pm am for healing There s a common belief that once you miss an hour of sleep that sleep is gone you can t make it up or get it back The truth is we have a divine sleep account that is owed to us from the minute we are born Every time you miss a minute hour or day of sleep that time is automatically put into your sleep account to save for a later date Upon waking be sure to drink oz of lemon water to flush out the liver lymphatic system lemon squeezed per oz of filtered water This will also help with any puffiness or swelling
