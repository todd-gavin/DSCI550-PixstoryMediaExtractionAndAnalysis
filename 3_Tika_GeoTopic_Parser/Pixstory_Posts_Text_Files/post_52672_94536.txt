Everyone asks me why are you alone why are you all by yourself why don t you go talk to them and so on but I give the same answer every single time I am happy I am someone who enjoys my own company I am someone who enjoys my own world in books I am someone who loves to dance alone with no audience I am someone who prefer to travel hr every day for college with some music and my headphones only rather than having a company and I am happy Hi I am Khushi and I am alone and happy
