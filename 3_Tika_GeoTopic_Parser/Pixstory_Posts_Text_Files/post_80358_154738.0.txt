Neymar, being a technically rich player, is famous for his tricks and skills on the field. He often humiliates opponents with his superior plays and mastery. He added a new victim to the list but it was none other than his own teammate Sergio Ramos.
During a training session ahead of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) clash against Benfica in the Champions League, the Brazilian was spotted nutmegging the Spanish defender. He found Ramos off caught and executed the nutmeg.
Reacting to this, Kylian Mbappe was seen having an uncontrollable laugh alongside Neymar and Achraf Hakimi. Ramos, who was embarrassed, went on to hug Mbappe to calm down his big laugh.

It seems like the alleged rift between Neymar and Mbappe has gone down. Ramos, who played a vital role as a mediator, has somewhat succeeded in fixing the issue.
Kylian Mbappe wants to leave PSG in January transfer window
Spanish outlet MARCA dropped a bombshell when it reported that PSG star forward Kylian Mbappe has informed the French club that he wants an exit in the January transfer window.
The French forward is unhappy with his current club and feels betrayed by it. It is reported that the club has failed to fulfill the promises made during the new contract.
Liverpool are being considered as a serious option for the 23-year-old forward. Real Madrid, on the other hand, will not have the opportunity to sign him as PSG have made it clear that they wonâ€™t hear any offers from the Spanish club.
Mbappe will be seen in action against Benfica on Tuesday (October 11). Both PSG and Benfica have 7 points each in their 3 games. However, Lionel Messi is not part of the group as he is still recovering from a calf niggle.
