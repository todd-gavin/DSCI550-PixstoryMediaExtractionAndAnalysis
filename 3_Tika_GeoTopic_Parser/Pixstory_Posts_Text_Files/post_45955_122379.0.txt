At least 15 people were hurt when a drunk driver from New Mexico ploughed through a Native American culture march in the state's western region without a valid licence, according to officials, US News reported. 

According to court documents, Jeff Irving, 33, who was detained late on Thursday, was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated, escaping from police, and injuring paradegoers as well as two Gallup police officers who attempted to stop the vehicle. 

According to a statement from the New Mexico State Police, there is no cause to believe that the crime was committed for racial or religious reasons. There was no fatality. According to New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, those harmed, including the police officers, primarily had minor wounds.

Many among the crowd of thousands lining the parade route in front of businesses that sell Native American jewelry, arts and crafts captured the chaotic scene on video.

Letâ€™s see if they get justice or are marginalised like every time.
