Open the window I will take you To the roaring river of life The water of this river does not return to the source It is better not to neglect from the beginning Open the window Blow in the morning Sunrise from behind the window Life shines on blacks Get up the war is over Song of Peace Whispers of life try Open the window Life The water of this river does not return to the source
