Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has suggested that Manchester United should re-sign Danny Welbeck as a panacea to their attacking woes following their turbulent start to the 2022-23 campaign.
  
Ferdinand was impressed by the performance of Welbeck who inspired Brighton to a 2-1 against United at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Welbeck was a torn in the flesh of his former side as he continually proved the Red Devil’s defense and paid off when he provided the assist for Brighton’s first goal. 
Ferdinand is now optimistic that Welbeck will effectively serve as a backup striker to the wantaway Cristiano Ronaldo this season should United bid for his signature.

The erstwhile United defender made this known via his YouTube channel (Rio Ferdinand Presents Five) in the following words: 

“Danny Welbeck starts for Man United today [Sunday] in this game. Welbeck walked out of that tunnel and you could see, shoulders back, chest out, thinking – ‘I will terrorize these two [Martinez and Maguire]’. 
That’s how he played today, he looked like prime-time Danny Welbeck at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid 10 years ago.

On today’s (Sunday) performance, no doubt. If you want a back-up striker, you wouldn’t go far wrong with Danny Welbeck.

Say to him, ‘you’re going to play 15/20 games over the season, fill in for Cristiano’. It gives us the legs, gives us the movement – the running behind defenders like he did today and it frees up the space for the likes of Bruno [Fernandes].”

Welbeck scored 29 goals in 142 appearances during his six-year spell at United before joining Arsenal in 2014. He has spent the last two years of his career at Brighton.
