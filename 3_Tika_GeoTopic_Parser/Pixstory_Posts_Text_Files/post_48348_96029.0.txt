There is also a law called Computer Fraud & Abuse Act (CFAA) [1986] if someone does any unlawful activities with a computer to obtain any documents or commit fraud activities or transmit harmful messages or items, this act pleads them guilty. 

There are Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act to check up on your financial transactions, Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) [2003] – which prevents sending deceptive headlines. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) [1998] – requires certain websites and online service providers to attain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from minors under the age of 13.

There is no single law regulating online privacy. Instead, a patchwork of federal and state laws applies. Yes of course someone it rests upon the ruling parties and majorities in the states. Know your laws so that you can be safe.
