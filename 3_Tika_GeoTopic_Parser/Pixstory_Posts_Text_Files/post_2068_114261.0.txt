More troubling news has come to light in the wake of the devastating mass shooting regarding the shooter.

According to reports by authorities, the parents of the shooter seemingly could have taken action to prevent the massacre, yet didn’t. In fact, some might say they encouraged his violent behavior.

There were allegedly two prior violent incidents involving the shooter, including a suicide attempt and an incident in which he threatened to kill “everyone” with a collection of knives that he owned. In that incident, police responded and seized a dagger, sword, and 16 knives.

Yet, despite all of this, his father helped him obtain firearms legally, going as far as being his sponsor so that he could legally possess the firearms since he was 19.

Oddly enough, despite these threats and police responses, he managed not to be flagged by the states red flag laws which would have prevented him from purchasing the firearm.
