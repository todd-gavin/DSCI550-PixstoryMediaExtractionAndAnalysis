The last time Federer was seen on a tennis court was at Wimbledon a year ago. He had reached the quarterfinals when he was defeated by the Polish Hurkacz who was then eliminated by Berrettini. After that match Federer never played again and despite August is his birthday, he doesn&#39;t seem to have the intention of hanging up his racket On the contrary, he can&#39;t wait for September to arrive when the Laver Cup will be held in London, the tournament in which six of the best European tennis players will challenge opponents from the rest of the world The Swiss will be paired with Nadal in doubles I love the Laver Cup and I&#39;m super excited to be back at the O Arena in London one of the most beautiful cities in the world Federer said he apparently has no thought of stopping Words echoed by his agent I know Roger well enough to knowing he is still hungry to compete said Tony Godsick His goal is to get back to the circuit and try to close with a success
