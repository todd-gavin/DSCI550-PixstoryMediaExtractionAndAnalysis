 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart and the pleasantness of a friend springs from their heartfelt advice Proverbs Henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you John And the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the Friend of God James There was a man all alone he had neither son nor brother There was no end to his toil yet his eyes were not content with his wealth For whom am I toiling he asked and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment This too is meaningless a miserable business Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor If either of them falls down one can help the other up But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up Also if two lie down together they will keep warm But how can one keep warm alone Though one may be overpowered two can defend themselves A cord of three strands is not quickly broken Ecclesiastes A friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity Proverbs
