Relations have been advancing on many fronts, including defense and trade. According to Chinese, China-Russia trade reached $130.4 billion, up 33.6 percent year on year from January to November. Trade volume between the two is likely to hit the target of $200 billion by 2024. (https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1243837.shtml)
 
A proposed mega-pipeline with investments of billions of dollars could deliver up to 50 billion cu. meters of Russian gas to China annually. The pipeline gas deal could also have implications for Europe as Russia increasingly looks at China and Asia as its customers for gas as opposed to the European Union.

There seems to be public support for China-Russia relations in China. The government-controlled newspaper Global Times claims to have conducted a survey in which more Chinese people consider China-Russia and China-EU relations more important than China-US ties. For the first time in 15 years, China-US ties did not top the list of the important bilateral relations. (https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1243624.shtml)
 
Both countries don't have a formal defense deal, but the military cooperation between the two has been increased in 2021, including joint naval patrols in the disputed South China Sea. Russia has opposed western criticism of China on human rights, Hong Kong and even on the investigations on origins of Covid-19. China for its part has been supporting Russian moves on Ukraine. The relations are likely to reach a higher plane in 2022.
