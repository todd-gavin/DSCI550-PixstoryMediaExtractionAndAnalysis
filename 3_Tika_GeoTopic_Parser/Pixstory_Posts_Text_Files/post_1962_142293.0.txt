With the announcement of Queen Elizabeth’s funeral following her death, the question came to mind of who from the United States will attend – more specifically, whether President Biden will invite Former-President Trump. Well, that question was answered, sort of. Buckingham Palace recently decided that the United States will not be allowed to bring a delegation. Instead, only President Biden and the First Lady will be permitted to attend.Following Biden’s inflammatory speech deriding Republicans, this could have been an opportunity to make a show of unity and attempt to bridge the divide between Republicans and Democrats right now. Unfortunately, the decision is now out of Biden’s hands. As the decision comes from Buckingham Palace, it must be respected.The funeral for Queen Elizabeth will take place on September 19 at Westminster Abbey. She will lie in state in Westminster Hall starting on Wednesday.
