The death of Punjabi musician Sidhu Moosewala shocked the country, with many mourning his passing. Several artists have been paying tribute to the late singer's legacy during the ongoing investigations into his death, and another Punjabi singing sensation, Diljit Dosanjh, has lately joined the bandwagon.

Diljit, who has a large fan base and is known for screaming out some incredible tunes, recently dedicated his Vancouver show to the late singer Sidhu Moosewala. On May 29, the musician was fatally shot in Punjab's Mansa district. 'This Show Is Dedicated To Our Brothers' was played in the background of Diljit's Vancouver show, making the audience tear up.

Several videos from the concert have leaked online, showing the Good Newwz artist singing special songs in the late Punjabi musician's honour.

 'One love,' the G.O.AT star wrote alongside a video from his performance on Instagram.
