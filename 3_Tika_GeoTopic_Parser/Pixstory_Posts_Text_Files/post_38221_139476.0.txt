The North London derby is easily one of the biggest matches in the English football calendar. There has been a never-ending debate as to which club is the better one and here are three reasons why Spurs boast the advantage for now...
1) Champions League Club! 
Yes, Tottenham Hotspur have returned to the Champions League this season whereas Arsenal would be playing on Thursdays instead. In fact, the Gunners last competed in the UCL in the 2016/17 season. To add to the misery, Tottenham pipped Arsenal to the Champions League last season. 
2) A better manager!
Mikel Arteta has proved that he is a world-class manager in his own right. But as of today, Antonio Conte is certainly a class above the Spaniard. The Italian tactician pulled the Spurs from midtable to a top-four finish last season, showing why exactly the North London side opted for him. 
3) Tottenham don't have the "Big game blues" 
Mikel Arteta's Arsenal have been exceptional. But if his side has come short on one aspect, it is surely under pressure in the big games. The Gunners disappointed against the PL's other top six last season whereas the Spurs had a better showing against Man City and Liverpool. To add to this, Conte's side were exceptional in the final few games of the season, sealing a top-four finish.
