Coronavirus disease COVID mortality rates have been steadily decreasing over the globe as immunisation rates against COVID rise Despite this many nations still confront difficulties in getting and providing sufficient vaccines Vaccine reluctance and the introduction of new SARS CoV mutations capable of bypassing protection might further hamper global immunisation efforts All of these elements point to the need of finding effective therapies for COVID According to a study published in the journal Communications Biology researchers at John Hopkins University have proposed using the drug sulforaphane isothiocyanate to treat SARS CoV and seasonal human coronavirus HCoV OC illnesses which are both caused by the same virus Prior to inoculation with either the HCoV OC or the wild type strain of SARS CoV the VeroC cells were treated for one to two hours with SFN Both coronaviruses were shown to be efficiently inhibited by SFN in a dose dependent manner Both HCoV OC and SARS CoV had median inhibitory concentrations IC of micromolar M and micromolar M respectively The same test was carried out in human diploid fibroblast cell line MRC with just HCoV OC to corroborate these results A slightly higher IC of nM was found in this experiment but the findings were almost identical As with the cytotoxicity the cytotoxic dosage TD ranged widely over the whole range of concentrations tested SARS CoV infected Caco cells infected with SFN showed a dose dependent decrease in viral RNA with an IC of M for SFN treatment For SARS CoV strains with the well known D G mutation SFN is equally efficient in Vero C cells against the Delta and Omicron versions with an IC of and microM respectively
