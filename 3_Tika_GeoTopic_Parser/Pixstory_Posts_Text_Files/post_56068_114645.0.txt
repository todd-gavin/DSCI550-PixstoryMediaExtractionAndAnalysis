Fireflies in the Garden

BY ROBERT FROST

Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,

And here on earth come emulating flies,

That though they never equal stars in size,

(And they were never really stars at heart)

Achieve at times a very star-like start.

Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.

Fireflies In The Garden” As a Representative of Natural Beauty: Robert Frost, as per his reputation, suddenly opens the poem syncing the whole theme of the poem with its title. He states that when the night comes, real stars appear in the skies. The earth is full of small stars which are competing with the real stars. Sometimes, they emulate them despite their short stature that means they are small in size but large in beauty. Although they are not stars themselves, they achieve the status of stars as they are also like stars. The reason is that they also do not produce light in the day.
