The idea that food is only fuel and must be earned is a toxic notion that can create disordered eating and eating disorders.

Food is much more than fuel. It is a social and cultural part of our lives. Solely focusing on food as fuel—or good vs. bad—isolates you from enjoying and embracing food as a deeper and more meaningful part of your life.

This effect is often seen after a major holiday when advertisements and articles push for detoxes or cleanses to “reset” or purge your body of “bad” food choices. 

Not only are these practices unscientific and potentially dangerous, but they also push the idea that enjoying food must come with a consequence.

Moreover, not all physically beneficial components of food provide fuel. Food is full of nutrients, phytochemicals, water, antioxidants, and other essential factors that contribute to an overall thriving body but provide little in the way of actual fuel.
