The Los Angeles Lakers have started their annual pre-draft workouts this week. One player the team worked out is Georgia Tech wing Jordan Usher.

Usher averaged 14.8 points per game, 6.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game during his senior season. While diving into this 2022 NBA Draft class, I have become very intrigued by Usher and think he would be an excellent fit for the Lakers. Although Usher has only played in the NCAA Tournament once during his five-year college career, he has significantly improved during each college season.

I think Usher could be a realistic Undrafted Free Agent option for the Lakers, and if so, I think he could be another hidden gem for the scouting department.

 

Top Three Player Traits

1. Athleticism

The No. 1 thing that pops off when you turn on Jordan Usher’s film is how athletic he is. Usher is an explosive player and does a great job of finishing above the rim. He isn’t just a vertical player, however. Usher is quick and shifty while making cuts and coming off pin downs and other screens. Having someone as explosive as Usher playing next to LeBron James and Anthony Davis would be an excellent fit for the Lakers. Kind of similar to how we saw Malik Monk fit next to the two Lakers superstars. 

Playmaking

During his interview following his workout with the Lakers, one of the players Usher compared his game to was Draymond Green. Although Usher only averaged 2.9 assists during his final season at Georgia Tech, he is an excellent passer. Georgia Tech ran many actions that involved having Usher playing at the elbow and allowing him to be a playmaker and decision-maker

3. Hustle Plays

The first play I saw while watching Jordan Usher’s tape was him diving on a loose ball and saving it for his team. That is the kind of player that the Lakers were sorely missing last season. Outside of Austin Reaves and Stanley Johnson, it was hard to find a player to dive on the floor for a loose ball.
