It created mixed responses among moviegoers, Twitter experts, Academic board members and actors branch with the inclusion of this new award at Oscars this year.

The decision was announced by Twitter and the Academy last week. Twitter users can vote for their favorite films online using the #OscarsFanFavorite up to 20 times a day till March 3. The move intends to regain Oscar’s lost popularity and promote more cultural bonding without losing its class. As Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg rightly puts in - People believe we are snooty.

It seems, Oscar, a non-profit organization had to relook into its apartheid towards box office juggernauts since Oscars telecast viewership drastically dropped in recent years. In 2021, it stooped to an all-time low of 9.85 million viewers.

Twitter users are excited about their favorite films on the Academy eligible list. Early votes are inclined towards Netflix’s Tick, Tick … Boom!, Sony’s Cinderella and Johnny Depp’s Minamata from respective diehard fans.

The 94th Academy Awards to be held on March 27 will announce the film selected by Twitter users and three luckiest winners will ensure a paid trip to attend the ceremony at Los Angeles to present an Oscar!
