It isn't a surprise when its said that Sir Alex Ferguson is the best manager of Aberdeen and arguably the best manager of all time. He dominated not only the Scottish league and won a near impossible European Cup w
Winners Cup with them, which everyone considered impossible. He then went ahead to conquer the English League with Manchester United, dominating the Premier League like no one ever had done and maybe will never do. He truly deserves this and more.
