Why is it always you with such takes? ðŸ˜…

Peer pressure can have a seriously negative impact on your mental health. It's often used to coerce people into doing things that they may not want to do or that they may not be best suited for. The sad reality is that peer pressure often leads to negative consequences, like feeling stressed out, anxious or depressed. In fact, studies have shown that peer pressure can even cause people to commit suicide.

The fact of the matter is that peer pressure is always negative - meaning that you're never really in control of what happens as a result. You may feel like you have no choice but to conform to the group, and this can cause huge psychological damage.

There's nothing wrong with being a little bit shy or reserved at times, but you shouldn't ever be coerced into doing anything that you don't want to do. The biggest misconception is that something good can come out of it but the truth is that be it for good reasons or bad, your boundaries are being violated. Even if it looks good from the outside, it completely butchers your ability and confidence of setting boundaries and takes away your agency from you. That, in long term, is not a good thing. Kids should be allowed to make mistakes to learn and shouldn't always be pressured into doing the right thing which is what you're referring as so-called positive peer pressure.
