Everyone has an special place in their heart for their dad as for me I am my dad's princess like every girl is.
I am really close to my dad then my mother every time I do a mistake or anything wrong first thing I will do to escape from my mother to my dad so that I can escape the punishment I will be suffering when I am in the hands of my mother I believe everyone has this time in their life it's possible that's sometimes mom has high placed then dad first but for me my dad has higher place as the same goes that daughter is a princess for their dad.
