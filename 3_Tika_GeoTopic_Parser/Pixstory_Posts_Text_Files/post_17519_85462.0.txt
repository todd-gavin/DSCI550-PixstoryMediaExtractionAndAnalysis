When the Los Angeles Lakers hoisted the Larry O’Brien trophy at the end of the 2019-20 season, they earned it through a hard-nosed defensive identity. Behind Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, and JaVale McGee, the Lakers swarmed teams at the rim, making life difficult on opposing offenses.

Since then, L.A. has decided to go a completely different route from the defense-first teams of the past two seasons. Instead, they focused on adding shooting, isolation scorers, and high-level transition playmakers.

What it led to has been the league’s 16th-ranked defense and even worse offense that has a tendency to stagnate amid all the isolation. So when Howard was asked to compare this year’s group to the championship team, he had little interest in doing so. “That’s a really tough question… We can’t go backwards,” Howard said.

“Different team, different season, so we can’t go backwards. It would be bad for us to try and go back and remember what we did two years ago. We’re a different team with a new style.”

When asked why things are so different, he pointed towards the mentality and play styles of all the new players. “I just think it’s a different team. We have a lot of scorers, I would say, one-on-one scorers who need a rhythm, need shots and stuff like that to get into a rhythm. It’s kind of been a half-court type of team, LeBron posting up, AD posting up, Russ posting up, Melo posting up. So we have our iso guy, THT too, so it’s just different.”

As Howard says, it’s very difficult to have a strong defensive identity when the roster is built with offense-first players. Especially with Davis missing a large portion of the season with injuries, the amount of players who put emphasis on defense is extremely limited.
