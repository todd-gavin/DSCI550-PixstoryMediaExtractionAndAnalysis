The Satsaran Pass, also known as the Satsaran Gali Pass, is located at a height of 3680 metres above sea level. The location is only open from June to October and serves as a base for trekking. This trail leads you through a forest to one of the stunning passes in the Jammu and Kashmir region, which includes a variety of flora, fauna, and avifauna. Although the climb is gradual during the hike, there isn't much climbing involved despite the distance to the pass. Even though it is a little drawn out, the tranquillity and serenity of the location more than make up for it as one begs for even more. Numerous well-known sites, including Satsar Lake, Nichnai Pass, Vishansar Lake, Zajibal Gali, Gadsar Lake, and Krishnasar Lake are located close to this pass.
