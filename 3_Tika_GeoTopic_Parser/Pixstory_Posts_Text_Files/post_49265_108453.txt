C mon y all moonchild moonchild That s how it s supposed to be Yeah all this pain and all these sorrows That s our destiny see You and my life was like this We gotta dance in the rain dance in the pain Even though we crash down We gon dance in the plane We need the night s scenery more than anyone else Only I can console myself nobody else It s okay to shed the tears But don t you tear yourself Moonchild you shine When moon rise it s your time C mon on y all Moonchild don t cry When moon rise it s your time C mon y all Moonchild you shine When moon rise it s your time This song is an allegory for melancholy and darker moments and how the day can be the darkest and the night can be the most liberating It s fine he continues if you choose to spend your time at night He contends that you must keep going even if you are in pain or suffocating during the day
