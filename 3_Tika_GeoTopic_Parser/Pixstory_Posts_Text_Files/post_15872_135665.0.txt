Abstract
Aims
We addressed the question whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) may contribute to cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Participants with type 2 diabetes with elevated cardiovascular risk or CKD from cognition substudies of two large trials were studied prospectively (CARMELINA: n = 2666, mean ± SD age 68.1 ± 8.7 years, CAROLINA: n = 4296; 64.7 ± 9.4 years). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) at baseline were related to cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and attention and executive functioning score (A&E)) in linear regression analyses, adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and treatment, at baseline and follow-up.
Results
CKD at baseline was more common in CARMELINA than CAROLINA (eGFR<60 in 72.6 % and 19.6 %, macroalbuminuria in 35.0 % and 4.1 %, respectively). Baseline eGFR was related to A&E in CARMELINA (b = 0.02 per 10 ml/min/1.73m2, 95%CI [0.01,0.03]). Baseline UACR was related to A&E in CAROLINA (b = −0.01 per doubling of UACR mg/g, 95%CI [−0.02,−0.002]). Baseline UACR predicted decline in A&E in CAROLINA (median 6.1 years follow-up; b = −0.01, 95%CI [−0.03,−0.0001] per doubling of UACR mg/g).
Conclusions
eGFR and UACR were associated with A&E in two cohorts with type 2 diabetes, enriched for CKD and cardiovascular disease. The small effect size estimates indicate limited impact of kidney dysfunction on cognition in this setting.
