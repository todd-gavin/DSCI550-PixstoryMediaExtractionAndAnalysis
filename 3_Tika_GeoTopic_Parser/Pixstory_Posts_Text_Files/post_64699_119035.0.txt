Ranbir kapoor starrer Shamshera released on 22 july 2022 estimates Rs 65-70 crore at the end of its theatrical run. ✔️🎬

Shamshera was released across 4,000 screens in the hope it could garner a handsome opening. I feel that content needs to be blamed instead of actors or co- actors .💫🌸
The movie is heading toward the flop tag which is very upset thing to directors,actors and ranbir lovers.📝📝

Shamshera is the second-widest release of the post-pandemic era, and is playing in over 4000 theatres, which means that occupancy on day one has been very low. The film has a tough road ahead
But it’s totally okay because we learn from our failures and our drawbacks .✔️
Definitely  it  is going to give ranbir a good lesson that would help him in his future .✔️✔️
As we all know comebacks are better than the setbacks 👌🏻
Ranbir kapoor surely is going to comeback strongerr !!!!!🙏
