Narwar under Maratha Rule :- Towards the end of the eighteenth century the fort was captured by Sindhia of the Marathas.


Interesting Legend :- A curious fact about the fort is that no Nat or gipsy ever enters the palace but always makes a long detour of several miles to avoid it. It is believed due to the treachery to a Natni, or female gipsy by the Raja several centuries ago, who had helped in delivering of a letter to friends of the Raja on the other hill by way of moving hand over hand on a rope, under the promise of delivery of half of his kingdom, when the fort was besieged.
