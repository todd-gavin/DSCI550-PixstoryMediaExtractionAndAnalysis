What s inside a black hole In the study the scientists were able to determine the mathematical description of the quantum state of the matrix model What s inside a black hole In the study the scientists were able to determine the mathematical description of the quantum state of the matrix model The American physicist Enrico Rinaldi along with his team at the University of Michigan has used quantum computing and computer learning to describe what is believed to be the interior of a black hole Scientists relied on the holographic principle which suggests that the two existing theories particles and gravity are equivalent to each other The complexity of ideas lies in the fact that they are built in different dimensions Both theories explain various dimensions but they differ by one in the number of dimensions they describe So for example gravity exists in three dimensions inside the geometry of a black hole but particle physics lives in two dimensions on its surface a flat disk Consider the black hole which due to its massive mass warps space time The black hole s gravity which exists in three dimensions mathematically connects to the particles dancing above it which exist in two dimensions As a result a black hole exists in three dimensional space but is perceived as a projection of particles Some scientists claim our entire universe is a holographic representation of particles and this could lead to a consistent quantum explanation of gravity
