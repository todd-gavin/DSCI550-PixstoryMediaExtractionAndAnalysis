Any thing happens in your life is good or bad but if we see it differently it must have any reason behind this as if something bad happens there would b a good reason behind this once i got an accident and at that day i realise that If i didn t get that accident i must b humiliated by some people on no reason and it would be a really bad experience more bad then my that accident
