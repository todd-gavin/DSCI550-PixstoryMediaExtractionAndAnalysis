In April 2021, user TrueIndology made a series of claims regarding Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar’s childhood, education, and how he gained the surname on the microblogging platform Koo, India’s alternative to Twitter. The account said, “Who took care of Ambedkar as a child? A Brahmin! / Who took care of Ambedkar’s education? A Brahmin! / Who gave his surname Ambedkar? A Brahmin / Who funded Ambedkar’s foreign education? A Hindu nationalist king Sayajirao Gaekwad. / Who married Ambedkar? A Brahmin lady. / Who married Ambedkar’s sisters? Brahmins. / Whom do Ambedkarites abuse? Hindus & Brahmins!”

Later, in October 2021, Twitter user BharadwajSpeaks made a similar claim, baring two — about Dr Ambedkar’s wife and sisters. Thus implying that the major accomplishments of Dr Ambedkar took place because of kind-hearted Brahmins. Yet he “abused” Brahmins. This tweet gained over 5000 retweets. Twitter has suspended this account and as of publishing the article, the account is inaccessible. The readers should note that BharadwajSpeaks previously owned the Twitter account called TrueIndology which is infamous for sharing fictitious historical claims. In 2017, Alt News published a three-part series called ‘TrueIndology or TrueFraudology‘ that documented and debunked 17 accounts of misinformation by TrueIndology.

The account posted an identical tweet in April 2021, which gained over 10,000 retweets. Back then, multiple pro-BJP Facebook pages — PMO Report Card, We Support Arnab Goswami, The Right Side, and Vedic Science, Fighting AntiIndia Elements, Indian Right Wing Community — shared the screenshot of BharadwajSpeaks’ tweet.

Several social media users have made the same claim repeatedly. Twitter user JoyantaKarmoker tweeted the same in 2022 on the occasion of Dr Ambedkar’s Birthday.

FACT-CHECK
CLAIM 1: “Who took care of Ambedkar as a child? A Brahmin”
Analysis: Ramji Sakpal, Dr Ambedkar’s father, passed away in 1913. At that time, Dr Ambedkar was in his early twenties. Therefore, throughout his childhood i.e., the first 18 years of his life, his father was the de facto guardian.
