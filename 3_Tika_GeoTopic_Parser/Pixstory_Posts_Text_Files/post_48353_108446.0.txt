President Joe Biden fell while trying to get off his bike at the end of the ride on Saturday. The incident happened at Cape Henlopen State Park near his beach home in Delaware. He is safe.

“I'm good,” he told reporters after U.S. Secret Service agents rapidly helped him up. “I got my foot caught” in the toe cages.

The president had decided to pedal over to a crowd of well-wishers standing by the bike trail. Biden, who was wearing a helmet, took the spill when he tried to dismount, apparently falling on his right side and rolling onto his back before being helped up.

He collected himself and even spent several minutes chatting to people who fathered around him to watch him a bike. According to a White House statement, he needed no medical attention and he was fine. 

Biden attended Mass at St. Edmond Catholic Church in Rehoboth Beach in the late afternoon. When he arrived after services, bystanders cheered and reporters yelled questions about how he felt. The president smiled and took three hops while rendering a motion with his hands like a jumping rope.
