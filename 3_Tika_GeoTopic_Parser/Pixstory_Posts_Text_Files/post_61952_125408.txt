A fan favorite character from the Game of Thrones series could be back on our screens before we know it A sequel to the mega hit series centered around the character Jon Snow appears to be in the works The first of our Jon Snow TV show predictions is that he reunites with the only surviving dragon from the Game of Thrones series If you watched the show you would know that Daenerys Targaryen received her three dragons from her marriage with Khal Drogo the Dothraki leader After Khal Drogo died Daenerys had him buried and set ablaze She then walked into the fire with her dragon eggs and survived Her Targaryen bloodline gave her the immunity to fire and she became the Mother of Dragons after her eggs hatched She was the heir to the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms and the dragons helped her claim what was rightfully hers There were times when the dragons seemed to stand down to no one but Daenerys introduced them to Jon Snow Exploring the life with Wildlings Speaking of where we left off after the Game of Thrones finale there s sure to be something epic beyond the Wall for Jon Snow After killing Daenerys Jon was sentenced to prison for several weeks Then he is exiled to Castle Black to live out his days on the Wall Instead Jon decides to join the Free Folk on their journey beyond This was a more satisfactory ending to his journey in Game of Thrones while the entirety of the finale could have been better Jon is better off with the Wildlings than he was on death row after killing Dany
