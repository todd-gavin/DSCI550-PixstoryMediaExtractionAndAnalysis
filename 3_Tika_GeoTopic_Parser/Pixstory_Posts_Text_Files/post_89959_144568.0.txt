The story of ‘Just Like You’…I wrote this song years ago about people with low self-esteem or lack of self belief. Someone once said to me that the would love to play guitar but they didn’t have any ‘natural musical talent’ and that they were probably ‘tone deaf’. I went onto explain that most musicians work very hard to be able to play and I for one couldn’t sing in tune when I started. I couldn’t stop thinking about how there are people in the world who really wanted to try something but the don’t dare step out of their comfort zone for fear of being jeered or laughed at. I for one, wasted so many years (and still do) listening to that negative voice in my head.I battle with it everyday but I’ll always try and focus on what makes me happy and find a way enjoy progressing and learning. The song is supposed to inspire people to go and do the things they want to do regardless of how good they become or how ‘successful’ they are. Just enjoy the art of learning and progression and you never know….you might even end up inspiring others….
