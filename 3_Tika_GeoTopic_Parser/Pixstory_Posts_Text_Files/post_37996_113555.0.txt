Paris Saint Germain have officially sacked Mauricio Pochettino. The manager has been sacked after a poor season and it is expected that he will be replaced by former Nice manager Christophe Galtier.

A lot was expected from Paris Saint Germain after a massive summer transfer window in 2021. The Parisians signed Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos, and Gianluigi Donnarumma among other stars to bolster their squad. PSG were termed by many as the favourites to win the 2021/22 UEFA Champions League title. However, the "dream team" failed and bowed out to Real Madrid in the round of 16 itself. 

To add to their misery, Mauricio Pochettino's side also managed to lose out on the French Super Cup and the Coupe De France to make things worse. Only winning the Ligue 1 title was not enough and PSG sacked Pochettino after a two-year stint at the club. 

PSG confirmed the sacking on Social Media with the following statement, "Paris Saint-Germain confirm that Mauricio Pochettino has ended his role at the Club. PSG would like to thank Mauricio Pochettino and his staff for their work and wish them the best for the future." Pochettino and his coaching staff have been paid a â‚¬15 million compensation fee after being relieved of their duties.

The announcement of Christophe Galtier is expected to be around the corner as PSG are set unveil him as their new manager.
