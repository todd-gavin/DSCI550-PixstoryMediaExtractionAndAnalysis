Gatka, an ancient Sikh martial art form which was becoming extinct, is now being revived in Punjab. The Sikh martial art which originated in Punjab in the 15th century was included by the Sports Ministry as part of one of the four indigenous sports in the Khelo India Youth Games 2021. The Gatka sport is being taught in various institutions in Punjab as part of their sports programme. More women in Punjab are practising the martial art form to learn self-defence.

From Amritsar, Ravinder Singh Robin reports on how the inclusion of Gatka under the Khelo India programme has helped revive the sport, which had become defunct over the years.
