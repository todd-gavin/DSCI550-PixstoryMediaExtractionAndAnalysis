Hamdullah Moheb, a former national security adviser to Afghanistan, said reports that fugitive President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani might return to the country were baseless.

 He tweeted a joint photo of himself with Ashraf Ghani, who was apparently in the UAE, calling the reports "baseless rumors."

 Earlier, Heshmat Ghani Ahmadzai, the brother of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, said there was talk of Mr Ghani "returning" to Afghanistan, saying that if Ashraf Ghani's return was "effective", he would be ready to return to Afghanistan.  .

 He also said that Mr. Ghani was not interested in returning to politics but wanted to be "socially active."

 In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Mr. Ahmadi said that he had met and was in contact with his brother in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.

 Heshmat Ghani Ahmadzai said that the visit of Abdul Salam Rahimi, the former Afghan Minister of Peace to Kabul and his meetings with Taliban officials had nothing to do with the issue and that Mr. Ghani had "no contact" with Mr. Rahimi.
