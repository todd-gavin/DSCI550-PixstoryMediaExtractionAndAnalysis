Rajamundhry in the s was a small sleepy town on the river Godavari Located at the riverhead it was a rich trading town from where goods were transported across the tributaries My earliest memory is of going to the river with my father and brothers for early morning dips One morning I lost my footing and was being swept away I clutched at my younger brother and got a foothold even as he was on the verge of drowning Our morning jaunts stopped that day Our sprawling house on the river road was simple The no frills lifestyle was embodied by my father who gave up his job under the British as head of villages earning gold coins He also took to wearing khadi which he wore to the end of his years My mornings started with an oil bath after which I was left out in the sun you see my father thought I was not growing adequately and needed some Vitamin D After tiffin my favorite idlis served by my mother or sisters I was taught the R s by my father or a tutor who came by periodically Together they succeeded in coaching me for a class ahead I only stepped into school in class five When I went for the entrance test I was eligible for class four The next day I trotted along with my father for the results We scanned the list and my father s face paled I hadn t made it His eyes fell on the class five list and there I was In all innocence I had sat where they were testing for class five and qualified When asked to register my name I didn t have a proper name as I d been only called Babu small boy at home My father presented me three names to choose I chose the one that was to become my identity and my destiny A lot of planning has gone into my work but as you will see most things that define me have been serendipitous As told to Priya Sarkar wife continues tomorrow
