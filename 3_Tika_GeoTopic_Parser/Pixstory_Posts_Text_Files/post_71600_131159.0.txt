Buddha’s teachings had a universal appeal. Love and compassion were
central to them. He defined spiritual inquiry not in terms of anunchangeable, eternal being that permeates the universe, but as a processof experiencing a mental state where all false desires become extinct. 
Buddhadid not believe in an unchanging, static reality. He experienced the ‘eternal’reality of change, which was the substance of life – like the water in theriver which may appear to be the same on the surface but in fact is constantlychanging. He did not claim to have revealed all dimensions of truth. Hewas humble enough to tell his disciples:
I have given you a handful of truths, but besides these, there aremany thousands of other truths, more than can be numbered.”
(The Discovery of India)
Buddha gave India and the world a new perspective on spiritual and social
life, and asked man to follow the middle path, ‘between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification’. He made man experience theradiance of ‘nirvana’ – a state of bliss after freeing oneself totally from desiresand inner turbulence. Nehru writes in The Discovery of India:
“Seated on the lotus flower, calm and impassive, above passion anddesire, beyond the storm and strife of this world, so far away heseems, out of reach, unattainable. Yet again we look, and behind those still unmoving features there is passion and an emotion,strange and more powerful than the passions and emotions we haveknown. His eyes are closed, but some power of the spirit looks outof them and a vital energy fills the frame. 
The ages roll by andBuddha seems not so far away after all; his voice whispers in our ears and tells us not to run away from the struggle, but calm-eyed,to face it, and to see in life ever greater opportunities for growth and advancement.”
