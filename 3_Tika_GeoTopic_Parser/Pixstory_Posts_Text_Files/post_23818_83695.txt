WHO epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove has shared an important Twitter thread on the BA sub variant of Omicron which is more transmissible than the BA strain Based on available data of transmission severity reinfection diagnostics therapeutics and impacts of vaccines BA sublineage of Omicron should continue to be considered a variant of concern and should remain classified as Covid Omicron the global health body said WHO further said that reinfection with Covid Omicron BA following infection with BA has been documented The initial data from population level reinfection studies suggest that infection with BA provides strong protection against reinfection with BA it added WHO will continue to monitor the BA lineage and has requested countries to continue to be vigilant to monitor and report sequences and to conduct independent and comparative analyses of the different sublineages Calling on public health authorities to keep a strict vigil over the variant the WHO has said BA sublineage should continue to be considered a variant of concern and that it should remain classified as Omicron BA differs from BA in its genetic sequence including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins Several studies have shown that BA has a growth advantage over BA WHO said studies are underway to understand the reasons for this growth advantage but initial data suggest that BA appears to spread faster than BA which currently remains the most common Omicron sublineage reported Source
