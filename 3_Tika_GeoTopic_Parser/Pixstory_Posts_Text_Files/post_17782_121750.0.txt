The bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto takes about two hours and 15 minutes, just the right amount of time to pull off a cartoonishly over-the-top action movie. It's a high-stakes game of hot potato, choreographed and executed by "Atomic Blonde" director David Leitch. A self-deprecating Brat Pitt wears a bucket hat and oversize specs, Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson play "twin" hit men Lemon and Tangerine.

"Bullet Train" feels like it comes from the same brain as "Snatch," wearing its pop style on its sleeve. The film is a "Kill Bill"-level mix of martial arts, manga and gabby hit-man-movie influences. These characters are identified by giant on-screen labels superimposed over their flash-frozen mugs.
Director David Leitch and screenwriter Zak Olkewicz make each of these characters twice as eccentric as necessary. Sandra Bullock voices Maria (as voiced by Brad Pitt) Ladybug is the bug in Pitt's ear, guiding the newly nonviolent tough guy. There appear to be more murderers crammed together here than Agatha Christie could fit on the Orient Express.

Brad Pitt's character, Ladybug, gets his hands on the bulletproof Tumi fairly easily early on. Fight scenes feel relatively original, which is impressive unto itself. Director David Leitch tends to approach these standoffs the way Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire once did their dance numbers. There's something callous about how casually Leitch takes human life. "Bullet Train" is one of the most ambitious pandemic-made blockbusters to be released.

It's essentially a live-action cartoon, with high-profile cameos sprinkled in for added laughs. Director David Leitch is trying his darnedest to channel the likes of Tarantino and Ritchie. This may be a fun enough ride, but such punchlines drive home that neither the characters nor the film they inhabit are particularly deep.
