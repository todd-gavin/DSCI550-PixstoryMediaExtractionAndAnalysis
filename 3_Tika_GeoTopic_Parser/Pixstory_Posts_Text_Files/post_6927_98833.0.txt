I am reminded of the old proverb – the wheels of justice turn slowly but grind exceedingly fine. But in the case of the Gurugram parents who lost their only son to cyberbullying two years ago, neither the wheels of justice seem to move nor the grinds of law seem to care.

17-year-old Manav jumped off his eleventh-floor balcony – instantly dying – on May 4, 2021. A year and a half ago, when I met his parents – Manoj Kumar and Tanuja Singh – in their Gurugram apartment, the couple said they reached their apartment’s ground floor, hearing the screams, only to find the lifeless body of their son. Manav’s father told me, “My son’s skull got split into two halves. It was split open like a watermelon. I picked up pieces of his brain and pieced them together and took him to the hospital, making him lie on my lap. I was hoping that some part of him was still alive”. But Manav was declared dead.

A few minutes before the incident, Manav was having a meal with his parents. He was in the best of spirits, and at 10.45 that night, he went into his room to sleep. “Before sleeping, he went through his Instagram account, and he was shocked to find many defamatory posts against him. He was being accused of sexual misconduct, and he was being cyberbullied and trolled. At 11.23 that night, he sent us a message from his phone bidding us farewell, and he jumped off his balcony soon after,” said Tanuja Singh, Manav’s mother.
