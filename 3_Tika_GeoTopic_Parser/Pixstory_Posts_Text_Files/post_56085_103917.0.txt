A Red, Red Rose by Robert Burns 

O my Luve is like a red, red rose
That’s newly sprung in June;
O my Luve is like the melody
That’s sweetly played in tune.

So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
So deep in luve am I;
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a’ the seas gang dry.

Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi’ the sun;
I will love thee still, my dear,
While the sands o’ life shall run.

And fare thee weel, my only luve!
And fare thee weel awhile!
And I will come again, my luve,
Though it were ten thousand miles.

The highly acclaimed romantic expression of comparing a women’s cheeks to a rose is believed by most to have begun in this poem. It describes the speaker’s deep love for his or her beloved and pledges that this love will last longer than human life and even the planet itself, remaining fresh and constant forever. Even after the seas have evaporated and the earth has decayed, the speaker will still love the beloved. This love will endure until their own lives have ended and even until all human life has ended.
