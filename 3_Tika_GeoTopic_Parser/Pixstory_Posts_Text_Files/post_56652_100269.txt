Carving out some aloneness the space to breathe and meditate is imperative We need time to cultivate ideas feel through concepts and simply be as a human being instead of constantly engaging with the world In today s frantic age I think it should be one of our greatest commitments Peaceful people who know themselves and don t feel besieged usually act kindly and with compassion and don t do a lot of the awful things that we are capable of as humans So let s stop feeling guilty for taking some moments for ourselves Everything we experience emotionally or physically is the result of chemical reactions in our bodies These reactions are responsible for negative feelings and experiences but they are also the reason for our joy and positivity Love happiness compassion these are all the result of a bunch of hormones that when in balance come to the rescue in times of need Endorphins serotonin dopamine and oxytocin are what we call the happy hormones They help us have a higher tolerance to pain and physical stress they regulate mood and help prevent depression making us happy and sociable They guide us in the direction of love and are the reason we strive towards our goals and feel satisfied when we reach them Happiness shouldn t be some far off goal It should be a daily reality And it can be when we remember that it s the little things in life that bring us the most joy The following exercise is going to ensure that you feel happiness and joy every day Grab a pen and paper sit down and get ready to get stuck in Write down small things that make you happy Focus on little events or activities that are unique to you Holidays and birthdays are common to everyone so they don t make the list This should be a list of happiness inducing activities that occupy a special little place in your soul and that are part of what makes you who you are
