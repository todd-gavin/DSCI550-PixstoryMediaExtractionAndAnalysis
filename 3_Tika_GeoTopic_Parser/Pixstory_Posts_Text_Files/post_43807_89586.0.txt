Lionel Messi is one of the most recognisable characters on the planet, with the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner developing a reputation that has allowed his celebrity status to transcend sport during his time at Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.

Given his global image, he's a marketing dream, and he's worked on some of the most lucrative contracts in football history, with top clubs in Spain and France willing to spend big to benefit from his incredible skill set.

Who, on the other hand, oversees Messi's career and acts as an agent, allowing the all-time great to excel on the field? GOAL investigates.

What is the name of Lionel Messi's agent?
Messi's journey to the top of the international game began in Rosario, Argentina, with the local side Grandoli.

Before moving up to Newell's Old Boys, his father, Jorge, tutored the precociously gifted talent at that point.

Messi's family realised he would need hormone injections for a development deficit issue when he was 13 years old, and although not being impoverished, they realised they would need help paying those expenditures.

Jorge contacted Barcelona and arranged for his son's trial in Catalunya, acting as his representative in the process.

"Even today he is still like that. He has never told me, 'I’m grown up and the best player in the world'.

"The other day I mentioned a couple of things to him. I’m still the same as a father as when I was his coach at Grandoli."

Are there any additional clients for Jorge Messi?

Jorge has aided in the development of a Messi brand that today encompasses nearly every aspect of sporting, retail, sponsorship, and gaming.

Jorge's time is spent in football circles ensuring that Lionel's every desire is met, with little opportunity or necessity for him to get connected with anybody else.
