Yess, 8 months have passed in 2022 and we are in September now.
September is a wonderful month. The weather is not as hot as it is in summer, and the air is just getting a little brisk. School should be back in session, as people gear up the colder weather. Summer is left behind as the anticipation of autumn is near.
For it’s a long, long while from May to December, But the days grow short when you reach September. 
Hahaha ha
