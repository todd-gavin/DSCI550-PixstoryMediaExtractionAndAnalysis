What a match, what a game, just cricket at its best. The pitch was really tricky and the ball was holding up a lot and the batsmen had a tough time to deal with the bowlers.
Mumbai Indians were batting first, Rohit Sharma fell early for 3 runs and Ishan Kishan only managed to get 14. Brevis and Suryakumar Yadav managed to stablise the innings. Brevis scored 29 of 19 and Yadav managed to get 52 of 36 balls against his former side. Varma also played well scoring 38 runs, in the end Pollard scored 22 of 5 balls. Rasikh Salam impressed with the ball, only giving away 18 runs in three overs. Umesh Yadav bowled well again, taking one wicket and giving away 25 runs. Pat Cummins bowled well up until his last over, he took 2 wickets.

MI bowled very well up front taking wickets regularly, Rahane fell for 7, Shreyas Iyer for 10, Billings for 17 and Rana for 8. Venkatesh Iyer played a good knock of 50 runs from 41 balls. Russell could also just manage 11. Then came the match winning knock Pat Cummins, he equalled the fastest 50 scored in IPL and went to score 56 runs of 15 balls. What a knock, what a player, it was his first match of the league this year and this was an amazing way to begin. He hit 6 sixes and 4 fours, on a pitch where everyone struggled he smacked the ball everywhere. He's going to be a great asset to KKR.
