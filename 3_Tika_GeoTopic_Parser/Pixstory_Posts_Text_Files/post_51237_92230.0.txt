What makes this film dangerous is that it is built on an element of truth and this everything it depicts takes on the colour of truth in the minds of the viewers. Yes many kashmiri pandits were killed during the terrible violent winter of 1990.
Â ' The kashmir files ' could have been a serious attempt to depict the tragic mass exodus of kashmiri pandits from the kashmir village in early 1990.
No doubt, the Kashmiri Pandits faced the most difficult time, but the reign of terror was against anyone and everyone who opposed terrorists. Many Muslims were killed. This film showing you the reality of truth and our prime minister shri Narendra modi ji also has shown interest in the movie The Kashmir Files He said We will watch the movie & will definitely give a reaction on it.
