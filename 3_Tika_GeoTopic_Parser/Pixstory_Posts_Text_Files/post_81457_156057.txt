Aaron Ramsdale labelled our defensive performance as outstanding as he dug deep to seal a seventh straight victory and beat Leeds United Bukayo Saka s first half strike grabbed all three points but equally important were the contributions at the other end including our shot stopper who made some crucial saves throughout the encounter to keep his clean sheet intact And while he admits it wasn t our most fluid football on display at Elland Road Aaron believes that grinding out a win with our backs against the way is equally satisfying Speaking post match he said As a whole as a collective we were outstanding defensively A win away from home at Leeds is a really tough ask and we ve done that Of course we want to win each week passing the ball but we found a way to win today and that s the most important thing But collectively I was shanking balls left right and centre Bukayo got a goal but couldn t get him into the game We were just losing duals and stuff but like I say from back to front the whole game we were outstanding defensively As well as seeing Patrick Bamford miss a penalty Ramsdale made a number of top stops denying Pascal Struijk from close range in the opening minutes before making himself big to deny Bamford as he raced through on goal That particular save put him in pain as he was struck in a sensitive area but he was delighted to suffer to help the team claim a ninth win from their opening top flight games for the first time in our history When asked about his best save he said The one with my nuts maybe Although it took a big effect on me I m still feeling a bit sick now I m just thankful I was there today I have been very critical of myself over recent games from the start of the season where goals have gone in and there s questions to be answered the following day So to help the team out today was great
