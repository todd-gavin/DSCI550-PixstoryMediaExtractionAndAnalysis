The US army has suspended a retired three-star general from a lucrative consultant’s role after a social media post seeming under his name taunted first lady Jill Biden’s support of abortion rights.

Former top army spokesperson Gary Volesky, who retired as a lieutenant general and earned a silver star for gallantry while serving in Iraq, was making $92 an hour advising military officers, staff, and students who were taking part in war games and other similar training.

A Twitter account under his name retorted to a statement from Biden that denounced the supreme court’s decision on 24 June to reverse its landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade which had established federal abortion rights.

“For nearly 50 years, women have had the right to make our own decisions about our bodies,” the Democratic first lady said about the ruling, which in effect prohibited abortions in more than half the country. “Today, that right was stolen from us.”
An account under Volesky’s name replied: “Glad to see you finally know what a woman is.” Some on the platform interpreted the statement as a verbal potshot at the Biden White House’s support for the transgender community.

On Saturday, an army spokesperson said the commander of the military branch’s integrated arms center, Lt Gen Theodore Martin, had suspended Volesky from his consultancy pending an investigation into whether the tweet in question overstepped decorum rules for retired officers.
