1. Canada: Poutine
Poutine is the French version of loaded French fries. More specifically, the fries are covered in melted cheese and brown gravy. They also add meat and/or vegetables on top if desired. These fries are typically homemade, instead of just being picked up at the nearest fast food joint.

2. Spain: Tortilla Espanola
A tortilla espanola is made up of potatoes and onions that are sauteed and baked into an egg. The American equivalent would be an omelette, though this version is lighter and fluffier. Tortilla espanola is enjoyed at any time of day, not just for breakfast. 

3. France: Crepe
Crepes are probably the most popular comfort food on this list, but also one of the hardest to make. If you're unfamiliar, a crepe is a thin pancake that can be filled with anything from fruit to chocolate to Nutella, or made savory with fillings like cheese and tomatoes. 

4. Japan: Oden
Oden is a dish that is usually served in Japan in the wintertime. It is a rather hearty dish, containing boiled eggs, radish, konjac, broth, and fish cakes. Like most things about Japanese culture, this recipe varies by region, with different parts of the country adding fish, vegetables or tofu.

5. Brazil: Pao De Queijo
Pao De Queijo is basically a Brazilian cheese bread that is baked into small rolls that can be served as snacks or for breakfast. They're made of milk, eggs, and cheese, and have a crispy texture on the outside, but remain soft on the inside. They're similar to those cheese biscuits at Red Lobster we all know and love here in America.
