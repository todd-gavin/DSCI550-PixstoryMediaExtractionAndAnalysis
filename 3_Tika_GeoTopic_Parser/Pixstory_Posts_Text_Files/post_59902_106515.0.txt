Today is Sidhu Moosewala's birthday, and he would have turned 29 years old.
The 'fearless' singer was known for speaking his opinion and was admired for his unbreakable ties with his family and mastery of his profession.

He never shied away from speaking his mind, regardless of the fact that he had to pay a price for all of it.

Moosewala has been trending on Twitter since midnight, as admirers showered their affection on the Punjabi singer's birth anniversary.

On May 29, criminals shot and killed the Punjabi singer, who had joined the Congress before the Punjab assembly elections.

The incident occurred just 24 hours after the Punjab government reduced his security.

Millions of admirers mourned the Punjabi singer's death, which was visible even at his 'antim ardas,' where millions of people from all walks of life gathered. This is only one example of how much the singer who was killed was adored.

On the 29th anniversary of his birth, supporters are expressing their grief on social media and seeking justice for his untimely demise.
