Negative Oil Prices, an unprecedented phenomenon occurred for the first time in April 2020. The world got shocked when the US oil benchmark WTI turned negative. It happened when coronavirus was in the initial phases of gripping the entire globe. With industries shut & traveling halted, crude demand fell sharply. In response, OPEC & its allies, including the USA announced a production cut of 9.7 mbpd. But such a huge cut in supply failed to stabilize prices. The oversupply coalesced with insufficient storage facilities forced the producers to pay the buyers to get rid of the piling crude, consequently causing negative prices. This was unfortunate news for WTI futures' investors. As for India, which imports 80% of its crude, it could have been good news but India doesn't import much crude from the US markets. The demand for oil was less in India as well, so there wasn't much incentive for Indian suppliers to import oil. Therefore, Indian refiners couldn't take much advantage of this situation. Amidst all of this, you might be wondering if individual customers were able to gain from this. Let me tell you one thing: Beware! The term negative price' might mislead you into believing that the next time such an incident occurs you would be getting paid for every barrel of petrol you purchase. Unfortunately, that's not how this works since petrol prices are affected by many factors like gasoline prices, taxes ... & not just crude benchmarks.
