The film charts the demonic possession of a sweet natured year old girl named Reagan and the lengths her mother goes to rid her daughter of the evil spirit Now years on it seems slightly less impressive than when it first premiered This isn t to undermine it completely it s still an exquisitely made and beautifully acted film and firmly deserves its classical status but scary it is not The Exorcist was one of the first films to deal with the idea of demonic possession and exorcism In the years since its release there have been dozens upon dozens of similarly natured horror films dealing with the likes of possession and exorcism None of these efforts are even remotely as well made as Friedkin s original tale but the fact remains that the idea is no longer as shocking as it once was The film itself has also been parodied and lampooned to death in the years following its release Is The Exorcist still the scariest film of all time After the likes of Saw and Hostel is there really anything left to be scared of Friedkin s film was released in s America where religion was more taboo than it is today Now with jokes about the Devil s sexuality and Jesus resurrection common in sitcoms like South Park there s less of a shock factor there Have we become too jaded by contemporary horror If Saw has made us less conscious of gore what is left to scare us
