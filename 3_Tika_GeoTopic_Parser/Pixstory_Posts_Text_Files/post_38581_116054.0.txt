On July 12, it was a friendly match between Manchester United and their arch-rivals Liverpool. United, under new boss Erik Ten Hag, were looking to begin their first pre-season with a victory, the Bangkok trophy, and have bragging rights over their arch-rivals. The match was being played at Rajamagala Stadium in Bangkok. Ten Hag is known for playing high-octane football, similar to Pep Guardiola.

  

United started with a strong side consisting of Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Jadon Sancho, and the first team XI. Meanwhile, the Liverpool side chose a mixture of youngsters and experienced players in the form of Allison, Luis Diaz, and Roberto Firminio to name a few. Harry Maguire was missing from action due to a slight knock he took and Cristiano Ronaldo was absent from the match for personal reasons, so Bruno Fernandes was made captain.

Liverpool was on fire from the getgo with Luis Diaz coming close to getting the lead, but he was thwarted by the heroics of David De Gea who made fine saves and had to rely on his defenders to get him out of a tight spot. Liverpool looked fast and inventive with their attacking creations.

In the 12th minute after a pass from Fernandes and sloppy clearance from Mabaya, it fell into Sancho’s foot who slot it past Allison. Man Utd 1-0 Liverpool.


In the 19th minute after a crazy run of play, Pool had the chance to level the scoreline through Carvalho who hits the post and Diaz also misses, Chambers had to level the score but he misses, and Man Utd kick it away from danger. It was a crazy play.


In the 30th minute before the water break, a poor defensive error by Liverpool players saw Fred dink the ball past Allison to double the lead for United. 


Klopp made his second team change bringing Liverpool B in the form of:


Alisson; Frauendorf, Matip, R. Williams, Tsimikas; Bajcetic, Clarkson, Milner; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jones, Clark. Except for Allison whole team was changed.
