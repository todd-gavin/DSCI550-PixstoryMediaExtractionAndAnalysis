A 2:20 minute-long CCTV clip where two youth are brutally attacked by five assailants is viral on social media as an incident from Delhiâ€™s Sangam Vihar. The video is viral with the claim that the victims are Hindus who were attacked by Muslims.

In the viral CCTV footage, it is visible that the two victims are passing by a narrow lane and five people approach them from behind. They quickly get into a scuffle. Later, one of the accused kicks a victim and hits him with a rock. The same is done by the other accused to the other victim. In the end, we see the accused dump the bodies of the victims in the drain. One of the victims appears to be mobile/alive, and the other seems lifeless.

The video has been shared on Twitter by one Joy Kumar Basak, who has requested people to retweet the video as much as possible.

Another Twitter user Rishi Raj Shanker has also shared the video.

Old video, false communal spin
We performed a keyword search on Google and came across various news reports on the incident published in December 2021. We also noticed that the viral CCTV footage that is being shared on Twitter has been recorded from a screen using a mobile device. The monitor where the video is being displayed has the full name of the person who possibly recorded the CCTV (Nitin Shukla) and his username on various social media platforms.

Taking this as a clue, we checked the YouTube channel of this user and found the viral bit on a live stream that was done on December 25, 2021. The viral bit appears at the 1:08:14 mark.
