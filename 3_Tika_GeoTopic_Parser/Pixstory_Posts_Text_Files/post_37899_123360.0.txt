Yes, the Premier League is back with a bang and we already have a few talking points from Game Week 1 itself. Here are the 3 major talking points from the weekend:



1) Tottenham Hotspur are potent! 

The Spurs beat Southampton 4-1 at home to kick off their campaign with a bang! Kulusevski stole the show as Antonio Conte's game plan worked out to perfection. Up next the Whites face Chelsea, this game could give a better picture of what the team is made of! 




2) Erling Haaland shines on his PL debut! 

Haaland's PL debut was heavily anticipated and the Norwegian #9 showed that he is here to stay. A penalty and a slick finish were enough to get the former Dortmund player his brace as Manchester City beat West Ham 2-0. Can Haaland end up as the top scorer this season? It has to be seen! 





3) Manchester United, Liverpool Drop Points!

Liverpool drew 2-2 against newly promoted Fulham as Manchester United lost 2-1 to Brighton at the Old Trafford Stadium. There were bright spots for the Reds as Darwin Nunez starred in the game. But United on the other hand would have to improve a lot if they are to finish in the top four this season under Ten Hag!
