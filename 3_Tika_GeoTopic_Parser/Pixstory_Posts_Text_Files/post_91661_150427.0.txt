I have always wondered how one is hired based on expertise, but expectations takeover on what the individual should be doing. It just baffles me, and trust me, it keeps happening even after experts over and over keep saying don't do it. 
There was a time when I was going through an article which talks about how very few successful companies let the expertise guide the company. Instead of a company telling them what to do, isn't it just defeats the purpose if you follow the later part? 
In my career, I have always tried to hire talent who can challenge me so that I can do better or guide them better. I have never been surrounded by individuals who try to please instead. I have to warn you if you try to follow what I just said it will never be easy, so all the best and better give it a shot. 
Bringing expertise is the goal of every company, so my dear friends let the expertise do their job, don't tell them what to do. You won't achieve anything other than always be on shopping spree for expertise.
