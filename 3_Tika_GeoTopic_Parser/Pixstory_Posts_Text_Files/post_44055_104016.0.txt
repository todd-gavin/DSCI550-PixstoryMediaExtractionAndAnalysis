Legendary Real Madrid left back Roberto Carlos has decided to include Cristiano Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi in his Ultimate Champions League XI team. Ronaldo has enjoyed a stellar career in the Champions League, winning it a massive 5 times - 1 time with Manchester United and 4 times with Real Madrid. Messi too, has enjoyed a fantastic career winning the trophy 4 times with Barcelona.

Ronaldo slightly holds the edge over Messi when it comes to the Champions League - with Ronaldo being the tournament’s leading goal scorer at 140 goals and Messi at 125.

Speaking to SportBible, Roberto Carlos has to say, “Cristiano represents exactly what the Champions League is and modern football. We will only have one Cristiano.”

The following players were able to make it to Roberto Carlos’ Ultimate XI: Iker Casillas; Cafu, Fernando Hierro, Fabio Cannavaro, Marcelo; Fernando Redondo, Casemiro, Zinedine Zidane; Francesco Totti, Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo.

Expanding a little bit more about his side, Carlos added, “It’s very hard to do the XI because there are so many amazing players I’ve had to leave out - Messi, Neymar and Vinicius Jr. I think we would lose because nobody in my team really defends! I like football with a lot of 
goals!"
