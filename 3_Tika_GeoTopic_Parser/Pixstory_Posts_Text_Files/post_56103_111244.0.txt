Warming Her Pearls
BY CAROL ANN DUFFY

for Judith Radstone

Next to my own skin, her pearls. My mistress
bids me wear them, warm them, until evening
when I'll brush her hair. At six, I place them
round her cool, white throat. All day I think of her,

resting in the Yellow Room, contemplating silk
or taffeta, which gown tonight? She fans herself
whilst I work willingly, my slow heat entering
each pearl. Slack on my neck, her rope.

She's beautiful. I dream about her
in my attic bed; picture her dancing
with tall men, puzzled by my faint, persistent scent
beneath her French perfume, her milky stones.

I dust her shoulders with a rabbit's foot,
watch the soft blush seep through her skin
like an indolent sigh. In her looking-glass
my red lips part as though I want to speak.

Full moon. Her carriage brings her home. I see
her every movement in my head.... Undressing,
taking off her jewels, her slim hand reaching
for the case, slipping naked into bed, the way

she always does.... And I lie here awake,
knowing the pearls are cooling even now
in the room where my mistress sleeps. All night
I feel their absence and I burn.

‘Warming Her Pearls’ by Carol Ann Duffy describes the relationship between the speaker and her mistress. There was a custom in the Edwardian period where servants were the pearls to get them warm so that it will shine more at night for their mistresses. So here too the speaker wears it in the day time and the mistress at night and the warmth of the beloved's heart are embodied in the poem. The secrecy of the relationship resonates with the pearls. The hungry urgency of a river inside the poet’s heart doesn’t fascinate the passions of the sea-like mistress. For this reason, the poet, troubled with stones of her lover’s inertness, says, “I burn”.
