Today is Menstrual Hygiene Day ! 🌸💪

Celebrated annually on May 28 to highlight the importance of good menstrual hygiene management at global level . It was initiated by the German-based NGO WASH United in 2014 .

But Guys , Do you know why this day is observed on 28 May ?? 🤔

Lemme tell you why - Because menstrual cycles average 28 days in length and people menstruate an average of five days each month . (May is the fifth month of the year.) ! 

It is meant to advance menstruation as a biological process so that people can menstruate without being cast out or missing out , without feeling fear or shame and without being treated like less or exposed to more vulnerabilities . It also raises awareness of the inability to afford the menstrual supplies needed to manage health and hygiene with dignity . 🌸

When she bleeds the smells I know change colour . There is iron in her soul on those days .  She smells like a gun . 💪❤️

Women complain about premenstrual syndrome , but I think of it as the only time of the month that I can be myself ! ❤️✅

Menstruation is just a way of your body letting go of something that is no longer needed ! ❤️

Happy Menstrual Hygiene Day 🌸💪
