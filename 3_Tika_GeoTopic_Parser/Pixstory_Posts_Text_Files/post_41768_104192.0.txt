According to a Cricket Australia press agency, Australia head coach Andrew McDonald has tested positive for Covid-19 and will join the team in Sri Lanka after a week of seclusion. 

IE reported that McDonald's first tour of Sri Lanka in six years, which includes eight limited-overs matches and two tests, kicks off his stint since taking over from Justin Langer last month. 

According to cricket.com.au, assistant coach Michael Di Venuto will lead the side in the first T20 encounter on June 7, while McDonald is anticipated to join the squad ahead of the second match. 

McDonald gave a favourable result on Tuesday afternoon, according to the report. Also, the Australia squad raised concerns about touring Sri Lanka, which is in the midst of an economic crisis, but the cricket board of the South Asian country has declared the tour will go on as scheduled.
