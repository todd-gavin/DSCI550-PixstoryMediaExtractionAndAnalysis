You do realize she's half fish, half human that live in the ocean and can talk under water perfectly and falls in love with a fully terrestrial human? Her skin color should probably be the least if your concerns if you care about realistic.
As for the argument that she's danish. Danish people can be black.
Third, yes movies with black native characters are much needed, so are those based on African mythology but black kids in America also read Disney. They love Cinderella and Ariel and Belle. They deserve to see their favorite princess look like them. For so long have people of color been forced to relate to white characters, you can do that once. Can't you?
People of color are sidelined in movies and TV shows, which not only denies them the opportunity to be seen as equals but also limits their potential earnings. This is especially true for BIPOC women, who are often portrayed as second-class citizens or sexual objects.
You all need to change its mindset if it wants to become more inclusive and reflect the world we live in today. By featuring more BIPOC characters onscreen, it can start changing the way people see them and make them feel more connected to their culture.
BIPOC representation is important in Disney because it contributes to a more inclusive and fair society for children. It's one thing to have a few token characters of color in a movie, but it's another thing altogether to actually have them play significant roles.
