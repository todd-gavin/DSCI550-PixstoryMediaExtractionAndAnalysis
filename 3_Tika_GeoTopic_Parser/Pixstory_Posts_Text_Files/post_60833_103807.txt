Writing helps me express my thoughts and emotions Much of my career leans towards writing too Even so I have struggled with writer s block quite often Personally some of these tips really helped me overcome the block Write whatever My teacher back in school told me to write whatever I felt like regardless of it having any structure So write whatever comes to your mind without thinking too much about grammar and stuff The minute rule Scrolling through Instagram I came across this post prompting people to do a task immediately if you know would not take more than minutes I jotted down any brilliant prompts I felt I can work on later immediately on my mobile when thoughts occurred to me Inspiration Change of sceneries does wonders Travelling has given me so much inspiration that it s hard to resist writing in general If that s not possible for you try asking a friend for a different perspective or tell them to give you ideas you can execute Appreciate It s so easy to criticize ourselves that we forget to appreciate the positive things about us Don t be too harsh on yourself if you re unable to write Try writing as much as you can Any amount of progress is still progress
