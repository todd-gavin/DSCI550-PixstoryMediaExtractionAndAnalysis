While it could be nostalgic to have movies be made in monochromatic coloring, it is also killing what Hollywood achieved back in that time—which is that "era". Trying to mimic it now would not only be disrespectful to the origins of it but would also make it lose its value. People would see nothing extraordinary looking at those legendary films.

It is not always necessary to copy and ruin a precious theme in the name of memories or homage, sometimes beautiful creations should be left alone to be appreciated by those who weren't present when they were created.

We have a new era of colors and VFX, why not stick to that or create something even better? People of our generation understand color, look for color. It is a more practical and a more accurate approach of showing the media. We have many more ways to play with color and I think as we move forward, it is important to make masterpieces with them instead of clinging to what's already been done.

About monochrome being used to bring out emotions in movies that talk about social issues like racism, I think it would be much to keep them in color so people could actually connect to it more and not think it's a thing of the past – especially when there's already enough denial of racism going on in our country because apparently it doesn't exist anymore.

I believe a legendary era of cinema should not be touched and devalued, especially when we have a lot more to explore. We should focus on making this era of cinema look like its own big thing so maybe the future generations could watch our movies and feel nostalgic instead of feeling ancient.
