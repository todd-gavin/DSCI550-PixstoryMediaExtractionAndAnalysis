Manchester City registered a 4-0 win against Southampton when the former hosted the latter in a Premier League fixture on October 8 (Saturday).
Since returning from the international break, the defending champions have been running riots. They beat arch-rivals Manchester United 6-3 followed by a 5-0 win over FC Copenhagen in the Champions League.
As expected, once again Pep Guardiola’s side were in top-notch form as they aim to achieve big targets this season. It only took them 20 minutes to open their scoring account. This time, surprisingly, it was defender Joao Cancelo on the sheet.
Cancelo picked up the ball passed by Phil Foden and then faked a shot to open up space in the box. He took a couple of touches before firing it into the goal using his left foot. The solo goal was welcomed by the City fans.

It took only 12 minutes for City to strike again, in the form of Phil Foden. Riyad Mahrez extended the lead just four minutes into the second half before goal scoring machine Erling Haaland completed the rituals in the 65th minute.
Everyone knows what we have to do: Pep Guardiola
"We score a lot of goals, the last two games we didn't concede one shot. Against United we were sloppy in the last minutes, concede two avoidable goals. I have a good feeling, everyone knows, rotate the team, everyone is involved. We need everyone, everyone knows what we have to do,” manager Pep Guardiola said in the post-match presentation.
City are currently sitting at the top of the Premier League points table with 23 points in 9 games. The result of the game between Arsenal and Liverpool on Sunday (October 9) will decide whether the Sky Blues will end this week as the toppers or not.
City will next lock horns against Copenhagen in the Champions League on October 11. They have been undefeated in the prestigious tournament so far this season.
