When my friends went abroad for their college, I wanted to send them off with a personalized gift. This is one of the easiest, low-budget gifts you could make and show your love to your close ones.
You will need a photo frame, a memorable photograph, a white marker, and double-sided tape. 
Center the photo on the frame's board and stick it down with double-sided tape.
You could print out a dummy Spotify template and use that to trace the design on the glass.
And voila, in just minutes, you got a wholesome gift.
