I have always heard - Invest in your hair , It's the crown you never take off ! I know that having good natural hair isn't easy . Lots of artificial things are needed to make it more natural . But the truth is - Hair that slays starts with good care !❤️ 
Guys I know how difficult it is to grow hair ! Earlier I was totally worried as my hair were not at all growing , no matter what i did ! My hair were broken , unhealthy and damaged .☹️ 
But then i decided to change everything about my hair ! I finally made Some changes and now my hair are longer , healthier and stronger than ever before ! 
Here are 10 changes i made ;✅💇‍♀️ 
1 Stopped washing my hair everyday .
2 Stopped blow drying my hair right out of the shower and let it dry 80 percent of the way first .
3 Started doing overnight hair oil masks 1-2 times a week .
4 Started sleeping with protective sleep hairstyles .
5 Stopped wearing damaging hairstyles consistently .
