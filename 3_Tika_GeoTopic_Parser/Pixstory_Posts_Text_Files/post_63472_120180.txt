Raheem Sterling scored his first Chelsea goal as Thomas Tuchel s side ended what had been a turbulent preseason on a relative high against Udinese While this was not exactly the most prolific performance in the world Chelsea did at least restore some order after being beaten by Arsenal in Orlando a result that left Tuchel questioning the commitment of some of his players No such queries could be made in north eastern Italy on Friday night however Throughout Tuchel s team made up for their shortcomings in front of goal with some energetic pressing swarming the home side into mistakes N Golo Kante opened the scoring with a brilliant strike from outside the box after taking the game by the scruff of the neck before Sterling enjoyed a slice of luck as his saved shot looped back over the goalkeeper Gerard Deulofeu made things interesting just before half time by pouncing on a poor Edouard Mendy save to tap into an empty net although Mason Mount would wrap up the game with a tap in during the dying minutes
