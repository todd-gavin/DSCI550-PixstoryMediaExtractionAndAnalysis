Sleeping at the height of summer can sometimes feel impossible And with gruelling heatwaves becoming more common the nights can be sweltering with no cooling breeze to relieve the discomfort At least you can trust your senses nights really are getting hotter Weather stations usually record the day s minimum temperature at or a little after dawn At a few sites in the UK records extend back years or more Allowing for minor changes in instruments and methods over the years scientists have found that night time temperatures have risen considerably since Victorian times In most of the records examined night time temperatures are actually rising at a faster rate than daytime temperatures Why is this Recent milder winters in the UK have had fewer very cold nights The coldest nights tend to be colder relative to the norm than the coldest winter days Their loss has pushed up the average night time minimum temperature disproportionately faster than the average daytime maximum temperature UK summers are also seeing more frequent hot weather as a result of climate change Extreme daytime and night time temperatures in the UK during heatwaves have risen by a similar amount about C in years But even a brief hot spell allows warm nights to persist after daytime temperatures have returned closer to the norm particularly in cities leading to more hot nights than days overall That s because concrete and asphalt absorb and release daytime heat more slowly overnight compared with outlying rural areas resulting in even higher night time temperatures for city dwellers This is known as the urban heat island effect There are even suggestions that condensation trails left by aircraft have boosted night time temperatures by reducing how much heat can escape the surface layers of the atmosphere to space although the evidence is somewhat mixed Warm nights double in years Records from two of the longest running weather stations in the UK the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford Read more
