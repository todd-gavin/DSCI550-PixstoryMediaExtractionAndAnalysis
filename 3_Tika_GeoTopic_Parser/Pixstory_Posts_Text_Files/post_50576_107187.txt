I was year old when I got severe anemia and was in a critical condition At year old it is rare to have such anemia and it was also difficult to diagnose the disease Well I was lucky that I was B so it was not a rare blood group My father is B and donated the blood Well I was kept in the ICU my mother was itself a patient so she was not allowed to donate So my father has to donate the blood twice a time as this critical was my condition I was lucky then as I recovered from it But after that incident it motivated my father to donate more blood often as when he got to know the condition of the blood bank he was severely traumatized Actually we live in a small town called Ramgarh Cantt in Jharkhand and that town there is no management and blood donors for blood donation Patients often suffer huge due to these blood crisis and most of the people there are illiterate and avoid donating blood My father at that time understood the need for blood donation as well as awareness in society
