On social media, a video of a police officer objecting to the food being served to them went viral. Manoj Kumar, a constable, was observed crying while staging a protest and was later taken away by the police.

In the video, Kumar says, “The food that is being given is the kind which even an animal cannot eat, but it is fed to us. It is a scam by the senior superintendent of police and the DCP. Through these people police personnel are provided poor quality food."

He added that poor food was served despite promises from Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, that allowances for police officers would be boosted by almost 30% to provide a healthy diet for them.

“The Chief Minister had earlier announced that the state government provides an allowance for a nutricious diet for police officials. But this is what we get after long hours of duty," he said.

Kumar said, “The Reserve Inspector says that I will be suspended soon. I have told DGP sir regarding the problem several times, but till date no solution has been provided."

However, the manager of the police mess claimed that Kumar used to make needless fuss over the food's quality.

The district's top police officers declined to comment on the video.

Constable Manoj Kumar has a history of disciplinary troubles and has received 15 prior punishments for irregularity and other issues, according to a later tweet from the Firozabad Police Department.
