For probably the first time in the conflict the US decided to supply the Afghans with frontline US equipment that could be traced back to them—the Stinger shoulder held anti-aircraft missile. This move almost immediately turned the tide against the Soviets once again. By this time, total support for the mujahideen stood at US$ 1 billion a year, which according to CIA estimates could arm four hundred thousand fighters. The reality, however, was that only 1/10th—about 40,000 fighters were operative in Afghanistan at the time.

Where the missing arms went became clearer when the insurgency in Indian Punjab peaked around this time. This peak also coincided with massive and provocative Indian military exercises along the Pakistan border codenamed “Brasstacks.”
