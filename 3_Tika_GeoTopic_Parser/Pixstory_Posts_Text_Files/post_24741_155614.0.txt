The Brazil goalkeeper made 6 saves to keep the score level. 
In their second group-stage game of the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup, at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Friday, Nicollette Kiorpes (33') of the USA and Carol(37') of Brazil scored a goal each for their sides as the match ended 1-1. With the win, USA now lead the group above Brazil, both having 4 points each. Group leaders will be decided as per the number of goals scored by Brazil against India in their final group game. 
The USA were dominating with small passes and they came one on one with the Brazil goalkeeper on several occasions. Finishing cost them full points. Earlier, Mia Bhuta's shot was tipped above the goal by Leilane. She has been brave and seasonable on many occasions to deny the Americans an early lead. Goal came from the right wing, when Gamero made a run deep towards the byline and cut back the ball. Kiorpes turned the ball towards the Brazil goal, which went past the goalkeeper's legs.
The lead didn't last too long. Most of Brazil's attempts on goal were from the distance. One similar try from Midfielder Carol Chaves from 27 yards out took the American goalkeeper by surprise. The ball went past her at the bottom right corner of the U.S. goal. 
Gamero has been a constant threat throughout. USA also had 7 corners to Brazil's nil but they couldn't convert it into a goal. For her heroic performance, Leilane won player of the match award. It was seen that humidity is affecting players. Many Brazilian players were cramping. The U.S. head coach Natalia Astrain made all of her five allowed substitutions in the second half.
In the group's other match, Morocco beat hosts India 3-0. In the next matches, USA will face Morocco and Brazil will play against India on 17 th October.
