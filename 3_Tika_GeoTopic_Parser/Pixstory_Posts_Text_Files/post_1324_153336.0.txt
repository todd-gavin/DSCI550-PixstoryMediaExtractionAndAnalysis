Pierre Gasly is moving to Alpine after the end of this season.With that, the French team has an all-French driver line-up!Glad to see that Gasly will finally get out from the Red Bull family. Now, it will be interesting cause Gasly does not get along well with Alpine’s other driver, Esteban Ocon. The two French drivers have been racing each other from the karting days and have this formed their own rivalry from the early days itself.Esteban Ocon has worked hard over the last two years to cement his place in the French team and would have been looking forward to becoming the lead driver next year onwards. The move of current teammate, two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso would have certainly helped him get that position in the team. Now with the arrival of French rival Gasly, it will be interesting to see who takes the leadership role out of the two drivers.Gasly’s move now means that three seats are still to be filled to complete next year’s grid. Nicholas Latifi’s exit from Williams has opened up one. Alpha Tauri has now got a vacant seat thanks to Gasly’s move. The final seat that is yet to be decided is of Haas. The American team still has to announce who will be driving for them alongside Kevin Magnussen as teammate Mick Schumacher’s year has been filled with massive ups and downs. The son of the legendary Michael Schumacher is still fighting to keep his F1 journey and dream to drive for Ferrari alive.McLaren’s Daniel Ricciardo is also out of a seat   for next season as of now. The veteran racer has been replaced by rookie driver Oscar Piastri for next year. Where will F1’s most likeable personality drive next year?Will he even remain in Formula One after 2022? Things are getting more interesting as we look to complete the final few pieces of the puzzle that is the 2023 F1 driver line-up.
