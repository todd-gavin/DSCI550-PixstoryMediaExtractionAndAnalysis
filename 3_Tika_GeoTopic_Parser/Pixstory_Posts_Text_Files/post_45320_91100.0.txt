In the play-offs, Roberto Mancini's side were defeated 1-0 by underdogs North Macedonia, guaranteeing Italy's exit from the competition for the second time in a row.
Italy's last appearance in the event came in 2014, when former Manchester City and Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli was a member of Cesare Prandelli's team, which was eliminated in the group stage along with England.
Despite Italy's poor performance in the tournament, Balotelli described his maiden World Cup as a "great sensation" after scoring in their 2-1 victory over the Three Lions.
Despite not playing for the Azzurri since September 2018, it appears that the ex-Inter Milan striker, who has 14 goals for his country, was still hoping to win the World Cup.
Speaking to Sky Sports Italia following Italy’s knockout, Balotelli said: “It hurts.
“But the matter is not the call-up against North Macedonia or Turkey. The World Cup is in December and I could have been part of the team.
“I think I had a chance and I’ve lost an important opportunity. To see Italy out of the World Cup is too bad.
“I am only missing when Italy lose. It’s easy to say it now because, before the match, nobody was thinking about me.
“I watched the match against North Macedonia, we had some good chances. I am quite good in front of the goal. It doesn’t mean we’d win with me on the pitch, but we’d had good chances to score.”
Despite his dissatisfaction with Qatar, Balotelli offered former City manager Mancini a great evaluation when asked if he thought he was still the right guy for the job.
“I am happy that he will remain in charge because he has already won the Euros. People are disappointed, but we can’t forget what the coach has achieved.
“Italy have a strong team, but nobody expected us to become European champions. Mancini deserves to stay.”
