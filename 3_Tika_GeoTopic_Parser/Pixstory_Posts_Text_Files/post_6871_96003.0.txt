From cooking up a spaghetti bath to honoring fungi fantasies, Willow Pillâ€™s looks are bound to make you re-invent and rediscover your true self.

Willowâ€™s name comes from her Cystinosis, that requires frequent blood draws and medication, and from Buffy the Vampire Slayer character -â€œI'm an adorably twisted little doll" with a different story behind every look and a sense of humor that comes from darkness. 

Willow has won one maxi challenge, one mini challenge, and has been in the bottom twice.
