We often trivialise how helpful can it be to sit and breath deeply.
It have some wonderful affects of calming your mind and soul.
Still, it's not too late, sit and take a deep breath.
Do it step by step-
Get comfortable. you can lie on your back in bed or on the floor with a pillow under your head and knees. or you can sit in a chair with your shoulders, head, and neck supported against the back of the chair.
Breathe in through your nose. let your belly fill with air.
Breathe out through your nose.
Place one hand on your belly. place the other hand on your chest.
As you breathe in, feel your belly rise. as you breathe out, feel your belly lower. the hand on your belly should move more than the one that's on your chest.
Take three more full, deep breaths. breathe fully into your belly as it rises and falls with your breath.
