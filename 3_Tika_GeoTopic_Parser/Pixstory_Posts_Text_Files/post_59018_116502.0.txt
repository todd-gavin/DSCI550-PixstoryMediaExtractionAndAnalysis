No surprises here as Jawaharlal Nehru University, JNU as it is not known everywhere, secures the second rank in the list of top universities of India. These are government rankings. Itâ€™s worth exploring what made JNU reach the second position in the top universities of the country.

Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has declared the seventh edition of the National Institutional Ranking Framework ranking 2022. 

The NIRF ranking 2022 lists the different categories such as engineering, medical, management, law etc.
The Delhi-based university Jawaharlal Nehru University secured the second spot with 68.47 points. 

One of the main reasons that JNU is the best in a multi-disciplinary approach to education is that the university allows a student from any background to choose another course of their choice which makes JNU unique in the country.

JNU is also well known for research in sciences and always encouraging students to improvise and research in different sectors.
