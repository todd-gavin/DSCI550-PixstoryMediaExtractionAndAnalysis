Expectations were amply confirmed and the first medal in Beijing for Italy went to Francesca Lollobrigida in A historic silver because the first Italian five-circle podium on the long track was achieved before the Roman athlete by no one I don&#39;t want to reflect on history I prefer to think Francesca Lollobrigida said to myself at the end. I wanted this medal and I earned it. To be honest, I had dreamed of bronze so I also managed to do better than I could have imagined. Before her, only the Dutch Irene Schouten arrived from after the Italian he had held the first position until the second kilometer when Schouten changed pace I raced shoulder to shoulder with Schouten who has a weaker starting part than mine but on the other hand has a better final starting point so the only possible tactic was the one I made Go strong to put pressure on her and stress her psychologically it was a push and pull at every intersection but when she moved ahead in the last two laps I realized that I would never catch her even considering that she would have finished on the inside lane
