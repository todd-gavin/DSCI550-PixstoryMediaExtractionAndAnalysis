A close dream for Sara Fantini in the hammer throw at the athletics world championships taking place in Eugene The blue athlete finished fourth but for the first throws she had also hoped for something more given that she had a positive progression that took her from meters to the first throw to the second measure that had allowed her to keep many favorites behind Sara&#39;s match however did not continue as it had begun and there was no improvement in the distance in the subsequent returns to the platform The opponents however managed to go further especially the American Brooke Andersen arrived first with a distance of almost meters Impregnable Behind her Camryn Rogers and Jane Kassanavoid In fourth place Sara Fantini I am extremely happy to have confirmed the position with which I arrived here wrote Sara Fantini on social media everything in this world championship was unexpected new every day was a challenge and I feel like saying that I really learned a lot
