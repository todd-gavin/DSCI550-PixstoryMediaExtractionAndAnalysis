After 20 years of war in Afghanistan, Peace Action welcomed the withdrawal of troops from the country and an end to the war.

Yet when the United States military pulled out of Afghanistan, the Biden administration also responded by choking off assets to Afghan banks and the economy by freezing the reserves of the Afghan Central Bank held in the U.S. They also imposed sanctions on those doing business with Afghanistan and cut aid. Jobs and income disappeared, people cannot afford to buy food and mass starvation is now occurring.

The Afghan people are suffering now more than ever. Hunger could kill more now than in two decades of war. This humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is in the words of the International Red Cross a “human-made catastrophe.” “Human-made” largely by coercive U.S. economic policies.

This Valentine’s Day, we are organizing “Love to Afghanistan” vigils across the country to promote much-needed aid to the people of Afghanistan.

We will be pressuring members of Congress to increase aid to Afghanistan and end the sanctions policies and asset freezes that humanitarian groups say are driving the current famine.

We will deliver a Valentine to Congressional offices along with the attendees’ wishes that their Congresspersons deliver on that Valentine – by increasing aid to Afghanistan and unfreezing frozen assets.
