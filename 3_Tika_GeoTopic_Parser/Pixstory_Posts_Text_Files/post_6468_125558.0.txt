Home is where I find my peace. 
It is where I can sit in silence. 
This silence made me strong every minute. 
This silence made me feel someone hugging me. 
Yes, It was home. 
The feeling when your loved one hugs you and you hear the heartbeat, you feel the breath. I could feel mine because maybe I was hugging myself. 
Home made me feel I am strong, I have me by my side. 
I am strength, I am home, I am the strong one. 
Home is Home
