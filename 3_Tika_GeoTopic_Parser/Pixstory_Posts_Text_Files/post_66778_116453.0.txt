This is such a stupid take, god I hope you're not serious. 

You mean to tell me that, telling kids they did a good job turns them into narcissists, it's exactly the opposite. 

If you don't show appreciation towards your kids, they'll look for it within themselves, and that will create a pattern, and they will always look within themselves for validation and not believe even the most genuine compliments they have received. 

And to compensate for this, they'll over praise themselves every single time, which turns into a self obsession and narcissism. 

So rather than doing a poor behaviural analysis on kids, find the time to praise and comfort them.
