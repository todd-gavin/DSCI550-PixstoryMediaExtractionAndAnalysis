After exactly two long years the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) recorded zero cases on Friday. It first covid case was reported on March 4, 2020.  

“No new case of Covid was recorded in KDMC on Friday. We remember that the first case of Covid recorded in KDMC limits was on March 4, 2020, and how the entire system fought back throughout the pandemic. Today, when there is no case detected, there is a major relief as we have managed to tackle the third wave of Covid pandemic. In case of another wave, the civic body will work equally hard to tackle it with better facilities,” said civic commissioner, Vijay Suryavanshi. 

The civic health department claimed that as the cases went low, the KDMC has also shut its Art Gallery Covid care centre as there are no admissions in the centre. But as precaution a 20 bed facility is set up with the necessary oxygen support for those who have other illnesses and have tested positive for covid. 

“The Covid centre has been shut as there are no cases recorded and the number of new cases is below five these days. The active cases are also 44. Most of the cases are in home isolation now. In case of requirement of oxygen or ventilation, we have kept the 20 beds for their admission,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.
