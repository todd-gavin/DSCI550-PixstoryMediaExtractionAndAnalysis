It was million man Jack Grealish who sparked the comeback against an undeterred West Ham when Manchester City were trailing by Jarrod Bowen Goals year old Grealish came to Manchester City from Aston Villa as the most expensive English player ever in But in Pep s City Grealish is not allowed to shoot Fascinating but true and cruel for a player who is playing as a winger In matches he has scored only goals no wonder for a forward who doesn t shoot He has taken only shots in total in the entire league season If we compare that to Bowen who gave West Ham goals lead in that match does the same job and has scored goals from matches taking shots in total Grealish has got only assists too while Bowen has got in his name the reason why he is in the Player of the season nominee list In at Aston Villa Grealish has taken shots from matches and scored goals But in Pep s plan Grealish is allowed only to receive passes and keep possession De Bruyne is allowed to shoot That is why he has got shots from matches and goals million for holding the ball and passing If we look at another player of similar position from outside the Premier league Vinicius Jr of Real Madrid has taken shots from league matches scoring goals and assisting in goals In modern football left footed players play at right wing and right footed players at left so that they can cut inside from line and go for goal But Grealish can t do that unless Pep gives permission We have no doubt that Pep is a world class manager We know the story of Theory Henry of France being substituted for not following his plan But sometimes managers also need to believe players their talents that make them valuable and use it beyond the plans so that they do magic because football is beautiful as it s played by thinking players
