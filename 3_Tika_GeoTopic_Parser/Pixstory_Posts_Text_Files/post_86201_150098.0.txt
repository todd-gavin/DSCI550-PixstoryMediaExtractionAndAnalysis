Recently i had the opportunity to visit Kuala Lumpur. I was surprised to see that the city is FULL of skyscrapers. Whichever way you turn your head, you WILL have to crane your neck to see the top of the buildings. The city of Kuala Lumpur has over 1,900 completed high-rise buildings, of which over 700 are buildings standing taller than 328 ft; 170 are buildings over 492 ft, 42 are buildings over 656 ft and 5 are buildings over 984 ft. 
One of the most remarkable one will have to be the Petronas Twin Towers. They're 88 storeyed skyscrapers looming at the height of 1483 ft and the world's tallest twin towers. These towers are also visible from many places throughout the city and if you end up staying in a hotel with room at one of the higher floorsÂ  like i did you may even be able to see it from your balcony. The towers are open to the tourists after paying entry fee and the view from the top is breathtaking.
Do go there is you ever have a chance.ðŸ’«ðŸ’«
