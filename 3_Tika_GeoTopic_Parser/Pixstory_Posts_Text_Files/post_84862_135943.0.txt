Barcelona and Martin Braithwaite have officially reached an agreement to terminate the striker’s contract on deadline day. The contract was due to run until the end of next season.
Blaugrana had been trying to get rid of him the whole summer but he refused to leave the club despite having numerous offers at the table in July. With time passing, the relationship between the club and the player turned ugly, finally resulting in the termination of the contract.
The club released an official statement which read: “FC Barcelona and Martin Braithwaite have reached an agreement to terminate the contract binding the player to the club until the end of the 2023/24 season”.
“FC Barcelona publicly expresses its gratitude to Braithwaite for his commitment and dedication and wishes him the best of fortune and every success in the future.”
The Danish forward landed at Camp Nou in the 2020 winter transfer from Leganes for a deal worth €18 million. It was a desperate signing for the injured Luis Suarez, who had been ruled out for the rest of the season.
In his two-and-a-half years of the spell, Braithwaite mostly remained injured and ended up scoring ten goals across all competitions. He did help the Spanish giants win the Copa del Rey trophy in the 2020/21 season by netting a late winner in the semi-final against Sevilla.
The 31-year-old striker could never impress the new manager Xavi Hernández and thus, he was left out of his plans. He is expected to join crosstown rivals Espanyol on a three-year term and the deal could be completed in the coming hours.
The termination will free up some wage cap for Barcelona to sign a couple more players on deadline day. Braithwaite, on the other hand, will get some valuable game time ahead of the World Cup.
