What is Spirituality If you feel that reading pooja or going to temples or reciting verses of Bhagavad Gita If we call it Spiritual then it is wrong this person can be religious but it is not necessary that he is Spiritual There is a big difference between being religious and being spiritual We cannot speak Religion and Spirituality together When we try to know the truth or when we try to know our truth self then we start being spiritual When we start seeing what we are in real then we start being spiritual Light and Dark are both inside us Unless we see and accept our darkness we cannot make ourselves spiritual When we start living our real life by removing our illusions then it can be called spiritual Till now we are stuck in just believe what the person in front says we just follow what we have never tried to do questions on our own Till then we cannot call ourselves Spiritual It is very important to know what is spirituality in reality Now we have further differentiated in off carious This is about inner knowing And the age of baisess that was left till now which we were following blindly In which we were going to follow Balindly things we were following Balindly rules and regulations I think Real Spiritual says that when someone else is good because of you when your reason brings happiness on another person s face If a person is benefited because of you then a feeling is born on him then you can become spiritual Like everyone must have heard about Mother Teresa Mother Teresa was a spiritual woman who always thought about others not about you We can call Mother Teresa a spiritual woman When we help a person selflessly then we can speak spiritually And then the same thing comes back as a multiple It s real spirituality in our life
