These are some of the lines from the book which is so true in real life as well The day we get what we always wanted and learn to hold it within us we realise there was no need to run in the first place it was always going to come to us In running after it we miss the smaller things in life things we could have enjoyed in the process These small things would have made victory so much sweeter We realise that we have lost more than what we have received We realise that the ocean would never be able to replace the pond which is now a distant dream
