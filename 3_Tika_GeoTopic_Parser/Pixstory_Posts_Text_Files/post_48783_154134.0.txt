In Tucson, Arizona, a 14-year-old girl who suffers from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis has been taking medication for years. However, the medicine can also be used to induce an abortion; hence, Emma Thompson's request for a prescription refill was turned down days after Arizona passed a legislation outlawing abortion.
An area news station this weekend stated that Emma needed the life-saving drug called methotrexate to help her stay out of hospital.
Do you understand how the so-called pro-life movement has nothing to do with life and everything to do with being anti-women? Disabled girls are being denied life saving drugs only because those drugs can induce abortion too. The reason being given is "they're not in their child-bearing years". The amount of objectification, invalidation and people with uterus are being put through is revolting.
Other physicians and patients have stated that they, too, have experienced delays and rejections in receiving drugs that could be used for abortions since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in June.
