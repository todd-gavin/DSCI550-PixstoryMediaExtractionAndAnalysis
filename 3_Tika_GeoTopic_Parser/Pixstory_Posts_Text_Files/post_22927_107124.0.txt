According to Garry Jacob, Spurs has agreed on a Â£25million deal to bring Yves Bissouma to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Brighton midfielder was on the bucket list of many top European clubs. If Spurs happen to seal the deal then it would be the best bargain of the window. 

People close to the Italian suggest, Conte is looking to bring in four more players. Spurs has already completed the signing of the Croatin winger, Perisic from Inter and look to strengthen their midfield with the signing of Bissouma. 

Other Spurs targets include, the Nottingham right back, Spence, Villareal centre back, Pau Torres and the Brazilian, Richarlison. These are the three names that have been making the rounds at the white half of North London. 

With City and Liverpool making headlines, with the signings of Haaland and Nunez, Conte looks to bridge the gap between Spurs and the top 2, with the signing of top class talents. As Spurs look to end their trophy drought that has been haunting them for years. 

Other transfer news suggest, Chelsea is now the favorites to sign the French winger, Dembele. Whereas the Reds of Mancheter are looking at Ajax starlets Timber and Antony, with Frankie De Jong being priority. 
United have already lost one Ten Hag's primary targets, Nunez to Liverpool, and they cannot afford to lose anymore of their targets. 

Cucurela, another Brighton player, who plays left back has caught the eyes of Pep Guardiola. The Spaniard is adamant on bringing the Brighton player to the Etihad. Since City lack a natural left bak, Guardiola sees Cucurela as the one to fill in that slot, for years ahead.
