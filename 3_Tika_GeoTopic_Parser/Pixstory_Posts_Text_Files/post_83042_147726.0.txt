WIS x Pixstory are back for more! At our THE BUSINESS OF SOCCER PART II event in NYC last night incredible trailblazers came together to talk about what it’s like to work in soccer. VP of Media at the USL, Dana Rubin and founders of Soccer Grl Probs, Alanna, Shannon and Carly shared their stories on what it’s like to work in the game, from very different perspectives! Rubin started in the MLB and Soccer Grl Probs started in their college dorm rooms. Thriving in soccer comes in many shapes and sizes! ⚡️ ⚽️ 💜 What’s your story working in the game? Tell us! And if you’re just getting started working in soccer, join our squad to gain access to a regularly updated jobs board that lists postings of soccer jobs in the US.
