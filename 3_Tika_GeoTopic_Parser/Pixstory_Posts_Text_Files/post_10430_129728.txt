During this holiday I did a bit of review on the European Union also finding some paradox Montenegro from the candidate to enter the European Union to already in EUROLAND in fact the currency that is used only the Euro In Croatia the situation is reversed the currency is the Kuna even if the Croatia has been in the European Union ever since it became the th member country and undertook to join Euroland as soon as it had the requisites Well it took years The EU Council has in fact recently adopted the last three legal acts necessary to allow Croatia to introduce the euro from 1 January by setting the conversion rate between the euro and the Croatian kuna at kuna per euro The exchange rate corresponds to the current central parity of the kuna in the exchange rate mechanism Erm II The Council announced it in a note in July The entry of the Croatia in the euro not only symbolic in numbers with the 20th country in the eurozone on the 20th anniversary but also a sign that together we are a stronger and bigger area and in itself an act as a common denominator like a shield because united we are stronger Congratulations to the Croatia This was stated by the president of the ECB Christine Lagarde during the signing ceremony in Brussels of the legal acts necessary to allow Croatia to introduce the euro on January 1 Croatia&#39;s journey towards the euro was extraordinary For my generation Croatia represents the first war fought after the end of the second world war The progress Croatia has made since joining the EU and then joining the single currency has been extraordinary These instead were the declarations of the EU Commissioner for the Economy Paolo Gentiloni at the same ceremony
