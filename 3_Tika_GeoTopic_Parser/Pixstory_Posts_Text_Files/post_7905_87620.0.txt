Well it was all a false dream, fans did hope for new  OTT Platform. The SRK+ announcement was just an advert for Disney Plus Hotstar as some people had suggested after seeing the name. In the advert, Anurag Kashyap gives Shah Rukh many ideas for his new platform but it seems they're all rehashed version of shows on Disney Hotstar. It's a pretty witty ad campaign one has to say that. It suits SRK's personality to the dot. 

Many Bollywood celebs reacted to the advertisement. Salman Khan said in a tweet that one shouldn't underestimate SRK and his sense of humour. While Ajay Devgan said that if he knew SRK+ was coming out he'd have released his series there only. To this Shah Rukh replied that season 2 should release on SRK+ only. 

The advert ends with the line, Abhi Thoda Ruk Shah Rukh. What a fun marketing campaign by Disney Plus Hotstar. Its always nice to say these bollywood celebrities interact like this with each other. 
Here's the link of the advertisement,
