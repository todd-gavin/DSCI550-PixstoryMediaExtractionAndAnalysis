Recent estimates by a federal watchdog found that over $45 billion was likely distributed in pandemic related disbursements by fraudsters. The way it often worked was that the Social Security numbers of dead people, and the identities of inmates, both who are ineligible for these benefits, were used to get the money.Sadly, these types of frauds from these pandemic related funds seemed almost too easy to steal from. It is as though anyone willing to take the risk could’ve stolen hundreds of thousands or even millions from the government without much difficulty.Now that the department of justice is finally beginning to go after these fraudsters, it has become clear that they are content with prosecuting after the fact, but not putting measures in place to prevent money that should’ve been going to people in need and small businesses from being stolen.In addition, because the department of justice only seems to be focusing on the higher value frauds, it seems likely that many people will have gotten away with defrauding.
