Raphinha Not a good game for the new signing He was very nervous with the ball and could not be seen for most of the match Robert Lewandowski It was a dissatisfying day for the Polish striker as he could not find a decent supply source of balls despite being unmarked for most of the time inside the opposition box Ousmane Dembele Like Raphinha Dembele too was totally neutralized by the opposition full backs in this match Ansu Fati Ansu Fati changed the dynamics of the game as soon as he stepped foot on the pitch Sergi Roberto Did not have a significant impact on the game after coming on Frenkie De Jong After coming on Frenkie De Jong was all over the pitch and he created great chances proving once again that he is still one of our best players Franck Kessie Franck Kessie s inclusion gave us the physical presence in the midfield that we longed for and he was great as well Pierre Emerick Aubameyang Aubameyang had like touches in the match and thus it would be wrong to judge him based on that
