Manchester United are allegedly interested in signing Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez and
would like to add Anthony Martial in the deal.

Since joining the Nerazzurri from Racing Club, the Argentine has been outstanding. In 176
appearances, he has 69 goals.

United are interested in luring Martinez to Old Trafford, according to Italian writer Marco
Barzaghi.

He stated on his YouTube channel (via the Express) that the Premier League heavyweights had
offered £42 million to recruit Martinez, who is presently on loan at Sevilla.

Inter is said to have turned down the offer, with United's new manager Erik ten Hag gearing up
for a blockbuster summer transfer window.

Martial joined United for a record £54 million cost and has shown flashes of brilliance, but he
has battled to justify the transfer sum that made him the most expensive teenager in the game.

His loan tenure with Sevilla has failed to resurrect his career, as he has failed to score in his
eight La Liga matches.

Manchester United wants to unload Martial's £240,000-per-week deal, which he has until 2024.

Before his January loan, the 26-year-old had 79 goals in 269 games for United and has only
scored once this season.

Kevin Phillips, an ex-Premier League striker, claims that Aaron Wan-Bissaka "has not
progressed" at Manchester United.

The right-back joined United for £50 million from Crystal Palace, but has battled to find his feet
at Old Trafford.

Phillips told Football Insider, "It's a shame because I like him."

"However, he hasn't made much progress at Man United, despite the fact that the club is in dire
straits."

"It wouldn't surprise me in the least if he returned to Palace and performed just as well as he did
before."

"Going back to familiar surroundings might be the most rational option." When you're at ease
and content, you'll be able to play your best football."
