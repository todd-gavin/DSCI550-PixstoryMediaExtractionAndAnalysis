When Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and co-president Louis D'Esposito asked Mark Ruffalo if he would be willing to play Bruce Banner and his enormous green alter ego, Smart Hulk, on the Disney+ series "She-Hulk: Attorney at Law," Ruffalo barely hesitating.
"I was a little curious as to the tone," Variety is told by Ruffalo. He was, however, completely on board for Bruce, nicknamed Smart Hulk, to pass the torch to his cousin Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany), called She-Hulk, after reading – and adoring — the script written by creator and head writer Jessica Gao.
Mark Ruffalo has been playing the Marvel superhero Hulk since 2012's "The Avengers". The actor talked with Variety about working with Tatiana Maslany on "She-Hulk". He said it was one of his first productions after the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown.
Variety - What appealed to you about making “She-Hulk”?
Mark Ruffalo - It was something that I've always sort of wondered: How does Hulk or Banner live their lives? I mean, if he is living on his own, how does he not hit his head on doorframes? It just opened up a whole world that's really funny and playful that I was craving after COVID. It was like a desperation for me when I got to it, to have that kind of experience after being locked down and imprisoned, in a way.
Variety - Finally, if you think back to your first time as Bruce in 2012 Avengers, how have you evolved and how you think about and approach the character?
Mark Ruffalo -  I've played Banner and Hulk in like five different iterations, and brought some important, meaningful part of myself to each one of those things. It's been a great place to express myself and to grow. Now I'm in this other stage, where it's like, the twilight of myself and my career and probably winding down in a way. I feel like the same thing is probably happening for Banner. He's one of the three that's left standing, and that's probably going to come to an end as well.
