IPL’s newest entrants Gujarat Titans, England opener Jason Roy has pulled out of the tournament citing extended bio-bubble stay. The England opener, who had represented Sunrisers Hyderabad last season was brought by Gujarat Titans for his base price of INR 2 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega auction. According to reports, he had informed the Ahmedabad-based franchise last week. Gujarat Titans are yet to name a replacement for the English cricketer.

This is the second time the English player is pulling out of the IPL. He had earlier withdrawn from the 2020 edition due to personal reasons after being picked up by the Delhi Capitals for Rs 1.5 crore.

The 2019 World Cup winner was in the form of his life having amassed 303 runs in six matches at the recently-concluded PSL 2022 averaging 50.50 that included two half-centuries representing the Quetta Gladiators. While Gujarat are yet to name a replacement, they do have some great options available.

Possible replacements:

 • Aaron Finch surprisingly went unsold at the IPL 2022 mega auction despite having led Australia to their maiden T20 World Cup triumph in the UAE a few months ago. No team was willing to buy him even at his base price of INR 1.5 crore. However, he now has a chance to open the innings for Gujarat Titans alongside youngster Shubman Gill.

 • Martin Guptill had come into the IPL 2022 mega auction at his base price of INR 75 lakh but found no takers and went unsold. Nonetheless, with Jason Roy out of action, it could be an opportunity for the senior New Zealand batter to make his way into the Titans setup.

 • Despite being a late boomer at the international level, Dawid Malan has proved to be arguably England’s best T20I batter and was also the top-ranked batter in this format for quite a while. Unfortunately, no team showed faith in him at the IPL 2022 mega auction.

 • Shakib Al Hasan is one of the finest all-rounders in the modern era. However, he went unsold at the IPL 2022 mega auction even at his base price of INR 2 crore.
