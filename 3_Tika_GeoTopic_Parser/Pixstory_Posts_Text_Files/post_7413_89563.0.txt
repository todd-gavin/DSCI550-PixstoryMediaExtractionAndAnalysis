The sea is painted in her eyes
And sand is sprinkled on her skin
Her waves of hair so soft to touch
Her mouth a cave they wisp within.

Her body lithe as leopard limbs
Whose spots adorn her cape of hope
Her arms that wrap like swaying grass
Her style and grace of antelope.

The broken skies show fickle winds
That warn of rains as thunder forms
And when her lightning spears the night
It drowns the plains in ocean storms.

But wrecking cliffs are turned to roosts
Soothed by the calm of summer lulls
And love so warm it dries you out
And lifts you with the wings of gulls.


*Charles Wiles (Best Love Poems).
