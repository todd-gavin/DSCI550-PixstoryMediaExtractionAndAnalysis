Russian troops in Ukraine have seized Chernobyl power station and taken staff as hostages as advisors to the Ukrainian president admitted they do not know the condition of its nuclear waste storage facility It was reported earlier a battle had broken out near the remains of the nuclear plant around miles from Kyiv between Ukrainian and Russian forces Now it appears Moscow has seized the site of the worst nuclear accident in world history with experts suggesting it is a key location as soldiers can now march directly to the country s capital city Mykhailo Podoliak adviser to the head of the president s office chillingly warned After a fierce battle our control over the Chernobyl site has been lost The condition of the facilities of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant is unknown This is one of the most serious problems in Europe today It is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe This is one of the most serious threats to Europe today Knowing the habits of the Russians they are probably already preparing provocative things at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Either they will use the damage received by the facilities during the attack to blame Ukraine for this or they will damage these undoubtedly most dangerous facilities themselves Russian soldiers are said to have attacked the radioactive area from the side of Belarus before engaging local forces in fierce fighting Mykhailo Podolyak another adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians
