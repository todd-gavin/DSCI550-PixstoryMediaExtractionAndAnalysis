Ripple pea milk offers 150% more calcium than cow's milk and has a higher protein content than well-known nondairy milks like almond and oat milk, which helps support strong bones and help you feel fuller for longer.
Field peas that are ground into flour to make flour are used to make pea milk, not green field peas. Unlike many dairy-free milks, which are typically manufactured by soaking, pea milk is created by combining pure protein, which has been separated from the fibre and starch in the flour, with water and additional components, such as sunflower oil and vitamins like B12.
