Arsenal legend Vieira wants to go back to his old for Nketiah as he chases up to four
signings in the next transfer window.

Nketiah is poised to leave Arsenal this summer but Crystal Palace is facing some strong
competition from top German clubs for his signing. Crystal Palace is also keen to strengthen in the centre of the park.

Nketiah, the 22-year-old will end his contract this summer at the Emirates and is
reportedly not planning to sign a new deal with the North Londoners as he searching for
more first-team action.

The Englishman has recently made a breakthrough with the Gunners starting their last
three Premier League victories and scoring a brace against Chelsea. However, Arsenal
is reportedly planning to buy two new strikers in the summer which will curb his long
term opportunities.

According to the Sun, Palace manager Patrick Vieira has been watching developments
closely and will make another move for Nketiah after failing with a 10 Million pound bid
in January.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta will be unhappy to lose Nketiah considering he is already
short of centre forwards after Aubameyang’s departure to Barcelona this January.

Meanwhile, Alexandre Lacazette is also set to leave at the end of the season with his
contract running out.

Since Nketiah arrived at Arsenal, he has struggled to hold down a first-team place, often
playing a bit part role in club competitions.

This season, he rose to prominence when he scored 5 goals in five Premier League cup games before usurping Lacazette as Arsenal’s first striker in recent weeks.

He is also the record goalscorer for England’s U-21 so is not short of suitors with
German club Borussia Monchengladbach reportedly interested in his signature along
with Palace.
