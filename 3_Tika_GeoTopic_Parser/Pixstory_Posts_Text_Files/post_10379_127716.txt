Have you ever been to the Balkan countries I have been several times to Croatia by the sea and I must say that it has beautiful beaches and a crystalline sea that rivals Sardinia This year I was taken aback by the holiday situation in the central week of August and I got off without booking up to Montenegro The beautiful and very cold sea the clean air the pleasant climate the Mediterranean food with Greek Italian and Central European contamination life seems to cost relatively little Tourists can be seen from Germany France and England Have you ever been there Would you like to visit it
