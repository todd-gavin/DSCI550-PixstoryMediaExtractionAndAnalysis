Posting unrelated picture doesnâ€™t help . The protesting girls are not wearing burqa,  they are wearing a hijab . Which means a headscarf. 
Their faces are as exposed as anyone else . They are not asking permission to cover their faces . Only problem is now a days wearing a mask is mandatory so they are wearing one. 
This post is inaccurate .
