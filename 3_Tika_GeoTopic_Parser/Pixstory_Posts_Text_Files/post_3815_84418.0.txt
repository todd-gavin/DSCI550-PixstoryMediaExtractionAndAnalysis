Playing polo on elephants may seem exotic, but it has heavy abuse involved when it comes to poor elephants. 

According to PETA Asia, "breaking" elephants to make them fearful and subservient is the only way to get them to accept humans riding on their backs. There is a lot of violence and threats involved in this. 

PETA, whose motto is the phrase "animals are not ours to use for amusement," points out that elephants employed in polo games, rides, or other forms of entertainment are subjected to rigorous training sessions in which they are often abused. They're frequently chained to chains so short that the animals can barely take a single step between matches.

Previously it was reported by live kindly that after an undercover animal cruelty investigation uncovered the sport's terrible mistreatment, elephant polo in Thailand has practically come to a stop. 

Major sponsors of the King's Cup Elephant Polo Tournament withdrew their sponsorship following the release of film obtained by PETA Asia, a part of the international animal rights organisation PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). Last year's competition was exposed, which showed handlers brutally thrashing captive elephants with bullhooks - a sharp weapon commonly employed by many circus trainers â€“ and pulling on the animals' sensitive ears. Some elephants were thrashed to the point of bleeding, and one elephant was found tied in standing water, according to authorities.
