The player went on to outscore
his xG which was at 23.4. He also had a 100% success ratio in the penalties that he attempted
in the league.

Amongst the 39 goals, 34 were non-penalty goals whereas the other five were
penalty goals across all competitions for Paris St Germain.

Unsung Hero: Angel di Maria

When Paris St Germain signed Lionel Messi from Barcelona, everyone expected the seven-time
Ballon dâ€™Or to take the league and the competitions by fire. However, it was his fellow
Argentinian, Angel di Maria who set the league on fire. In Ligue 1, he had five goals and seven
assists. On the other hand, across all competitions, the player was able to rake in an additional
assist. The attacking midfielder exceeded his xGA which stood at 6.4. All the five goals that he
scored were non-penalty goals in Ligue 1.

Along with Angel di Maria, it was Achraf Hakimi and Neymar who took the goal-scoring duties.

Achraf Hakimi, being a defender, had four goals and six assists to his name whereas Neymar
went on to add 13 goals and eight assists from 28 games across all competitions.

What to expect from the next season?

The stalwart of the Paris St Germain, Kylian Mbappe has renewed the contract after negotiations over a year. The team now consists of the players like Neymar Jr and Lionel Messi
forming a dangerous front three.

Mauricio Pochettino has finally won the title with a team and
will look to sweep the entire domestic titles along with a possible Champions League trophy as
well. The team is on the verge of adding a few high-profile players like Paul Pogba and Jorginho
who can alter the dynamics of the star team.
