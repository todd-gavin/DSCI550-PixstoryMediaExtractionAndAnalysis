Praful Patel had taken over as full-time president in October 2009 before being re-elected to the top post in December 2012 and 2016.


Praful Patel, the president of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has accepted the Supreme Court’s decision to have AIFF elections and bring “finality to a long-pending issue.”

Patel’s time as the top man in AIFF affairs came to an end after the Supreme Court on Wednesday constituted a three-man Committee of Administrators (CoA) to run the day-to-day affairs of the national federation. 


The SC named a panel with former captain of the Indian Football team, Bhaskar Ganguly and former Chief Election Commissioner, SY Qureshi and Justice AR Dave as its head. 


The 65-year-old admitted that he was not eligible for re-election. 

“A speedy resolution and a newly elected body will serve in the best interest of Indian football,” Patel said in a statement, going on to add that the AIFF constitution was already “broadly complying” with the National Sports Code, keeping in mind the statues of AFC and FIFA. 

“The AIFF constitution broadly follows the sports code 2011 for age and tenure limits and therefore I was in any way going to step down from office and neither was I eligible for re-election. I am always available for the service to take Indian Football forward together and once again express my gratitude for having received the love and affection and honour to serve the sport.” Patel said. 


Patel’s third term in office ended in December 2020 but he clung to an SC case, which remained pending since 2017 to extend his executive committee’s term while refusing to hold elections till the issue of a new constitution was settled by the top court.
