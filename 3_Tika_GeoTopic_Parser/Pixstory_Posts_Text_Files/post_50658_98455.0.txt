Online advertising spending shows how important the WA vote is and the parties are going all out!

ABC News has reported that more than $6 million has been spent on social media in the last month to try to sway Australians' opinions on a variety of social and political topics. 

However, in Western Australia, spending is around 15% greater, reflecting the state's predicted pivotal position in the federal election. As the drive to win over West Australians intensifies, that figure has risen even higher in the recent week, approaching 20%.

Also, Facebook is the main target! My guess is because mainly because middle age people use Facebook most and it’s easiest to influence them!

As per abc analysis, political parties, lobby groups, and a variety of other organisations paid Facebook's parent company, Meta, $232,922 last week to buy ads on its platforms in Western Australia. 

The Labor Party, or pages linked with it, contributed almost 40% of that, or $93,045. 

Pages like Stand Up for WA and Every School Every Child spent a large portion of that, frequently only exposing their affiliation in small language revealing who the advertising are funded for.

It isn’t clear who will win but it is definitely clear that power of social media should not be underestimated!
