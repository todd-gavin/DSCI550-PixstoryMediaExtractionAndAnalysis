How people have begun to accept and acknowledge mental health issues shows some positive change in their outlook Mental health has long been a taboo people have chosen to zip up their mouths when discussing their mental health What evoked in their mind was a sense of insecurity and the predicament that they would endure because of society But unknowingly after many movements and happenings people tend to realise how essential it is to speak about mental health However learning about a mental health language is even more essential Though a lot has changed some still need to work on their mental health lingo while dealing with a person with any mental health issues or even telling about them to others Like choosing to say someone is experiencing social anxiety disorder instead of saying someone has social anxiety Choosing not to put disorder in the sentence would seem that the feelings are quite normal it is not something to be ashamed of Saying She s in eating recovery instead of She was a victim of an eating disorder or she s suffering from an eating disorder Using terminologies like victim or suffering about people who are experiencing or working through an issue can suggest a lack of quality of life Instead focus on the positive fact that they re in treatment and learning ways to cope and heal Choose to say She died by suicide or we lost her to suicide instead of She committed suicide or she took her own life Saying someone took their own life implies a conscious choice We know that when people get to the point where they are hopeless and depressed enough that they die by suicide they re not really thinking clearly at least that s how we look at it in mental health Instead saying we lost them to suicide highlights the tragedy of it
