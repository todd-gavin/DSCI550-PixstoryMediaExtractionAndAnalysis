 Id Software co founder John Romero, one of the brains behind Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein 3d is working on another first person shooter. Announcing the game on Twitter, Romero Games said“It's a new dawn for Romero Games.” The developers added. “We're working with a major publisher to develop John Romero's next shooter: an all-new FPS with an original, new IP. Our team is expanding, and we're looking for talented people for all positions and at all experience levels, particularly those with Unreal Engine 5 experience.”

Few other details were revealed about the upcoming title, which will be the first title from Romero Games since Brenda's 2020 strategy game Empire of Sin.  An FAQ on the Romero Games site says "it's way too early to share any other information on it," and co-founder Brenda Romero indicated that the studio isn't rushing into promotion, telling PC Gamer, "We are deliberately not boarding the hype train."

Multiple roles suggest a significant focus on multiplayer - the lead level requirements include "extensive experience" on "current gen console or PC titles that featured a multiplayer component," while Online Architect and Senior Multiplayer Programmer roles both suggest online play will be important to the new project.
