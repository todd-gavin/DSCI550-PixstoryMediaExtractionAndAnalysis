We used to live in a universe where there were only a few known planets all of which orbited our Sun However a recent flurry of discoveries represents a watershed moment in science more than planets beyond our solar system have already been confirmed NASA TV reported that the latest batch of exoplanets planets outside our immediate solar system was added to the NASA Exoplanet Archive on March marking the start of the planetary odometer The repository contains exoplanet discoveries that have been confirmed using various detection methods or analytical techniques and have been published in peer reviewed scientific articles Small rocky worlds like Earth gas giants many times larger than Jupiter and hot Jupiters in scorchingly close orbits around their stars are among the planets discovered There are super Earths which are potentially larger rocky worlds than our own and mini Neptunes which are smaller copies of Neptune in our system Add planets orbiting two stars at the same time as well as planets stubbornly orbiting the collapsed remnants of dead stars to the mix It s not just a number said Jessie Christiansen the archive s science head and a research scientist at Caltech s NASA Exoplanet Science Institute Each of them is a brand new planet a brand new world Every one excites me because we don t know anything about them
