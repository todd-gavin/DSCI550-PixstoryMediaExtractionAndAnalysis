Thiago Silva is one of the best defenders in the game. He has accomplished a lot of feats in his career and is known for his slid defence. 

The 37-year old got transferred for free from Paris Saint-Germain to Chelsea in 2020. There was a lot of expectations from Silva when he reached Stamford Bridge which he didn’t only live up to but exceeded in an exceptional way. He played a major role in Chelsea winning the Champions League and becoming the champions of Europe.  

The genius of the player makes him one of the greatest central defenders of his generation and he has no plans to stop. The 37-year old has signed a contract to remain in the blues a little shy of his 39th Birthday. 

Silva in a recent interview admitted that he wants to recreate the Milan legend Paolo Maldini and play even after entering his 40s. 

Silva said, "I hope I can do the same thing that Maldini did at Milan, playing until he was 40 or 41 years old, That’s my plan for the immediate future and I have prepared myself for that"
