During a discussion with former WWE writer Brian Gewirtz and current WWE Superstars Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch on Instagram Live on Tuesday, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson told a story about a memorable WWE segment in 2013.

The Rock recalled getting triple powerbombed by The Shield, which was comprised of Rollins, Dean Ambrose and his real-life cousin Roman Reigns. As a result of the attack, The Rock ended up bleeding out of his mouth.

While talking about the confrontation, which occurred on the final episode of Raw before the 2013 Royal Rumble, The Rock remembered a humorous interaction that occurred

"You know what was really cool? When The Shield attacked me before WrestleMania and powerbombed me, and I remember Seth â€¦ I was on Roman's shoulders. He threw me down so hard on that mat. Busted my blood vessels, blood started coming out of my mouth. Roman looked down and was like, 'You okay, Uso?' ... And as far as I can answer, Seth was like, 'Who gives a s--t,' and walks away."

Rollins noted that he didn't specifically remember saying that, but noted that a lot of things happen in the heat of the moment. Both he and The Rock had a laugh about it nonetheless.
