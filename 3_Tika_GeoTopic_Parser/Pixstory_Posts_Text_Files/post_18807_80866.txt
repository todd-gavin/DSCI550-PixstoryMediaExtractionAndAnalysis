Marcell Jacobs wins again The fastest athlete in the world over meters ran in the final of the Silver stage of the World Indoor Tour of Lodz in Poland An excellent time only two hundredths more than the Italian record The battery that took him to the final was also good closed with the time of I&#39;m gnawing a bit because in the final I wanted to overdo it I forced the start too much looking for the frequencies I didn&#39;t need and unfortunately I hesitated But I liked the second part of the race a lot commented Jacobs at the end of the final The goal was to get as close as possible to and so I&#39;m quite satisfied I knew I could do a little bit better for a step forward compared to Berlin I didn&#39;t feel the same pre-race tension I was calm with a great desire to compete my second time under i for me which are a diesel and that it takes a while to get into condition it&#39;s good for only the second race of the year In six days another challenge for Lievin I aim to do even better
