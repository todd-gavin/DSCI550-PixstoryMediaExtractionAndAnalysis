The World Cup in Qatar later this year could be the last appearance for many great players at the world stage – several of them would be wearing the captain’s armband for their respective nations. Loyal fans of Argentina’s Lionel Messi, Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale of Wales  are already excited; they all want their revered stars to end on high note – a memorable Qatar 2022 would add to the greatness they have already achieved.

But then, the list doesn’t end with two or three footballers only. There are few others, who have reached legendary status in their own countries and will most probably lead their teams for the last time in Qatar. The first name that comes to mind is of Andres Guardado of Mexico, who has till date spent 17 glorious years with the national team. The 35-year-old came through the ranks of Mexican club Atlas, but he spent major part of his career in Spain, making 325 appearances combined for Deportivo La Coruna, Valencia, and Real Betis. The midfielder has made 175 appearances for Mexico, for who he has scored 28 goals. He made his Mexico debut in December 2005, just four months after his senior club debut. The Qatar meet is likely to be his last.

Canada captain Atiba Hutchinson is another player, who is unlikely to be seen beyond the Qatar 2022. At 39, he can best be described as the old man of the squad. He will lead out a team with players like Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, in the country’s first World Cup since 1986. Hutchinson is a robust defensive midfielder who has played for Turkish club Besiktas since 2013. He is also the captain of the club. Hutchinson has made 265 appearances for the Turkish giants, scoring 23 goals. For Canada, he has made 97 appearances, scoring nine goals. He will hope to hit the 100 cap mark at the World Cup.
