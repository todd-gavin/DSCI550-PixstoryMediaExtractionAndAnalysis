Kareena Kapoor and Aamir Khan graced the Koffee couch in the latest episode of Koffee With Karan and discussed how they manage their 'modern' families. During the episode, Kareena recalled how her step-daughter Sara Ali Khan has been a fan of her since childhood.🥰🥰😍🤩

Kareena said, "I remember at the K3G trials, she (Sara Ali Khan) was hiding behind her mum. And Amrita was actually like 'Sara really wants a picture because she's such a big fan. She had loved Poo in KGG and 'You are my Soniya' so much.' But I don't know why people discuss so much about it, because I mean we are family, and like Aamir said if there's love and regard and understanding. This is what it is. They are Saif's children, they are his priorities."👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👧‍👦😍
