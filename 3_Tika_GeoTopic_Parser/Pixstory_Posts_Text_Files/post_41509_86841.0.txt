Jocelyn Alo grew up wanting to be softball’s most prolific home run hitter. And she did it. 

Alo's 96th career home run, a sixth-inning bomb to centre against Hawaii in Honolulu in the Rainbow Wahine Classic, breaking Lauren Chamberlain's NCAA record. 

"I've had this in my head for a long time, ever since I was a kid," Alo remarked earlier this season. "I was like, 'OK, let's do it,' when I arrived to college and just started taking off." I told my father the other day that he has always believed in me since I was a child, and he has just kind of instilled it in my head for a time till I started to believe it.”

U.S News reported that since Alo tied the record on Feb. 20, she hasn't gotten many pitches to hit as opponents pitched around her in an attempt to avoid being the team to hand up the game-winner. 

On Feb. 25, Alo came close in the second of those games, hitting a high double off the right-field wall against Long Beach State. 

She hit an RBI double to right in the first inning, then walked in her next two at-bats before singling up the middle in the fifth.



She'd largely been walked or tossed around since then. 

Alo went 0 for 1 with two walks in the Sooners' inaugural game, a five-inning 8-0 triumph over Cal on Friday night. 

Alo found more pitches to hit in the nightcap versus Hawaii.
