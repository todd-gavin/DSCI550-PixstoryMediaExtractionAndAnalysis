Released by Celtic as a teenager because he was deemed too small, Andy Robertson
made it the hard way to amateur side Queen’s Park, Dundee United and Hull City
preceding his move to Liverpool in 2017.

As he gears up for his third UEFA Champions League final with the Reds the
28-year-old left-back reflects on his circuitous rise to the top of European football and
Jurgen Klopp’s role in taking Liverpool to the next season.

At his best moment at Liverpool

“That night with Madrid will live with me for the rest of my life. The season before we fell
short in Kyiv and then getting to another Champions League final doesn’t happen all the
time. Some people only get to one and they are blessed to be one.

On his slow rise to stardom

“I have always worked hard. I have always looked at my weaknesses instead of my strengths and tried to improve them as the years have gone on. Once you do that, you slowly but surely get better and you also have the experience of playing a wee bit longer
and you start reading the game differently.

Liverpool’s manager Jurgen Klopp

“He has made this club better. He has put us back in the position when we are
competing for trophies. When took over, nobody would have put Liverpool up there for
the Champions League, nobody would have put Liverpool up there for competing for
Premier Leagues. And we are always in the conversation, and that is down to him and
his staff. He has changed the mentality around everyone.

It takes the boys to buy into it, but it is an easy philosophy to buy into when it works. But
the manager is the leader of us. He is the one that makes big decisions and gets the big
calls right and I think he will go down as a legend in Liverpool.
