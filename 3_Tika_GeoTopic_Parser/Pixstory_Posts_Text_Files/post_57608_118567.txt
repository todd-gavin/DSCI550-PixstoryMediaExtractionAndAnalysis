William Congreve once said Music has charms to soothe the wild beast to soften rocks or bend the knotted oak This is how appropriately Congreve portrayed the power of music It s a well known fact that what music creates no other artist would do It is a medium to break all the barriers and maintain peaceful relations The language and cultural differences wane when one cooperates and promotes each other with a similar liking of sounds The narrative around musical diplomacy is not so obscure we know it well and what it did to bring a change in the most tumultuous times in the world Music diplomacy is a part of cultural diplomacy which includes the exchange of ideas information art language and other aspects of culture among nations and their peoples to foster mutual understanding So decades back countries began using music ambassadors to travel to different countries and make a positive view of their culture people and policies It was done to seek cooperation and promote peace between nations Whilst the role of music as a force for social cohesion can be seen to have emerged together with the earliest musical forms the use of music to promote political diplomatic or societal objectives became prominent during the Cold War It was times when wars enraged people s minds a time of conflict and chaos when there was no way to seek peace But besides choosing other mediums and art to eradicate differences nations chose music so that people could sit calmly and lend their ears to the most exquisite source of happiness
