Manchester United and Manchester City share a heated rivalry in the Premier League. But this has not stopped the Sky Blues' manager Pep Guardiola from having his say in United's managerial decision. 

As per the Daily Mail, Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked the Red Devils' management to sign Erik Ten Hag as their next manager. The Spaniard praised the Dutchman while saying so.

Talking to the press before Manchester City's game against Burnley, Pep Guardiola stressed the positives of Erik Ten Hag. The Spaniard said that Ten Hag is an incredible human being and is very humble.  

Talking about his game plan, Pep Guardiola added, "Just look at Ajax. To define a manager, watch his team for a long time. There is no doubt about that. If I was 100 percent sure I would call Manchester United and say 'guys you have to take him', but nobody knows."

Pep Guardiola has worked with Erik Ten Hag at Bayern Munich. The Dutchman was in charge of the reserve team when Guardiola was the Bayern Munich manager. The two managers have since retained their bond. 

Erik Ten Hag was also reportedly referred to as "Mini Pep" during his time with Bayern Munich. Hence the 52-year-old Ajax manager would certainly have picked up on loads of tricks and tips from Pep Guardiola himself.
