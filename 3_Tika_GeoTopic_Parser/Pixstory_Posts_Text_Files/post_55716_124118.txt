When it comes to food the Australian in me will always chose damper and pea and ham soup over everything As reports say in earlier times bushmen and road labourers relied heavily on this well known affordable Australian dish At first the recipe was the most straightforward With a sip of rum or billy tea the soda bread is made from wheat flour water and a pinch of salt It is then baked over a campfire Today milk and self raising flour can make it a little fancier Pea and ham soup on the other hand a straightforward dish that has been prepared in farmhouse kitchens for decades is the ideal substantial winter dinner and may have British origins To make it even heartier people recommend to add slices of smoked sausage or frankfurters
