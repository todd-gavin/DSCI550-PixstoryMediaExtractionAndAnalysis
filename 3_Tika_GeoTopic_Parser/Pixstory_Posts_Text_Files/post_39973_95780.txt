MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF TEA Using only the new leaf bud and leaves below it ensures a tea with flavour and character Tea leaves and bud two each Tea is hand picked from the bushes wilted Once there the tea leaves are put in large withering troughs with heated air blowers to reduce moisture content Flaccid leaves result Physical withering occurs The partial disintegration of cell walls between cells cell wall permeability is required for later steps of synthesis The plucked leaves are chemically wilted for a minimum of hours Lessen the leaf s wetness Hot or cool air blowing the leaves a b Rolling breaks apart leaf cells and combines enzymes with leaf chemical components Various rollers are used The first roll is pre conditioning By gently expressing leaf juice onto the surface of the twisted particles These liquids evaporate on the particles darkening tea The following rolling should fully destroy the leaf cells During rolling friction creates heat which must be kept below C to avoid chemical and enzymatic reactions To mix up the leaf s chemical components A roller that applies pressure on leaves in stages In order to encourage oxidation or fermentation the leaf is stretched out after sifting through the Roll Breaker After the leaf is split in the roller fermentation begins Polyphenols are oxidised when cells split prompting enzymes to interact with other cellular components Fermentation produces flavour compounds This permits critical chemical reactions to occur in the macerated leaf A roller that applies pressure on leaves in stages Drying Firing kills enzymes and removes most leaf moisture During the burning process undesired low boiling compounds are removed revealing more desirable high boiling compounds To stop tea fermentation and chemistry The fermented leaves are dried hot Planning The charred tea leaves are sorted through meshes to determine particle size This helps separate teas into dust pekoe BOP etc grades To grade tea leaves The tea is filtered via various mesh sizes Aesthetics The Teamaker and expert tasters next assess the tea s leaf smell cup colour and character To assess the tea s taste and flavour Examine the brewed tea leaf and the liquid colour to evaluate it
