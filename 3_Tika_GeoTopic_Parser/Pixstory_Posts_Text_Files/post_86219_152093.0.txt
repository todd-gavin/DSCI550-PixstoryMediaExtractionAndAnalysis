Stairway to public speaking 
I had always been someone who had the inclination more towards writing than speaking. However, I wanted to come out of my comfort zone. These are some of the simple lessons I learnt regarding public speaking:
1. Be confident.
If you are confident, the listeners will trust you automatically. 
2. Personalize the content. 
Use of examples, questions, real life stories and humor can help connect with the listeners. 
3. Know the content well.
It is better to choose a topic you are passionate about and know well. Additional research also plays a vital role.
4. Practice. 
Rehearse the speech as frequently as you can.
5. Use body language. 
It is proven that a major part of the communication happens non- verbally. 
6. Avoid information overload.
Too much information may leave the audience disinterested.
