I believe formal education is the most important thing in a person s life Without education the world will degrade and fall into pieces It is true education is not everything that a person needs Education without correct implementation leads nowhere and is of no use Development occurs when a person puts the knowledge he gathered from education into the world in the correct manner It is also true to possess all the mental and physical skills from education but lacking social awareness and a sound moral personality it will also lead to failure But the bottom line still remains that education is the building stone to a good and happy life uneducated people are seen to destroy the resources of the world and themselves too There are people begging for such an opportunity and others who are taking advantage of it we need to normalize having education till high school Following your passion is correct it can also happen that a person does not interest in studies but has become very successful but we need to keep in mind that for every person who achieves this exception there are that do not It also might happen that what do you want to do in life has no role of education in it hell being a businessman required no degree but you need at least General knowledge gained from education to be a decent human and to have a career to begin with
