Among the more unforgettable moments of my travels have been my three visits to Pakistan. The love, affection and warmth for us from India from its people was simply unbelievable.I visited Pakistan three times, in 1997, 2004 and then in 2006. And each time, I had a distinct experience. In 1997, when the Pakistan Independence Cup, the three match one day series was played, only a few journalists travelled with the team. So we were initially apprehensive. But our fears vanished the moment we landed in Karachi. The taxi driver spoke in fluent Punjabi, put a Hindi film song on his tape and greeted us with great warmth. However, the Indian team that was led by Sachin Tendulkar, kept to themselves as a tight security cordon kept them away from interacting with their Pakistani fans. They were cold towards the local press as well, something which didn't go well with the people. But the entire situation was different in 2004. As it was sort of a peace mission by the Indian government, and the then prime minister Vajpayee said, 'Sirf match hi mat jeeto, dil bhi jeeto (win matches as well as their hearts) .This time Pakistan didn't even make separate seating arrangements for the Indian spectators. It was a masterstroke as the hundreds who travelled to Lahore mingled with the Pakistani people and were given real VIP treatment by them. Whosoever went to Pakistan in 2004, whether the players, the journalists, or the people, all of them came back with memories, filled with love and goodwill. I have mentioned many such incidents in my book and how cricket can be a bridge and help in mending relationships between the two countries.
