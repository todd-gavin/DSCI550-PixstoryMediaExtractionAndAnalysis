Another week, another episode. The Boys' finale for the third season drops and I'm both anticipating and dreading it.

Waiting for another season is always a struggle, but a struggle that's damn worth it. This show is cinematic level excellence with great graphics, an incredible storyline and award worthy acting. This show gets the dark humor right too.

Talking of which, this season Soldier Boy made his appearance and man, I was not disappointed. I've been a fan of Jensen Ackles since his Dean Winchester days and he kept his acting chops up even in The Boys. He came in as a great addition and you can't just help but hate him. He's the sexist, racist and homophobic, what fans call him, America's A**hole. He has incredible strength and I would say is the best villain of the series so far.

That being said, I keep my money on soldier boy losing as much as I want him to be in the next season for how impeccable the comic timing he has, always gets a laugh out of you. I think Black Noir would be the one to defeat him. Other possibility is that Soldier Boy would kill Homelander and we'll have a new permanent villain from this season onwards. But I still think it's Soldier Boy that goes down which is both great and a shame because I'd sure like to see him die but also more of him.

I'm so excited! No matter what the end would be, I know for sure the next season would be even better because it's The Boys we're talking about! Let's see how this one ends though.
