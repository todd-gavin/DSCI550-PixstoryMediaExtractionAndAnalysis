At Kidderminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, Justin Lee Price, 19, of Worcester, was sentenced.
He made a remark at the Manchester United striker, who missed a penalty attempt in England's penalty shootout loss to Italy in the World Cup final at Wembley last year. At a hearing in Worcester Magistrates' Court on March 17, Price guilty to transmitting an extremely insulting message by public communication network. After the tweet was detected, he tried to avoid discovery by changing his Twitter handle, according to the CPS.
Following his arrest, the adolescent first denied the offence in his first police interrogation, but then acknowledged to posting the tweet when questioned by cops a second time.

Mark Johnson, senior Crown prosecutor for CPS West Midlands, said: "Price targeted a footballer based on the colour of his skin and his action was clearly racist and a hate crime.

"Those who racially abuse footballers ruin the game for all.
"I hope this case sends out the message that we will not tolerate racism and offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."

Douglas Mackay, the CPS sports lead prosecutor, said hate crimes relating to football have risen significantly over recent years.

"The UK Football Policing Unit's internal mid-season report has shown a significant rise in football-related criminality compared to pre-pandemic levels," he said.
"At the CPS, we play a crucial role in tackling these crimes and making our national sport inclusive and safe to watch.
"There is no place for hate in football and hate crimes such as this has significant impact on victims."
