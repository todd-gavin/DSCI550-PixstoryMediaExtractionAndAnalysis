Men, if you are unsure about what you need to do in these times here’s where you can start:

1. Believe the women who are coming forward even
    if the claims are against your friends or family.
    Don’t question why they didn’t come forward
    sooner. The least you can do is listen and believe
    them now.
2. Do not make sexual jokes or any jokes at all
    about women (which is just scratching
    the surface, right now)
3. If someone accuses YOU of (moderate)
    harassment, inappropriate jokes, gestures, of
    basically being a douche, take time to reflect,
    understand, apologize (profusely!) and use this as
    moment for self-growth.
4. Don’t get defensive if you see women use the
    blanket term “all men” to address their stories.
    Even if you are an outlier, I bet you have been in
    a room where a guy said something inappropriate
    and you choose to stay quiet. So, yes you are
    part of the problem.
5. Don’t participate in conversations which talk
    about women in a degrading manner. Heck, be
    the man who asks others to stop even!
6. This one will probably be difficult for a lot of
    Indian men, but try and stop talking to your
    friends with mother- sister cursing. Clean your
    language, clean your mind!
