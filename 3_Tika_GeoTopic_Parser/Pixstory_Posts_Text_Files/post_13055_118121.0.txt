This climbing champion has lost his life while trying to climb the second highest mountain in the world.
He was the first mountaineer from Afghanistan who tried to climb this peak, but he died due to a heart attack on this mountain.

(K2) with a height of 8611 meters above sea level, is the second highest mountain on earth after Mount Everest.

Part of these mountain ranges are located in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and other parts are located in Xinjiang, China and Tajikistan.

"He wanted to raise the Afghan flag on Ka-2 peak."
