Second birth It s time That you open your eyes Earth is not a difficult place Or when You find the back of your trench empty There is no accompaniment The promise of auxiliary force was false Or that moment You will find that the sky is not a high ceiling Blue is nothing When you are born again Kiss the Prophet And you will believe in the mission of a smile Outside the window There is stillness veto You will see the miracle of this moment
