International singing sensation Katy Perry  opened up about how her life changed after she became “clinically depressed”.

She speaks up about her days of depression hitting the peak and described it as “I just couldn’t get out of bed for weeks and became clinically depressed and had to get on medication for the first time in my life…I was so ashamed of it,”

Perry realised after the release of the fifth album that her experiences were not helping her as an artist. It was something about her own expectations that got her depres6sion. 

After she got into depression, she transformed her pain into another level of success.

 “I’m grateful for the pain because it pushed me towards the growth. Now I don’t feel like a thirsty, desperate pop star that’s just trying to hit a number. I’ve got more dimension. I have a baby on the way. I have a fiance. I love my nieces. I love my soon-to-be stepson. I love life.”
