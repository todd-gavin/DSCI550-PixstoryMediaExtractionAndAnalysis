Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot has rejected a chance to join French side Lyon this summer.

Rabiot had joined Juve in the summer of 2019 on a free transfer but the midfielder has failed to impress during his ongoing stint at the Bianconeri. He has been looking for a move away from the club this summer.
He recently didn’t travel to the US with the Juventus squad for the pre-season friendlies and Corriere di Torino (via TuttoJuve) have now reported that he will be sold to make room for the signing of Leandro Paredes.

Rabiot’s mother-agent Veronique received an offer from French side Lyon recently but she pegged it back, as they are not playing in the UEFA Champions League. The player currently ‘dreams’ of returning to Paris Saint-Germain, potentially as a possible swap in a deal involving Leandro Paredes.
Now 27, Rabiot made 32 appearances last season and couldn’t score even once, whlie getting two assists.
