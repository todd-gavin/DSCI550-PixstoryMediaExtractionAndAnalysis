Among the most ancient forms of artistic expression we can certainly also include the mosaic Already forty centuries ago the Sumerians used small dyed clay bodies to decorate walls and columns with simple colors The pre-Columbian civilizations of South and Central America and southern Mexico also used this technique using very different materials hard stones of splendid colors malachite etc. mother-of-pearl metals reptile scales The Egyptians had even developed this decorative taste to the point of glazing bricks which, inserted into the construction, gave prominence to polychrome figures Moving on to ancient Greece we have the first unpretentious mosaics tones with scenes of animals and the like executed with pebbles, even smoothed. also with uncommon material such as onyx, serpentine, glass pastes, etc. With the prevalence of Roman power, this form of art, like any other, was absorbed by the victors who brought it and spread it throughout the Empire from North Africa to the Black Sea, from Asia to Spain as for the Greek statuary, copies of mosaics made by famous Greek masters were seen in the houses of rich patricians of Rome and other cities. The material most used by the Romans consisted of weaving the cubes with which the limestone mosaic was composed, vitreous where the tonal intensity of the natural stone was not sufficiently expressed Furthermore, a very important fact, the Roman mosaicists exceeded the limit imposed on the mosaic by the Hellenistic tradition of an autonomous expressive phenomenon and placed it instead as a decorative element with the main purpose of defining the architectural spaces in a colouristic way With the Romans, the mosaic assumed a general and standardized characteristic even if differentiated according to the school of origin.
