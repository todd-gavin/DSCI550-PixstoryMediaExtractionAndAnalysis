Imran Khan ends 2-day Moscow visit hours after Russia begins military operation in Ukraine. He had arrived in Russia on Wednesday and was scheduled to meet President Vladimir Putin today. 

Khan's visit was planned more than a month ago and was expected to focus on Pakistan’s energy needs. 

In earlier reports, Khan was quoted by various news agencies saying , “He had arrived in Russia at an exciting time”. 

Khan's visit to Moscow comes in the wake of US President Joe Biden and other Western governments imposing tough economic sanctions on Russia for sending its military into parts of eastern Ukraine.

In a televised address on Thursday, Putin announced the invasion and said clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces are "inevitable". He even called on Ukrainian service members to "lay down their arms and go home".
