The rapid transition to fossil fuel is very much impractical and it will not find a permanent solution Natural gas is a clean burning fuel and will be a crucial part of this energy transition We will do our part to promote this energy transition by facilitating natural gas as part of the climate change discussion and solution How can we dismiss the role of petroleum and diesel as Oil provides of the fuel demands of the transportation sector Every transport mode cars trucks trains buses marine vessels and aircraft relies almost completely on petroleum fuels Can we abandon all the vehicles and switch to electric cars all of a sudden It is a recent development and merits yet to be seen throughout the years In the US almost per cent of electricity generation is from coal per cent from natural gas and per cent from nuclear While rising steadily only per cent is from renewable energy The decline in the price of renewable energy is indeed worth noticing but not enough Yes there must be an advancement in the field of renewable resources but it is a very slow process and this would not happen in three or four decades
