On the celebrated ‘aurat’ movement recently in Pakistan, the Urdu slogan “Mera Jism Meri Marzi !” (My body, my choice) has had it’s own share of spinoffs like “Meri zindagi, meri marzi” (My life, my choice), “Meri zindagi mere faisale” (My life, my decisions), “Meri zindagi, mera haq, mera ikhtiyar” (My life, my right, my discretion);  “Mera wajood, meri marzi!” (my existence, my choice). Recently, in India, in an alleged rape case, the victim verbalized her argument in Hindi as “Mera sharir mera hai” (My Body is Mine), “mere employer ka khilona nahi” (My body is mine, Not a toy to be played by my employer). My Choice, (a film starring Deepika Padukone of the same name, also a take on the subject) not only refers to reproductive rights but also a range of women's rights issues relating to South Asian women, such as freedom to choose clothing, movement, love, sex and marriage.

 

The present day debate on whether the hijab is an ‘essential religious practice’ may also be viewed as a non-debate, because your right to choose your attire is a question of your choice entirely. What you choose to wear is definitely not any (wo)man’s business, ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal’. Personally speaking, the Constitution of India, was for protection of choice, access and guarantee to education, no matter your religion, caste or creed. So keeping this in mind, maybe if I am to #BreakTheBias, who am I to decide your head dress or not ?
