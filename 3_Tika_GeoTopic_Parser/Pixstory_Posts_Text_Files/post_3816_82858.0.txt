As I was spending some time basking in the sun today, I spotted this little cutie. 

In Delhi, I am used to seeing only cumbersome pigeons whom I am not very fond of. I miss those times I would spot many sparrows in my colony early in the morning while leaving for school. 
Itâ€™s disheartening to see how their population has decreased over time in the city. 

Sheila Dixit, in her time declared sparrow as the State Bird of Delhi to save the species and draw awareness to its history and life and habitat. 

This bird reminded me of a sparrow with her melodious voice and the way it sucked the nectar out of the plant without hurting it.
