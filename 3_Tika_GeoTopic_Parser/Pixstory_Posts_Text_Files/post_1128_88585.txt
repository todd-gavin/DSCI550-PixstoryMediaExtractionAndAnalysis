By Sangeeth Sebastian Till the th century white Christians and authors of the New Testament justified slavery as divinely ordained Yet if you read the Bible closely you will also get an alternate and even subversive view The formative experience for early Israel was the escape from slavery in Egypt The Decalogue chronicles this experience I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slaves Prophet Moses reminds this again when he asks Israelites to observe the Sabbath Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and Yahweh your God brought you out of there Every part of the Bible is littered with such glaring contradictions and inconsistencies So like the American constitution the Bible too must be interpreted critically to ensure that its underlying principle of love thy neighbour expressed in the book of Leviticus and reiterated by Jesus does apply Love your neighbour as yourself Love does no wrong to a neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law The Bible like the Quran is one ancient text that continues to be misinterpreted by fundamentalists by cherry picking verses that suit their vested religious and political agendas Fortunately for Christianity the number of such hard line loonies are far fewer than in Islam America is an exception in the developed world Concluded The writer is the founder of VVOX a sextech platform
