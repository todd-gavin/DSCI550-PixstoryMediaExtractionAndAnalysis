Verdict
Vuskovic is a well-known name in the second tier of German Football. With that popularity comes the attention of big clubs. Liverpool has been credited for showing interest in him. With Joel Matip reaching his 30s, the Croatian will provide crucial, as he can be sturdy for the next decade. Plus his performances have shown that he is fitted to play in top-flight football.
However, Vuskovic is keen on staying at Hamburg, as he wants his team to get back to the top flight of the Bundesliga and the feelings are mutual for his team too. In case the 20-year-old decides to leave Hamburg, theyâ€™ll demand a range of 10-12 million to sell their Croatian prospect. However the amount for him may be deemed unfair by Liverpool, and other top clubs as they would feel that he lacks the experience to play in top-flight football.
