In just a few months we ll be getting our hands on both the highly awaited Dead Space remake and the brand new horror game Callisto Protocol made by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield Made by the same person and featuring a similar sort of environment with the same kind of disgusting creepy enemies as was the case in Dead Space what is the difference between Callisto Protocol and the EA horror action icon Since its initial reveal The Callisto Protocol has been referred to by many as a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series due to the commonalities in IPs including their science fiction settings horror elements unpredictability violence and visual designs Furthermore both are survival horror games set on space colonies that feature mutant zombies that must be dismembered before they can be fully killed While The Callisto Protocol emphasizes traditional action mechanics more it also features an action stealth dynamic in a vein similar to The Last Of Us rather than the straight ahead pound and stomp brutal combat of Dead Space A spiritual sequel to Dead Space in almost every sense of the word The Callisto Protocol aims to recapture the aura of its spiritual predecessor while aiming to create an altogether different sort of experience As such The Callisto Protocol aims to push the Dead Space legacy forward The Callisto Protocol s combat will be an almost rhythmic balancing act between melee weapons firearms and some form of telekinesis with Telekinesis being a familiar feature in both games However here it is mainly used against enemies themselves while Dead Space s Kinesis can only be used on objects and parts removed from enemies The Callisto Protocol s telekinesis allows players to grab enemies in an instant restraining them pulling them closer or pushing them away Between the stealth mechanics and increased focus on telekinesis it s clear that the combat in the two games have enough differences Furthermore the camera work and movement animations used in the gameplay trailer are rather reminiscent of The Last of Us while the game s enemies don t seem quite as creepy and horrifying as the Necromorphs in Dead Space
