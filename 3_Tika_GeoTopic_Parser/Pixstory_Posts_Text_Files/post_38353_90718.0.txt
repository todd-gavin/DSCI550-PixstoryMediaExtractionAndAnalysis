Spicy pickled cabbage (called Kimch'i) and rice are the mainstays of the diet around which most other dishes revolve just like how Indians need mango pickle, lemon pickle etc., With their meals. 

Meals usually consist of a number of spicy vegetables, soup, fish, and Kimch'i. A favorite food is naengmyon, a cold noodle dish. 
Not to forget Koreans have a high spice tolerance and their food is a must try!! ü§§

But something is shocking!! ü§î
Families rarely have time to eat daily meals together. Fathers often leave early in the morning and return late at night. They commonly eat their meals at workplace cafeterias. Koreans consider eating while walking on the street ill-mannered and offensive, something only a child is allowed to indulge in. Except during lengthy dinner parties, conversation during meals is quite limited. Eating with the fingers is considered impolite, but slurping soup and noodles is accepted; in fact, it is a practical way to eat hot food at the rapid pace Koreans are used to. Spoons for soup and chopsticks for everything else are the most common utensils.

Do let me know what all Korean dishes will u try üòÅ
