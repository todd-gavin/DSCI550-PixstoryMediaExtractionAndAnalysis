Being a good person isn't equivalent to not being a privileged one. Being a good person is doing the bare minimum in bringing equality to those who are marginalized unlike yourself. In this case, men not being criminals does not nullify the fact that they're privileged. On the contrary, it proves their privilege because not being criminals is being used as something that's supposed to put them on a pedestal. 

It was clearly mentioned in the previous post that the "All Men" ideology does not stem from thinking every man is a rapist or a murderer, it stems from the fact that every man is privileged when it comes to his gender. "Men are victims too." Not a word of lie there. But that again has a lot to do with gendered expectations that come from patriarchy and not women. Statistically, 80% violent crimes are committed by men, 96% sex crimes are committed by men, 96% mass shootings are committed by men. The data is too inclined towards one part of the society to just shrug off the fact that crimes committed by men are just crimes and not something that's systemic and deeply institutionalized in the society. Expecting women to just go ahead and trust men because "not all men" with that kind of statistic in hand is like asking a person to play Russian Roulette because not all of its chambers carry live rounds.

Let's suppose there are 100 snakes in a container and not all of them are venomous and you're told to put your hand in it because, well, not all snakes. Would you trust that? Would you risk being bitten by the venomous snake just because there might be some non venomous snakes in there? No you wouldn't. Yet you expect women to somehow know what man has ill intentions and what doesn't.

Your privilege reflects in all your actions, denying women's fear of being assaulted by a man is one of them. Being able to walk at night is another. There are countless other examples. Open your eyes and look around for your own self!
