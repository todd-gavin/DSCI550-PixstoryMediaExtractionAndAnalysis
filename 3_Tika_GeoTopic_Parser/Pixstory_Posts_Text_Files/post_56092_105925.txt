The Tyger BY WILLIAM BLAKE Tyger Tyger burning bright In the forests of the night What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes On what wings dare he aspire What the hand dare seize the fire And what shoulder what art Could twist the sinews of thy heart And when thy heart began to beat What dread hand what dread feet What the hammer what the chain In what furnace was thy brain That the anvil what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp When the stars threw down their spears And water d heaven with their tears Did he smile at his work to see Did he who made the Lamb make thee Tyger Tyger burning bright In the forests of the night What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry The poem is one of the most anthologised in the English literary canon and has been the subject of both literary criticism and many adaptations including various musical versions The poem explores and questions Christian religious paradigms in late th century and early th century England discussing God s intention and motivation for creating both the tiger and the lamb In The Tyger there is a duality between beauty and ferocity with Blake indicating that understanding one expects an understanding of the other Blake asserts that humankind s battles have their origin in the contrasting nature of theories Truth his poetry indicates lies in discerning the paradoxes between innocence and experience Rather than believing in the war between good and evil or heaven and hell Blake believed each man must first see and then settle the contraries of existence and life
