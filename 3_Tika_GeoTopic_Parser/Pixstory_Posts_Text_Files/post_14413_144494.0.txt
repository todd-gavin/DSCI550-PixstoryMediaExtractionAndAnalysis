👉Know your magic number-
To get on the right track, multiply your body weight by 16-18 to get your ideal growth range.
 If you need to drop a few pounds, multiply your body weight by 12. If maintenance is the aim, you'll want to fall within the 13-15 range.
👉Avoid the extremes: make small tweaks
Maintain your current macronutrient ratios, and stick with that new level for another three weeks.
Keep tweaking your macros until the scale is moving steadily in the right direction.
👉Supplement with shakes.
If you're having trouble squeezing enough of those filling foods in your meals, make protein shakes your secret weapon. 
Add a 20-25-gram protein shake to your meal plan once or twice a day to hit your numbers without feeling stuffed.
👉Include protein with every meal.
Approximately 15-20 percent of your daily calories should come from lean protein.
Lean meats are one of your body's greatest fat-burning sources, helping to jump-start your metabolism.
👉Never fear carbs—at least not the good carbs.
Following a low-carb diet for too long can leave you feeling depleted and potentially catabolic, shedding muscle mass instead of body fat.
👉Beware of hidden sodium.
The fact is, it's important to get enough sodium in your diet. The best nutritional approach is to be aware of your sodium intake and aim for levels that are neither too high nor too low, which can sometimes be tricky.
