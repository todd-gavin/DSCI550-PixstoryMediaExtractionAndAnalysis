‘Don't Look Up’ is arguably the first film to seriously address the climate question. Critical reception is mixed, but viewers have cheered it: it set a record for the most viewing hours in a single week on Netflix, and is the second most-watched film within 28 days of release on that platform. 

Director Adam McKay says he is under no illusion that one film can solve the crisis. “But if it inspires conversation, critical thinking, and makes people less tolerant of inaction from their leaders, then I’d say we accomplished our goal”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/climate/dont-look-up-climate.html

But the climate issue has been so complicated that one wonders if one film (or one book) can bring about a revolutionary transformation in the public discourse and compel governments to take decisive action.

To be honest, there have been cases of works of art making a radical contribution. Stanley Kubrick’s ‘Dr Strangelove’ or James Bridges’ ‘The China Syndrome’ made people realize the full dangers of nuclear warfare like never before. After watching ‘The Day After’, President Reagan resolved not to let a nuclear war happen: https://www.reaganfoundation.org/ronald-reagan/white-house-diaries/diary-entry-10101983/ 

Rachel Carson’s ‘Silent Spring’ (1962) awakened policymakers and citizens alike to the dangers of indiscriminate use of pesticides: http://www.rachelcarson.org/SilentSpring.aspx

The climate front is not well served by Hollywood yet. Either the subject is handled as part of the disaster/dystopia/apocalypse genre (‘Avengers’, ‘Godzilla’) or specialist sci-fi (‘Interstellar’). The trouble with ‘Don’t Look Up’, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, is that it presents an approaching comet about to destroy earth as metaphor for global warming. Two astronomers attempt to warn humanity about the coming catastrophe, and they are met with (as we have seen in case of climate) disbelief, inaction and so on. Many critics think the satire part is either too funny or too ham-handed for any lasting impact on viewers: https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-crude-demagogy-of-dont-look-up

But many climate scientists are impressed. Famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson thought it was rather like watching a documentary: https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1476293956153581578?s=20

Either way, it has begun a conversation: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/climate-scientist-dont-look-up-madness 
Let us see how it goes forward.

Netflix has partnered with climate scientists to host a website that suggests how people can take action: https://dontlookup.count-us-in.com/
