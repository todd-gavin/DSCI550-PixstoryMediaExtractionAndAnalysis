Psychotherapy is an amalgamation of psychological methods to help people overcome their problems; it's mainly about counselling and interaction that involves dealing with the person's issue and helping them find the lost soul they once were.

It helps resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviours, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions and improves relationships and social skills. Numerous psychotherapy types have been designed for individual adults, families, children, and adolescents. Certain types of psychotherapy are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders; other classes have been criticized as pseudoscience.

In ancient Greece, philosophers found the connection between mental health and medicine. Before this, changes in mental health were often connected to curses, omens or signs from God.

If to speak particularly about modern psychotherapy, then we know the name of Austrian physician Franz Anton Mesmer, who is considered the modern founder of psychotherapy.

Besides, some renowned names are associated with psychotherapy, like Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, and Melanie Klien.

Psychotherapy has never lost its relevance.
