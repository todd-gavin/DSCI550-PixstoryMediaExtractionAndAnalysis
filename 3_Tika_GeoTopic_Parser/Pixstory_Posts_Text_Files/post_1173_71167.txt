By Sangeeth Sebastian A few years ago journalist John Tierney took Helen Fisher a noted American human behaviour researcher pictured on a date During their meeting Tierney told Fisher that he is interested only in a friends with benefits relationship read casual sex with her As someone who studied love and sex for a living Fisher told Tierney that when you have sex with someone there is a possibility that you may also end up falling in love with that person True to her words two years later in Tierney married Fisher In an interview a few weeks ago Fisher half jokingly hoped that her partner of two years is not cheating on her because they are now navigating a long distance relationship There is nothing unusual about her apprehension except when you are told that Tierney is and Fisher is Forget infidelity sex is often the last thing at least that s what we think ought to be on many people s mind at that age But the truth is something else Love hormones can kick in at any age You can feel the same level of emotional dependency burst in energy levels separation anxiety and mood swings which you experienced at at or even beyond that provided you are healthy Love and sex are the two most powerful and basic brain systems human beings have evolved while wandering in the African savannas
