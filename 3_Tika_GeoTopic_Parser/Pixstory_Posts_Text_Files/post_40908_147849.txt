Through me forbidden voices Voices of sexes and lusts voices veil d and I remove the veil Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur d I do not press my fingers across my mouth I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart Copulation is no more rank to me than death is I believe in the flesh and the appetites Seeing hearing feeling are miracles and each part and tag of me is a miracle Divine am I inside and out and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch d from The scent of these arm pits aroma finer than prayer This head more than churches bibles and all the creeds If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body or any part of it Translucent mould of me it shall be you Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you Firm masculine colter it shall be you Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you You my rich blood your milky stream pale strippings of my life Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you My brain it shall be your occult convolutions Root of wash d sweet flag timorous pond snipe nest of guarded duplicate eggs it shall be you Mix d tussled hay of head beard brawn it shall be you Trickling sap of maple fibre of manly wheat it shall be you Sun so generous it shall be you Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you Winds whose soft tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you Broad muscular fields branches of live oak loving lounger in my winding paths it shall be you Hands I have taken face I have kiss d mortal I have ever touch d it shall be you Walt Whitman
