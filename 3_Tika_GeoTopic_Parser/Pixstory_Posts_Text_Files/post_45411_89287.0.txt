According to the recent reports across outlets and from famous journalists, the Juventus playmaker, Paulo Dybala is all set to leave Juventus at the end of the season as a free agent. The club had decided to offer a sum of €10 million but the Old Lady decided to change the package offered to the Argentine international. Hence, the player has decided to part ways.

Dybala will leave Juventus as free agent. There was full verbal agreement last October for €8m plus €2m net salary until 2026 - then Juve decided to change their proposal. 
Dybala Paulo’s not happy with current, new conditions and he will now open talks with other clubs.

Other clubs have encircled the player for his signature. The Serie A clubs AC Milan and Inter Milan and Premier League clubs like Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal are interested in securing the player. Despite the presence of these clubs, Paulo Dybala can fit the bill of only a few clubs.   

With multiple clubs circling the player, it becomes important for the interested club to seal the deal. Tottenham Hotspur are one such club who are looking to secure the services of the playmaker. And, it makes sense why the club badly needs the services of the Argentine international.
