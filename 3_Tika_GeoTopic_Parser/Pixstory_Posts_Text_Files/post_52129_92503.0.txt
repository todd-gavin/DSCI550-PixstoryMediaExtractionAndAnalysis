The Los Angeles Lakers' postseason hopes are officially over, the future seems bleak, and heads are likely to roll. Head coach Frank Vogel is widely expected to face a reckoning. The Lakers would like to find a way to offload Russell Westbrook, unlikely though that may be, after he almost surely opts in to his $47 million, final year option this summer. 

Fingers can be pointed all around at a Lakers season that is a wreckage of the high hopes when the season began: At Russ, at Vogel, at Anthony Davis' injuries, at a front office that put as ill-fitting a team as possible around their all-time great superstar. 

But it is, ultimately, the fault of the person in the Lakers organization with the most say and the most power who is to blame -- the one who used that sway to put into place all the elements that have led L.A. to where it now stands, with a failed season behind them and no clear path forward.

This is all LeBron James' fault.

The Catch-22 of LeBron's all-time greatness has always been the out-weighted influence he's exuded on a team. His wants have often been paramount to the plan, even his actual needs. But the juice has always been worth the squeeze. His call for player power in the NBA always had a sheen of success because he succeeded at every turn, regardless of how he wielded that power.

Chris Bosh as perhaps the wrong fit with LeBron and Dwyane Wade? No worries. Championships ensued anyway.

Kevin Love for Andrew Wiggins, JR Smith as a key cog and a host of other moves quietly -- or not so quietly -- pushed by the King turning out to not exactly be the stuff for an executive-of-the-year resume? Who cares? Finals appearances, and an actual championship for Cleveland, arrived nonetheless.
