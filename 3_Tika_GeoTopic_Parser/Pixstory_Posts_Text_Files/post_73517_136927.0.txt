GAANE-GUNE SUNO, DANCE-SHANCE KARO also last song IS THE ULTIMATE MOOD-LIFTER. You really have to rap, automatically singing shuru hojati hai. It's funny how we specifically look for happiness on a Friday jab ki weekends palak jhapakte hi nikal jaate hain, at least weekdays ke end par you feel you did something productive but on the contrary weekends waise hi hone chahiye, some weekends at home, doing nothing in your pyjamas and some weekends, getting wasted with your friends and some random strangers. Manifesting both kinda weekends this september. Please bhagwaanji baaki sab sambhaal lena.
Thanks.

Didara
Suban hone na de
Mileya mileya
Say shava shava
Woh ladki hai kahan
Jhakk maar ke
Senorita
Aankhain khuli ho
