First thing that the book taught me is that One can always be a good human, we all make mistakes but what matters is how we redeem our wrong actions,

Second thing Is Forgiveness, or choosing to let go of negative feelings toward one who has hurt you, can bring up feelings of pride, guilt, and sorrow. The Kite Runner is a book all about forgiveness. The main character, Amir, spends most of his life trying to forgive himself for not helping his friend while he was assaulted.
