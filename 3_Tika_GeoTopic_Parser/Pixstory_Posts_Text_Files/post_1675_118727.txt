If all the cultures of the world are rivers then Kolkata is the basin where they meet The ancient heritage of the Chinese people residing at India s only Chinatown at Tangra seems to ardently worship Goddess Kali in their own spiritual essence With noodles served in the holy prasad no wonder India s only Chinese Kali Bari is worth every mentioning One can never understand the intensity of religious and cultural homogenization until they step here Alongwith a Sunday lunch plan at the famous Chinatown I could not miss a visit to Chinese Kali Bari Right at the heart of Kolkata on one of the main roads of India s thriving Chinatown this temple is the compound of faiths and beliefs There is always ambiguity in their worship and you can draw your own personal credence It s all a part of our belief a fragment of our faith emulsified with our religious doctrines that at times forbids or even lets us follow a different philosophical pathway One of the best examples of such kind of harmony confluence exists in the only Chinatown of India in Kolkata The Chinese Kali Bari in Tangra tells us a story of how two diverging cultural theologies converged at this holy shrine years ago the local Hindu worshippers prayed a stone under a tree decorated with sindoor As the story goes on it so happened that a terminally ill boy upon whom doctors had given up all hopes of recovery miraculously got better It is said that one of the Hindu locals prayed to Goddess Kali in front of that stone establishment Slowly the feeble belief turned into faith as the Chinese community came together and built the temple Although the major religion in Tangra Chinatown is Buddhism and Christianity the cultural bifurcation turns out superfluous during Kali Puja The entire granite temple was built in wherein every single Chinese family donated money for its construction The Chinese use candles made of paper to ward off evil spirits during the evening aarti in the same way as done in Chinese churches You must visit this Chinese Bengali amalgamation holy temple during Diwali where more than a thousand people gather to pray The prasad served after Kali Puja consists of chop suey ramen noodles and Chinese rice which can t be found anywhere else in India
