On July 8th, in response to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh being harassed by protesters while out to eat with his family, forcing him to leave the restaurant, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mocked the Justice by tweeting out, “Poor guy. He left before his souffle because he decided half the country should risk death if they have an ectopic pregnancy within the wrong state lines. It’s all very unfair to him. The least they could do is let him eat cake.”

Just 5 days later, in response to one lone person heckling her, AOC tweeted out the following: “I posted about a deeply disgusting incident that happened today on the Capitol steps, but took it down bc it’s clearly someone seeking extremist fame. It’s just a bummer to work in an institution that openly allowed this, but talking about it only invites more. Just really sad.”

The hypocrisy of AOC and her supporters is shockingly transparent. Her and her supporters constantly excuse their outraged and immoral conduct by portraying their opponents as evildoers, so that they may be nasty to evil persons, but claim being victimized if an evil person does something to them.  AOC has a history of making public posts about those who heckle her. However, when you disagree with AOC, it is apparently permissible to be heckled and harassed to a significant degree, whereas when you agree with her, you must be protected from any furious protesters.
