Everyone knows tress are very important but let' s look at some of the advantages 
You can get by planting one near your house 

REMOVING POLLUTANTS - Trees clean the air, remove dust and particulates, absorb ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants, through the stomates in the leaf surface . 

SOUND ABSORPTION, WINDBREAKS - T rees provide sound buffers and act as windbreaks in urban areas 

COOLING URBAN AREAS : A tree can be a natural air conditioner. The evaporation from a single large tree can produce the cooling effect of 10 room size air conditioners operating 20 hours a day . 

AIR CLEANSING: Cooler air temperatures created by tree canopies reduce smog levels by up to 6%. A mature tree absorbs from 120 to 240 lbs of the small particles and gases of air pollution.
