Gareth Bale&#39;s adventure at Real Madrid now at a minimum From being the hero of the night in Kiev in the Welshman has now become a real redundancy for the Blancos This season from August to late March Bale has only collected minutes with the shirt of Merengues Numbers that in recent days have unleashed the fans and the Spanish press against the Welshman Even more after the call-up with Wales and the brace against Austria Marca and other national media have defined Bale as a parasite by attacking him directly The parasite Bale came from the cold and rainy Great Britain He settled in Spain at Real Madrid where he first showed diligence and love for the club then his true nature led him to suck blood without giving anything in return Well actually more than blood he sucked and still sucks the club&#39;s money This is the incipit of the long attack by the Spanish newspaper against the Welshman A direct affront aimed at hitting the footballer in no uncertain terms Today, on his social profiles, Bale responded by calling into question the Spanish media themselves and suggesting them a shrewd reflection At a time when people take their lives off because of the insensitivity of the media i want to know who controls these journalists and who allows them to write articles like this Luckily i have thick skin but that doesn&#39;t mean articles like these don&#39;t cause harm i have witnessed the effect that i media can have on people&#39;s mental and physical health The media always expect extraordinary performance and are the first to celebrate when it happens but then encourage the anger and disappointment of fans when things go wrong The daily pressures on athletes are immense and it is clear how media negativity can easily send an already stressed athlete into a tailspin or anyone in the spotlight I hope for our children that the ethics and standards of journalism are enforced more rigorously in the future
