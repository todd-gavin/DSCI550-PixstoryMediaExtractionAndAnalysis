The normalcy is yet to return the mood is still sombre Cameroon are through to the semi finals of the African Cup of Nations after Karl Toko Ekambi s double strike helped them to a win over Gambia in the hosts first game since the deadly crush in Yaounde The Indomitable Lions had not taken to the field since the tragic crush prior to their last game against the Comoros in Yaounde a disaster which left eight dead and injured The quarter final loss was also the end of Gambia s dream who despite being a low ranked side did wonderfully to reach the last eight But will this victory be able to bring the smile back on the faces of the people of Cameroon There are serious doubts though the victory resulted to scenes of ecstatic celebration in Douala Cameroon may march further up in the tournament and team can make the people of the host nation feel proud of their achievements but the scene of even a six year old dying because of stampede and chaos outside the stadium would continue to haunt them for many years Every team aspire to win the tournament they play every nation dream of hosting an international meet successfully But certainly not at any cost There were serious allegations from some quarters that the Covid protocol laid down on the eve of the continental meet was hardly followed and the authorities too weren t completely serious resulting in overcrowding in the stadium that led to the stampede Now several measures have been enforced to avoid a repeat of disaster like stopping of free distribution of tickets and banning children under from attending games The sports minister of Cameroon has urged the spectators to come to the stadium early All these precautions however could have been taken earlier CAF president Patrice Motsepe said the venue will not host the semis or final unless Cameroon soccer officials can guarantee it will be safe But this will not bring back the dead All those hapless people wanted was to watch a game of football and have some fun They didn t deserve this end
