For an average Indian for hours or so while Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is playing on screen life seems full of possibilities What s not to like Friends travelling to Spain doing adventure sports and the cherry on top being finding love along the way You start to plan a similar trip in your mind After all you only live once right In the interval you drop a text in your Goa Trip WhatsApp group determined to make it happen this time You have an awakening a new found respect for life and experiences You don t want to live in a box By the time the movie gets over two of friends have cancelled because they can t get a leave from office One of them has family commitments and your women friends can t get permission from home And you The electricity bill rent and the EMI was your iPhone and MacBook just got debited and the only Spain you can afford to go is the one in your dreams Movies like ZNMD are good mode of escapism but this world of Zoya Akhtar is for a few chosen upper class only The average Indian drinks chai and eats peanuts in the winter fun and the weekend is a success
