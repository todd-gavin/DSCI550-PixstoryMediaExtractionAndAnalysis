Harry Styles’ highly anticipated third album was released 2 weeks ago, and we couldn’t be more excited for it. Harry takes a different approach with this album, as he makes an acoustic album with a sprinkle of rock along with a dash of pop music. The whole album is amazing from start to finish, but there is one song which has caught special attention of the fans and has quickly become a fan favorite. ‘Matilda’ being Track #7 on the album has solidified its position on the charts and evidently in the fans’ heart too. 

Matilda is based off a movie with the same name, which sees a young girl facing the challenges of having emotionally absent and abusive parents. The song works like a balm being applied to the wounds of the child who had to endure the abuse in her formative years. Many fans across the globe unfortunately found the song highly relatable to what they have faced in their lives. Harry soothes some of the pain that the fans carry by singing 
“You can let it go, You can throw a party full of everyone you know, 
And not invite your family, Coz, they never showed you love, 
You don’t have to be sorry for leaving and growing up.” 

These words of comfort from Harry means a lot to the fans as they have showed an overpouring love and support to this song. 

Harry said in his interview with Zane Lowe how it was important for him to make sure, that he 
could properly convey his support in the song, without making himself the center of the attention. He accomplishes that with the following lyrics: - 
 “You showed me a power that is strong enough to bring sun to the darkest day, 
 It’s none of my business, but it’s just been on my mind” 

Harry finishes the song by assuring the fans that they can always start a family that will always show them love and that they don’t have to hold onto the past and that they can let it go.
