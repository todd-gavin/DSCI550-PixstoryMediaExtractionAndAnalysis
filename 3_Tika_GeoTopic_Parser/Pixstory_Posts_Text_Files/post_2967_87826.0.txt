Jonathan and Diana Toebbe were a happily married couple, in their mid-forties, who had been living happily in the sleepy suburb of Annapolis in Maryland, US with two young children.

Jonathan was a US Navy nuclear engineer, working for the US government, specialising in naval nuclear propulsion, better known as Naval Reactors. He had worked as the top officer in the US navy’s branch in Arlington, Virginia, from 2012 to 2014. He had access to “Restricted Data” concerning design, manufacture or utilisation of atomic weapons. Diana Toebbe was a humanities teacher at Key School, a private K-12 school, close to their home in Annapolis.

But the two were not happy with what they earned—Jonathan apparently earned around $150,000 and Diana $60,000 a year. And they had lost a $270,000 house during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2016 when Donald Trump became the US president, the couple got distraught and planned to leave the US with a huge cache of funds. That was when the couple hatched a conspiracy to sell the country’s nuclear secrets to a discerning foreign nation.

But the couple hadn’t lost their conscience completely. They believed that selling the secret to Russia or China, America’s arch enemies, would be too immoral. So, they settled on Brazil, “a country that was rich enough to buy the secrets” and also not “too hostile” to the US, according to a report in the New York Times.   

Indeed, Brazil was eager to buy the secrets and the couple eyed $500,000 via cryptocurrency. But they had never imagined that Brazil’s intelligence officials would pass the details of the deal to FBI agents.

The engineer was caught red-handed while passing the secrets—which included designs of nuclear submarines and how to operate them-- via memory cards concealed in a sandwich, a chewing gum package and a sealed Band-Aid wrapper in 2021.  

The couple now await sentencing on August 17. The engineer could be sentenced for 17 years and his wife 3 years for assisting him in espionage.
