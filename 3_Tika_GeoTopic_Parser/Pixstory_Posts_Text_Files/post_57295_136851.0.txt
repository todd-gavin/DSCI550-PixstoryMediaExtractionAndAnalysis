This is quite a perplexing idea in itself.
With the growing culture and intermixing of food, people are finding different ways to change what and how they can eat.
Earlier the most commonly used terms were vegetarian and non-vegetarian, but slowly different other terms related to diet have been added to this area.
A pescatarian is someone who adds seafood and fish to his otherwise vegetarian diet.
This term was coined in the early 1990s.
If we speak of scientific literature, this diet is often described as a "pesco- vegetarian" and is undoubtedly put in the spectrum of vegetarianism.
Seafood is taken in this diet to maintain the protein source; otherwise, the diet involves eating whole grains, nuts, legumes etc.
