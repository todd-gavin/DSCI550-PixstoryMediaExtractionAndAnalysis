Every time you lift your hand off the keyboard and reach for your mouse or touchpad you re wasting precious seconds That s why I use keyboard shortcuts for everything on my PC Not only are key combos faster to hit but they re also more accurate than even the best mouse when it comes to precise actions like highlighting text or selecting cells in a spreadsheet
