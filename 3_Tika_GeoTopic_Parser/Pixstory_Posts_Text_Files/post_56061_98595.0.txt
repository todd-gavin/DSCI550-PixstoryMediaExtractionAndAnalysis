Ozymandias 

BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY

I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Ozymandias is one of the most powerful poems by P.B Shelley.  The poem is about the question of existence after death. We all live for a few years its just to make the life meaningful for us. In the poem around the decaying ruin of the statue, nothing remains only the “lone and level sands,” which stretch out around it. Ozymandias’s works have deteriorated and disappeared, his civilization is gone, and all have been turned to dust by the impartial, indiscriminate, destructive power of history. The ruined statue is now merely a monument to one man’s hubris and a powerful statement about the unimportance of human beings in the passage of time. Ozymandias symbolises political power.
