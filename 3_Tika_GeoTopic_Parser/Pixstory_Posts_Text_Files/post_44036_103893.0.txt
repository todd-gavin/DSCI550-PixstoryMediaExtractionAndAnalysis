The Portugal international has signed a four-year contract with Ligue 1 champions. Paris Saint Germain has signed Nuno Mendes permanently from Sporting CP. 

The French side triggered their option to acquire the left-back after he spent the last season on loan from the Portuguese team. 

How did Nuno Mendes perform at PSG on loan?
Mendes took a significant role at PSG after making the temporary move in August last year. He featured 27 times in Ligue 1 as Mauricio Pochettino’s team went on to lift another title.

He also played in all eight of their Champions League matches before they were eliminated by Real Madrid in the round of 16.
At 19 years of age, Mendes is expected to be a key part of PSG’s long-term ambitions. 

In the first season in Paris, the teenage international made 37 appearances, providing two assists and playing his part in the club’s tenth French championship triumph. Nominated for the Ligue 1 player of the year, he was named the best left-back in the competition. 

Who else could come and go at PSG this summer?
The signing of the promising defender is the latest piece of business to be wrapped up early after the end of the season. 
Most importantly, Kylian Mbappe has committed to a new contract with the club that runs until 2025 despite being long linked with a move to Real Madrid. 

Meanwhile, Neymar recently said he intends to stay at the capital club despite reports that they are open to selling him for the right place. 

They already have announced that Angel di Maria has left the club this summer. The Argentine international may not be the only outgoing player, with Julian Draxler one of those being linked with a move away in search of first-team football.
