Jurgen Klopp has revealed that Liverpool are in contract talks with James Milner.

The 36-year-old has been at Anfield since the summer of 2015, but his contract is up at the end of the season.

However, Klopp doesn't think that Milner has any intention to retire, and he revealed in his press conference before the Reds play Burnley that Liverpool are speaking to Milner about a new deal.

Liverpool picked the former Newcastle United and Aston Villa man up from Manchester City on a free, and what a signing he has turned out to be.

Milner has made 273 appearances for the Reds, and he has also won the Champions League and the Premier League (transfermarkt).

He can play in midfield or fill in at right-back, and despite ageing, his standards never ever slip.

Therefore, I totally understand why Klopp and Liverpool want him to stay, even if he doesn't play as much as he used to.

Milner has been one of Liverpool's best signings in the Premier League era because of what he has achieved and the way he approaches games.

He has always been a top professional, but under Klopp, he has become a key part of a fantastic period of time at Anfield.

A new contract is the least he deserves, so I hope they get this sorted out quickly, so Milner can retire at Liverpool if he wants to.
