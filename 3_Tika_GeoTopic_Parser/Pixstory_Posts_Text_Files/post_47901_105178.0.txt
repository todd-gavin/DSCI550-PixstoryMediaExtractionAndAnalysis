Archana Sarode, a private school teacher in Gurgaon, lost her job in the pandemic aftermath. With classes going online, her private school did not have the need for a pre-school teacher. Sarode, a mother of two, had been working for the last three years. Likewise, independent insurance consultant Mitul Tiwari, based out of Delhi, had to quit her job as the post-pandemic period proved a roadblock in getting people interested in extra savings.

Sarode and Tiwari are among thousands of women who had to quit their job or were laid off during the pandemic and its aftermath. According to recent data compiled by the World Bank, it has been seen that between 2010 and 2020, the number of working women in India dropped from 26 percent to 19 percent. In fact, female employment plummeted to only nine percent in 2022. The reasons are manifold.

The foremost reason, of course, is the fact that in India women are considered the primary caregivers of the family. For example, in Sarode’s case, her husband is a data analyst with a startup, while her ailing father-in-law lives with them, plus there was the care needed for two school-going children—the younger one in Class II. As lockdown after lockdown was imposed, and with her husband also working from home, it was decided by the family to shore up their expenses by cutting down on household help. The moment that happened, the household chores largely fell on Sarode, with her husband chipping in from time to time. But with his job demanding most of his time, there was only so much he could do. Then there was the need to care for her ailing father-in-law and with no outdoor play time and online classes, look after the needs of her children. With the school shut, Sarode doubled up as the caregiver for her family of five.
