June marks the st anniversary of the birth of Arthur Stanley Jefferson better known as Stan Laurel We remember him primarily for the relatively brief time fourteen years in which Laurel and Hardy made their best films for the Hal Roach Studios from to but he toiled hard to create laughter for most of his life He worked steadily for twenty years learning his craft and refining his art before the first Laurel and Hardy film flashed onto theater screens Stan Laurel came to USA and joined a Karno touring company The star comedian was Charlie Chaplin whose specialty was playing an angry drunk in the Mumming Birds audience Stan was Chaplin s roommate and understudy and while Chaplin was Stan s friend he was also a hindrance to his becoming anything more than a supporting player This and the refusal of a raise in pay prompted Stan to return to UK Not achieving any success in UK he went back to USA to rejoin Chaplin Though Laurel acted in a number of solo movies his notable works are in the immortal Laurel Hardy movies
