Things in this country just don’t seem to improve for Native Americans. If use of slurs wasn’t enough, now our Native American friends are being banned from public places. 

Native News Online reported that on March 20, Grand Gateway Hotel co-owner Connie Uhre responded on Rapid City Mayor Steve Allender's Facebook post stating Native Americans would no longer be permitted on the grounds, including at "Cheers," the hotel's renowned bar. Uhre's remark occurred after a late-night shooting at the motel, which led in a young Lakota guy being sent to the local hospital's intensive care unit. 

“In Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), the Supreme Court held that Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a valid exercise of Congress' power, and Title II prohibits racial discrimination in public accommodations,” Alkire wrote to Garland. “The Department of Justice has the responsibility to enforce the Civil Rights Act prohibition against denial of access to public accommodations based upon race.”

When Uhre's remark about banning all Native Americans from the hotel property was made public, Lakota Nation leaders were forthright and determined to providing a united and coordinated reaction. On March 21, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Chairman Harold Frazier released a press release claiming that Lakota people have been considered as a problem since settlers arrived. 

A demonstration was held on Saturday, mostly organised by tribal leadership, with hundreds of people in attendance. 

Let’s see if justice is served or this incident is swept under rug like any crime against Native Americans.
