Almost 500 straphangers have been ticketed this year for taking up too much space napping in subway cars, an NYPD chief said Friday at a City Council budget hearing.

The enforcement is part of the crackdown since Mayor Adams and police last month announced it was determined to drive down subway crime and restore order underground while trying to connect the homeless with social services.

Chief of Transit Jason Wilcox said more than 1,000 extra cops now patrol the subway system as part of the focus on the crime rate, currently up 80%.

He said officers have helped place 198 homeless people in shelters and have issued 470 summonses for the offense of “outstretching,” as sprawling out to sleep in a subway car is called, plus more than 13,000 summonses for fare evasion, 1,080 for smoking, 620 for drinking and 200 for public urination. Wilcox also said arrests for fare evasion are up 44%.

“We are now very much focused on these quality-of-life situations that we’re experiencing in transit,” Wilcox said. “We’re working very hard to restore that sense of calm, that sense of order in the transit system.”

The increase reflects a broader rise in enforcement this year as the NYPD deals with a 45% surge in the overall crime rate.

Murders are down thus far, to 76 compared to 82 at the same time last year. But the other six felonies that comprise the crime rate are up sharply -- including 35% for rape, 44% for robbery, 62% for grand larceny and 92% for grand larceny auto.

But Sewell, in her first appearance -- albeit virtual -- before the council’s Public Safety Committee said she expects the newly-unveiled Neighborhood Safety Unit to help drive down the gun violence that has surged across the city the past two years.

And so far this year, she said, arrests for major crimes have increased, including 40% for rape and 24% for robbery.

But, she noted, the key to long-range success will be less about enforcement and more about prevention.
