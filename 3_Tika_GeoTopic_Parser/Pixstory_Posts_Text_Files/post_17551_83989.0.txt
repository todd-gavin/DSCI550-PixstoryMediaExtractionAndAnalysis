It was another disappointing loss for the Lakers as they dropped five games behind .500. They faced off against the Clippers in their first game after the All-Star weekend but failed to get the win.

It was an erratic end to the game, as a controversial call was made which tipped the game in favor of the Lakers. Although the team expressed their displeasure with officiating, the result did not change, resulting in the Lakers losing their third game against the Clippers this season.

LeBron registered a game-high 21 points but was very inefficient from the field. He shot 33.3% from the field and also had a game-high six turnovers.
