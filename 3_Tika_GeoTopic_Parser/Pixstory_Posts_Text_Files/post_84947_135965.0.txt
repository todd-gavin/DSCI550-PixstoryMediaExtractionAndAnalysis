Liverpool have completed the signing of Arthur Melo on a season-long deal from Juventus. There is not a buy-option included in the agreement, meaning the Brazilian is unlikely to be at Anfield beyond this season. The Reds have not enjoyed a perfect start to the Premier League campaign and it a central midfielder was needed. Arthur is Liverpool’s fourth signing of the summer after the club brought in Darwin Nunez, Fabio Carvalho and Calvin Ramsey earlier in the window.
Harvey Elliot and Fabio Carvalho have arguably been Liverpool’s best midfielders so far this season but Jurgen Klopp cannot rely on the youngsters for the whole season. Rotation will be key and given Jordan Henderson and Fabinho’s poor form, this is a shrewd piece of business from Liverpool. Henderson is currently ruled out with injury alongside this seems to be a key factor in the club making a move for Artur with the likes of Thiago Alacantara, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also on the sidelines.
Arthur arrives with a good pedigree having played for Juventus and Barcelona. The Brazilian has not played a competitive fixture since May therefore it is unlikely he starts in the Merseyside Derby this weekend. The midfielder completed his medical this afternoon after an agreement was reached between Liverpool and Juventus. It seems there was not a world-class midfielder on the market for Liverpool therefore they pursued a move for Arthur.
Liverpool have been linked with Jude Bellingham all summer but it now appears they will look to move for the England international next summer as Dortmund were unwilling to let the midfielder leave, especially after losing Erling Haaland to Manchester City. Klopp stressed the need to bring the ‘right’ player in and it will be interesting to see how Arthur fares for the Reds.
