Finding good TV shows in this age of endless streaming might be difficult, but there is a sense of accomplishment when you find one that is well-made and well-acted. As Paul McClure point out, Australia is known for creating some of the top shows available for streaming both within and outside of the country. 

Therefore, Collider recommended some shows that must be on your watch list!

First is, ‘Frayed’! Simone (award-winning comic Sarah Kendall, who also wrote the programme) is called in to identify her English husband's body after learning that he died with electronics inserted in every orifice. "We would have phoned you sooner," the doctor (Rufus Jones) explains, "but we couldn't get the phone out." That provides you an idea of the dark comedy that is one of Frayed's strengths.

Another one that comes to mind is ‘Please Like Me’. Please Like Me, written by and starring comedian Josh Thomas, isn't your standard Australian comedy. The series is both funny and moving, successfully balancing serious themes — mental illness, sexual assault, and suicide — with Josh's intelligent, ironic humour. It is partly inspired by events in Thomas' life. 

Please Like Me, while being a few years old, remains the gold standard for humour that makes you chuckle while still tugging at your heartstrings.
