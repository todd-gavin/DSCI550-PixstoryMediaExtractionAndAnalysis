The general perception is that cindrella is not a good role model for young girls . She does not do anything about her situation and waits for a prince to rescue her . 
But it is wrong infact cindrella is strong in her own way .

She did not go the ball to meet a prince , she met him by chance . She went there to enjoy herself

Even after being abused she gathered courage , made herself a dress and asked her  stepmother for permission to go the ball . 

After meeting Fairy godmother, she indeed go to the ball .

Most of all she remained kind , compassionate and strong believing in her values despite her surroundings . 

Given her environment ,she indeed was brave . She is a great role model who stands up for herself .
