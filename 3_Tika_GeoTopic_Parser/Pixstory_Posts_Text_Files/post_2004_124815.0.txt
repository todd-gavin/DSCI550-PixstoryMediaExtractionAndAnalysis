A new study by the National Library of Medicine revealed that the coronavirus lockdowns led to large increases in juvenile obesity, especially among Hispanic and African-American children. According to the report, this widespread weight increase among children is the consequence of homeschooling and a lack of physical exercise, which has also led to excessive eating.

Throughout the duration of the coronavirus lockdowns, I and many other Republicans called for an end to the lockdowns due to the detrimental cognitive and physical impacts they had on children and adults.



It was clear from the beginning that isolating individuals in their homes and closing businesses would result in fewer coronavirus infections and fatalities but would have significantly more detrimental cognitive and physical consequences for everyone else. People were less likely to go to the doctor for routine exams and for critical exams they may have been dissuaded from taking the chance of contracting COVID-19. Children were also unable to visit their friends in person, which could have stunted their social development as well.



All of this has resulted in a world in which many of the repercussions of the lockdowns will not be realized for years, after the harm has already been done. These nuggets of information shed light on the reality that these long-term lockdowns were improper and unnecessary, and inflicted considerably more long-term damage merely for a short-term benefit.
