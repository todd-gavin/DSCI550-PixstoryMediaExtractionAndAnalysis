The World Cup in Qatar is fast approaching and all the teams, including Brazil, are gearing up for the big event of 2022.
Brazil coach Tite has reiterated his desire in training to field a very attacking line-up. with Brazil set to have five attackers in the team when they have the ball.
The team's desired formation is a 4-2-3-1 of: Alisson; Eder Militao, Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Alex Telles; Casemiro, Lucas Paqueta; Raphinha, Neymar, Vinicius; Richarlison.
However, when the team has possession of the ball the formation becomes more radicalised in favour of a more attacking style of play. Sevilla's Telles moves into the midfield pivot, with Paqueta given the freedom to drive forward.
Militao's presence on the right is also notable, though the coach already stated that this would be an option when he announced the squad, featuring only one right-back in Danilo.
"He [Militao] has played there for a while, and I went to talk to him and he told me: that's where he stood out," the coach said.
"Versatility is important, and he has it."
