My Artist friend sat across from me in my room She was visiting from Pune and was having a terrible time back as her family was giving her drama She sat moping behind her iPad and that s when I grabbed the closest piece of paper and a pen I could find It took me five minutes to finish this Even she got intrigued over what I was doing but I refused to let her see it Once I was done I showed it to her She saw it and joyfully hugged me The hug lasted a good minute The cat in the doodle was hers She had passed away recently The cat would always play with her pen whenever she would try and do any art Now that drawing sits laminated on her table back in Pune A simple doodle can make anyone s day
