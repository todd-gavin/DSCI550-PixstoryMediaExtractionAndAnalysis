It doens't have to be a place or a house with it's four walls. I read somewhere that it could also simply be two eyes and a heartbeat. I think I'd like to believe in the latter idea. It's not the place, rather the people who lives there that makes it feel like home. It's because you feel at home with that person. That person is in a way your home.  A home where you feel like you're safe, like you can just be yourself, cry your heart out openly with. That's the home which when you think about at any given moment, a warmth spreads out within you just feom the thought of them. That's home to me I think.
