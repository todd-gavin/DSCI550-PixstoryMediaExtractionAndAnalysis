"Democracy remains in danger," said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the panel, during the hearing, timed for prime time to reach as many Americans as possible.

"Jan. 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan. 6, to overthrow the government,” Thompson said. "The violence was no accident.”

The House panel investigating the uprising at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 has blamed Donald Trump, saying the attack was not spontaneous but rather an "attempted coup" and a direct outcome of the rejected president's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.

The committee's final report attempts to account for the most violent attack on the Capitol since 1814, and to ensure that such an incident never happens again. The panel presented an unseen video recording of former Attorney General Bill Barr testifying that he warned Trump that the allegations of a rigged election were "bull——."

“I accepted what he said.”
In another video, Ivanka Trump, the former president's daughter, told the committee that she respected Barr's view that there was no election fraud.

"President Trump summoned a violent mob," said Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the panel's vice chair who took the lead for much of the hearing. "When a president fails to take the steps necessary to preserve our union — or worse, causes a constitutional crisis — we're in a moment of maximum danger for our republic."
