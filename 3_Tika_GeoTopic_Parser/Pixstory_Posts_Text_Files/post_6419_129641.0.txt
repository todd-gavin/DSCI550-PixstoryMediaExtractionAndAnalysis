My personal observations during haj were different though unique. Times when I planned my hajj and wished to witness some admirable initiatives of transformational planning, support, synergy where entire Muslim Ummah can work together for bigger and brighter objectives. I, imagined some distinct set- up where hajjis from diverse backgrounds could conversate over the issues of expansionary vision stating details of futuristic solutions. This way I kept visualising the journey and the grand Hajj event to actually celebrate the essence & spirit of Hajj Baytullah in action. Being a believer of action, I really hoped if I could witness something of this sort. And to my surprise, I already saw Iran working over the same lines.
Their Hajj mission every year continues to hold meetings on their regular platform dedicatedly made for this event and take the opportunity of Haj in building co-operations and collaborations amongst the Muslim Ummah. On this
platform, they invite Muslims from across to discuss their issues & contemplations and this year, I got a noble opportunity to be able to register my presence.
By enacting groups, inculcating progressive & inclusive values, adoption of deliberation models, engagement of major Muslim stakeholders, reporting of issues, adoption of calculated strategies, we can honestly abide by the principles which Prophet s.a.w and his progeny left , to be able to reach the end goals relentlessly. This way we can become the torch bearers of the realistic cause and causations on the event of Holy Hajj Pilgrimage.
It's sad that the state institutions of Saudi Arabia only provide support for the completion of Pilgrimage rituals and do not fuel the machine of such a large cause. I wish I could witness the same in bigger co- operation with their government too. That way things could have been more progressive, deeper and sustainable.
