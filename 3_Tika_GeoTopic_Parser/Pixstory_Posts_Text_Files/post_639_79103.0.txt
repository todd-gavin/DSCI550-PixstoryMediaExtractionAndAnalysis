#CloseTheCareGap
Create a future without cancer.
The time to act is now. 
THis is the theme of world cancer day 2022 , but how close are we to closing this gap.
We know about the disease, which is not even named for the fear of it in some cultures, more than we ever did. That’s why when scientists tell us more than one third of cancer cases can be prevented, we believe them. Another third, they say can be cured with timely detection and proper treatment. 
Getting cancer does no longer means a “death sentence”, every now and than we get to hear great survivors stories . 
While cancer rates are higher in countries like Australia, New Zealand and even US, we also know that 65 percent of the cancer deaths are happening in countries that are low on development and economic indicators. 
We can save millions of lives each year but for that we need to make sure appropriate tools for prevention, early detection and treatment are available to all. 
As a health reporter and than as a health enthusiast, I hear about breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment all the time but I also know that majority of people in a country like India are unable to afford chemotherapy . 
Although cancer treatment is free in India, yet majority of poor patients drop out. India records 80-110 cancer cases per 100,000 people burden however is higher in smaller states. Some record 150-200 cases per 100,000. The facilities are limited to few cities, the patient burden is huge. 
Even if you live in higher income countries the disease burden is more on indigenous, immigrant, refugee and rural communities. 
The message is clear .
Through raising the public and political literacy and understanding around cancer, we reduce fear, increase understanding, dispel myths and misconceptions, and change behaviours and attitudes.

Let’s help close the care gap, join the conversation to make the difference
