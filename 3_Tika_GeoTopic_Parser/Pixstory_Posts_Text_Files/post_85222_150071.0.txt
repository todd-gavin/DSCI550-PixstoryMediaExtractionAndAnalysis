#2 Ian Wright
Wright joined Arsenal in 1991 for a record-breaking fee of 2.5 million pounds. And the player justified every penny he by scoring goals left and right. What better way to start than with a goal on your debut, followed by a hattrick on your league debut? Wright was a lethal striker who went on to be the club's top scorer for six consecutive seasons.
He was at his best and one of the best strikers in Arsenal's run to glory, finishing his Arsenal career with 185 goals in 288 matches.
#1 Thierry Henry
No player in Arsenal history has scored 200 goals, but when the Frenchman joined the club under Arsene Wenger, he changed the club's history. However, in his early days, he was more employed as a winger and scored a lot of goals, which prompted Wenger to use him as a false nine, and Henry thrived in that role.
He was a determined striker who was a part of Arsenal's unbeaten run. They also reached the Champions League final, but were defeated by Barcelona. However, the French striker finished his Arsenal career with a total of 228 goals in 377 games.
