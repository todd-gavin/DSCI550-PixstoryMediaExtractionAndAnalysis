After former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi decided to run for the presidential election in his country, he knew what he had to do catch attention. His full-page newspaper ads claimed that he was responsible for ending the Cold War. It’s a different matter that it ended long before he held a summit between the U.S. and Russia in Rome in 2002. There were other factual accuracies too. (https://www.politico.eu/article/silvio-berlusconi-italy-president-republic-kingmaker/)

“Friend of everyone and enemy of no one,” his ads claimed. Many Italians doubted that claim. The 85-year-old wanted to be the successor to Sergio Mattarella who’s seven-year term ends at the end of this month. After all, he had to get the support of many Italian parliamentarians and regional leaders as the Presidential elections in Italy take place through the secret ballot of the elected representatives.

After being in the limelight for weeks, Berlusconi has decided to drop out. While his party Forza Italy is no longer a great force in Italian politics, but he was banking on unaffiliated parliamentarians to support him. 

Berlusconi gave a reason that not many people believe to be true. In a meeting of right-wing leaders, He claimed that he was dropping out as a “national responsibility.” “Today, Italy needs unity,” he said, noting the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “I will continue to serve my country in other ways.” (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/22/berlusconi-decides-against-running-in-italian-presidential-race) 

The four-term PM became infamous for “Bunga Bunga” sex parties that involved young girls and his maverick ways infuriated many Italians but he still was able to stay in power for many years.

Analysts say that he may fancied his chances, but the realisation that not many were willing to support him and getting a two-thirds majority in the first three rounds of voting, would have been an uphill task. Berlusconi, anti-migrant League leader Matteo Salvini, and nationalist Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni could command around 400 which is far short of the halfway mark of the 1009 electors. The writing was clear on the wall.
