Serena Williams, the 23-time grand slam champion who had ruled the sport ever since winning her first US Open in 1999, said on Tuesday that she planned to retire from the sport after playing once more in the tournament, which begins later this month.

Serena, who long ago transcended her sport as a dominant cultural figure, said in an as-told-to cover story for Vogue that she has “never liked the word retirement,” and preferred the word “evolution” to describe her next steps. “I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.” 

“I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist,” she said. Serena won her first singles match in 430 days on Monday, defeating Spain’s Nuria Párrizas Díaz 6-4, 6-3 at the Canadian Open in Toronto. With her daughter Olympia “wanting to be a big sister”, Serena said that she and her husband, Alexis Ohanian, planned to have another child.
