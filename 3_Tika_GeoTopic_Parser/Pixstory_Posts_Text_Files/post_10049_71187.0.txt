Births and deaths are events of great social and individual importance, marked by religious rites and observances. Some of these practices are orthodox Islam, while others find their source in the rich folk religion of the Afghans.

The arrival of a new baby is the ‘crowning’ of the marriage. In Afghan society, where marriages are usually arranged by the parents, a much wider circle rejoices. The tiny baby represents security for the parents in old age, gives security of position and status to the young mother, and may ensure land holdings within the family circle. It also means a new identity for the bride, who is known as Arus (bride) until her first child is born; after that she is called mAdar-e … (the mother of …).

In Afghanistan, maternal and neonatal mortality rates are among the highest in the world.
