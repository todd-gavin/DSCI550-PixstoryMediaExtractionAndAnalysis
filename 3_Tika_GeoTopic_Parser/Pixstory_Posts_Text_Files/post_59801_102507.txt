The country that was once known as sone ki chidiya is now known for its rapid industrialization as well as poverty While India has made significant progress the bulk of the population still lives on the edge of poverty with only the bare needs From looking for opportunities to starving to death their circumstances and chances of survival are deteriorating There are many government programmes that help the poor but are they beneficial in the long run These solutions can only tackle their immediate difficulties nonetheless the issue of inclusivity and equality persists and appears to be a distant dream As privileged persons we must recognise our position and advocate for them and their human rights Being impoverished isn t only about money It s also a social problem When it comes to hospitals courts and literally everything else poor people are ill prepared
