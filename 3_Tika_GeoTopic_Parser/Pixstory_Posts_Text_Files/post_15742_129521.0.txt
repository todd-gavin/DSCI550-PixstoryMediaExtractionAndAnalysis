The FTX Crypto Cup in Miami is boiling down to a tense two-horse race after Magnus Carlsen and Indian teen Praggnanandhaa both crushed their opponents today.
The two front-runners peek increasingly impossible to catch as they stretched their lead over the pack with 3pt wins that took them to 12/12 excellent scores.
With three rounds to go, Carlsen and Pragg aren’t completely in the clear yet though. The exciting teenager Alireza Firouzja is still in the hunt for the FTX title and sits third on the leaderboard on 8/12.
In a crazy match, Firouzja beat Poland’s World Cup winner Jan-Krzysztof Duda 2.5-1.5. He will need both Carlsen and Pragg to slip up badly to catch them, however.
Pragg again exhibited he’s the real deal at just 17 by smoothly winning against America’s former world blitz and rapid champion Levon Aronian.
Following a draw in game 1, the youngster from Chennai had briefly looked in trouble both on the clock and on the board in a rollercoaster game 2.
But when the queens came off the board it petered out quickly into a draw and after that, it was one-way traffic.
Game 3 was an unmitigated disaster for Aronian. Playing the Grünfeld Defence, an opening he rarely plays, the 39-year-old fell into an early trap.
After just 11 moves the computer suggested Aronian was losing with his queen hopelessly trapped on a5 and by move 14 he was dead lost.
“Wow! What a play by Pragg” said Grandmaster Peter Leko. “Beating Levon like this, or crushing him like this, tricking him like this. Unbelievable, never seen this ever before!”
This is some unbelievable stuff from Pragg, he surely has a bright future
