When it comes to honour the amazing woman that our generation has experienced, the bollywood lovers cannot stop swooning over the sheer brilliance of Deepika Padukone. She is the maestro of our time. While people have started to get a hold of her brilliance quite recently after films like Padmaavat and Bajirao Mastani, Many of us knew we would love her forever right after watching “Cocktail”. 

Her performances are incredibly nuanced and brave, for any young aspiring actor or actress, she is the perfect role model with the way she delivers her dialogues, the way her eyes talk are nothing but magical. She deserves all the love, all the young actresses consider her as their inspiration and so do we. In my opinion, Deepika in “Gehraiyaan” was the sole reason that movie was bearable. Her performance was unbelievable, even from her standards. 

If you are a bollywood rookie and trying to explore the world of bollywood, then Deepika’s filmography is the one for you. She delivered hits after hits after hits… and that too with the utmost grace and brilliance. She is nothing short of a miracle. 

This woman’s day, we honour her and thank her for gracing our lives with her presence.
