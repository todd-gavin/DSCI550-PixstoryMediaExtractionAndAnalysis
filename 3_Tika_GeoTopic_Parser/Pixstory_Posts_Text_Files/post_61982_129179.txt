Marvel Studios What If stands as the MCU s first foray into animation The nine episode first season explored as the show s title would suggest What If moments that took a memorable moment from the studios Infinity Saga and turned it on its head often with chaos ensuing thereafter Speaking to Deadline What If director Bryan Andrews explained how the series was a bit reserved in Season with regards to the storylines it pursued but going forward in the second and third seasons things will be much wackier Obviously more unique stories that slowly get a little bit wilder The first season Kevin wanted to keep it a little bit closer to the vest have a little thing that was different and that little thing made these things different but still tied very much to either a moment in the movies or a particular film itself Now there s more films and things to pull from so we don t have to have just a tiny moment We can expand out and things can get a little bit wackier We take it up a notch in season two and then in season three we just go even wackier What if will give the writers to flex their creative muscles without having to connect it to the main universe The series has been pretty innovative and very popular among the fans the fans not only loved the season but have been relentlessly lobbying for more seasons Looks like they will have their wishes answered
