Data ‘mis-entry’ continues....

Is it lack of alertness (if not carelessness), overburdened and unskilled data entry operators or demotivation that results in wrong entries that create problems for the common man. This opens up avenues for touts/corrupt officers to cash in from those who do not have access to the right people or resources to raise grievances against it?


Most of the governance related problems that is creating this negative image of the country’s governance system, can be rectified if those incharge of feeding in the data for issuing government documents (be it Aadhaar or EPIC or any other) are more careful.

Senior officials and supervisors need to pay urgent and special attention to this aspect to ensure good governance. 

A considerable number of people in this country may not have uniformity of name and other details in their identity cards/relevant government documents mainly due to avoidable data entry errors.

People also need to be cautious while filling up application forms either online or offline.

One of the ways is to have a fully digitized system that pops up a replica of the identity cards/government documents that are being issued by the concerned authority at the time of application itself.

This measure is being followed by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) while accepting applications for issuance of passport online.

One gets to know what major details his or her passport would have post its issuance. It does away with the possibility of data errors that might happen in manual feeding of the data.

UIDAI, Income Tax department and the Election
Commission of India may also consider such facilities for issuance of Aadhaar, PAN and EPIC, respectively.

Such and other changes would change the face of governance. There is a need for the government organizations to learn from each other and improve. Good governance practices being followed by a department need to be followed by others doing similar work.
