Ben Marshall is the Head of Contemporary Music at the Sydney Opera House and the Curator of the annual centrepiece music event Vivid LIVE. He has been involved in the Australian music scene for over 20 years. Marshall, a former solicitor by day and electronic music promoter by night, founded Inertia's touring division Civil Society (now Handsome Tours), bringing some of today's most influential artists to Sydney for the first time. The Sydney Opera House has hosted Nick Cave, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Wu-Tang Clan, Iggy Pop, Lizzo, Courtney Barnett, Kamasi Washington, New Order, Yaeji, and Florence + The Machine under his curatorship, a testament to Ben's ambitious and forward-thinking vision in nurturing contemporary music in Australia.

Since taking over as Vivid LIVE Curator in 2015, Ben has programmed specially commissioned works such as The Cure's Disintegration 30th Anniversary performances (2019), Max Richter's Sleep and Bon Iver's special in-the-round performance Cercle (both 2016), seminal artists such as Solange and Ice Cube (both 2018), Australian premieres from H.E.R. (2018), Anohni (2016), and Mazzy Star (2018), and specially artist-curated evenings such as Briggs His passion for Sydney's electronic music scene has also led him to open the doors of the Opera House to clubs such as Goodgod, Australian label Future Classic, and local communities such as Club Kooky, Astral People, and Mad Racket.
