Arsenal were primed to finish in the top four last season. But a horrible run of results to end the campaign helped Tottenham Hotspur to overtake them as the Gunners had to settle for the 5th spot at the end of a positive season. 

Though the Gunners failed to return to the Champions League, Owner Stan Kroenke has heavily invested in the transfer window. The North London club signed on Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Gabriel Jesus, and 19-year-old Marquinhos in the summer. But it does look like Arsenal have failed to sign a proper CM even though they were linked with multiple candidates since January. 

With Leno, Tavarez, and Lacazette gone, the Gunners seem to have replaced their departed superstars quite well. One of the biggest positives for Arsenal would be the fact that Martin Odegaard has been given the captain's armband. The Gunners have had a lot of controversial figures become the captain in the last few seasons. Hence the Norwegian youngster was a great choice as he is very mature for his age. 

A top-four finish for the Gunners would be important to keep a hold of their young squad. However, winning the Europa League could be the best route to reach the Champions League next season as Mikel Arteta's side would surely enter the competition as one of the favourites this term.
