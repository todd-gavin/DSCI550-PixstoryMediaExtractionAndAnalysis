Good first for Davide Nicola who, on his debut as Salernitana coach, stopped Milan with the result of Interviewed on Sky Sport he analyzed the game like this There are many things I liked We knew we couldn&#39;t be perfect Tonight we faced a great team it was easy to take the responsibility to press high I liked the proposition of the game the continuous overlapping apply a couple of principles We know there is a lot to do but the work does not bother us a pleasure for sure if we do something big we will do it for this audience from outside you could see an incredible overwhelming enthusiasm from within If we don&#39;t have this attitude from everyone it becomes difficult to do something extraordinary If a champion of this level like Ribery manages to put in such a performance but because for that time they had to make a difference He was captivating in terms of quality and personality The very fact that he is here shows that I want to believe in him From this point of view I accepted Salernitana because in my opinion there are successful people who have ideas and values The pleasure of having come to work with this president the pride of being able to work with this director who can teach me a lot And then the desire to do something different with a mentality that is more in line with my own not having to adapt I think the ranking is clear that this team may have only one way to feel alive and capable. That is, playing aggressively with a module that I like and in other circumstances I have not been able to use. Twitter profile photo credits Davide Nicola
