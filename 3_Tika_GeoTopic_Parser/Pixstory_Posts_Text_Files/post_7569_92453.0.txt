What does some shrine give me,
While I have you to bow down,
In front of to show my desires,
Pray for my dreams,
Plead for my requests, 
Beg for a trial,
I don't need to prove anything,
Watch me bury my soul,
Beneath your feet,
Don't blame yourself,
I'm the one who escalated,
My aspirations to this extent,
From where no return is possible,
Before the burial,
I'll carve out my heart,
Burn it with the emotions,
Of my feelings you left,
I'll offer you the urn,
As far as these hands go,
Offer them to your beauty,
They'll write a few melodies,
They'll last a lifetime,
Don't blackmail me with abandonment,
I've lived my life in confinement,
Lonliness is a friend,
That embraces me,
With passion only I can observe,
Go ahead leave my sights,
I'll try to forget you,
Only to remember you at every moment,
That I breathe in these feelings of life,
To sing praises of your existence,
I ramble on with thoughts,
Wasn't feeling myself,
Said things in tears,
That shouldn't have left my lips,
What difference does it make,
What I say or didn't,
Your decisions always take precedent,
You'd have left anyway,
I just want to witness,
How you react to this,
Will you just blow me away,
Like the dust on an old frame?
I'm an idiot to still see a chance,
I left my integrity,
At the altar of your love,
You're the witness 
Of its bloody death,
For nothing but the hope,
Even that died with these tears,
That felt like rain last night,
My love knows no boundaries,
Someday we'll meet again,
And talk about things,
That could've been,
Only if you could see.
