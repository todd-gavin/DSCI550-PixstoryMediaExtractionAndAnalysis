Beauty sleep really exists.
Sleeping is a core way to rejuvenate your body.
It is the only time when your body feels relaxed and free hence benefiting you in every possible manner.
Skin makes new collagen when you sleep, which prevents sagging.
"Only getting 5 hours a night can lead to twice as many fine lines as sleeping 7 would. It also leaves skin drier, which can make lines more visible."
Moreover, your body boosts blood flow to the skin while you snooze, which means you wake to a healthy glow. Skimp on sleep and your complexion can look drab, ashen, or lifeless.
Whereas sleep deprivation causes a decrease in blood flow to the skin surrounding your face causing skin problems.
The right amount od sleep is always a panacea for all your problems.
