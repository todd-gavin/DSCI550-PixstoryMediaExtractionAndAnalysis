It s exciting to watch a new drama but rewatching your fav show is so comforting and full of warmth that you can t escape it I love rewatching some of my absolute fav Kdramas and always recommend others around me to watch them too But Legend of The Blue Sea stands tall at the top of my list It s been four years since I first watched Legend of the Blue Sea but still it never fails to give me warm flutters It s a fantastical rom com Korean drama A romance between a human and a mermaid It s both historical and modern so it s fun to watch Not only that but it s also intense and has different angles that just makes it all the more fun to watch I totally love it s star cast especially Lee Min Ho and Jin Ji Hyun they re so charming I genuinely think you can ever get bored from this one After watching it at least a dozen times I still love it as much as I did when I first watched it You can watch it on Netflix
