Kazakhstan will play Belarus at the Karaore Stadium on Friday, looking to make it three victories
in a row and expand their advantage at the top of Group C3.

Belarus was held to a goalless draw by Azerbaijan on Monday, denying them their first Nations
League victory.Prior to that, they had a three-game winning streak snapped with a 1-0 loss to
Slovakia in the group opener last week.Belarus has now gone winless in six of their previous
seven games in all competitions, losing five and drawing one.

Kazakhstan, meanwhile, kept their perfect start to the season going with a 1-0 win against
Slovakia last time out.They have now gone undefeated in each of their previous five games,
winning four and drawing one . Kazakhstan's most recent defeat was in November 2021, when
they were beaten 8-0 by France in World Cup qualifying.

Despite the fact that Belarus has won the past two encounters with Kazakhstan, we believe the
hosts will lose on Friday when they face a Kazakhstan side that has won both of its Nations
League games without conceding.
