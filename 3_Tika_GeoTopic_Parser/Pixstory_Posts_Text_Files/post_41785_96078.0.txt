The NRL may be on the verge of achieving an American Dream, with a season opening that has the potential to reintroduce rugby league to the United States. 

The Guardian reported that the competition is said to have reignited talks on staging a historic premiership match between Manly and South Sydney in Los Angeles to kick off the 2023 season. Clubs will rely on Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe and Sea Eagles booster Hugh Jackman's Hollywood clout three years after plans for 2019 fell through. 

However, this isn't the first time that Australian sports have attempted to achieve visibility and importance in the rich American market.

It The first time was an exhibition match in Long Beach, California, following the conclusion of the 1987 series. New South Wales defeated Queensland 30-18 at Veterans Memorial Stadium three weeks after retaining the shield. While the result did not count towards the series, it was taken into account when calculating the player's presence and records. 

However, in terms of publicity, it just scraped by, with the crowd figure disputed but claimed to be approximately 12,000 people. To date, it is the only Origin game that has been released in the United States.
