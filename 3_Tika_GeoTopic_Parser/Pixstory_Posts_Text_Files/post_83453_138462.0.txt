I am an Alien
Checking flinging, falling
Alarming the wishful thinking
Unwelcoming and confusing
Winking, blinking, limping
Easy going places My mind on races
With no one to embrace
My feet slipped with no grace
Surprised obviously of the happenings
Running, skipping, jumping, 
failing, quiting overwhelming
Striving mind-blowing, heart bleeding
On dark pages life stories stayed in hiding
Rhyming, timing of emotions not linkng Feeling like an alien in bitterness soul lamenting..ðŸ‘½
