 Nothing happens Nobody comes nobody goes Waiting for Godot Samuel Beckett The youth of today has been called many names lazy privileged entitled brats etc While they may not be all of these things they definitely are one exhausted Exhausted of following the same cycle that their father and grandfather followed get education get a job preferably government marry a girl of your caste and pop out a few kids preferably boys After that it is eat sleep work procreate and repeat Except this time the cycle is not reaping the desired benefits Degrees are useless jobs are scarce and youth is just tired Their dream are hiding behind the k per month salary of their father and education where only the digits of their class changed Their is nothing that can be done and their is no energy to make an effort in any direction When real life becomes absurd one turns fictional world Why would anyone make an effort to do anything with no guaranteed results when they can be the main character whose life is definitely turning around after the first half of the film Everything is fast everything is on the tip of their fingers and it s almost inexhaustible But most importantly the world of Netflix Prime Video and Hotstar is so comforting Labour and hardwork are overtly romanticised The absurdism of existence is bearable through escapism Hence the youth today would rather watch a tv series without food but eating without selecting the perfect thing to watch Impossible Image source The Print
