There have been many returns to football over the years One of the last that of Ibrahimovic who returned to Milan after traveling halfway around the world allowed the Rossoneri to return to being competitive return to the Champions League and win the Scudetto On the other side of Milan the nerazzurri a striker who has scored more than the Belgian Lukaku wants to return in two years quickly enough to almost always be placed among the reserves or even not called up Also excluded from the match against Real Madrid which earned the elimination of the main continental competition As they said Lukaku would like to go back to when he was happy at the San Siro But the operation with the Inter could be very complicated and not because they wouldn&#39;t want him back in Milan but because the costs would be unsustainable for the moment Lukaku had been sold just to make ends meet and his return would cost too much Not so much for the player&#39;s signing who today receives millions euro per season he said he would be willing to halve it but for the cost of the card Chelsea are also changing ownership so any negotiation at the moment would be difficult In any case a friend of Lukaku a lawyer it seems that he will meet Inter to understand how to move forward to bring the Belgian striker back to Milan
