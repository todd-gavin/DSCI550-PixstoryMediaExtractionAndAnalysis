Violence against doctors in india is a very big problem Residents working in rural areas are more vulnerable and prone to it Apart from physical assault verbal abuse is very common Rude remarks are made to the doctors nurses as well as other medical staff on a daily basis The cases against doctors increased significantly during the pandemic to cater to the problem and provide relief Indian government introduced an ordinance called The Epidemic Diseases Amendment Ordinance in after demand made by IMA and other medical orgsnizations As its name suggests the ordinance amended the Epidemic Diseases Act which the health ministry had invoked as the pandemic began The change created a provision to levy those convicted of harassing or assaulting a healthcare worker a fine of Rs to Rs lakh and be imprisoned for three months to five years In case the injury inflicted on the worker was serious the convicted person would have to pay a higher fine and or spend more time in prison Still as the health is a state subject in India many states have their own laws but sadly they are not properly implemented If you have a problem please seek legal measures do not resort to attacking the medical staff
