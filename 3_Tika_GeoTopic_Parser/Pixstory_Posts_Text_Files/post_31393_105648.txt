the discipline of the subordinate employment contract which is aimed at a specific type of contract precisely the subordinate employment contract The characteristic of this matter compared to the disciplines of the other contracts lies in the fact that in the discipline of the subordinate employment relationship the autonomy of the parties is rather limited we are witnessing a compression of individual autonomy We have said that the rules of labor law were born in an era in which the labor market was mostly made up of poorly trained workers who tended to be workers in large industries and therefore had very little bargaining power compared to industry with respect to the company Labor law therefore arises as a protection of the weaker contractor in order to prevent him from accepting working conditions that are worse than those established by the legislator Labor law arises as a protective statute for the weaker contractor the worker precisely because he exists unequal conditions in the labor market between employer and employee All this has produced a certain anomaly of the matter even though it is the discipline of a contract therefore the maximum expression of the autonomy of the parties the same autonomy for is compressed limited therefore we are faced with the discipline of a contract in which the parties do not enjoy the same breadth of contractual autonomy as the other contracts. of the compression of the contractual autonomy of the parties compression which was not known by civil law Except that in the course of the evolution of the subject we have witnessed very particular changes as we will in fact see in recent years the labor law with a view to greater flexibility of the discipline of the the relationship has increasingly extended that initially limited contractual autonomy, thus granting the employer and the employee the possibility of derogating in peius not on everything from the limits set by the legal framework Therefore, in labor law, the initially limited limited autonomy of the parties has widened more and more
