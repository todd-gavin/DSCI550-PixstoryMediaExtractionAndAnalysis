The Forward Policy and ‘Operation ONKAR’continues....
‘Operation ONKAR’ was originally conceived by the Ministry of 
External Affairs (MEA) in Delhi as a means of establishing the Indian 
claim to the McMahon Line and the Indian interpretation of the 
international Ladakh-Tibet and Ladakh-Sinkiang borders. The North￾East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was actually administered by the MEA 
through the officers of the erstwhile Indian Frontier Administrative Service (IFAS) and the units of the Assam Rifles which were deployed in NEFA. 
These ‘Op ONKAR’ deployments were in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Himmatsinghji Committee, which has already 
been mentioned. In NEFA, as part of Op ONKAR, Assam Rifles posts 
were to be established from Khinzemane in the Tawang sector in the 
west, eastwards to the India-Tibet-Burma tri-junction. Theoretically, in 
the north-east (or the eastern sector of the Sino-Indian frontier) the 
Indian Army’s role in Op ONKAR was to assist the Assam Rifles in 
setting up these forward posts. 
In Ladakh, it became operational when 
the Army was inducted into Ladakh in April 1960, with initially just a 
brigade HQ and two battalions of local militia, later joined by a regular 
infantry battalion in April 1961. Orders to HQ Western Command from Army HQ regarding the method of implementation of this policy have 
already been given earlier. 114 Infantry Brigade was then tasked as under:
l 14 J&K Militia to look after the area north of the Galwan River.
l 1/8 G.R. to hold the area between the Galwan river and Chushul.
l 7 J&K Militia to hold the area south of Chushul down to the tri￾junction of the international border with two Indian states, i.e., the 
Tibet-J&K (Ladakh)-Himachal Pradesh tri-junction.
