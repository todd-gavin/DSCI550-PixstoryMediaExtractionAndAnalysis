Common man on G launch in India The country s telecom industry is giving an amazing gift to crore Indians in the form of G said PM Narendra Modi in his inaugural speech at the India Mobile Congress launching G services in India The crore Indian population is known for its diversity but after speaking to some distinct individuals I understood that there is unity in this diversity for receiving this gift and welcoming G networks to the country It appears that the Indian common man is eagerly ready for the revolution and awaits the future however there is a need for more clarity on the functionality of G as people are mostly curious but unaware of how things will unfold with the upcoming G technology Undoubtedly in this age of inflation G rates and the cost of buying new G smartphones would burn a whole in the pockets of indian households but it is interesting to see that people especially belonging to the lower income groups are ready to bear the extra cost for experiencing the g Technology Some people are only appreciating G under the Modi influence some on the other hand understand the severity of the situation that how it has taken years for India to introduce G networks and how far behind is the country lagging if compared to other developing and developed economies All in all Indians are welcoming the new technology to the country with open arms and open minds and hope that the fast internet speed of g will help them be even more effective and efficient
