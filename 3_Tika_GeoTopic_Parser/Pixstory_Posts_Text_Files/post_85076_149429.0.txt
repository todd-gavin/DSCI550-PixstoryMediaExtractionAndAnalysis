Opportunities
Newcastle United have a great opportunity to finish in the top half of the points table which they missed last season. They missed the top half finish in the previous campaign by two points and ended up finishing eleventh. This season, they have a great chance because of the arrivals and the manager. Also, they can look to finish high in other competitions as well. They have already qualified for the third round of the EFL Cup and will look to give tough competition to stronger sides.
Threats
The threats that lie ahead in front of Eddie Howe and his men are their injured players. The team is prone to injuries and few players are even participating in the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The club will hope for these players to return safely ahead of the long season.
