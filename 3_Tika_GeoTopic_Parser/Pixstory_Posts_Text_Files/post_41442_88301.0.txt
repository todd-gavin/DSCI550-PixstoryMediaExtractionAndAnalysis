American ownership in Premier League clubs is frequent, with a number of top-flight clubs being partly or entirely owned by an American investor or corporation. 

Sporting News reported that over the last decade, the Premier League's development, as well as its global viewership and television revenue sources, has made the clubs increasingly accessible to American-based owners. 

Several of these investors saw an opportunity to take over teams with devoted fan bases, well-known brands, and untapped potential by applying lessons learned in American sports to club business.

For instance, Kroenke began investing in Arsenal in 2007 and finally became the club's sole owner in 2018. He's been chastised for his lack of engagement with fans, but the club has invested heavily in players like Nicolas Pepe, Ben White, and Thomas Partey in recent years. 

Moreover, Randy Lerner, an American, was the previous owner of Villa. The NSWE Group, led by Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawiris and American Wesley Edens, seized control of the club in 2018 when they purchased a controlling 55 percent share. Their combined net worth is estimated to be $9.9 billion.
