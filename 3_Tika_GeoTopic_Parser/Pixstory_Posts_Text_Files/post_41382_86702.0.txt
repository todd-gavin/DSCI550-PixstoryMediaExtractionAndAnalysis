Mike Krzyzewski, associate head coach Chris Carrawell, and freshman forward A.J. Griffin all got food poisoning before Duke's ACC Tournament quarterfinal win over Syracuse on Thursday. 

Krzyzewski said he, Carrawell, and Griffin were "throwing up all day" Wednesday after the Blue Devils' 88-79 triumph over the Orange. 

"We weren't sure if A.J. would play," Krzyzewski explained. 

Griffin finished with four points on 1-3 shooting in 22 minutes on Thursday. 

Top-seeded In Friday's 7 p.m. semifinal, Duke, which received a double-bye entering the tournament, will face either No. 3 seed Miami or No. 13 Boston College.

â€œWe're hoping it's not a bug that goes through the team.," Krzyzewski said. "A few of the kids are not up to par. Hopefully by tomorrow we'll be in a lot better shape."
