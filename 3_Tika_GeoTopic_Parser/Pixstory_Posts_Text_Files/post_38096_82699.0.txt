Sergio Aguero had to retire unexpectedly due to a heart condition. But the former Manchester City star could still be travelling to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar!





How will Sergio Aguero go to the World Cup with Argentina? 


As per The Mirror, Sergio Aguero is in talks with the Argentine national team. The former Manchester City striker is reportedly in talks for a role in the national team's coaching staff. 

If not for retirement, The 33-year old would surely have been part of the squad barring an injury. Sergio Aguero was a key part of Argentina's 2014 FIFA World Cup side that reached the finals. But eventually, there was heartbreak as they ended up losing the finals to Germany in extra time. 

Sergio Aguero was also part of the Argentine side that won the Copa America last year. Hence the 33-year old striker has certainly been one of the best modern strikers in the national team's history. 

The Argentine recently talked about the possible coaching role on Radio 10. Sergio Aguero said "I'm going to the World Cup in Qatar. We are going to have a meeting this week." 

To this, Sergio Aguero added "I want to be there. The idea is for me to be incorporated into the coaching staff. I spoke with the manager, Lionel Scaloni, and the AFA president Claudio Tapia about the same."

Having scored 41 goals for Argentina in 101 appearances, Sergio Aguero could certainly help the Argentine strikeforce. Hence it has to be seen if the head coach Lionel Scaloni decides to include him in his coaching staff for the World Cup.
