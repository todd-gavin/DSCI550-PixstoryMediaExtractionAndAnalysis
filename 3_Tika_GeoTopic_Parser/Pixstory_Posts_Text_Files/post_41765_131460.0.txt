On October 16, the undisputed lightweight world champion Devin Haney will rematch with the Australian George Kambosos Jr. at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena. 

Sky Sports reported that t o add the WBA, IBF, WBO, and The Ring titles to the WBC strap he already wore and become the first undisputed champion at the weight since the advent of the four-belt era, Haney defeated Kambosos Jr. in June by unanimous decision. 

The 23-year-old American easily won the first fight in a lopsided fashion, but he said he anticipated Kambosos Jr. to put up a more difficult battle in the rematch.

"I know George is going to come to fight, he's going to give his all, even more than he did the first time," Haney, who boasts a 28-0 record, told a news conference.

"It'll make for me to be able to showcase my skills even more, and it'll be better this time around."
