Waris Dirie is a Somalian model , actress , author and an activist aiming to eradicate the practise of Female Genital Mutilation/Female Circumcision - a nonsensical practise which is still being carried out among various tribes on the grounds of some incoherent reasons.
In 1997 , while being interviewed for a renowned magazine , the interviewer asked Waris to explain about her journey of being a part of the limelight. But Waris chose to explain about  her childhood and a particular incident that had taken place when she was around 5 years . 
Details about Waris' childhood and the various illogical practises being carried out by many naive tribes left the whole crew and audience in complete daze.

Post this interview , around 13 crore girls in Africa were freed from undergoing the practise of genital mutilation/circumcision. 

Waris' journey , starting from  the outskirts of a tribal village in the African - Ethiopian border to becoming one of the finest and  notable actors of Hollywood is indeed breathtaking and beyond inspiring.💫
