Saying Happy Women's Day, gathering a few educated women for symbolic celebrations by ministries and departments, giving gifts and applauding photos to ministers, MPs and officials is a simple, carefree and most challenging celebration. These shows can only take place in two or three big cities and fill the media news outlets for a day or two, but has anyone really dared to speak out against a woman in eastern Afghanistan at one of these Women's Day celebrations: "Anyone who says that a woman is mentally retarded is herself mentally retarded." Remember the various sanctions and pressures from the Council of Ulema (Clergy) of Afghanistan? In addition to the men, even the women present at the ceremony accused him of insulting the hadith of the Prophet of Islam, whose words were later justified, interpreted, and even apologized to by the Kunar Ulema Council in order to preserve his life and reputation. Years later, the Council of Ulema and Kunar are proudly reminded of this embargo and this apology.
