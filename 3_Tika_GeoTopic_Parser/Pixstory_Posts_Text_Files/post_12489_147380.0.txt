Signs you need to slow down and take a break 

Ever felt over Helene bed when there is a lot on your plate? 
Personally I take up so much on mine,  until it gets overwhelming to the point of breakdown. 

But it’s always important to slow down and take a break and here’s sharing some signs that you would get to know if you need to slow down too:

-You have no energy and lack motivation
-You feel overwhelmed and negative
-You are exhausted and your brain shuts down
-You have trouble concentrating
-You feel indifferent about your life
-You aren't enjoying your favourite things
