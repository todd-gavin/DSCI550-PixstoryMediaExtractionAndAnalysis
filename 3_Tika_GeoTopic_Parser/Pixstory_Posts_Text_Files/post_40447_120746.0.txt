Bill Russell, who some regarded as the best NBA player ever due to his 11 NBA championships and five MVP awards, passed away Thursday at the age of 88. William Felton Russell, one of the best defensive players in league history, had 12 All-Star selections and won the 1956 Olympic gold medal. Russell had a startling 28-2 record in 30 elimination games at the college, professional, and Olympic levels. On February 12th, 1934, Russell was born in Monroe, Louisiana. In the 1940s, when his family relocated to Oakland, California, Russell made his basketball debut. He didn't begin attending high school until his final year and received few scholarship offers, thus his abilities were initially undervalued. He only received a scholarship from the nearby University of San Francisco.
