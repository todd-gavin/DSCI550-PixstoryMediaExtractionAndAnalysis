Saeen Parveen Bano, a 35-year-old domestic worker and a mother to four boys, said the policemen who beat her husband, Liyaqat Ali, a scooter mechanic, mocked her when she tried making a video of the attack that she alleged took place at one in the morning on 11 April in their house in Hassan Nagar.


“Ask your wife to record now,”  Parveen recalled the policemen saying, as they continued beating them and dragged him to the police jeep, while saying nothing to the Hindu sword-wielding men standing nearby, in the town of Himmatnagar in the northwestern district of Sabarkantha in Gujarat. 


Explaining that her husband had a problem in his legs that made it difficult for him to stand for more than 10 minutes, and that he needed treatment for his injuries after being beaten that night, Parveen alleged the police told her to pay Rs 5,000 to get him treated in the hospital. 


“The police didn't show me a warrant or any document,” she said, at her home in a housing society built under a government programme of subsidised housing, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme). “They just told me that Liyaqat is accused of bringing men and weapons from outside.”  


The day before on 10 April, Parveen said she saw a Hindu mob of over a dozen men, including their neighbours, part of a celebratory procession for Ram Navami, march into Hassan Nagar, wielding swords and provoking the Muslim residents of the mixed locality by throwing stones and forcing them to chant Jai Shree Ram, triggering a clash between the two groups. 


“I saw people with swords. They tried to pelt stones on my 11-year-old son. When I asked them why they were beating us, they told us to say Jai Shree Ram or they would beat us.  They said they were ordered from above to beat Muslims,” she said. “I saw their faces and can recognise all of them.”
