My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.Writing and talk do not prove me,I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.Now I will do nothing but listen,To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,The heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,The slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)Walt w
