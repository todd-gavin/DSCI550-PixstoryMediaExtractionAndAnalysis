Federica Brignone conquers the Super-G World Cup and a few weeks before the Winter Olympics in Beijing she becomes the first Italian to win three specialty cups. An incredible result also helped by luck given that when it was her turn, she came out of the gate with virtually the cup already among her hands This is because before her the first three athletes, all Austrians Puchner Raidler and Tippler, as well as the other Italian Elena Curtoni had left the track. The blue skier made no mistakes and despite a very technical track she crossed the finish line with a smile on her lips. Federica Brignone said very happy at the end of the match and after greeting Roger Federer present in the parterre What a thrill to meet Roger Federer I&#39;m sorry for Elena She knew that today she had to go all out to recover and ended up out of the game
