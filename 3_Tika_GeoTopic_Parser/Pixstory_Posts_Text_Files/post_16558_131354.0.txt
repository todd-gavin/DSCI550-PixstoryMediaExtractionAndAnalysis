After Lal Singh Chadha and Darlings now viewers have decided to Boycott Tapsi Pannu and Anurag Kashyap's latest Movie Dobara. ❌🎬

In an interview when they both were asked about this Boycott trend that is going on Anurag Kashyap Said, 

"People are boycotting movies because they don't have money to watch the movies, as there is GST applicable on even food items like paneer how can theta afford a movie?" And next to that Tapasi and Anurag both said.
"Please go and boycott our movie,
hame koi farak nahi padta". 🫢🫢

Taking the audience for granted was a big mistake they did, on the first day of Dobara, some shows had been canceled because of low sales, Indians have taken this BOYCOTTING very seriously😭😭😭
