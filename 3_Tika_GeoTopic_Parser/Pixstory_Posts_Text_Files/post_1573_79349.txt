The New York Knicks have expressed interest in trading for De Aaron Fox Fox is averaging points rebounds and assists this season in the Sacramento Kings crowded backcourt The Knicks have shown some interest in De Aaron Fox said Brian Windhorst on his podcast The player that makes the most sense in that swap is Julius Randle Will this happen Most likely no Randall was in all star last year and Fox has not yet made an all star team and is paid about million more a year than Randle In order for this to happen the Kings would need to make a straight swap but most experts feel Fox has more upside especially given that he is years younger than Randle If the Knicks included the recently acquire Cam Reddish the deal would work financially and make a lot more sense for the kings but that is likely too hefty a price for the Knicks Who knows The Knicks have been desperate for a franchise altering point guard for many years and Fox could be the first perfect PG to build around
