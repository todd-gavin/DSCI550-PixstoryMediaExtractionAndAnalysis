Hema died of a brain hemorrhage. We don't know the reasons behind that: Has she gone through such mental distress? Or what are the health reasons that caused a brain hemorrhage? 

Another factor is that we have personal marriages in our lives. Our family isn't able to identify, or doesn't want to acknowledge our gender identity. That's how they force us to get married, and all of a sudden we run from our homes to live our lives. 

That has questioned a lot of systematic gaps on the lines of transgender health, mostly the traditional and cultural Hijra and trans women who transition, might not be in an environment to question gaps in gender-affirming health.

We recently filed a petition to reopen medical colleges for gender-affirming surgeries, which were stopped during COVID. Society feels that transitioning is not an urgent need for trans people to transition and that again reverts back the process of transition, which is extremely problematic.

We go through this pain and nobody understands. So we have to challenge those things in court to get gender-affirming services open. Day and night we fight for the right policies for the health of trans people.
