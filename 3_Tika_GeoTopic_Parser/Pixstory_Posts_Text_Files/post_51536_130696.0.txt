Casemiro: “I had all the illusion of being able to play here, when I left Sao Paulo, it was clear to me that I was to play in the first team. But first I had to play for Castilla.”
Casemiro: “It was a very big illusion because I learned values there, which is the most beautiful thing about this club. The future is this young ones."
Casemiro: “I have won a lot, but I think the biggest title was when I managed to come and train at this club, the best job is the one we do in Valdebebas. I have won with the help of my mother, my brothers, my wife... the club, you president, eternally grateful…”
Casemiro: “Ramón Martínez who went fishing me in Sao Paulo. For my colleagues, without them it would be impossible. A team is played with 25 men, but I have to talk about Modrić and Kroos. I have really enjoyed football with them.”
