The British government sanctioned Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as part of a crackdown on wealthy Russians with assets in the country It means that all of Abramovich s assets in the UK have been frozen and while Chelsea can continue to operate under a special licence the club s sale has been halted While the sanctions are in place the west London club will be unable to make player transfers or sell merchandise Furthermore the club will be unable to sell any more tickets which means that only current season ticket holders will be able to attend games for the foreseeable future Food and drink sales will be permitted at Stamford Bridge on match days Abramovich is one of seven more Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the British government on Thursday in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine Last week Chelsea s owner announced plans to sell the club after nearly years of ownership with the proceeds going to all victims of the war in Ukraine However the sanctions will take effect before the club s sale can take place Boris Johnson s statement on sanctioning Abramovich and six other Russian oligarchs with ties to the United Kingdom There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin s vicious assault on Ukraine Today s sanctions are the latest step in the UK s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people The fact that Chelsea Football Club has been sanctioned effectively puts it in limbo The Treasury has granted a special licence allowing football related activities such as tonight s match against Norwich to take place Abramovich on the other hand is unable to sell of the club The government would have to grant special permission for Chelsea s sale and no money could go to Abramovich directly or indirectly He Abramovich will not receive a penny from the sale of the club the government said It s likely to be a lengthy procedure
