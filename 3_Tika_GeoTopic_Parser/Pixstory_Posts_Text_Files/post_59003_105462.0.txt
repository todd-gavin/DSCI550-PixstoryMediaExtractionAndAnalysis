"We're not expecting a cost overrun currently," says Christoph Schnellmann, Chief Executive Officer of Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), the corporation set up to administer and run Noida Airport. YIAPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Zurich Airport International, which works closely with the governments of Uttar Pradesh and India.

While the upcoming airport has yet to find an anchor airline, Schnellmann says that now that Tata Projects has been awarded the EPC contract and construction is underway, "those conversations (with airlines) will certainly intensify again," and that "one of the things we will be looking at until the end of 2024, of course, is to secure partnerships with airlines to operate out of Noida."

Input prices, commodity prices, and gasoline prices have all risen over the world, including in India. It's something we've been discussing with bidders for the CPC contract for the past few months. We are optimistic that the Tatas will be able to complete the airport infrastructure within the budgets set by our lenders, SBI, and our shareholders. The contract has a set term and a set fee. On this basis, we do not expect the project to face any more cost pressures or cost overruns.

Noida International Airport is Asia's largest airport. Its work has been going forward at a breakneck speed. I personally went to the location to observe the progress. The road between Bulandshahar and Jewar has been closed for the past two and a half months, forcing residents to rely on roads that run through the villages, as this is the only route to get from Jewar to Bulandshahar or vice versa.
