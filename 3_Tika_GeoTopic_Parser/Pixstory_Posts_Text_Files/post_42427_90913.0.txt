Today, the whole world is celebrating World Bipolar day. World Bipolar Day is celebrated on the birth anniversary of famous painter Vincent Van Gogh.

When a person is suffering from bipolar disorder, people around him/her notices symptoms like mood swings ranging from extreme depressive lows to manic highs.

No one knows the actual cause behind bipolar disorder, but what I think is, people, suffer from bipolar disorder because of past incidents that still haunt them and a person is unable to come out of that.

I am not a doctor so I can’t talk about bipolar disorder in-depth but I can talk about a movie character who perfectly showed how a man suffers from the disorder.

I am talking about Ranbir Kapoor’s character  ‘Ved’ which he played in the movie Tamasha. Tamasha is directed by Imtiaz Ali and a movie released back in the year 2015.

The movie is about a character who wants to become a theatre director but because of his father’s pressure, he studied and then did a job that he didn’t like at all.

But, when he went on a vacation to Corsica he met a girl Tara and after meeting her, Ved felt new energy inside him that the storyteller want to give him one chance again to himself but somehow things didn’t work out well for Ved and he returned to his job.

After a few years, Ved and Tara met again in Delhi, Tara is looking for a guy she met in Corsica whose passion was to become a storyteller, and here she met a person who is happy working in a 9-5 job.

From here onwards, we got to see a sudden change in Ved’s character, in one scene he is happy, in another scene he can’t control his anger, sometimes he feels very sad, and sometimes his storyteller desperately wants to come outside and show the world his passion.

After analyzing the movie again, I can tell you that acting of Ranbir Kapoor as a bipolar character is top-notch and you must give it a try and watch this movie once.
