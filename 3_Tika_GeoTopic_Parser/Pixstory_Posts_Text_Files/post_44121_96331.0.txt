Vincent Kompany

From his arrival in 2008 through his departure after winning his fourth league title in 2019, the
Belgian defensive stalwart proved important for City.

He had injury issues, but he is one of the best defenders the league has ever seen. Kompany
returned to Anderlecht, where he began his career as a player-manager before retiring a season
later. He is still the club's head coach.

Joleon Lescott

After joining City from Everton in 2009, the England international centre-back enjoyed a
respectable career with the club, making 107 league appearances in five years. But what
happened next was complete mayhem.

Lescott, a boyhood Aston Villa fan, moved right across the Midlands to Villa Park following one
season at West Bromwich Albion after leaving Manchester United.

His time with Aston Villa was a complete failure. He was relegated with Richards after only one
season, and enraged the entire supporters by tweeting an image of a Ferrari shortly after a 6-0
loss to Liverpool.

Gael Clichy

Gael Clichy made his Manchester City debut in the same match as Sergio Aguero, following his
arrival at the same time as fellow Gunner Samir Nasri, and would go on to become a rotating
option at left-back for City over the next few years.

Clichy spent time with Istanbul Basaksehir before joining Servette in Switzerland, where he was
sometimes defensively suspect.
