Neymar: The Perfect Chaos is finally out! The three part docuseries tracks the Brazilian’s journey… from humble beginnings to becoming a star with carefully crafted image and brand name, from criticism on and off the pitch to experiencing the highs and lows, this documentary Netflix definitely is a must watch for the fans.

One of the thing that can’t go unnoticed is Neymar’s love and affection for Leo Messi and how the Argentine captain helped him settle at Camp Nou and adjust to La Liga.

Two of the biggest challenges for Neymar when he joined FC Barcelona was to become physically & mentally strong. This was needed in order to adjust to the physicality of the league and to show that he deserved to share the locker room with the greatest players on the football pitch.

In the documentary, The Brazilian says:

“During my first season at Barça, I was understood much pressure. I did not recognize myself. I was crying in the locker room and at the time, Messi spoke to me. It changed everything.”

It was under Leo Messi’s wings that Neymar started to flourish. The 29 year old Brazilian has played 123 games for Barcelona, finding the back of the net on 68 occasions. 

The duo (Messi & Neymar) played 161 games together for Blaugrana, winning 120 games in total and scoring 56 goals.

Neymar left the Spanish side in 2017 and we thought it would be the last time we’ll see Messi and him play for the same team again. There were plenty of rumours of Neymar heading back to Camp Nou but he admits he’s happier away from Barcelona.

Well, football can be a surprising sport and things can change in a heartbeat, both on and off the pitch. 2021 saw Messi depart FC Barcelona and head to PSG where is now plays alongside Neymar. They have already featured together in nine games for the Ligue 1 side.

Neymar is an absolute phenomenon. With the right support, his talent and creativity is mesmerising to watch.
