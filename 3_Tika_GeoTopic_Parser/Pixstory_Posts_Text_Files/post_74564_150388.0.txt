At the promotional press conference, Vikram Vedha aka Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan were seen breaking their silence on then being compared to R Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi😱😱😱😱During a recent media event, when Vikram Vedha’s lead actors were asked the comparison, Hrithik Roshan told the section of media, “There is nothing I can do about it. I have done my part. The only thing in my control is to do my best. That’s all. 👍👍There’s a prayer I say every day: ‘give me the courage to change what things I can, serenity to accept what cannot be changed, and the insight to know the difference. Once I know that I am content.”🔥🔥🔥🔥Giving the reference of another remake that he starred in, Hrithik said, “For me, that’s not been my aim. It is not a thought in my head that I need to do with. I have just taken a part and done it like how I would do it.✅ That is what I did when I was doing Agneepath when everybody was worried about the comparisons, but when I like something, I take it and give it my all. Then whatever it is, it is okay.”🔥🔥💯Hrithik Roshan had also opened up about keeping his real and reel life separate. “Kabir in War or Vedha now are handmade characters, that’s not me. It’s my work. It’s so important to demarcate and differentiate me as a person, from the person I am and the persona that I project on-screen. ✅If I don’t separate the two, I will live in chaos. I will always live as a hungry soul, trying to get the applause all the time, trying to portray all of that in my real life.✔️He went on to add that he won’t be able to repeat what Vijay Sethupathi’s character portrayed in the film. “I know how amazingly Vijay Sethupathi did the same part. I can’t in my dreams think that I would achieve that level. Yet, I have done my best and I am happy with what I have done,” said the actor.✅✅✅
