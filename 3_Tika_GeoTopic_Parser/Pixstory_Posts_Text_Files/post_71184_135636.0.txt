The shawl is thought to have originated in the 16th century, under the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar. He is thought to have had several of these shawls and to have had a tremendous fondness for them. In reality, throughout the Mughal era, shawl manufacturers thrived and turned into a significant source of wealth in Kashmir. It's interesting to note that's when the wool's name, "Shahtoosh," was given. 
The royals were the only people who could wear toosh shawls prior to Shah Jahan's reign (1666). Later, as times changed, the shawls were also made available to regular people. The shawls quickly acquired acceptance and developed into a status symbol for the wealthy classes all over the world.

The commerce of the shahtoosh thus got started and shaped the market for a very, very long period. In the past, they were also commonly given as wedding gifts.
