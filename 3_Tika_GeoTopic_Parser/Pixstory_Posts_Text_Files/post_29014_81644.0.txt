The world holds it's collective breath as the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League kicks off with the clash of the Titans. Paris St Germain lock horns with European aristocrats Real Madrid in what promises to be a gladiator match for the ages.

Both these teams will be looking to assert their dominance over the other in a match that will see the crème de la crème of footballers pitting their wits against each other. 

PSG will be hoping to get one over the team that has been a constant thorn in their flesh in their quest for long-awaited European glory that has been eluding them. With the Ligue 1 almost wrapped up, they will be expected to put all their focus on toppling the Spanish Giants to take one step closer to European glory.

Real Madrid will be hoping to establish further dominance over a competition that is synonymous with them. However, it has been a rough few years since winning their last crown. They will be wary of the prowess that their opponents possess and will hope that their stars fulfill the expectations that are put on them.

For PSG, a lot will be expected from French hotshot Kylian Mbappe. With Neymar facing fitness issues and Lionel Messi not hitting the heights of his dominant Barca self, the onus will be on the Frenchman to deliver the goods against a team that he openly has expressed his desire to join. 

For the Los Blancos, they will be hoping that Karim Benzema comes back fit and firing after an injury issue that has seen him be sidelined for a while now. The Frenchman has been the backbone of this side and takes this team to a whole new level. With the reinvigorated Vinicius Jr and a midfield that has found the fountain of youth, this team has all what it takes to be crowned kings of Europe.

So sit back, leave whatever you are doing, and get ready to witness the greatest titans take the field in a match for the ages, with a place in the quarters up for grabs. Let the games begin.
