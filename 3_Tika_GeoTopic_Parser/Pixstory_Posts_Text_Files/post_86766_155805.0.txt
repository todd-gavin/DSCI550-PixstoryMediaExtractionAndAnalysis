Fewer European fans will be traveling to Qatar to attend the coming FIFA World Cup between November 20 and December 18 compared with the previous editions of the tournament, according to The Athletic which talked to football associations of the countries qualified for Qatar 2022.
There are a total of 13 European teams qualified for this year's World Cup: Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland and Wales.
Of the eight associations from these countries that responded to The Athletic's query, seven reported drops in the numbers of fans who have booked tickets for the World Cup.
For example, supporters for France in Qatar will be only one-sixth of their size in Russia in 2018, according to Fabien Bonnel, founder of "Irrésistibles Français" Dutch fans set to attend the 2022 World Cup will only be 60 percent of their regular number, according to the sports website.
The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) said that they have received only 3,000 applications for each game in Qatar. By contrast, the number for each group game in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil was 5,000. The Swiss Football Association had 5,000 applications from fans for all three group games combined. However, it is still "far fewer" than that for the last edition of the World Cup.
