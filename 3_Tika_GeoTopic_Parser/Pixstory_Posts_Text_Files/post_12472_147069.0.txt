This is not Being Kind, It is People Pleasing

What’s the difference between people pleasing and being kind? 
What’s the thin line between too sweet and getting your own feelings hurt? 

* ﻿﻿Repeatedly forgiving people who refuse to change
* ﻿﻿Not expressing your feelings when you are upset
* ﻿﻿Taking on more than you can handle even when you are very tired
* ﻿﻿Not standing up for yourself when people are disrespectful
* ﻿﻿Being passive with your concerns and issues
* ﻿﻿Being a crutch for others when you are burnt out
* ﻿﻿Always apologizing first during conflict because you cannot stand others to be upset with you
* ﻿﻿Being everyone's support system but your own
* ﻿﻿Saying 'yes' to things and regretting it later
