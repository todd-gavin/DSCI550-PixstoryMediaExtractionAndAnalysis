There's no end game for President Trump. That's wishful thinking on your part. The only way President Trump might see an 'endgame' — might is the key word — is if the Republican party dumps him. And that is again, a wishful thinking for many.

There is no chance that the party will betray him. This is because the Republican party is built on loyalty, and Trump has always been loyal to them. He fought tooth-and-nail during the presidential campaign to get elected, and he's always been a big supporter of the Republican party. In fact, he even donated money to some of their campaigns in the past! Since John F. Kennedy, Trump is the first president to give his salary. Herbert Hoover and John F. Kennedy both gave their presidential salary to charitable organisations. He's done a lot for America and especially the party, there is no way they will betray him.

Just because of some problems here and there does not mean he's a bad leader. He is a good one and Republicans believe in him.
