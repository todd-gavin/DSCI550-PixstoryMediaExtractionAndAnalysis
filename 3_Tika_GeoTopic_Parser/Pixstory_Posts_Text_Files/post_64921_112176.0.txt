Another batch of 6,113 pilgrims on Saturday left for the Amarnath cave shrine in a fleet of 228 vehicles from the Yatri Niwas base camp here amid tight security.

An official said the pilgrims, including 25 children and 193 sadhus, left 120 buses and 108 light motor vehicles for the annual pilgrimage from the Pahalgam and Baltal routes.

Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha had on June 29 flagged off the first batch of pilgrims. The pilgrimage remained suspended for two years due to Covi-19.

This year, the 43-day pilgrimage will conclude on August 11.
