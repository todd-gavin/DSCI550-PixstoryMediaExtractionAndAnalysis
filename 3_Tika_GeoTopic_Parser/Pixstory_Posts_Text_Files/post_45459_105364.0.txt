Luxembourg would look to make it two wins out of two when they meet Faroe Islands at the Tórsvøllur Stadium for their UEFA Nations League against Faroe Islands Tuesday in Group 1 of League C.

Faroe Islands will be looking to cement their position in League C, after gaining promotion last time out. However, they were in for a rude awakening with a 4 - 0 defeat away to Turkey. 

Luxembourg are coming into the tie with good form, just losing one in their last 5 matches in the UEFA Nations League.

Luxembourg: Anthony Moris (GK); Marvin Santos, Maxime Chanot, Dirk Carlson, Michael Pinto; Christopher Martins, Borges Sanches, Leandro Barreiro, Vincent Thill; Danel Sinani, Florian Bohnert

Faroe Islands vs Luxembourg: Predictions
Faroe Islands home advantage might not prove fruitful given their poor home form, winning just one out of their last five matches here. Luxembourg will make easy work of a team who rank 30 places below them in the FIFA rankings.
