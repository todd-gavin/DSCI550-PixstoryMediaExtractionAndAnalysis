The caretaker cabinet of the Islamic Emirate has approved a proposal of the Ministry of Interior for a new uniform for the security forces. 

The new uniform would have some slight differences to the uniform of the former security forces, officials said on Thursday. 

“The new uniform has slight changes and was approved by the cabinet. The uniform is essential on duty,” said Bilal Karimi, deputy spokesman for the Islamic Emirate.  

The Interior Ministry said that the distribution of the new uniform would begin soon.    

“The proposal offered by the Interior Ministry to the Prime Minister was approved, and the distribution will begin soon,” said Aqel Ozam, deputy spokesman for the Interior Ministry.  

Some military veterans suggested that the new uniform for the security forces would help increase security in the country.  

“The security forces should have a uniform besides training and integrity so they can have the support of the people,” said Hikmatullah Hikmat, a military expert.  

“The uniform has a vital role in the reduction of crimes,” said Sarwar Niazai, a military veteran.  

The Islamic Emirate earlier faced criticism for the lack of uniforms for its forces, with some citizens complaining that private individuals misuse the authority of the Islamic Emirate to harass citizens.  

The citizens praised the decision of the Islamic Emirate to introduce a standard uniform and urged other military departments to take similar actions.  

“They should wear proper uniforms so that the people can recognize them,” said Mohammad Marouf, a resident of Kabul.
