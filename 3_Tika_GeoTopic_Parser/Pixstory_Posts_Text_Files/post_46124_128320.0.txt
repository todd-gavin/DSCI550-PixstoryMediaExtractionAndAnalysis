📍Santushti Shopping Complex Shop No-10 Opp Samrat Hotel, New Delhi , Delhi 110003 ! 

Some days back i visited Diggin Cafe in CP ! Diggin has been a beloved spot for all Delhiites , especially the student crowd . Be it in chanakyapuri or Anand lok , the pretty aesthetic and the sublime food and drinks always hit the sweet spot whenever we visit , spreading smiles on all our faces with its pretty corners . And , ever since they’ve opened up a new outlet in CP , my happiness has multiplied ! 😍

First things i loved is -  It's neatness and cleanliness is top notch ! The lady at the front desk was welcoming and lovely . I loved the way she initiated the conversation while getting us a good seat . As the evening fell upon me , the lights made the ambience better . Everything felt nice ! Gorgeous cafe with extremely picturesque surroundings ! ✨😍

What i loved the most is - Food ! Food was extremely presentable and palatable ! Sitting there in such a pleasing place , trust me nothing else mattered . I ordered the French fries , chocolate shake and pizza . Pizza was perfectly cooked , perfectly cheesy , hot and crispy ! Loved the shake - the chocolate oreo are perfectly blend together , the thickness , texture and taste of shake was superior rich . 😋😍

Well , finally I would say is just go here if you’re in Delhi with your loved ones for it’s food and its aesthetic and cozy vibe ! I feels like Christmas without Christmas here . The kind of place where i can sit and lose track of time , loved the overall experience here ! 😍✨

Tip : it's usually crowded and wait time is guaranteed so time your visits wisely . ✅

Tell me in notes if you have visited this place 💭❤️
