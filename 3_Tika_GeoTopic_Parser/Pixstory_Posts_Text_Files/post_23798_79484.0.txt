Situated in the Himalayan range of Garhwal (Uttarakhand), Kedarnath temple is one of the most sacred shrines in the world. The holy abode of Shiva is believed to have been built by the Pandavas to atone for their sins during Mahabharata.

The temple was restored by Adi Sankaracharya in the 8th century. It is one of the Chota Char Dhams of Uttarakhand and requires the pilgrims to trek a distance of 14 kms on the hilly terrain.

Standing at a height of 3,583 metres, surrounded by the glaciers and snow-clad peaks, the temple is closed during winters due to severe weather conditions. Even the idol of Lord Shiva is shifted to Ukhimath during the months the temple remains closed.
