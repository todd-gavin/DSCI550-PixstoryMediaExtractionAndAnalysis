Mertens gets closer to Napoli The news comes from Il Mattino which reports how the most prolific player in the club&#39;s history wants to resume the discussion on the renewal of his contract and to do so he is also willing to give up two million euros compared to what was initially requested from De Laurentiis With an email, the player&#39;s lawyers had requested a total of millions of euros, of which two for his salary and the same amount for signing as a bonus. The club&#39;s no had been dry and so Mertens had started looking around. This is probably how Il Mattino reports the player years ago accomplished he has not found an alternative solution that would guarantee him that money and so in the end he would have followed his heart too Apparently, however, his decision to Napoli has not yet been communicated and therefore it is not clear whether the president will pretend nothing with respect to that email from some time ago
