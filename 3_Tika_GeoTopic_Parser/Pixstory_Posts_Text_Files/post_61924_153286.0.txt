Captain America: Civil War was a big deal for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
For one, it finally brought the tensions between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark to a breaking point, which led to Earth's Mightiest Heroes being fractured by the time Thanos arrived. 
But there was another big consequence that went into effect before Captain America and Iron Man fought: the Sokovia Accords.
Introduced by General Thunderbolt Ross, the Sokovia Accords were an attempt to bring accountability to the world's superheroes. 
This measure was created in the hope of minimizing casualties in the field and stopping such large-scale destruction that often occurred around the site of superhero activity.
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law's latest episode brought Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock into the picture. The fan-favorite lawyer ended up going toe-to-toe with Jennifer Walters in the courtroom while defending Luke Jacobson against Eugene Patilio, aka Leap-Frog.
But it's not the case itself that ended up being the biggest part of the whole situation. Instead, it's this little tidbit casually dropped by Murdock: "the Sokovia Accords have been repealed:"
"... The very nature of Mr. Jacobson's line of work, making suits exclusively for superheroes, necessitates anonymity. May I remind you that the Sokovia Accords have been repealed."
There you have it, Captain America aka Steve Rogers was always right about the Accords being a shackle on The Avengers, and the fact that they have been repealed suggests that Cap was right all along!!
