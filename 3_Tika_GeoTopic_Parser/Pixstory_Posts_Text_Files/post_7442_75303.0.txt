A man and a teenage girl are fighting for their lives after a drive-by shooter sprayed their car with bullets in Brooklyn early Sunday, police said..

The victims were in a car stopped at a red light at Linden Blvd. and Drew St. in East New York when a vehicle pulled up and someone inside opened fire about 3:30 a.m., cops said.

The driver, a 35-year-old man, was hit several times, while one of his passengers, a 16-year-old girl, was shot in the back of the head. The wounded driver sped off but only made it a block before crashing into a parked unoccupied car on Dumont Ave.

Medics took the man and girl to Brookdale University Hospital in critical condition.

Another passenger, a 17-year-old girl, was in stable condition at the same hospital after one of the bullets grazed her face, police said.

The gunmanâ€™s vehicle sped off and cops have made no arrests.
