This New Test for Back Pain has helped 10,000+ people avoid Spine Surgery

There is good news for those suffering from severe Back & Neck pain. Medical researchers from Germany have made advances in developing very accurate spine function tests which are now being used extensively by leading spine specialists across the world.

It's called the Digital Spine Analysis (DSA) and it's a spine function test that can accurately identify the weak areas in the back & neck.
 This useful test can help doctors develop a more targeted treatment plan. It is non-invasive and takes just 30 mins. It's like a stress test for the back and is considered the safest and most effective way to diagnose the root cause of pain in the Spine. It has helped us prevent many surgeries”, says Dr. Garima Anandani, Clinical Director, QI Spine Clinic.

How a Digital Spine Analysis (DSA) can help?
The Digital Spine Analysis (DSA) is a gold standard in Spine Function Testing and is being used in the leading Spine institutes across the world.
 It is considered more accurate because it performs a functional analysis of the spine. The mechanical structure of the back is measured on different motion-sensitive devices across parameters like – strength, mobility, and balance, to identify the muscle groups which are causing pain.

In over 85% of back pain cases, the root cause of the problem lies in the soft tissue or muscle that protects the Spine. The bones, disc and nerves in your spine are protected by a load-bearing network of muscles. The soft muscle tissue carries 70% of the weight of your back, only 30% is borne by your bones. When your muscle tissue is unable to support your back, your bones are forced to take the additional load and that’s where the problem begins.
