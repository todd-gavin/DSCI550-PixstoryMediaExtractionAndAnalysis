Brahmastra promotional event happened on September 2 in Hyderabad, where it was confirmed by the makers that this film is being releasing in 5000 plus screens in India and 3000 plus screens in overseas. This is by far the widest release of an Indian film post-pandemic, especially outside India. ✅✅✅✅✅✅✅👍

Well, I haven’t see such a craze like I see for Brahmastra in South Market. In Hyderabad, over 25 theaters have allotted multiple shows to this film and nearly 40 to 45 percent shows are almost sold out in the town and that too in Hindi version with an average ticket price is over 250 rupees in the morning shows. ✅✅🎬🎬

In Telugu 3D version, only one theatre has opened its screens. In Chennai, only 12 theaters have opened 3D Hindi version shows and almost 50 percent shows are housefull with in a day. 🎬😳Though, the average ticket price in Chennai is 93.73 rupees and it goes out till 232.84 rupees. So, this is a best opportunity for the local people and they are cashing in handsomely by booking up the tickets 😱😱✅✅✅

As per the current trend, Brahmastra will take the biggest advance booking of 2022 in Hindi film industry and may cross 35 crores plus collections on day 1 as well.
