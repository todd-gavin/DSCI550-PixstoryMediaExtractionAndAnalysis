Dwayne Johnson maybe the biggest box office star in Hollywood, but to WWE Universe, he will always be The Rock. 

The Rock was a charismatic 3rd generation superstar who had it all. But the one quality that set him apart from the rest was his ability to turn anything into a catch phrase, and own it. 

I mean the guy, who turned "Roody-poo" Into a catchphrase can pretty much do anything. 

The Rock was always entertaining on the mic and he was just someone that you looked forward to seeing. 

He has many iconic promos, and he always insulted his opponents in very unique ways. 

You are all free to think that he wasn't the best promo in the business, but to quote The Rock himself, "IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK"
