Why do able bodied people think they have the right to not only discriminate against but also seek compensation from people for being disabled?
I am absolutely appalled that someone even thought of doing that. They, not only, made this woman stay downstairs in her kitchen so they don't have to look at her. This is horrible! Apparently, the couple who sued her have political support from a group against disabled people and disability legislation.
Not only are disabled people facing discrimination for being out in the public, working jobs or simply buying groceries, they are being discriminated against for simply existing. And in a way like this, by people suing them for hundreds of thousands of bucks.
This is not how we want a society. We can't! We hold a responsibility to make the world safer for the disabled community. This is hideous and appalling. The laws against ableist discrimination need to be stricter with more people willing to support the cause.
As for personal responsibility, we need to start respecting disabled people just as we do with others, we need to start being more compassionate. We must learn and educate ourselves more about how to make the environment and society friendlier for them, and teach our kids young. We need to educate children that it's not okay to automatically form an opinion, criticize or discriminate against someone because of their look or demeanor . No matter how someone looks, acts, or has other traits, we should be a society that sees and respects everyone equally. 
Disabled people deserve just as much chance as anyone else at respectful living.
