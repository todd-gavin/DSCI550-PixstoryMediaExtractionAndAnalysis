"Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you." â€“ 1 Thessalonians 4:1-8

Masturbation is, at its essence, lust. There are many things in this world that we can choose to do, but they may not be useful to our walk or purpose as believers. It's preferable to stay away from those nefarious activities. I want to encourage ladies who are struggling with this sin to consider how they live their lives as children of God. It's not about how close you can get to the line; it's about how far you can go before breaking the law. It's about living a life that celebrates God while being free in God's blessing and favor.

Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, a dwelling place for God's glory and might. Any desecration of it is an act of rebellion against God. Take in and act out the ideas, words, and deeds that bring praise to God. This is a life that pleases God and honors Him.
