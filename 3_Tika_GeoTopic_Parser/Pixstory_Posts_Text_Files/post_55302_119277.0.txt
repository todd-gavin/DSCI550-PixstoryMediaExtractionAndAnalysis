Renante O. Salimbao EarthDay.org My Future My Voice Youth Ambassador, Philippines is proud that the Department of Education (DepEd)- City Schools Division of Dasmariñas recognised the need to #EndPlasticPollution. In 2021, DepEd Dasmariñas City totally banned single-use plastic products in all divisions and school training and activities as one of the continuous improvements of the School Governance and Operations Division- Human Resource Development. This was implemented through the Division Memorandum No. 45, s. 2021 which was originally from the policy Regulating the Use of Plastic Products in Schools and Offices in the Division (Division Order No. 1, s. 2019). The policies prohibit the use of single-use plastic bottles, cups, cutlery, straws, bags, cellophane wrappers, and containers in In-Service training (INSET), School Learning Action Cell (SLAC) and other agency activities that follow the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) resolution no. 25-2017 wherein food and catering services have been prioritised in the Green Public Procurement Roadmap.

Instead of bottled water, potable and clean drinking water in a dispenser shall be used. Teachers and students are required to bring personal water tumblers and cutleries which can also prevent the transmission of viruses especially during the pandemic. With this, DepEd Dasmariñas City came up with creative and trending activities on social media such as #TumblerChallenge where everyone is encouraged to post their selfies with their favourite tumbler and a caption of their oath to never use single-use plastic bottles. They also need to tag their friends whom they want to challenge to post the same promise. The #TumblerDanceChallenge and #TumblerPoseChallenge trend followed. Different public and private institutions participated and were inspired to follow the policy the division has implemented. Several organisations partnered with the division and contributed to more than 8 thousand tumblers for the students. #EcoWin #SayNoToPlasticBags #RefuseTheStraw #Philippines #PlasticFreeJuly #GreatGlobalCleanupHeroes
