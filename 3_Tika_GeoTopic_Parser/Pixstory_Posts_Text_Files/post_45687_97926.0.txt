A solar flare can release enough energy to power the entire earth for 20,000 years in just minutes. These solar flares are triggered by an explosive phenomenon known as magnetic reconnection, and scientists have spent the last half-century attempting to figure out how it works. 

As NASA TV reported, It's more than a scientific curiosity: a greater knowledge of magnetic reconnection could lead to new insights into nuclear fusion and better predictions of solar particle storms that could disrupt Earth-orbiting technologies. 

NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) scientists believe they've cracked the code. The researchers have devised a theory to explain how the most explosive sort of magnetic reconnection, known as fast reconnection, occurs and why it occurs at a predictable rate.

“We finally understand what makes this type of magnetic reconnection so fast,” said lead author on the new study Yi-Hsin Liu, a physics professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and the deputy-lead of MMS’ theory and modeling team. “We now have a theory to explain it fully.”
