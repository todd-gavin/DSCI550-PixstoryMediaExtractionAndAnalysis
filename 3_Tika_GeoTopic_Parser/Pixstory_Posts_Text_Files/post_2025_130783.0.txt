Should the people of yesterday be evaluated by the standards of today? You've heard it before: individuals referring to folks who passed away decades or centuries ago as racist, backward, or another pejorative phrase. But is this just?
 
Consider the beliefs we have today and ponder whether there are any that are judged acceptable by society and to which there is little disagreement. Wouldn't it be simple to see a world in which these actions are viewed so repugnant that anybody who committed them would be considered a monster?

A person may only reject a generally established social norm, or anything else, when there is a valid basis to do so. For instance, no one would have questioned your assertion that there are only two genders decades ago. This is due to the fact that, except from intersex individuals, there are only two biological genders. Today, if you assert unequivocally that there are only two genders, you will encounter considerable opposition from a large number of individuals. And it is conceivable that in ten years, stating unequivocally that there are only two genders would result in even worse societal penalty for those who do so.

Is it therefore accurate to state that a person who had a notion that was practically universally accepted at the time was a bad person? The implication is that a person is only good, or at least not bad, if they independently engaged in extensive study and a gained thorough grasp of the downsides of a subject that they did not consider even remotely contentious. If, in 50 years, mowing your front yard is seen as akin to indulging in hyper-localized deforestation, would you be at fault if, prior to cutting your lawn, you didn't take the initiative to investigate the notion that mowing one’s lawn is actually a detestable action?
