European and Italian researchers have obtained record amounts of energy from nuclear fusion reactions by imitating what happens in the core of stars Eurofusion has in fact achieved a record amount of energy produced by megajoules fusion against the previous record of The result was announced during a conference press held in the United Kingdom at the Ukaea J Assembly Hall in Culham where important scientific results obtained in the European Jet fusion experiment were announced, which also saw Italian research in the front row Just as demand increases globally to effectively address the effects of climate change through the decarbonisation of energy production this success represents a great step forward on the road towards fusion as an efficient and low environmental impact safe source to combat the global energy crisis said Cnr Enea Eurofusion and Consorzio Rfx Yes it is a real breakthrough towards the production of energy for the future that can be abundant and environmentally sustainable nuclear fusion energy in fact emits no greenhouse gases and a small amount of fuel could theoretically supply the energy needs of a house for hundreds of years
