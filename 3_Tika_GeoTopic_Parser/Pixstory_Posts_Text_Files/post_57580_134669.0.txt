The Greenland ice sheet is a vast body of ice covering about 80 per cent of the island of Greenland. It is considered the second largest ice mass after the Antarctic ice sheet.
It lies from 71°N northwards, between the Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. The ice sheet covers almost 80% of Greenland’s landmass, expanding an area of over 1.7 million km2. "The ice from the centre flows through a series of drainage networks with both outlet glaciers and ice streams, all flowing towards the ocean, with some ending in glacial ice tongues."
Ice sheets are present from 56 million to 33.9 million years ago.  
On the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about "−31 °C (−24 °F), occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about −20 °C (−4 °F). On 22 December 1991, a temperature of −69.6 °C (−93.3 °F) was recorded at an automatic weather station near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, making it the lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere." The record went unnoticed for more than 28 years and was finally recognized in 2020.
Knowing about the Greenland ice sheet is important because it plays an integral role in the global climate system and directly impacts the sea levels.
