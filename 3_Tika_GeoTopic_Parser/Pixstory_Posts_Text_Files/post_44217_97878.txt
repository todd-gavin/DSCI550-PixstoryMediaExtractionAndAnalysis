It s been quite the topsy turvy first season at Manchester United for Anthony Elanga The swede made his breakthrough in Manchester United s Champions League first leg game against Atl tico Madrid scoring past Jan Oblak to rescue a point Since then he s consistently featured as part of Ralf Ragnick s plans Elanga assisted the first of Cristiano Ronaldo s three goals against Norwich City last month following it up with an unexpected SIUUU celebration alongside the Portuguese Anthony Elanga talked to MUFC TV about his said celebration revealing that It s something the two predisposed even ahead of the game That was an exciting time the double SIUUU I didn t expect it He said Let s do it I said Fair enough but if you see in the video I didn t really get into the air properly But I managed to do it anyway and it was a special moment He is someone I look up to and speak to and ask for advice and stuff He is a special player to work with Ronaldo now is known widely for his extravagant celebration since his Real Madrid days Since moving on from his old mate Marcelo he s done celebrations with Paulo Dyba at Juventus and young Elanga is next in line You can see his record and the amount of goals he s scored I think it s in the Premier League we spoke about it the day before actually How we were going to work in terms of pressing If you get an opportunity to look up If he gets an opportunity to look up for me as I ll be in the box or he will be in the box Elanga is unlikely to share the same pitch with Ronaldo next season as United s campaign ends in a flop even by their recent standards Nevertheless It s been quite the learning experience for him
