Currently, the fourth edition of the Street Child World Cup 2022 in Doha, Qatar is taking place, with 28 young teams from 24 countries across the continents having come together to give street-connected children a voice for change.
The Street Child World Cup 2022 is an 11-day event that features 15 boys’ teams and 13 girls’ teams, with 10 of the teams represented by refugees and displaced children.
The UN estimates there to be over 100 million children living on the streets worldwide. Many of them lack formal identification and have no legal rights, access to education, or healthcare.
The event aims to empower street children who are passionate about playing sports.
The charity's flagship initiative is the Street Child World Cup, an international football tournament and congress for street-connected children, which kicks off-ahead of each FIFA World Cup.
