 Man was made by patience and the odds against him this quote is perfectly fit for Peter played by Kodi Smit McPhee Last Night I saw The Power Of The Dog and I am thinking about the movie till now The movie is directed by Jane Campion The Power Of The Dog is a story based in Montana The story is about the Burbank brothers played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons They are the ranchman and one day when they stopped for having dinner George Jesse Plemons saw a widow in a restaurant Rose played by Kirsten Dunst and starts liking her and few days later they both get married and Rose also has a very Introvert son Peter Phil Benedict Cumberbatch never accepted this marriage Phil always intimidates Peter and Rose with his daily actions The relationship between Phil Rose Peter is not so good Rose becomes a drunkard and Peter didn t like it By the time movie enters the third act we see that Phil and Peter are enjoying each other company The movie ends on a note where no one expected and character of the Peter does things that no one can think about The movie is divided into five parts and each part helps to take the story forward and make the movie interesting You can t miss the dialogues of the movie because if you did then you will not understand the actions taken by the actors in the latter part of the movie Benedict Cumberbatch s character behaves like a tough man but he is not he got his fear which he can t even express because of society Performance is top notch so was the way of storytelling but the pace of the movie is slow and some people might not like the movie because of this thing only Slow and steady win the race and this movie proved this and will win your heart The power Of The Dog is available on Netflix so you can watch it now
