Pollution is an unwanted waste of human origin that is released into the air, land, and water. 

We do know that pollution is something that affects our life but claiming lives is a huge concern. 

Pollution which has been an unwanted waste since human origin that's released to the air, land and water have been taking lives. 

As per 2017 Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health its found that in 2015 pollution was responsible for around 16% of deaths globally. 

While monitoring the effects of pollution on public health, this helped for formulating new policies that prevents negative health consequences. 

Recently, researchers updated the 2017 Lancet Commission on pollution and health with data from 2019Trusted Source.  

The 2017 Lancet Commission on pollution and health have updated the data from 2019. 

The results of it says as the deaths from the household and water pollution have gone down since 2015, but pollution have been a cause of death for over 9 million in 2019. 

Dana Boyd Barr, Ph.D., professor of Exposure Science and Environmental Health at Emory University, not involved in the report, told Medical News Today, that, “Given the lack of prioritization of a sustainable environment, I am not surprised we have not progressed in reducing pollution-related health [issues] in the last 5 years,”  

“The U.S. has some of the most relaxed environmental policies globally and contributes significantly to global pollution. The approximation of deaths attributable to environmental pollution in this article is likely underestimated because of pollutants that are yet to be recognized,” she added.
