I am Moon
Shines in sky in the night
It's a significant Boom
Having scars on the face
So soon I am Cool
Fluttering wings of love
It is a bird of Zoo
Glow of us repluse each other 
So don't want to be Moon
Getting crazier and crazier
In a exquisite cold Noon
Shivers body of mine 
While kissing my goose
Commingling my body
It's a Brooke
Wants to feel brightness of love
But still it's Goom
Aana✨✨
