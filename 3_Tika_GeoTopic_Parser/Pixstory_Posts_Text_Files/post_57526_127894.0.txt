Women have long been seen as objects and are often exploited in different fields of work. Prostitution is just another form of exploitation. 
Most people refer to it as any other work which pays for your labour. But prostitution lets people treat the other person as a sexual object that can be used for gratification. 
Women are vilified and disrespected even if paid for what they do.

Prostitution proliferates and promotes other violence like sex trafficking, where women are forcibly thrown into this so-called "legitimate business". 
No matter how far we go in accepting or legalizing it, violence against sex workers will never cease. 
Many surveys have shown that money is the utmost priority of these women who put themselves in such a vicious labyrinth of life. But most women working in the business are underaged; moreover, it's not their wish to choose such a profession that inflicts them so much harm.

Besides all this, some cruel realities are often left unsaid.
Women who try to speak against some pimps and clients bear the burden of proving that they were forced.
They are disparaged with the charges and tags that it is what they have chosen to do and their choice has made them fall into such space.

Another thing is that one in ten women are raped and used purposely; sadly, this is never spoken about because of the debate around consent, and their choice evokes.
Furthermore, prostitution is terrible not because it is considered immoral but because it harms women at every level.
