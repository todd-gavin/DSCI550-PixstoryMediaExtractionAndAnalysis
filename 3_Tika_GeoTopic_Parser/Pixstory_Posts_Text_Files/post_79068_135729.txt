Wow What a game We probably should have killed it off in the first half we really could have been three or four ahead by the break Second half was not so good but we reacted well to the Villa goal and got the three points Here s my player ratings from the game Ramsdale Didn t do much wrong Tierney Technically inferior to Zinchenko but defended well Gabriel What a performance Saliba A bit shaky in the second half White Another solid display Lokonga Proved a lot of people wrong Xhaka My MOTM So so good degaard Not at his best but good nonetheless Martinelli Always dangerous lovely goal Jesus So strong so powerful What a player we have Saka Much better performance but should have scored Great assist for the winning goal Subs Tomiyasu Very good when he came on Nothing much to say about Holding or Smith Rowe but Nketiah was superb again off the bench Great start to the season
