Activision has released the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II gameplay launch trailer just a few days ahead of the game’s official release, and from the looks of it the game is going to be rather impressive. The trailer highlights Modern Warfare 2's campaign and provides some details regarding what to expect in terms of the story.
Modern Warfare 2 will drop players into an unprecedented global conflict that features the return of the iconic special ops group Task Force 141. From small-scale, high-stakes infiltration tactical ops to highly classified missions, combating terrorism and drug cartels, players will deploy on high risk military operations alongside friends.
Activision has said Modern Warfare 2’s campaign features a globe-trotting operation spanning missions in Europe, Asia and the Americas. It will include “offshore sieges with underwater combat, all-out explosive assaults from 30,000 feet above enemy strongholds, and high-stakes, low-profile stealth missions in both plain sight and under the cover of darkness”.
According to Activision: “Modern Warfare II features a physically based material system allowing for state-of-the-art photogrammetry, a new hybrid tile-based streaming system, a new PBR (Physical Based Rendering) decal rendering system, world volumetric lighting, 4K HDR, as well as a new GPU geometry pipeline. All of this is in service of a massive cinematic Campaign. “
“The game also features a new advanced AI system. Enemies and friendlies alike across Campaign and Special Ops act tactically using combat and cover manoeuvring techniques that would be second nature to a Tier 1 Operator.”
The Modern Warfare II campaign is playable a week early, starting October 20, for people who pre-order along with some additional perks, while the game is officially launching on October 28th.
