The player
had 1.23 tackles per 90 along with 3.57 aerial wins per 90 in the league. Also, the player
accounted for 4.42 clearances per 90, along with 1.61 blocks per 90.

Unsung Hero:

For the numbers that this player has accumulated to his name, he stands amongst the best
Player of the Season. However, with the player leaving the club, we decided to name him in the
Unsung Hero of the Season for Juventus. It is none other than Paulo Dybala.

The Argentine
international raked up double digits in number of goals this term across all competitions. He
accounted for 15 goals and six assists in his name.

Paulo Dybala in Serie A was phenomenal. He had ten goals to his name and drove the team
from the front in the absence of a clinical striker. (Juventus signed Dusan Vlahovic in the
January transfer window).

What to expect from the next season?

Juventus are one of the premier clubs across Europe and Italy. In the last two seasons, the
team has lost a lot. The Scudetto will be high on the target of the side, which is managed by
Massimiliano Allegri. The team is already in talks with multiple players across the leagues to
strengthen their attack and midfield. Paulo Dybalaâ€™s departure will hurt the team, but there is no
dearth of talent in the Juventus squad.

Few players did not live up the hype this term, but the
Tuscan tactician will expect the team to hit the right form come the next season.
