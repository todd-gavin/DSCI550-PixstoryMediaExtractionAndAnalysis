Iker is a Footballing legend a tough Spaniard who will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the greatest Goal keepers of the sport But today s post was in such bad taste I know Iker meant it as a joke but the reprecussions lf his tweet are way too big Coming out of the closet is a really personal thing for everyone in the LGBT community and Iker made a mockery of it What s worse is that Real Madrid the club on whose board of directors Iker serves unfollowed Iker after the announcement So did Sergio Ramos and a number of other Real Madrid players It is no secret that Real Madrid have always stayed silent and have denied acceptance of LGBT individuals for a long time They don t even recognize them as fans So pulling antics like this is a sure fire way of getting cancelled It s disgusting that a player of this stature would mock Lgbt community but the Worldwide club and the Legends of the sport would unfollow Iker over thisss
