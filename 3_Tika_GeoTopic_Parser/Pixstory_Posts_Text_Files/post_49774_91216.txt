Daleep Singh makes a precise statement to India When asked about India s decision to take up Russia s offer of discounted crude oil he said that the US doesn t want India to accelerate its cooperation with Russia He said What we would not like to see is a rapid acceleration of India s imports from Russia as it relates to energy or any other any other exports that are currently being prohibited by the US or by other aspects of the international sanctions regime He urged all countries to stand together against Russia for global peace and harmony He also focused on China s relationship with Russia and how it could affect India He also pointed out that if there is a security breach by China at the borders Russian Army will not rush to support India India has so far abstained from censuring Russia for the invasion of Ukraine and also stayed away from all Ukraine related votes at UN bodies moves that have been linked to New Delhi s long standing defence and strategic partnership with Moscow This meeting is essential for India to take a stand Credits Hindustan Times
