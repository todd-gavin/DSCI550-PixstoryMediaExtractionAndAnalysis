Youtuber Logan Paul is set to reignite his feud with veteran wrestler The Miz after signing a contract with the WWE.

The social media star joined a tag team with the superstar when he made his ring debut at Wrestlemania 38 in April.

But fans watched on as The Miz turned on Logan - flooring him with his trademark Skull-Crushing Finale finisher - after the pair's victory over father-son duo The Mysterios.

The rivals are expected to face off at Summerslam at the end of the month.

Logan announced the news to his 23.2 million Instagram followers with a picture of him next to WWE bosses Stephanie McMahon and Paul "Triple H" Levesque.

In a video message shot at the company's headquarters, the 27-year-old turns to the camera and says: "The Miz is dead to me, he is my enemy, and I signed this contract so I could beat his ass at Summerslam."

This is a huge marquee signing for the WWE
