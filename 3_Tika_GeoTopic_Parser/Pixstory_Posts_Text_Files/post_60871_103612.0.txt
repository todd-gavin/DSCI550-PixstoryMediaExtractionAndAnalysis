Hey there Pixstory community!

I don't know where to start but let's talk about what I'm passionated about. I love weaving words into stories and other content .

I also love travelling and discovering less travelled destinations. 

I am a social media enthusiast and I also love analyzing plots of movies and tv series. This has much to do with what I'm currently studying ;) I am also good at digital art but I like dabbling in traditional mediums as well.

When people can't find me, they'll find me in my garden tucked in with a book.

I guess that's about it :)
