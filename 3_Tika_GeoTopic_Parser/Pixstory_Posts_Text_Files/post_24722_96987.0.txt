City must be disappointed that they failed to kill the game, looking at the way they played. 

Manchester City went onto a perfect start with a goal in just 2 minutes. Mehrez at right wing cut inside and dribbled to the edge of the box and crossed into the penalty area of Madrid, which was headed in emphatically by Kevin De Bruyne after a perfectly timed run.  This was the fastest goal in Champions league semifinals history. This was De Bruyne’s 15th goal in all matches this season. City doubled their lead with in no time. It was 10 minutes on the clock, when Foden brilliantly controlled the ball and dribbled to the corner flag before giving a back pass to De Bruyne. His long ball into the box was controlled by Gabriel Jesus, but Alaba made a mistake by trying to clear the ball, which gave opportunity for Jesus to turn and aim for the goal, which he put back in the net. The Madrid goal came from nothing. Mendy sent a searching cross into the box, which Benzema turned into the net with his left foot. This was his 40th goal of the season. 

In the 52nd minute, Phil Foden scored from a close header, a supercross after a great overlap run by Fernandinho.

Within 2 minutes, it was 3-2!!!! Magical work by Vinicius Jr at the left wing, who dummies the ball through the legs of Fernandinho and runs into the box from half before finishing with his inside of the foot.

Bernardo Silva fires one(74'), beating Courtois, which was taken as an advantage ball after Kroos fouled Zinchenko just outside the box. 

Drama continued as Madrid got a penalty when Laporte handled the air ball inside the box. Benzema chipped the ball into the net with a cool way, sending Ederson to the opposite direction. 83 minutes and 4-3.

Madrid deserves applause as they hung in this game. They have got a character of sticking in matches like this, when it is felt everything is against them, against PSG, against Chelsea and now playing away at a well-organized City side.
