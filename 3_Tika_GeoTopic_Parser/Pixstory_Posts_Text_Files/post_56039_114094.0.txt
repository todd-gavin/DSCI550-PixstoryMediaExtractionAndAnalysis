Love

BY ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING

We cannot live, except thus mutually

We alternate, aware or unaware,

The reflex act of life: and when we bear

Our virtue onward most impulsively,

Most full of invocation, and to be

Most instantly compelling, certes, there

We live most life, whoever breathes most air

And counts his dying years by sun and sea.

But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth

Throw out her full force on another soul,

The conscience and the concentration both

Make mere life, Love. For Life in perfect whole

And aim consummated, is Love in sooth,

As nature’s magnet-heat rounds pole with pole.


Elizabeth B.Browning’s poem “Love” is a representation of a female lover, one who is trying to imply the intensity of feelings and emotions between two loved ones. The lines to whom they are addressed, in the form of a poem, are to a speaker, though he stays quiet throughout. Thus, it is only the female voice here, with her understanding of love and intimate relation.

She begins with the line “We cannot live, except thus mutually/ We alternate…” which creates the personal acquaintance of the speaker with her male lover. The love felt by either of them acts as a stimulus for the other, she believes. And she continues to pour her thoughts saying that when they bear their virtue onward without a thought and with full of invocation, they live their life in a true sense, indicating that the mutual understanding and employment between the two is what helps her lead her life in its true sense. The speaker uses the personification of “sun and sea” to express the brightness and stillness of the future that she opines to be lying ahead.
