People who got COVID have a higher risk of developing brain disorders such as dementia, psychosis, and brain fog said a study in Lancet. The study says the effects would be seen in people two years after they were infected than people who had other respiratory illnesses

University of Oxford researchers examined medical data on about 1.3 million people diagnosed with COVID from Jan. 20, 2020, and April 13, 2022, and compared it to data from an equal number of people who had other respiratory diseases. Most of the patients were from the United States.

Researchers said it was encouraging that the risk of anxiety and depression was “transient” for COVID patients, with the risk dropping sharply two months after infection.
