6) Continuously Promote Your Book
You need to promote your book constantly if you want it to become a bestseller. This means constantly pushing your content out there in a variety of ways.
You can start by leveraging your social media platforms to get the word out. Post updates regularly, and make sure to use hashtags to increase your reach. You can also offer excerpts of your book on your website or blog, and make use of book review websites to get more attention.
In addition, you should consider doing speaking engagements or workshops related to your book. This will help you reach new audiences who may be interested in buying your book. And finally, never forget to ask people to review your book online and offline. The more reviews you have, the better!
