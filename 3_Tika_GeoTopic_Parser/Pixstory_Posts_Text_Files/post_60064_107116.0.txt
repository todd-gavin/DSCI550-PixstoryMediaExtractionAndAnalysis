In our university, a blood donation camp was held in the institute. Donating blood and overcoming my fear has always been on my goal list. This was an ideal situation for me. I gathered some courage (thanks to my friends who accompanied me) After having food (tip: don't donate on an empty stomach), my buddies and I went to the venue in the evening. We completed the formalities and were shortly in our beds. It stung for the first 1â€“2 minutes, but then it went away.

It was soon over. Refreshments were served to us. Believe me when I say that the emotion that followed filled me with a new sense of joy in my life. There was a feeling of fulfilment.
