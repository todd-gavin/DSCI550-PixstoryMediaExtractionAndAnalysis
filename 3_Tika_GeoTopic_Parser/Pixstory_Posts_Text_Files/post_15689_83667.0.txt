You get the impression that you’ve stepped into a secret garden once you make your way past the subtle entrance at Tenjuan Garden.

 As a sub-temple, it features a rock pond and a lush garden that are both equally stunning in the Spring and Fall, serving as a worthwhile escape from the crowds that flock to the Nanzen-ji temple complex. 

Tenjuan Garden tends to not be overcrowded in the slightest, so the limit of time you’d like to place in losing your gaze in the koi fish or the ripples in the water is largely up to you.

 Either way, this charming garden is likely to leave a big impression whether you’re stopping by for a quick stroll or a longer duration of time.

A sub-temple of the Nanzen-ji Zen Temple is located in Sakyo Ward in Kyoto City. The temple was built by imperial charter from Emperor Kogon in 1339 as the private hermitage of Mukan Fumon, the priest who founded the Nanzen-ji Zen Temple.

 Visitors can enjoy two Japanese gardens—a strolling garden built around a central pond thick with trees, and a landscaped garden composed of white sand and rhomboidal stones. The fall foliage is gorgeous and the view from the main temple nave is truly superb. 

The abbot’s chamber is decorated with a screen painting by the famed Hasegawa Tohaku which is a registered important cultural property; unfortunately, however, it is not displayed to the general public.


But, in short, a must-visit place in your lifetime!
