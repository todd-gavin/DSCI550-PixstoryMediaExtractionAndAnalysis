The wet land we hit within minutes of leaving Tangsey would be a birder s paradise in warmer months There is a village on the far side as we drive eastwards on the barest incline cross corrals of goats yaks grazing The herders seem to be throwing down roots The road winds it s way up in the perfect U shaped valley at a leisurely pace along a marshy stream that seems to lose its purpose direction seems to muddle along going in the opposite direction to the lake left behind We spot a marmot or two the first of the distinctive Bar Headed geese Brahminy ducks for the others I spotted I d need the expertise of a bird book or and a birder At the crest we realize it has been quite a climb because the other side is a loopy way down The village of Chushul has the feel of an outpost dusty worn out The first of the two Chushul War memorials outside the village stand as sentinels guarding the memories of the fierce battles fought here man against man man against nature The road had disappeared many miles back an apology of a track hugs the range on the Indian side You can take off in any direction its so flat it would feel the same mildly bumpy Soon we hit a rocky stream of melting snow looking slightly impassable We go downwards to cross it only to realize that the lack of rocks has made it too boggy to cross There is nary a soul to rescue us in case we get stuck So we go up along the stream finally gingerly rock roll our way across We come across a deserted campsite or so we think till we see this massive dog run in our direction What a beauty He gives chase running along not looking like he reciprocates the love To be continued
