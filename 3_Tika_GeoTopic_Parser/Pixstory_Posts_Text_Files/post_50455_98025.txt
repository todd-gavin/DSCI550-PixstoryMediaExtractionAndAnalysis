Well I have a habit to have coffee atleast once in a day In my hostel I get served only once in breakfast no choice But when I was in home I used to have atleast times a day I am a person who like all kinds of coffee from cold coffee to filter coffee to Macchiato And and and obviously coffee cafe were my favourite spots to crash every weekend Well if you are a coffee lover just like me then going to Starbucks and Costa is your fascination too But being an Indian I prefer South Indian filter coffee more simply because I am just obsessed with its aroma and taste I mean you can really relate with what I am saying if you ever had that coffee originally from South India itself As I believe no forms of coffee can beat the level of South Indian coffee Also filter coffee is traditionally brewed with very simple equipment and thus remains an easy way of brewing strong coffee that lends itself to dilution with milk and sugar So yeah it s easy peasy
