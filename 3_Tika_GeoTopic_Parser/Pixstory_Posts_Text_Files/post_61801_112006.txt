Despite not playing a single game for the New Orleans Pelicans last season Zion Williamson is being rewarded with a five year max extension Williamson collecting the full million is likely based on being named MVP or making All NBA teams as Spotrac lists his non All NBA max at million over five years This is the rd largest contract in the history of the league While in Cleveland Rick Rubio is making his return to Cleveland in a year deal While Rubio is expected to miss the beginning of the season getting the year old for just over million a year with an out in the third season is terrific value for Cleveland His million annual average is well below fellow free agent point guards like Tyus Jones million and Delon Wright million and still leaves the Cavs with part of their mid level exception Cleveland has certainly made a steal for themselves
