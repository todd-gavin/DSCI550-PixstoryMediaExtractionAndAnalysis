Today, I came back home after my short trip to Ahmedabad, Gujarat. My main reason to go to Ahmedabad was for IPL 2022 final match where Gujarat Titans wins the title after beating Rajasthan Royals.

Coming back to the trip, I reached Ahmedabad on Saturday and I had one and a half days to travel to various famous tourist attractions.

So, I first went to Sabarmati Ashram, which is located on the banks of the Sabarmati River. Sabarmati Ashram was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi. Sabarmati Ashram also contains a sizeable collection of manuscripts of Gandhi’s writings during his stay in the Sabarmati Ashram which has been preserved with care and accuracy.

On the same day, I went to The Adalaj Stepwell which is located in the village of Adalaj, close to Gandhinagar City. Adalaj Stepwell is considered a fine example of Indian architecture work. It was built in 1498 in the memory of Rana Veer Singh by his wife, Queen Rudadevi.

On Sunday, I went to two temples which are very famous in Ahmedabad. The name of the Temples is Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Tirthdham and Isckon temple.

Vaishno Devi temple at Ahmedabad is a true replica of the original Vaishno Devi temple of Jammu and Kashmir and to give a real feel of the environment of the sacred temple, it has been set above a mock hill.

On the other hand, ISCKON Temple also known as Hare Krishna Temple, ISCKON temple of Ahmedabad was built as a step to spread the teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to a maximum number of people. The glorious ISCKON temple was built by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1997.

After all of this, I attended IPL final in Narendra Modi Stadium, Motera and watching the final match with more than one lakh people is just amazing and it’s just all about the experience. When one lakh people shout at every wicket or boundaries or sixes, you can’t compare that experience as compared to watching the match on T.V.

It was a short trip but becomes memorable because of the moments I lived.
