Born in a Sikh family Baisakhi is my prominent festival to celebrate Since I am living in a hostel and it is the first time ever I am staying away from my family and so I thought I would be celebrating it alone But my destiny had a different purpose Indeed my college had organized a Gurbani recital on the occasion of Baisakhi for which I was totally unaware of it I celebrated this auspicious day by listening to gurbani with my friends and have kada Prasad Truly it was phenomenal I got a chance to listen to shabad kirtan and to know something more about our Gurus Sikh Guru Usually when I used to celebrate with my family we used to go to Gurudwara this day in the afternoon and in the night and listen shabad kirtan and katha and felt privileged to be part of the sangat Then we used to have langar and chabil which I missed a lot this time as I didn t get a chance to drink it But most importantly I had a chance to connect with guru ki vari which means a lot to me but was not expecting to have this opportunity this time
