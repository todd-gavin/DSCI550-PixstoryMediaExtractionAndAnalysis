Adding in to Marvel Cinematic Universe’s ever expanding inventory of movies and television shows, in a somewhat unexpected turn of events, the upcoming Disney+ Armor Wars show based on the Marvel character of War Machine is now reworked into a movie as confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter. This move came just a few weeks just after Marvel Studios already teased some of their work at the D23 Expo.
The project is based on Marvel Comics’ seven-issue arc of the same name within the story of Iron Man, and follows Tony Stark’s best friend James Rhodes as he must face what happens when his deceased friend’s Iron Man tech falls into the wrong hands.
The movie was previously billed as a six episode Disney+ series, and while turning this into a movie will delay the project, Don Cheadle is still attached to it and will be reprising his role as War Machine for the movie.
In Marvel Comics, the Armor Wars storyline focused on the legacy of Tony Stark, whose wondrous armour technology led to multiple villains getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction.
 However, since the MCU Tony Stark died in Avengers: Endgame, various changes will be made to accommodate the storyline, though to what extent changes will be made to fit the new format is currently unknown.
Cheadle’s next appearance in the MCU will come much sooner than Armor Wars though with the character set to appear in the thriller series Secret Invasion. 
The series will follow Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) as he is going after a group of shapeshifting alien called Skrulls who have infiltrated the most influential organizations on Earth.
Furthermore, as Secret Invasion is expected to be directly connected to Armor Wars, a potential Civil War like scenario may also develop in the future, though as of now Disney and Marvel Studios have not provided many details on the subject.
