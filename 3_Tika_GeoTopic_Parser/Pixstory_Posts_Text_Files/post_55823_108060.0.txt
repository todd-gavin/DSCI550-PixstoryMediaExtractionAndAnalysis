Stead was born in Sydney in 1902 and lived in London, Paris, Spain, and New York before returning to Australia in her early twenties. Her books are as diverse as the cities she called home. For Love Alone was the first Stead many people read after graduating from high school, and the story of a young girl growing up and fleeing Sydney is still widely favourite. 

Christina Stead is most known for The Man Who Loved Children, a story about a father who terrorises his family in a similar way to Stead's own father. But the book can be a little depressing, especially the fact that her publishers convinced her that Americans were uninterested in Australia and that she should, at the last minute, switch the scene from Sydney to New York City.
