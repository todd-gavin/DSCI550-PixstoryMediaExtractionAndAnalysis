I m an Adult now yes I m But I still have a couple of soft toys around me my companions It s like sometimes these toys non living beings provide us with so much comfort and emotional support We feel much better just at the sight of them I m not embarrassed by the fact that I still seek comfort in my soft toys instead I feel even more happy to have something I can just look at and pass on a smile Do you also still seek comfort in a toy around you
