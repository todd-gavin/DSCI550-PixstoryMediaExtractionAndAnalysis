The connective tissue here is Fraser the DP behind both the first season of The Mandalorian and the highly anticipated reboot The Batman He helped develop the virtual production technology and ensure it worked in a cinematic way and when I spoke to Fraser earlier this year during an extended interview about his career he predicted almost every film in the future would be using this technology I see a world where almost every film will use this technology in some way shape or form Be it from a million blockbuster down to a million independent movie using it for one sequence that they dry hire a studio that s already been built and they get in there like a location So I believe when the technology kicks on and gets widely adopted when people understand what it can do I believe it Il be used quite a lot Source Collider
