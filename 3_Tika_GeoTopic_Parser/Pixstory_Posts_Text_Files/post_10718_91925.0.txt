Delight for South Africa, Zimbabwe endure a stormy match against Netherlands and USA win crucial Pan-Am clash.

Potchefstroom, South Africa: It was a mix of relief and delight for the host nation as South Africa defeated Ireland in a nervy Pool B clash that would decide who progressed to the quarter-finals.

If that match was edgy and goals hard to come by, the second match saw Netherlands go on a goal spree against Zimbabwe. Two weather interruptions couldn’t prevent the Netherlands showing their class when in attack. The 18 goals scored by the Dutch is a new record for a team at the Junior Hockey World Cup and beats the record the Netherlands themselves had set back in 1989 - also against Zimbabwe.

The third match of the day was a north American clash between Canada and USA. The USA had never beaten Canada in a Women’s Junior World Cup match sop there was a heightened sense  of frisson as the teams took to the field. This was a day for history making though and USA’s 4-0 win was achieved on the back of some sparkling performances by the energetic USA team.

The delight on the faces of the South Africa team as the final whistle blew told the whole story. Although not the most convincing of victories, the host nation had sealed a spot in the quarter-finals.
