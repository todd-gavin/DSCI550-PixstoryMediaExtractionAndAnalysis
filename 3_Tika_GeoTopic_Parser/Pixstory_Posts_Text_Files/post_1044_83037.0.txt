Russian president Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will decide whether to recognise the two breakaway regions, the so called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, news agency Reuters reported. Remember, the Russia-backed separatist forces have been engaged in a ferocious battle with the Ukrainian government forces in these two regions since 2014, in which more than 15,000 people have been killed. Even though Putin has denied any intentions of invading Ukraine, news agency AFP quoted the Russian president saying there was no peace plan to end the Ukrainian conflict.


Putin also accused the West of threats and blackmail during the previously unscheduled convening of the Russian security council that, in unusually theatrical setting, was shown on television.
