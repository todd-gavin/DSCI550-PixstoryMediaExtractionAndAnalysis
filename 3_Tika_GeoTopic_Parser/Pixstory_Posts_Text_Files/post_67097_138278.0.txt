 Priyan Ottathilanu Review: A Joyful, Mildmannered Film Led By Sharaf-U-Dheen
A housing crisis squeezes itself through the narrative pores in Priyan Ottathilaanu, directed by Antony Sony. The sludge and the drain water from an apartment complex in Kochi clog the canal that edges a slum, leading to a clash between the two parties. The louder, less refined slum-dwellers led by a dense young man (Sudhi Koppa) against easily scared and law-abiding flat residents under the leadership of the protagonist, Priyadarshan/Priyan (sharfudeen), the secretary of the apartment community.
I wouldn’t say the character of Priyan is an impractical one. We all know people who have a hard time saying no to people. The script written by Abhayakumar and Anil Kurien manages to establish the character of Priyan very effectively in the beginning portions of the movie. But after a point, they want to suffocate him with issues for the second half to work. Those additional problems and complications don’t feel organic. The way he “helps” everyone by compromising his schedule is too much goodness. And just when I thought whether it was a script that Jayasurya rejected, the film went for a climax that made it look like a Ranjith Sankar movie.
Sharaf U Dheen as Priyadarshan was terrific, in my opinion. He knew how to underplay the character who was unreally optimistic. Nyla Usha was in her typical angry mode of acting. Aparna Das as Neena was fine, and there was a massive improvement when compared to her performance in Manoharam. The character played by Biju Sopanam was somewhat a burden to the script. Jaffar Idukki, Sminu Sijo, Harisree Ashokan, Sudhy Koppa, RJ Mike, Hakkim Shajahan, Anarkali Marakkar and a few more names are there in the elaborate star cast.
