1-BRAHMASTRA üî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

Alia Bhatt believes that Ayan Mukerji's Brahmastra is unique and up to global standards. The first instalment of the three-part fantasy drama series, which stars Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Amitabh Bachchan, will be released around Christmas this year. Alia expressed her strong belief in Ayan's vision. "Ranbir and I have always maintained that Brahmastra is not a superhero film; it is a mystical fantasy drama," she explained. There is no comparable reference. It's a new film coming out of our industry. It could be a film that makes our industry proud and elevates us to a global stage. I don't want to brag, but I have a lot of faith in Ayan's vision."

Alia's most recent film, Gangubai Kathiawadi, has received positive reviews from both critics and audiences.
