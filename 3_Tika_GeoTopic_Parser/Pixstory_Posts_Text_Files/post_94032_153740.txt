 One day the girl was walking through the Park and there she saw the loving birds enjoying their moments this sight in front of her made her cry because till now she was waiting for her prince but it didn t happened yet That girl went from there directly to her favourite bridge Whenever she used to get sad or cry and even whenever she is happy she used to come here because this is the only place where she can share everything she want to She sat down near the railing looking at the beach and cold wind is touching her skin her hairs are flying in the air A drop of tear left her eyes she was crying silently And then Suddenly someone tap her shoulder she turned back and looked up to see a handsome and pretty boy giving his hand to her she took his hand looking into his eyes The boy helped her to stand and wiped her tears with his thumbs and gave a warming smile to her this sight made her to smile a bit Then the boy gave a chocolate to that girl she warmly accepted still smiling Then the boy went from there She is still looking at the boy s disappearing figure Then she also went from there Since that day She is very happy because she is thinking that the boy who gave her a chocolate is the one and only her prince And now she is waiting for the day when her prince take her for forever She is impatiently waiting for that moment when they will meet again
