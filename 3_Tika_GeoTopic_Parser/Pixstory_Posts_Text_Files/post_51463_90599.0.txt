Getting into the Guinness Book of World Records has now become an aspirational goal for many Indians. People from all over the country come to me with requests for training, so that they can better their chances of entering into the record book.

My own entry into Guinness happened entirely by chance. It was a casual remark by my martial arts guru, under whom I was practising karate in 2008, that triggered interest in training for the Guinness. He said my punches are so fast that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. This sparked my curiosity and I decided to find out if there was anyone holding a record in this category. A few minutes into Googling I found that the record was held by Muhammad Rashid from Pakistan. He was the founder of Pakistan Martial Arts Academy. His record was 377 punches with one free hand in one minute. I broke the record in 2017, with a total of 393, single hand, full contact punches.

The achievement was particularly heartening for me because it brought in a lot of positive media attention to my home town, Kalahandi, which had always been in the news for its backwardness and poverty.

The record generated a lot of interest among people in Odisha to get into the Guinness. I began to receive random requests from people on social media asking me to train them to break some Guinness world record or the other. I donâ€™t charge any money for training. The only thing which I insist on is showing full dedication.
