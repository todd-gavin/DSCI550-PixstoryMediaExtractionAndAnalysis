Abstract 

Diabetes technology is an integral part of the lives of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, children's experiences with these technologies are often overlooked. Furthermore, little is known about psychosocial aspects of technology use during children's transition to adolescence. The aim of this study was to explore how children with T1D perceive, make sense of and handle diabetes technologies in their everyday lives. Data were obtained from interviews with 18 children with T1D aged 10–14 years (pre-teens). The interviews were conducted between March and August 2019 in Denmark. Photos were used as probes to facilitate discussion and reflection about issues pre-teens found important. The study was informed by a technology-in-practice perspective to articulate how diabetes technologies were embedded in practices of use. The analysis focused on insulin pumps and technologies for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). We found that these technologies introduced tensions regarding dependence and independence, wanted and unwanted attention, worries and peace of mind, treatment and care, visibility and invisibility as well as control and loss of control. We synthesized the tensions into the following three themes which characterized the pre-teens’ relationship with diabetes technology: 1) demanding devices, 2) the social context of using diabetes technologies, and 3) care and support through data. Our findings indicate the need for researchers and clinicians to engage with the social and emotional dimensions of living with diabetes technologies. Importantly, this includes recognizing the norms underlying diabetes technologies and how these inform care in pre-teens with T1D.
