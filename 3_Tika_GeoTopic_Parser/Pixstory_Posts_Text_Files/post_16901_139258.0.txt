Bajrang Dal activists on Tuesday night stopped Bollywood actor-couple Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt from entering the famous Mahakal temple in Madhya Pradeshâ€™s Ujjain for their alleged remarks over beef-eating and watching Brahmastra movie.

Confirming the incident, a Mahakal police station official said they resorted to cane-charge to disperse the protesters.
The â€˜Beef Guyâ€™ Ranbir Kapoor, his arrogant wife Alia Bhatt & the confused â€˜Brahmastraâ€™ director, Ayan Mukherjee were booted out of Ujjainâ€™s Mahakal temple by the protesting hindus there. The trio escaped b4 completing their temple run.ðŸ‘‡
