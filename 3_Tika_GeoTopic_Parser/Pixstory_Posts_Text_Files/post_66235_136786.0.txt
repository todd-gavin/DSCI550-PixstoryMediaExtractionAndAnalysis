I never thought that I'll watch a Fast and Furious movie without Paul Walker, and to be honest when this movie released I thought that how this movie will work without him BUT IT DID. Dominic Torreto the main hero of the Franchise better to call an Universe now became villain in the film. And the motivation was too clear because it is obvious that a father would do anything to make his child safe and secure. When Elena died we felt sad for her but not that much of sad as Tony Stark, Black Widow, Avengers in Infinity War, Batman in T.D.K.R, Superman in BVS:-D.T.J (Director's cut), T-800, Letty and Paul Walker because we didn't connected to her character that much as we did to the characters mentioned above. This franchise didn't developed her character as they did to Gezelle, Han or Brian in the same franchise. That's why her dead was sorrowful but not painful. Dom never wanted to betray his family but he had too and to be honest when I saw him betraying Luke Hobbs in Berlin I was shocked. The action scenes are top notch mainly the last fighting scene and the way Deckard Shaw saved Dom's son in that plane while fighting with the army of Charliz Therone was next level entertaining and and comedic and by the name of Deckard Shaw I remembered one thing that this universe well established the character of Deckard Shaw. No I mean many people became fan of Jason Snatham for his role of Deckard Shaw in this film. The main antagonist of Furious 7 became one of the main protagonist of the universe. And the friendship between Shaw and Hobbs was so liked by audience that they made a separate movie on them and I don'thave to say that how best that movie was. And they also did great character development of Charlize Therone, from my point of view she is the strongest villain of the franchise or the universe.
