The Shrine of Remembrance is the national war memorial of Victoria. It opened in 1934 to commemorate First World War veterans, and now honours all Australians who have served their country.

Enter the Shrine’s classical interior and discover the peaceful atmosphere of the Sanctuary, where Ray of Light demonstrations occur every half hour.

 The Galleries of Remembrance feature over 800 artworks and historical artefacts, including an original Gallipoli landing boat. There's also personal effects that illustrate the experiences of Australians in war and peacekeeping operations, from the 1850s to today. The Shrine’s Balcony offers breath-taking vistas of Melbourne.

Take the family on a Shrine scavenger hunt with free Shrine Kids activity cards, available every day from the Visitor Centre. See the Last Post Service every Sunday at 4.45 pm, complete with buglers, bagpipers and Shrine Guard in historic uniform.

You can visit the shrine throughout the week and get a guided tour to learn about its history & about the sacrifices of our brave men and women.
