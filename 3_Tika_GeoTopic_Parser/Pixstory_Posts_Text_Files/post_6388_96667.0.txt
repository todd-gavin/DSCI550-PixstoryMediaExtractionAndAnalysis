30 days ago I underwent a major step into my transition, gender journey. I had a total of 8 procedures on my face to affirm my gender from MTF. These surgeries are life changing and can ensure my safety out in public. It is reported that there is a 100% improvement on the lives of those who undergo these procedures. Iâ€™m blessed to have my insurance cover part of my surgeries but many out there who are from my community do not get these same opportunities. Besides not being able to afford these surgeries, society still continues to stigmatize or discriminate against the majority of trans women. So it makes it hard to find jobs that aid in paying for these services. Beside the services there is the one month recovery period where you are out of work and tech wring from 8-10 hours of surgery. The moment has its ups and downs but the moment is a celebration and a milestone for many of us.
