When Rayo Vallecano got the better of Barcelona at Camp Nou last week, the cameras were focused on one man: Stole Dimitrievski. The North Macedonian international stole the show by denying the Catalans repeatedly, eventually leading to his side for three points. 

On Monday, he made four saves including two from inside the box. He recorded three punches two high claims and five clearances. He was also declared the man of the match at Camp Nou. 

It was not the first time, the show-stopper raised his performance against Barcelona. When the two teams met earlier this season, he had saved Memphis Depay’s second-half penalty to give his side a win. 

In an interview with Mozzart sport, Dimitrievski revealed that he was too close to signing with Barcelona. 
“In January I agreed to personal terms with Barcelona. Everything was agreed upon. All that was remaining was to sign the contracts, but everything collapsed because of Neto. He did not want to leave Barcelona. 

The 28-year-old had been a vital part of the Vallecano squad this season, keeping eight clean sheets in 26 starts. He has saved two penalties and averages a whopping three saves every ninety minutes. 

It is quite surprising that Neto turned down the chance to leave Barcelona, given that he had a very minimal role under the current manager Xavi Hernandez. 

The Brazilian started only two league games for the team when Ter Stegen was out with injury. In those 180 minutes, he let the ball pass him, three times.


Barcelona could make changes with their goalkeepers in the summer but it is still unclear if they will return for Stole Dimitrievski. Neto is still expected to leave, while Pena would return after his loan contract gets over with Galatasaray and would replace the Brazilian in the first team squad
