Did you ever wish rocking out to your favourite songs could earn you money? Content creators can now earn money from videos that use Facebook's library of authorised music! 

On Monday, Meta debuted a new feature that enables producers to make money from Facebook videos that include music from well-known musicians like Post Malone and Tove Lo. Meta reassured the music business that it takes copyright infringement seriously by rewarding creators who adhere to the law when using music on its platforms.

Creators can earn revenue on videos with adverts and have access to a library of music that has been licenced by Meta. The remainder will be split between Meta and the owners of the music rights and those creators, who will each receive 20% of the ad revenue. The new approach does, however, have certain guidelines: videos that qualify must be at least one minute long, and they must be primarily intended to showcase music. Reels are not included, either.

Meta's new tools could potentially draw users 
away from copyright infringement. Along with the rewards come concequences as well. Videos that use unlicensed music can be blocked or muted, and repeat offender can have their accounts blocked.
