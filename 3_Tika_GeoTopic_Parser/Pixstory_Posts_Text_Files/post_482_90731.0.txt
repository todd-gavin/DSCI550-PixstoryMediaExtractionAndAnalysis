All media organisations in India are reporting this .

A Delhi court on Monday granted bail to the 'Bulli Bai' app case accused Niraj Bishnoi and 'Sulli Deals' app creator Omkareshwar Thakur on humanitarian grounds.
The court considered that the accused are first time offenders and continued incarceration would be detrimental to their overall wellbeing.

The court had imposed strict conditions on the accused persons so that they could not threaten any witness and temper any evidence.

Your honours . How can I have a problem, ofcourse they are first time offenders and of sound mental health so far, because what have these young men done, only attempted to auction young women on their apps. Published their pictures, given out their contact details and acted against an entire community. 
My only question is how many underaged children are in jails in Kashmir because they have thrown a stone, how many are denied passports because their kin are/ have been supposedly of separatist ideology. 
Rest I have no problems, we should even sponsor their mental health sessions . These gentlemen sure need a chance . Can someone finance their future ventures.
