The Impact Partners Can Have on Breastfeeding Outcomes Breastfeeding is hard it comes with challenges roadblocks and a learning curve If the non nursing partner is educated on breastfeeding they can step in and support when these issues come up of moms start out breastfeeding but only make it to the CDC recommendation of months But when partners are targeted with education about breastfeeding moms are more likely to breastfeed even beyond the six month goal An informed partner might notice When a nursing mom is struggling provide guidance on latching encourage her to get help from a lactation consultant or remind her of different nursing positions she might try Partners can help moms mitigate stress as they and their babies learn how to breastfeed This empowers both partners to work as a team in breastfeeding and in other aspects of parenting as well changing diapers doing bathtime and putting babies to bed When a partner is involved it isn t just to give a break to the mom it s also to forge their own bonds with the baby Babies benefit when both partners take accountability and ownership in their parenting roles
