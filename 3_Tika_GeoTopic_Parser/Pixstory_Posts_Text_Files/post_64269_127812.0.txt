Visiting my “ homeland “ after almost 11 months brought with it great excitement, nervousness and hopes. 

Would everything be the same? I asked myself.
Will I be fine if everything STILL felt the same? I pondered. 

Each passing day brought new experiences whether it was a good lunch made at home or a fun night out with friends in the city. Or whether it was trying that specific potatoes from the market whose taste isn’t the same anywhere else in the world. Happiness truly lies in the smallest of things. And I’m glad to have this, everyday.
