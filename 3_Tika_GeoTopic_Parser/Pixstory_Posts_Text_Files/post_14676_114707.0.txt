Actor Brad Pitt recently shared that he lives with a rare condition, he believes he has prosopagnosia also known as face blindness. 

Pitt says that he struggles to remember new people or recognize their faces. Never diagnosed officially before, mainly people believes that he's remote, aloof, inaccessible and self absorbed. 

Pitt told to the interviewer that, “Nobody believes me,” and it’s not difficult to understand why. 

It may sound unusual, prosopagnosia is a real condition which gives unique challenges to those living with the condition. 

Here is what to know more about the condition 

Prosopagnosia is a condition where one struggles to recognize faces or understand and interpret facial expressions and cues. It happens because of brain damage, but some people have it from birth. The treatment measure for this condition focuses on the underlying causes or helping one to adapt so that one can recognize people in different ways. 

Prosopagnosia comes under a family of conditions, agnosias, which disrupts and interferes with how one's brain processes information from their senses. This condition occurs because of damage to one's brain from any number of causes. Prosopagnosia can also happen without the damage as well. 

Symptoms of the condition 

There are two forms of prosopagnosia and the symptoms of the condition depends on which form the individual has. 

• Apperceptive prosopagnosia. This form is characterized when one can't recognize a person's facial expressions or non verbal cues. 

• Associative prosopagnosia. This form happens when one is not being able to recognize a person's face even if one is familiar with them. One can understand them through different means like by their sound or by how they walk.
