Arsenal vs Tottenham - Key Areas

Just hours away from the fiercely awaited North London Derby, here are a few key areas for the game.

Spurs in Transition:

It goes without saying, but Arsenal will need to block any out balls to Son & Richarlison. 

With Kulusevski most likely out with injury, it’s just the infamous Harry Kane, which Arsenal must congest. 

Albeit risky against a deadly transitional side, it is pivotal Arsenal maintain their high line, suffocate their rivals, and ultimately continue on their same, aggressive trajectory. 

Martinelli & Saka:

Hard to say who the young stars will be facing on each wing, but Spurs have got to ensure they don’t allow easy overloads & 1v1 opportunities, as the two Gunners wingers are deadly in this field.

Central battle: 

When Spurs have operated a 3-4-3, they’ve often been out numbered & ball dominated, so it’s imperative for the away side to play 3 in the middle, to attempt to congest, similar to how Fulham did so, albeit with a 4.

The only problem with this is Arsenal have incredible technical attributes, so block the middle & Arsenal make the pitch incredibly wide through under/ over laps from White, and the constant fluidity of zones, for example Xhaka going to the left, Zinchenko vacating the middle leaving Martinelli high and wide. 

Pinned in:

The hosts like to suffocate the opposition with a high line & incredible dual winners, not providing any time on the ball. Tottenham must be careful when playing out from the back - to not giveaway needless possession, and ensure they have some form of out ball, otherwise with the electric crowd & technical quality & intensity, Spurs could find themselves with little control, very quickly.

A special fixture, anything can and WILL happen.
