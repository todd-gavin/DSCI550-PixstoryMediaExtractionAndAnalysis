We continue to hear the sound of bombs and with the airspace closed and the land borders clogged by people fleeing by car it is practically impossible to leave Furthermore, food is scarce the shops are closed We have to wait Words from the Shaktar coach the Italian Roberto De Zerbi who in these difficult hours he is in the Ukraine in Kiev locked up in a hotel with his staff and with the Brazilian players of the team This morning he spoke to Deejay Chiama Italia on Radio Deejay where he told what he is experiencing in this terrible moment of the Russian attack Now we are here with Brazilian players I was saying with whom we have the responsibility of adults They are young and we older ones must be protective to guarantee that minimum of security which, to tell the truth, is not inside you in the most absolute way The two radio operators asked De Zerbi why not he returned to Italy when the Farnesiva had recommended him for all the Italians who were in Ukraine I know that many are wondering why he didn&#39;t return to Italy when the Farnesina called But I have a job here and as a coach I am responsible for my team of my boys I&#39;m not a co one Until less than a week ago, the Football Federation of Ukraine guaranteed us that this weekend&#39;s then canceled league match against Metalist Karrkiv would take place It was a wrong choice by the Ukrainian football officials sport was clear after Vladimir Putin&#39;s conference that sport could not have continued Having said that, what should I have done Escape to Italy I realize that those who do not know football or sport do not understand how it works in some cases there are responsibilities to be respected
