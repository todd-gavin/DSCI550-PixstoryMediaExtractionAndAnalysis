The importance of doctors has definitely come to the forefront in last two years with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's not that they were not there before, but with the virus spreading far and wide they have been working non-stop for 24 hours with little to no rest. They are there to ensure that patients recover fully, and with the number of infected cases rising daily, hospitals are overflowing with patients.

Increasing cases and mortality during the outbreak pushes frontline healthcare providers towards extreme pressure due to multiple factors including social isolation, stigma and discrimination; and put them at higher risk of psychological problems. üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

The stigma, discrimination and social isolation, therefore, need to be root out from the society. However, in the this situation these healthcare providers have been victims of the societal disapproval.

Neighbours and people in the community have been showing a kind of displeasure to allow the frontline healthcare providers reside in their home despite of the fact that healthcare workers are working with all necessary precautions. Anyone who has been involved in providing healthcare facility in a setting with a large number of COVID-19 cases is treated as an untouchable.

But in conclusion, emphasis on providing comprehensive support to the frontline healthcare providers both from the administrators and the society are required to create an enabling environment to improve the mental health of the patients, recovered patients and the frontline healthcare providers.
