Parasuraman is Kerala s first openly bisexual academician An assistant professor of English at the University College in Thiruvananthapuram Parasuraman talks about what it means to be openly bisexual academician and father of two in a conservative society like Kerala Q What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of coming out as a bisexual individual in a conservative society like Kerala Ans Well for me there hasn t been a major disadvantage There might be a few homophobic people who might want to keep a distance from you or might develop prejudices against you If you are a male and you are financially self supported particularly in the more enlightening corporate sector or the government sector there are no serious disadvantages of coming out as bisexual or maybe even coming out as gay But the entire game changes if you are a woman because unfortunately marriage is still more or less compulsory for women It s lesbians who face the wrong end of the stick because people can t understand that they don t want to marry and imposing heterosexual marriage on them would be subjecting them to a lifetime of rape and people don t get these things Then there is the phenomenon of political correctness many people might support the LGBTQ community and they may even take part in a pride march but when it comes to somebody in their family it may be totally different you know the ultimate test is how you may react if it s your own child who turns out to be gay lesbian or bisexual I deal with a lot of queer people in the armor gay lesbian and collective with which I am associated now as an advisor and a lot of young bisexuals come out to me and I tell them to get a secure job be on their own feet have a bank balance then come out The interview is a part of The Outing a podcast series brought to you by VVOX a platform with a mission to eradicate sexual shame and Earshot India s hottest podcast platform VVOX Earshot
