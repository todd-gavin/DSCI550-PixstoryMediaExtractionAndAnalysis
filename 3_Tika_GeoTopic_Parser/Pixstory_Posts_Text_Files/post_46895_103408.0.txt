Gwendolyn L. Ifill was an American journalist, television newscaster, and author. 

She was the first African-American woman to host a nationally televised U.S. public affairs program with Washington Week in Review.

At one of her earlier jobs as an intern, she found a note on her desk that read, "Nigger go home." After showing the note to editors at the newspaper, who "were horrified", they offered her a job when she graduated from college in 1977. Her first job in television was with NBC, where she was the network's Capitol Hill reporter.


She was the moderator and managing editor of Washington Week and co-anchor and co-managing editor, with Judy Woodruff, of the PBS NewsHour, both of which air on PBS.


In February 2016, she and Woodruff, moderating the debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, became the first team of women to moderate a Democratic presidential debate.

Ifill was a political analyst and moderated the 2004 and 2008 vice-presidential debates for which she is known.

She authored the best-selling book The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama. The book was directed at several African-American politicians, including Obama and other up-and-comers such as then-member of Congress Artur Davis, then-Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, and then mayor of Newark, New Jersey Cory Booker.

Ifill's readiness to always ask tough questions is always inspiring. At the 2004 vice presidential debate, for example, she asked each party's candidate to respond to the increasing rate of AIDS deaths among black women in the United States. Even after her demise, she remains to be an example of journalistic excellence.
