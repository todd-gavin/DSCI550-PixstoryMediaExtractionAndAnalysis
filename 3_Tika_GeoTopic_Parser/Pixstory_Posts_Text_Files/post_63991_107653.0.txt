The first season of ‘The Devil is a part timer’ was released in 2013 and is now almost a decade old. The second season was announced way back in 2021, though what are the things one can expect from the upcoming anime.

 For those who do not know, ‘The Devil is a part timer’ is an Isekai-slice of life- comedy anime which focuses on Satan himself who escapes to the human world along with one of his generals, and soon has fate cast an UNO reverse card on him. He loses his powers, gains a human body, is lost in an unfamiliar world and is now broke.

 So he works in a caricature McDonalds while the hero who defeated him follows him to Earth only to lose all her powers, become weak and work with the Dark Lord to adapt to the human world. Funny enough, Satan’s friends soon start pouring into the human world at times causing havoc and Satan must drive them off with the few reserves of magic he has left as he has grown to love the human world and the daily slog he has to go through. The series ended on a ‘Lived Happily Ever After’ note, so what can the second season introduce?

 Without giving spoilers, the show has been adapted of a light novel and the first season adapted the first two light novels. Currently 19 more novels are left in the tray, according to the trailer new characters from the light novels will be introduced alongside new plot lines putting the lord of hell in more hilarious situations with the anime being adapted from the 3rd and 4th light novels. 

The anime will handled by Studio 3Hz, which is best known for Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online and Princess Principal. This will mark the introduction of a new animation style, though the Japanese  voice cast will be returning. The second season will start streaming on Japanese TV by July 14 of this fall.
