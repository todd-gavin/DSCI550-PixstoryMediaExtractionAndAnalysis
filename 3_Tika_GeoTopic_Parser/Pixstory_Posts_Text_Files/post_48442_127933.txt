I know it is a controversial topic but I truly believe the only way to make the world a better place is by adhering to Christian values There is one true God who created the world and all that exists in it He has a plan for humanity which we can access through Jesus Christ By accepting Jesus Christ as our savior we can be forgiven of our sins and experience eternal life in heaven When we accept Jesus as our personal savior He conquers our sinfulness and opens the door to Heaven for us Through His death on the cross He made atonement for our sins and now He lives inside us as our continuous hope and guide Christ also provides salvation from eternity in Hell which is why being a Christian is so important to me and to so many others I pray that people see the way soon and realizes Jesus is the answer
