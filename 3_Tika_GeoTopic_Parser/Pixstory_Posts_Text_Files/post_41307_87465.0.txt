Gas costs, like inflation in general, are expected to damage President Biden's popularity and the Democratic Party's election chances. However, there is significant discussion over how dangerous the price hike will be, as well as whether there is a strong link between petrol costs and election outcomes. 

As per US News, across the country, prices are rising. The average price of a retail gallon of gasoline has climbed by nearly 25% in the last two months, and by about 70% since President Biden took office, according to US Energy Information Administration data. As Biden conceded this week, his move to ban US imports of Russian oil could push prices much higher. (However, the future remains uncertain; oil prices have recently dropped slightly.)

The broader trend's repercussions have only recently begun to reverberate through the American political system, and Biden's possible consequences are unclear: Putin is primarily to blame for the most recent shock, and according to FiveThirtyEight's tracker, Biden's approval rating has improved by approximately 2 percentage points in recent weeks to roughly 43%, but this could be a one-time boost from his State of the Union address. Even so, if these high prices persist, Republicans will undoubtedly use them as a target in this year's midterm elections.
