Adam Harry speaks on ‘Affirmative experiences and its impact on trans health: Not all doctors are bad doctors’ (edited, in the speakers words):

My name is Adam Harry and my pronouns are he/him. I have a private pilot licence from South Africa and now I'm a pursuing commercial pilot.

I started my transition when I was 18 and was closeted till 2017. Kerala is known as a transgender-friendly state, but we didn't have much visibility for transgender men.

So when I tell people I’m a transgender man, they think of Batman and Superman, and always ask me, ‘What is your superpower?’

I tell them that I have this power to be invisible, I was invisible for years. I was closeted for years. When I came out as trans, I was disowned by my family.

I was taken to invasive medical procedures, including conversion and aversion therapies. I ran away from my home at the age of 19, I started working at a juice bar as juice maker. Then later after one year, I got a scholarship from the Kerala government to continue my education — that's when I started my physical transition.

Before my physical transition, my friends helped me to get consultation with a psychiatrist and psychologist, and they have helped me really well.

The power held by doctors is always a barrier for us. We know we have a policy, which prohibits discrimination against transgender people, including denial of services in healthcare. Yet, we face violence and discrimination.
