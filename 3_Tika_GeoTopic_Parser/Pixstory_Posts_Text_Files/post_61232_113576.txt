Isn t it amazing that you can wear shirt in different styles A shirt is staple in any wardrobe because it can be worn pretty much all year long I love it in the summer tied around my waist with a dress in case it is too cold inside But it also looks great under a sweater or cardigan in the winter Do try these styles
