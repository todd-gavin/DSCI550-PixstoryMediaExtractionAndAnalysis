Suicide is among the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the surge in mental health disorders and anxiety, depression, and other problems compel people to attempt suicide.
Although the reasons could be many, delving into the root cause of increasing suicide is essential.
The times are tough, and so is the mental health condition, the unrelenting pressure of not being able to follow up with aspirations and desires, and people are giving up their want to live.

This pressure is not always created by society( nevertheless, an important cause for suicide) or the people around us. Still, it is instead a cornucopia of yearnings and wanting to be part of a utopia that people construct.
With the growing demand and need to set a perfect portrait of oneself that is successful and vibrant in all the phases of life, whether economic or social, people are constantly trying to build this for themselves, scarcely taking care of their mental health and how it can get inflicted by running in this race.

Besides, this is not the only reason people tend to commit suicide. Other essential factors like being surrounded by negative people and thoughts that discourage and demotivate someone to the extent that they renounce the idea of living. 
Sometimes, family problems or grief caused by the death of someone can also affect one's mental health, severely forcing them to take their life.
