Raising public awareness and educating people about the opportunities and risks presented by asteroids. The goal is to inform the public regarding various actions and efforts that should take place in case the need should arise.

While it is unclear exactly how long asteroids have been floating around in the solar system, scientists believe that they go back tens of millions of years. They can range from small to large – 10 meters across to more than 500 meters across. Added together, the total mass of all current asteroids in our solar systems would be less in size than the Earth’s moon.

Scientists estimate that approximately 65 million years ago, an enormous asteroid fell to the earth in the area that is presently Yucatan, Mexico. 
This is referred to as the Chicxulub impact and some scientists think this may be what contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs. 

This asteroid may have been the size of some small countries and left a crater that was somewhere around 150 km in size where a rim of mountains the size of the Himalayas formed around the edge.

International Asteroid Day was founded by Stephen Hawking and a collection of other people, including an Apollo 9 astronaut, a filmmaker, and Brian May – who was the guitarist for Queen and also an astrophysicist. 

June 30 was chosen for the day as it is the anniversary of the 1908 incident in Siberia.
The day officially launched in 2014 with the support of more than 200 astronauts. It took two more years before it was officially recognized by the United Nations in 2016.
