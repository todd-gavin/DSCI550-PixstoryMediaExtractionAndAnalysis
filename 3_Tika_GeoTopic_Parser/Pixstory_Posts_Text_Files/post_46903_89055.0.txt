According to Wikipedia; The main reasons given for her rejection were that (1) she was a woman and therefore intellectually secondary, and (2) she might prove equal to the task, prove to be competition, and that she could not expect them to "furnish [her] with a stick to break our heads with". Out of desperation, she applied to twelve "country schools".

Finally, the Geneva Medical College accepted her application as the male students voted for her acceptance. In 1847, Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the United States.
