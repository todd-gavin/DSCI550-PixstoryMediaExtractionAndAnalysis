A third dose of an mRNA vaccine provides increased protection against hospitalization with Covid in people with conditions that compromise their immune system as well as in those who don t have such conditions According to a study published Thursday in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Research has found that people who have weakened immune systems because of conditions like certain cancers AIDS or organ transplants may not have had a complete immune response from the standard two doses of an mRNA Covid vaccine The new study followed hospitalized adults who were Covid positive and who were negative for Covid and compared vaccine effectiveness among those who had received two doses of the mRNA vaccine and those who had gotten three The third vaccine was defined as a full dose in immunocompromised people or a booster dose in those without immune compromising conditions The researchers found that a third dose increased vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization from to among the immunocompromised and to among those without immune compromising conditions These findings underscore the importance of immunocompromised adults obtaining a third mRNA vaccine dose days after the second vaccine dose and of immunocompetent adults receiving a third booster dose currently recommended months after the second dose the authors state in alignment with current CDC guidelines The study was conducted between August and December a period in which Delta was the dominant Covid variant though Omicron cases were emerging Hence all variant conclusions cannot be drawn from this study However the authors reference early evidence suggesting that third mRNA vaccine doses elicit markedly stronger neutralizing antibody responses to the Omicron variant compared with responses to vaccine doses Source CNN
