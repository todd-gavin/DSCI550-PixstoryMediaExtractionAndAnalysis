‌The need for gun control is stressed as a severe incident happened a few blocks from California; a state with the nation's strongest gun laws. According to the State Firearm Laws project at Boston University, California has the most gun laws of any state. This shows the need not only for stricter gun laws but the need of removing gun culture from the lives of Americans. 
‌
‌Let's have a look at some laws in California. The state prohibits access to military-style weapons, assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. It was the first state in the nation to require a point of sale background check for ammunition, and also requires firearm sales and transfers of ownership to be administered through licensed dealers for background checks. California law inhibits firearm access for people condemned of hate crimes and other violent acts, as well as for those who are subject to a restraining order.
‌
‌This means restrictions are not enough banning guns should be considered as an option but it would be non-fundamental. The Californian lawmakers are considering at least 24 more laws. One bill would enable victims, as well as state and local governments, to sue the gun industry. Another bill would consider banning ghost guns in their entirety, not just their parts. 
‌
‌Awareness should be spread and people should be taught not to contain violence.
