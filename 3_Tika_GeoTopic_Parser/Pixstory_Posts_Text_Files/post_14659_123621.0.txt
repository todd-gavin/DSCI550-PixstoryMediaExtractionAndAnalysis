With time restricted eating we know it's effective for weight loss, but this kind of restricted eating can also improve the mood and blood pressure. 

According to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine that found about how early time restricted eating for a period of 8 hours between 7 am to 3 pm helps in a more effective weight loss, blood pressure control and mood improvement among adults with obesity is possible when compared with those who ate an eating window which is greater than 12 hours. 

A study author write, that, “Early time-restricted eating (eTRE) was more effective for losing weight and lowering diastolic blood pressure than eating over a period of 12 or more hours at 14 weeks." 

“The eTRE intervention may therefore be an effective treatment for both obesity and hypertension. It also improves mood by decreasing fatigue and feelings of depression-dejection and increasing vigor, and those who can stick with eTRE lose more body fat and trunk fat,” they added. 

The impact of time restricted eating on participants with obesity was equivalent of decreasing calorie intake by 214 calories a day. 

Experts believes that this could make an effective difference in weight loss. 

Dana Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, a senior dietitian at the RR-UCLA Medical Center in California, told Healthline, that, “Over a 14-week period, an additional 214 calories/day amounts to 6 pounds (2.7kg) difference in weight loss. For many people, losing 5 percent of the weight is considered a significant health benefit and so, yes, this many calories can absolutely make a difference because in a year this would amount to losing roughly 10kg of weight (22 lb), which for some people would be close to a 10 percent weight loss.”
