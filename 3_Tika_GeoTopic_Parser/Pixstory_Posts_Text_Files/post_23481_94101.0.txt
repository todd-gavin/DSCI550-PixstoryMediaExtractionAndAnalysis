We cross the few simple quintessential village houses set amidst the step fields of green wheat to reach the camp. 

It is set on this sliver of land seemingly floating so high up that one can barely see the Ramganga flowing down below on the north of the spur.

On the east are the peaks near Munsiyari, on the south the world & on the north separated by just this deep narrow valley, the wall of the Nanda Devi massif & the Namik glacier. 

The dramatic setting offers a stunning almost 360 degree, to-die-for view!

The beauty of the camp lies in it’s simplicity. There is a cookhouse on one side, doling out copious quantities of tea & piping hot pakoras & the most sublime food fresh off the land. 

A thatched structure has the place of pride right in the middle of the highest field, serving as the dining area & the place for congregating in the evening around a bonfire. 

A few stone & mud huts, each with a different yet fabulous view, scattered around on the lower fields make up the accommodation. 

I appreciate the fact that the camp ensures one communes with nature by keeping the facilities snug but simple. 

To lounge in a room in a locale like this would be a criminal waste. My absolute favourite is the washbasin holding on to the trunk of a tree in the washroom area. 

I can’t recall there being a mirror because I couldn’t take my eyes of the vista in front of me – the peaks visible through the trees, the birds flitting around the tree tops below…
