Anywhere , on any social media , whether twitter/Facebook/ Instagram, I get adds like all of you do.  While the algorithms have figured I am a lover of kurtas- cotton kurtas at that, I keep getting adds about Jaipuri kurtas, ajrakh, ikaat and Kalam kari kurtas . The adds leave me tempted. 
What is also tempting me is an add about weight loss for menopausal women or peri menopausal women . The algorithms must have figured I am on the wrong side of 40, but how did they figure I am struggling with weight loss. Everything the woman claims is happening to me. Although she claims itâ€™s for women above 50 and I have many years to reach there but the things are happening to me already. I eat healthy, calorie deficient , keto the scale refuses to bulge . I lost a few inches here and there but the scale- my dear scale refuses to make me happy. 
So what are these vitamins / pro biotics
That are being touted as this magic remedy for ur weight loss , your bloating , hot flashes . A months supply comes for almost $50 . Do they really work can anyone tell me, or just tell me the recipe for weight loss
