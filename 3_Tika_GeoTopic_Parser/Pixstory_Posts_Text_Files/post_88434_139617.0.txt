*Discussion* ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Was Thomas Tuchelâ€™s sacking too soon?
Tuchel was sacked just 6 games into the season, having navigated an incredibly turbulent time through 2022 with sanctions around Chelsea Football Club and the following takeover from Todd Boehly. 

Throughout that, Tuchel stuck with the club, and yet as soon as the going got tough, they didnâ€™t stick with him.

Having had 2 key signings, Fofana and Aubameyang for just 1 game, was Tuchel ever really given the chance to put his mark on the new squad?

Let me know what you think!
