Being a mom is an experience of self-discovery🤰🏻 Being A mother is one of the most beautiful experience ! ❤️

But Unfortunately , new moms often believe myths that only add undue stress and guilt . sometimes myths can suggest otherwise ❌

I have debunked a few myths for you ;

1 Myth - it's Not safe To work Out for The First Three months after having a baby !

Truth - While ample rest is important , a safe workout regimen can gently rebuild your core and prepare you to return to a regular workouts !


2 Myth - You must eat bland foods if you are breastfeeding !

Truth - In most cases , what you eat doesn't affect the baby as it is already digested by the time it reaches your baby through your milk .

3 Myth - If you wait , Post Partum depression will just go away on it's own  !

Truth - Waiting can have a negative impact on your relationship with the baby , if you are struggling for longer than 10-14 days , reach out for help .

It becomes very important to not fall for baseless information !❌
