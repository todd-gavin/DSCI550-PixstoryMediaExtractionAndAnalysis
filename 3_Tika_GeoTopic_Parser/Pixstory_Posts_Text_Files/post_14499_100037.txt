Most of us believe on how steriods and anti inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen would help in treating the low back pain if other methods like exercise and other non drug therapies don t work out But the reality behind this is something else According to a study published in Science Translation Medicine the medication taken for getting relief from acute pain doesn t reduce and improve one s health but rather makes way for developing chronic pain For many decades it s been standard medical practice to treat pain with anti inflammatory drugs Jeffrey Mogil a psychology professor at McGill University said in a school news release But we found that this short term fix could lead to longer term problems Researchers looked into low back pain because the condition is so common now with almost of U S adults say that they have had low back pain in three months as per the reports from CDC Acute back pain is defined as lasting for four weeks whereas chronic back pain lasts for more than weeks Researchers discovered that by examining the blood samples those people who have low back pain and which was resolved had high inflammation that was driven by neutrophils which is a type of white blood cell that helps the body to fight from infection Neutrophils dominate the early stages of inflammation and set the stage for repair of tissue damage Inflammation occurs for a reason and it looks like it s dangerous to interfere with it Mogil said in the news release The team found that the blocking neutrophils in mice increased the pain in the animals upto fold more Pain was also prolonged in the mice who were given antiflammatory drugs and steriods An analysis that the school cited included people in the United Kingdom The analysis was that those taking anti inflammatory drugs for pain were to have pain for like to years later Sources
