Bukayo Saka was at the centre of attention as England lost the Euros at home to Italy in the summer. 

Since then, the Arsenal youngster has come a long way to solidify his case as one of the best in Europe. 

The England international proved his worth once again in the game against Watford on the weekend. Saka scored a goal and also provided an assist as the Gunners won the game 3-2. 

Owing to his fine form, Bukayo Saka has now scored 8 goals and has provided 5 assists in 25 Premier League games. These are very respectable numbers for a 20-year old. 

Saka  currently has the same number of Premier League goals as Harry Kane and Michail Antonio. With such stats, Bukayo Saka should certainly be one of the favourites to win the Young Player of the Year award.

Phil Foden won the Young player award last year. The Manchester City youngster had 9 goals and 5 assists in the 2020/21 season. Hence, Saka should certainly be one of the contenders to win the coveted award.
