Ivan Juric&#39;s analysis of Turin coach on Sky Sport after the defeat against Genoa We approached the match well we put pressure on but conceded a rather ridiculous goal on the first mistake In the second half we did too little too many technical mistakes In the first time instead we did the right things And a very negative period in terms of results The team started well afterwards they didn&#39;t do well technically making many choices and many passes wrong In the second half we did too little in numerical superiority It was too long that we didn&#39;t win we&#39;re doing well up to a certain point Now we&#39;re throwing a lot of perspective now I don&#39;t care much I&#39;m only interested in winning then normal we&#39;re doing well after two disastrous years but we need to raise the level
