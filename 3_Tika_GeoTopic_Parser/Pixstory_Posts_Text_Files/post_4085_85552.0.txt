‌On Sunday Kerala Police arrested Sujeesh PS who had been accused of sexual assault by several women.
‌
‌He has been charged under Sections 375 (rape) and 509 (words or gestures intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.
‌
‌Kochi Police Commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam said, "after allegations arose, he closed his studio and absconded,” he said. “Our teams were monitoring his movements and tracked him down on Saturday night.”

The police raided Sujeesh’s tattoo studio and confiscated laptops and close-circuit television footage. 

The police also carried out inspections at other tattoo studios in Kochi, and gathered details about their employees according to sources from Hindustan Times.

Meanwhile, the #metoo wave further captures social media as few women including the survivors are collecting information to expose many predators in the society. The post in social media of one of the survivor said: "In response to growing misogyny and instances of sexual abuse, few concerned women have come together to address this issue. We believe that warning each other of predators is only a first step and not the* finality. We are inviting you to share your experiences here in this google form so that we can begin processing towards actionable change." They have also provided google forms for the same.

They have guaranteed to keep all the information very confidential.

With the effort and courage of these women the predator was arrested in 3days. No one has to sacrifice or bear the pain of violation alone. Together make a difference.
