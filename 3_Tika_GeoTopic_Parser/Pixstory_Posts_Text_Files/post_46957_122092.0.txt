Media studies scholar Aph Ko offers a compelling vision of a reimagined social justice movement marked by a deconstruction of the conceptual framework that keeps activists silo-ed fighting their various oppressionsâ€”and one another. This book is a scintillating combination of critical race theory, social commentary, veganism, and gender analysis. Ko demonstrates the various ways that white supremacist concepts of animality and race exist through the eating and exploitation of flesh through a sophisticated and in-depth analysis of Jordan Peele's popular 2017 film Get Out. She exemplifies how the road to real freedom can be found in a critical historical and social knowledge of anti-Blackness. Racism as Zoological Witchcraft is a wonderful example of the developing discipline of Black veganism by one of its main speakers. It is very accessible, lavishly illustrated, and full of shocking discoveries.
