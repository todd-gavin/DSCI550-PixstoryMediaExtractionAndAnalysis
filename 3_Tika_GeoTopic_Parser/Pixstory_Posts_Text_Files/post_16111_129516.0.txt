Alia Bhatt might be in a satisfying space both professionally and personally but she also has her own fair share of trolls. Recently, the actress was brutally trolled for allegedly smelling her own fart after a clip went viral from her promotional activity for Brahmastra.

The video showed the actress touching her backside and then putting her finger in front of her nose.🤮🤮🤮
