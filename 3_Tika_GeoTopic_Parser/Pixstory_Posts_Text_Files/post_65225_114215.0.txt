We are here today to discuss how we can move forward together to achieve the 2030 Agenda objective of zero hunger, under immense and growing challenges. 

I want to congratulate FAO and co-authors for this flagship report that provides basis for this meeting and what we need to do to meet the SDGs. 

There is no doubt that over the past 25 years significant progress has been made in reducing hunger and malnutrition. The proportion of undernourished people in the world had declined from 15 percent in 2000-2004 to 8.9 percent in 2019. The rate of stunting fell from 33 percent of children under age five in 2000 to 21.3 percent in 2019. 

Sadly, more recently we have seen global hunger on the rise, reversing decades of progress.  

The first time I attended the launch of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report in 2019, hunger was already on the rise. 

In that year, the report introduced a second indicator for monitoring the Prevalence of Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity.  It found that more than 2 billion people lacked regular access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food, and the pace of progress was too slow to meet global nutrition targets by 2030. 

Since 2017, the SOFI reports have identified the main drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition: conflict, climate variability and extremes, and economic slowdowns and downturns.  These drivers are increasing in intensity and frequency, often in combination and their negative impacts are exacerbated by, and contributing to worsening high and persistent levels of inequality and poverty. 

The past two years, the food security and nutrition of billions of people has been further undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effects are still felt across the globe. The measures to contain the pandemic and the scars it has left on global food supply chains have resulted in severe worldwide economic contractions.
