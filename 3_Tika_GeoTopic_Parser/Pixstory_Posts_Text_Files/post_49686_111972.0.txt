The republican dominated states have already enacted most of the conservative laws. Texas has been at the forefront of bringing out measures like would illegalize parents’ efforts to seek medical treatment for their transgender children.

‌Latest, Ken Paxton state’s conservative attorney general, has motioned that he is willing to reconsider the state’s anti-sodomy law, which was abolished by the Supreme Court in 2003 to maintain intimacy between same-sex partners.

“People are still reeling from Roe, and we’re in an incredibly toxic political environment right now,” said Oni Blair, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas. “But we need to recognize that nothing is off the table at this moment. All of our rights and liberties — from LGBTQ equality, voting, and even contraception — could be at risk.”

The abortion-rights advocates are in a struggle to get their rights and this law will further make the situation worse for everyone in Texas. The conservative nature here is totally against humanity. 

Paxton’s remarks have already caused havoc in Texas's LGBTQ and human rights community, which worries that in the coming weeks the conservative state and Gov. Greg Abbott (R) could take on other long-standing protections regulating bodily autonomy and gay rights, threatening growth gained over decades of struggle.

“We put up a valiant fight here, and we are being attacked in every direction,” said Ricardo Martinez, chief executive of Equality Texas, an LGBTQ rights group. “It is not the government’s business who we have sex with. They’ve intruded in the doctor’s office and the classroom; now they want to intrude into the bedroom. This is government overreach.”
