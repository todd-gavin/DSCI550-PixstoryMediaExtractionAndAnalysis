Afghanistan
 Saad al-Din Saeed, the Taliban's deputy minister of information and culture, spoke with a UNESCO representative today to prevent "flood damage to the Minaret of Jam and the clearing of the Jam Sea." The UNESCO representative said during the meeting that the organization is ready to protect Afghanistan's cultural heritage.

The 800-year-old World Cup minaret, a UN World Heritage site, is currently in critical condition and reportedly in danger of collapsing.

The Taliban Ministry of Information and Culture announced a few days ago that a number of minarets in Jam Jam had collapsed.
