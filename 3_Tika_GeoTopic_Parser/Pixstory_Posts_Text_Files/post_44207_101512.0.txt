Arsenal's top-four ambitions remain "quite possible," according to Mikel Arteta, as they wait for Norwich to do them a favour against north London rivals Tottenham.

The Gunners enter the last day of the season on Sunday with back-to-back defeats, leaving them two points behind Spurs in the Champions League race. They must beat Everton at the Emirates and hope that the demoted Canaries can help them out at Carrow Road against their oldest rivals.

Norwich have lost five of their previous six home games and have conceded 17 goals during that time. But, after seeing Crystal Palace put up a fight in what was mostly a dead rubber for Patrick Vieira's side at Goodison Park on Thursday night, Arteta believes the odds can be overturned at Carrow Road on Sunday.

Mikel Arteta:

"It's very possible. Looking back, I've been back a few years and seen a few examples of things like this happening at the end of the season. The longer the game is close, I am hopeful.

"We are back in Europe, we don't know where, hopefully it will be in the Champions League - we'll do what we have to do and we will be cheering for Norwich."

Arteta began his final pre-season press conference of the season with a speech regarding his team's improvement, despite their regret at dropping out of the top four in the final week of the season.

The 40-year-old emphasised Arsenal's progress in remaining in contention for the Champions League into the final matchday after finishing eighth in the previous two seasons, and he looked ahead to the future, which he said would necessitate additional resources for investment in the "depth and quality" of the playing squad.
