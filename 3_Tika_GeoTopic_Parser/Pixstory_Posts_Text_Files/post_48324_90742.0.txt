Manchester United recently held talks with the Ajax Head Coach Erik ten Hag in their search for a manager for next season. Ten Hag has been the Ajax coach for the last 4 years and in that time has taken Ajax to great heights reaching a Europa league Final, a Champions League Semi Final and has won multiple domestic honors as well. With his time at Ajax looking like ending, the Ajax boss has been on the radar of many top European clubs. But none have shown more intrest than Manchester United who are currently managed by their interim coach Ralf Rangnick.

Ten Hag has also shown intrest in taking the job at Old Trafford as was evident by his meeting with United officials. But former United coach, Louis Van Gaal is of a different opinion. The current Netherlands National Team coach has stated that ten Hag should not take the Manchester United job as it is a 'commercial club' and he would be better off taking a job at a 'football club' instead.

Van Gaal managed the Manchester club for 2 seasons from 2014 to 2016 winning a F.A Cup in his second season which was his last at the club. Van Gaal believes that the move would hinder Ten Hag's career and suggested the Ajax coach to not take the job.

United in recent years has seen a revolving door of managers who have been unable to inspire the club to Premier League or Champions League glory like Sir Alex Ferguson did. The club has also been accused by the fans and pundits to be focusing more on the commercial rather than the footballing aspects of things. So in some way Van Gaal might be right in suggesting Ten Haag to avoid the hot seat at Old Trafford.
