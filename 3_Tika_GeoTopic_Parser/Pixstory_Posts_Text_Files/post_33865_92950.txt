Zanetti&#39;s Venice continues to lose, however, they also lost against Udinese in the Serie A round. This is the analysis of the Venetian coach. In the lower part of the standings, it doesn&#39;t change much because we all always lose. the fifth time in this championship we have conceded after obviously our game would have been different without these episodes C definitely a psychological component it was a hard-fought and physical match we were in it and we were good at recovering after a penalty that could have knocked us down Definitely c a psychological problem on the other it&#39;s clear that we have limits we need to be clear at the end of the championship But we&#39;ll play it to the end because in my opinion we can still do it
