But more importantly, Frenkie De Jong is one of those players who is very hard to press. His close control and control, in general, is brilliant and be it facing his own goal or the opponent’s when he is being pressed, he quickly analyses the field and usually creates a gap between him and his marker with his first touch, following which he quickly develops a movement. 

Moreover, one of the most wonderful traits of Frenkie De Jong as a footballer is that he is flexible to play in whichever position is assigned to him. Over years, we have seen him playing as a CM, DM, CF, and even a CB very recently. And surprisingly, he fits into all these positions pretty well. 

All these attributes makes Frenkie De Jong one of the best midfielders of his kind in the world and Man United and Chelsea definitely do not want to give up on the opportunity to sign him. Man United are more eager to buy him that Chelsea as their newly appointed head coach Erik Ten Hag knows Frenkie very well from his days at Ajax and he has kept him as one of his top priorities for this transfer window.
