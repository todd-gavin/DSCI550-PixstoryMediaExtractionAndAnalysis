Avocados, especially when sliced and placed on toast, may have seemed like a fad in the early 2000s. But, happily, they are here to stay.
And to make sure they are paid the attention they deserve, they have their own day – National Avocado Day!

As per DOY, originating in south-central Mexico, avocados have been around for thousands of years, but likely were not cultivated until around 500 BC. Even then, the first mention of this fruit in the English language wasn’t until 1696.

National Avocado Day is celebrated on the last day of July, at the peak of the avocado season in California. But, luckily, avocados can usually be found in supermarkets all year round for people who want to eat them in all of the seasons.
National Avocado Day was founded in 2017 and has been observed annually and gaining in popularity ever since.
