You sea I resign myself to you also I guess what you mean I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me We must have a turn together I undress hurry me out of sight of the land Cushion me soft rock me in billowy drowse Dash me with amorous wet I can repay you Sea of stretch d ground swells Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell d yet always ready graves Howler and scooper of storms capricious and dainty sea I am integral with you I too am of one phase and of all phases Partaker of influx and efflux I extoller of hate and conciliation Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others arms Walt Whitman
