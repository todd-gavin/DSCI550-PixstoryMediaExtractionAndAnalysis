Saturday has been rebranded as Caturday for a particular section of the internet.

It's a place where cat lovers share photos, tales, and information about cats - and if you want to join in, we can help you out with these tidbits about why cats meow and purr.

Caturday is, as the Urban Dictionary puts it, "the greatest holiday on the internets" — just don't tell the dogs.

The term "Caturday" was coined by the website 4Chan. On Saturdays, it began as a venue to swap cat photographs and memes (Caturday).

Since 2005, Caturday has existed.

You don't have to love cats to appreciate these little tiny balls of fluff – or not – because, let's be honest, once you meet a cat, you can't exactly help loving them. So enjoy your caturday seeing some lovely cat pictures and videos!
