Real Madrid's manager continued the press conference by addressing what he expects from the Derby as he said: "It will be a competitive match. They don't expect anything new and it will be a very competitive duel, a good football match because there are very good players on both teams. The match is open, but there is nothing definitive. Rivalry is normal."
Next, he was asked about the peculiar situation of Antoine Griezmann faced by both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona but Ancelotti managed not to indulge himself into such debates by diplomatically answering: "It sounds a bit strange but I don't like getting into these discussions, every coach has to make decisions, Simeone and Atletico have been and are doing well in Spain and Europe."
Ancelotti demanded respect for his opposition manager Diego Simeone by saying: "He has a great relationship with his players, he is able to build that bond and that's an important part of being a coach."
On Vinicius and the support from all over the world: "It's something we don't touch on in the locked room, these are topics that are not normally discussed in the locker room, we usually talk about football."
"Racism is one thing, what happens on the field is another, there is a lot of talk about provocations, but racism is a much more important issue that what happens on the field. But we will not address the issue of racism, as Vinicius spoke well in his statement."
The next part of the article is continued in the support section.
