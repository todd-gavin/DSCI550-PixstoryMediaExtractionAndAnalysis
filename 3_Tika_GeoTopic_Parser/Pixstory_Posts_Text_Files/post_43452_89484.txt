Shawn Mendes and Camilla Cabello were the picture perfect couple Every single one of us felt lonely seeing the two love birds share their love with us So when they announced that they were breaking up we all were shocked Months after the breakup Shawn opened about his separation with his ex Camila and now we finally know his perspective You know you don t realize when you re breaking up with someone you re thinking that it s the right thing to do he said You don t realize all this shit that comes after Like who do I call when I m in a panic attack Who do I call when I m like fucking on the edge I think that s the reality that kind of hit me he continued It s like Oh I m on my own now he said Now I feel like finally I m actually on my own and I hate that That s my reality you know Shawn has released a beatiful breakup song It ll be okay sharing with the world how he feels post breakup Everyone in the world deserves love Let s hope that Shawn finds his own soon
