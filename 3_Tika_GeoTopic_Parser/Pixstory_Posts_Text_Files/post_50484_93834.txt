Another night another dinner in the hostel mess where on one place you can feel a void of your family and on another place filled with spending time with the hostelers and sharing joys of each other Not just we share a common mess but our experience culture heritage and wisdom which are beyond anything So now it just doesn t bother to me what kind of quality of food is veing prepared whether delicious or not or according to my taste or not but what matter is that these days are previous and never comes back Cheers to the hostel life
