Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer is stepping down at the end of the court’s current term, opening up the possibility of President Biden’s first nomination. Given the 6-3 conservative majority in the top court, the Democrats have been waiting anxiously for this chance, even if this one vacancy is not going to reset the balance. 

Justice Breyer is expected to make his announcement Thursday: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/senate-democrats-breyer-vacancy.html

Biden is likely to make good his the campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the apex court: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/opinion/supreme-court-black-woman.html At least three names are already doing rounds: https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-race-and-ethnicity-8dd8cdc06986f97cc87961b7bce4f36a

Going by the Constitution, the president names judges, but it is the Senate that confirms their appointment – after an elaborate process: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/26/supreme-court-nominations/9228216002/ 

Biden will have to complete the nomination process in a short time. The Democrats’ chances could worsen if the Republicans retake the Senate this November and/or the presidency in 2024. Today, the Senate is split evenly, and the vice president has the tie-breaking vote. Then some of the Democrats too have not played along in case of some of the president’s legislative moves. 

On the other hand, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) may try his best to block Biden’s moves. He has served the notice that he may not confirm Biden’s nominee during the last two years of the president’s term: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/06/14/mcconnell-biden-wont-get-supreme-court-pick-in-2024-if-gop-wins-back-senate/?sh=3ae2985e10fd In the past, he applied rules differently in 2016 and 2020 when it comes to confirming justices.

That is why Biden will have to fine-tune his strategy. After mid-terms polls, which usually go to the opposition, Republicans could be in majority in the chamber: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/26/what-stephen-breyers-retirement-means/

Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointment. Trump had a rare chance, with McConnell’s help probably, to clear three appointments and tilt the ideological balance. That is not going to happen again for a long time, since the incumbent judges are not likely to retire soon. The recent appointees are relatively young too, so the next opportunity would be years away. So, the majority in the court will remain on the conservative side for a long while, changing the course of the nation on issues like abortion: https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-elections-692d2189c269fd802444c3b9e466db01
