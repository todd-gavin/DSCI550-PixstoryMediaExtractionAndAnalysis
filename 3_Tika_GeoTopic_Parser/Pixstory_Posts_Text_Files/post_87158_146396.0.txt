3 David Silva
He was the mainstay of Manchester City, and his passing was flawless. He embodied Manchester City, with great technique, vision, and the ability to score goals. Silva would pull all the thread as a playmaker and feed striker goals. The left-footed midfielder scored 77 goals in 436 appearances for Manchester City, who won their first title in a century.
2 Yaya Toure
Toure was a complete midfielder, and his presence on the field freed up space for City forwards to score goals. Toure's height and strength allowed him to physically outclass opponents, and he had the capability to link plays during games. Toure was in his prime when City acquired him, and it paid off handsomely.
Yaya Toure appeared in 316 games and scored 79 goals. He was a revelation as a defensive midfielder in the 2013-14 season, scoring 20 goals and propelling City to the Premier League.

1 Kevin de Bruyne
One of the best in the business, his vision is unreal, and only a few midfielders can compete with him. Bruyne is a real blessing to Manchester City, and with his passing range and ability to unveil any unwavering defence, he can simply provide an assist from anywhere on the pitch. He is an important player for Guardiola and has more than earned his status as one of the greatest Manchester City midfielders of all time.
He recently broke Gerrard's all-time Premier League assist record, and having him on the team is a privilege. The Belgian playmaker has played a role in 317 goals and scored 87 for City.
