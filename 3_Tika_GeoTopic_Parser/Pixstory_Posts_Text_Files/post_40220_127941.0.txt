Don’t get me wrong, I am not judging the series without watching! I watched the entire series and to me there isn't really anything that standout about the show. 

I accept that it is a decent show but the way is is being showered with awards and praises? A bit overhyped in my opinion. It is a fun show but not a great one. 

As one Reddit user pointed out, the story isn't by any means original, both of the "twists" near the end are cliché, the villains are just evil for evils sake and don't provide any reasoning beyond being "bad guys" and the plot just kinda exists. It doesn't do anything special or unique. 

Maybe it worked because everyone likes violence these days and that is why is people are so enamored by the show, but honestly, the show is just people dying for stupid reasons. I would have expected a bit more of a story arc from the show but okay.

What do you think about the show?
