I bet that many of us would have forgotten about father s day In reality we not only devote more effort to finding the perfect gift for our mothers but we also spend significantly more money on Mother s Day than on Father s Day To be honest it is not our fault that we forget about this auspicious day One main reason would be how Mother s day is marketed on a higher level than Father s day Advertisements gift hampers and offers are more centered on mothers than fathers It is just recently that changes have been made to recognize fathers It could also be how mothers were not recognized for many centuries and now that they are they have been put in the spotlight However it s time that we give importance to both these days equally and this post would be a reminder to wish a Happy Father s Day to the one who has been a good father figure in your life
