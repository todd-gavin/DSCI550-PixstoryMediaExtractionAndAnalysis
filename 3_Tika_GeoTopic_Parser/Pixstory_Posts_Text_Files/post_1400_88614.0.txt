Choco is my mum’s new kitten! He is what they call a ‘tripod’, he does not have four functioning legs

The shelter told my mother that he would not have a high chance of being adopted by someone else if she didn’t take him, which made me sad. Because there’s absolutely nothing preventing him from being a wonderful pet choice! Tripod cats are just as cheerful and energetic as any other cat, you see. They just require a little more help sometimes with jumping and running, but that’s it

My friend has a blind cat named Chutney, who has no idea that she’s blind. She hides and pounces using smell! You smile watching her and seeing how well she is able to navigate the world 

So please, don’t be afraid to adopt an older animal, or one that is missing a limb or an eye. They are just as cute, and it breaks my heart that they don’t get adopted as much as their fellow creatures!
