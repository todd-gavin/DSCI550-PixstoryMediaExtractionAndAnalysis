Manchester City and Barcelona played a 3-3 draw on Wednesday night in a fundraiser charity match. 

Pep Guardiola made his return to  Barcelona face his former side in a charity friendly match that organised as a fundraiser for charity cause with the proceeds going towards aiding ALS research through the Luzon foundation. 

In a Contest that took place in honour of ex-Barcelona goalkeeper coach Juan Carlos Unzue who was diagnosed with the incurable nervous system condition ALS two years ago, Manchester City were the pacesetters taking the lead in the 21st minute after Julian Alvarez capitalised on a poor goalkeeping by Inaki Peña in the area. 

Pierre Emerick Aubameyang cancelled City’s lead eight minute later with his half-volley from six yards out. 

Barcelona then went ahead in the second half as a shambolic defending by Manchester City enabled Frankie De Jong to latch on a loose ball and strike over the goalkeeper in the 66th minute.
 
The visitors equalised four minutes later as academy player Cole Palmer tapped into an empty net from a beautiful square play by Joao Cancelo.
 
The host regained their lead with 10 minutes to go as Memphis Depay comfortably slot home a cut back pass from Sergi Roberto at the centre of the box. That goal preceded Riyadh Mahrez’s eventual penalty kick in the last minute of injury time to level the scoreboard.
