Married at 15 to a man more than twice her age, A*, a 19-year-old Kashmiri, had survived miscarriage, physical violence, and mental torture at the hands of her husband. Not well educated and with little support from her family members, who kept sending her back to her husband, A* didn't know that she could have a better life until she found out about Mehram, a group of Kashmiri women committed to helping survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse. 
This was one of the several stories that Arshie Qureshi, 29, a co-founder of Mehram, told Article 14 in a recent conversation, explaining that Mehram means ‘a close friend’ in Urdu, and women survivors of abuse in Kashmir were in dire need of a support structure because they couldn't find one in their own families. It was particularly hard for someone like A*, who had no notable skills and had not completed her education.
“When A* approached us, she had not seen or envisioned another way of living,” said Qureshi. “She was not even sure about her age, so we had to figure out if she had been married as a minor.”
Qureshi, pursuing her PhD in gender, law and policy at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University, started Mehram with two Kashmiri lawyers, Subreen Malik and Shehryar Khanum, both in their early thirties. The three women began reaching out to women who they knew needed help but were reluctant to ask for it, volunteering their time and expertise in aspects of legal aid and rehabilitation.
With an office in Rajbagh, Srinagar, Mehra, now two years old and run by three lawyers and 20-25 volunteers, provides legal aid and counselling and carries out donation drives for survivors of domestic violence.
“There was a need to address the vacuum that has emerged between domestic violence and the institutions tasked to address it,” said Qureshi.
