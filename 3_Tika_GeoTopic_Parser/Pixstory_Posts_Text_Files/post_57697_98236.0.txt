Over the hundred thousands of years of human existence, we have created numerous natural languages and conlangs(constructed languages consciously devised from some purpose like a work of fiction, example: Klingon from the Start Trek universe and Dothraki from the Game of Thrones, an international auxiliary language and code languages). Floriography is one of those languages, a cryptology based language which which is done using individual and/or an arrangement of the various flowers that exist. Flowers have been attributed with meaning over thousands of years in multiple traditions, literature and art across Europe, Africa and Asia. Its emergence and interest rose in Victorian England and the United States in the 19th century. Floral dictionaries were created with every flower having multiple associations and the Victorians sent "nosegays" or "posys" or "tussie-mussies", which were small bouquets sent as gifts and coded messages saying things in that era what could be said aloud. The meanings were derived from various sources ranging from mythology, the characteristics of the flowers or from hedge-witch lore about their medical and magical properties in the 19th century. Though their use has diminished in the present, the magnificence of a language of flowers cannot be taken away.
