A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolan s own original screenplay Inception is the smartest CGI head trip since The Matrix The premise is so out there it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain so do yourself a favor and pay attention Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb an excavator who digs around in people s subconscious while they re catching some zzzzs This act of infiltration is not strictly legal the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft It s also not a solo operation To do the job properly requires an architect basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamer s defenses down Depending on the complexity of the project it might also require a burglar a chemist and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well timed wake up call In the course of probing his subject s subconscious Cobb escorts him into a dream within a dream within a dream If it s a little disappointing that each level plays out as a straight up action thriller this guy really should get out more the rules of this game are delightfully devious He has a tendency to over complicate but nobody bends time more ingeniously than Nolan Three minutes in one dream might correspond to an hour in the next and both transpire in a matter of seconds up in the real world Gloriously real world physics are refracted in the dream zones gravity just drops out like a faulty signal and if the dreamer starts to stir the universe crumbles The Big One the ultimate Angeleno nightmare It certainly hasn t escaped Nolan s attention that this dream life functions as a metaphor for the movies Ariadne is a production designer Cobb an actor director Extras in the dream ordinary passers by are known as projections and they become hostile if they suspect that someone is messing with their reality Inception only dabbles in the art of perception For all its layering the movie s depth remains on the surface But with its grand clanging Hans Zimmer score its immense dazzling effects and audacious storytelling it s the summer s best bet to bust the blocks
