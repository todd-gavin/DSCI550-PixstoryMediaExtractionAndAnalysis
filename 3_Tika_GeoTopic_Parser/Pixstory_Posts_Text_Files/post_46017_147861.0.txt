The tranquilly and silence that permeate the ocean's depths are becoming more and more disturbed. Undersea life appears to be going on normally at first, but a dreadful secret lies behind this endless calm: the underwater world is disappearing. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the fishing industry is the largest threat to marine species since since 1950, we have taken nearly 6 billion tonnes of fish and other invertebrates out of the seas. According to the United Nations (UN), the loss of marine biodiversity also has detrimental effects on the more than 3 billion people who depend on the richness of the seas and coasts for their livelihoods. Also, fishing fleets that are forced to sail hundreds of kilometres further to cast their nets in more productive waters.As Iberdola says, as a result of these forced migrations, new issues arise, such as the overfishing of other fishing grounds and the escalation of territorial disputes, particularly off the coasts of Africa, Latin America, and south and north-east Asia, the continent with the highest levels of global fishing activity. The depletion of the seas also encourages illegal fishing, which generates 36 billion dollars annually, damages marine ecosystems, and jeopardises food security. This is in addition to the lack of resources in the poorest fleets and the depletion of the seas.
