Ms dhoni 

Ms dhoni the untold story narrates the life story of the indian cricket legend Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Dhoni, known to be the greatest captain of the Indian team has been influential in India’s rise in all three formats. He also became the first captain in the world to win all major ICC trophies. 

The movie shows the life of MSD from his childhood till the time he famously won the Indian team the World Cup in 2011. The movie is a tribute to the once in a lifetime legend. From his early days in Ranchi and being born in a struggling middle class family, MS always had a yearn for playing sports, even though his first love was football, destiny brought him to cricket and we are grateful for that. 

The story takes us into a deep dive about the struggles and problems a middle class boy has to face in order to rise above the ranks of hierarchy, even if he has exceptional talent and how it is the closes mentality of the middle class families that kill more dreams than failure ever would. Dhoni’s decisions at times might have seemed impulsive but they always provided him a good result. 

Ms’s story from scratch portrayed by The late Sushant Singh Rajput in a career defining performance is something that you would want to watch and be inspired from. Ms’s story is everything you need to see the power of bollywood and sports stories.
