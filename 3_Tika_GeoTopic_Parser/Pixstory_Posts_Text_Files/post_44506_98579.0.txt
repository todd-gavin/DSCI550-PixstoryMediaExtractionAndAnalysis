The UK Government will only issue a special license for the club to be sold if none of the proceeds goes to the Russian Billionaire. 

Abramovich officially put Chelsea up for sale in March after 19 years at the helm in response to Russia’s military invasion in Ukraine, and he was subsequently sanctioned by the UK Government. The Russian billionaire said that all proceeds would go to the victims of the war in Ukraine and insisted that he would not be requested repayment on his loans to the Blues, but recent reports have suggested that a restructuring of the deal could see him break his words. 


What has Abramovich said?

Abramovich appointed the investment bank Raine Group to oversee the sale and he is set to have the final say on who buys Chelsea, but the UK Government will only approve a takeover if he is not in line to take any proceeds. 


The 55-year old still insisted that he still has no intention of asking for his loans to be reimbursed and has confirmed that he won’t be profiting from the sale in an official statement on the club’s website. 


“Following speculation in media concerning the sale of Chelsea FC, we would like to clarify the following points.” A spokesperson for Abramovich said. 

“Firstly, Mr Abramovich’s intentions concerning gifting the sale proceeds from the Chelsea sale to charity has not changed.”


“Following sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the UK Government announcing that the club would be sold, the loan has also become subject to EU sanctions, requiring additional approvals.” 


“To be clear Mr Abramovich has no control or access over these funds and will not have any control over the funds after the sale.”
