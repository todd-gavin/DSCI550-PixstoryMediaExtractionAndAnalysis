According to the Premier League statement, the Premier League captains are set to sport Ukraine armbands in the support of Ukraine amidst the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. 

“
We call for peace and our thoughts are with all those who have been impacted.

The 20 club captains will wear special armbands in Ukrainian colours and fans are encouraged to join players, managers, match officials and club staff in a moment of reflection and solidarity before kick-off at each game.”

The Premier League also added that the big board will carry “Football Stands Together”. These texts will be in the backdrop of Blue and Yellow Colours to support the war-torn country. The words will be shown on LED perimeter boards during the game as well. 

Not only the aforementioned two initiatives but the Premier League will also display the message of solidarity across the globe. The digital channels, profiles and logos of the respective clubs will change into the colours of Ukraine during the game. Not only in the UK, but the message of solidarity will be overseas as well. 

The Premier League fraternity has been actively involved in spreading the peace message and imposing sanctions on Russia. The PL game between Manchester United and Watford saw the clubs holding the peace message whereas Everton have suspended all commercial ties with USM Holdings, MegaFon and Yota. The Merseysiders followed the suit of Manchester United, who suspended their sponsorship with Aeroflot. 

Over the weekend, Manchester City are set to take on Manchester United in the Manchester Derby. Manchester United have a top-four race whereas Manchester City will look to keep their hold on the title race with a win. On the other hand, Liverpool will take on West Ham United and look to win to keep their title aspirations intact.
