The Bollywood superstar welcomed fans gathering outside his Mannat home in Mumbai on the occasion of Eid-al-Adha 2022 by stepping out onto his balcony. He had none other than his youngest son, AbRam Khan, with him. Shah Rukh Khan paired his appearance with sunglasses and a white t-shirt paired with jeans.

Outside Mannat, fans could see Shah Rukh and AbRam waving and greeting them. He is also seen endearingly kissing AbRam in one of the pictures.

Shah Rukh Khan, meantime, just celebrated 30 years in Bollywood. He released a character poster for his next movie Pathaan at the time and held a live Instagram session where he spoke with fans and responded to their questions.

When discussing Pathaan, SRK said he had liked the filming, but had not yet had an opportunity to watch the finished product. He referred to the producer Aditya Chopra and the director Siddharth Anand as "kanjoos" for not releasing the movie yet and said that Pathaan provided him with what he had been lacking. Although Pathaan provided him with something different, SRK claimed that he sought a sabbatical after Zero since he was not enjoying the filmmaking process. He even stated that he hopes to use Pathaan to accomplish the reason he travelled to Mumbai.
