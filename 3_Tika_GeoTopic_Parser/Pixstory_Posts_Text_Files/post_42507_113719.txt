After winning UEFA Champions League La Liga and Supercopa de Espana in the season Real Madrid fans are hoping for the same success in coming years and today as a Real Madrid fan I will discuss what s next for Real Madrid and what they can win in season To date Real Madrid offloaded three players which are Marcelo Gareth Bale and Isco and bought two players which are Rudiger Centre Back and Tchouameni Centre Defensive Midfielder and Odriozola Right Back will come back after spending one year at Florentina as a loanee player This means Real Madrid strengthen their defence and midfield and didn t add any player in attack position As per the rumours Luka Jovic Striker Asensio Winger and Mendy Left Back can leave the club if good offers come in front of the Real Madrid table Now I will tell you the players Real Madrid has for each position The list is as follows Goalkeeper Courtois Lunin Left Back Mendy Centre Back Rudiger Nacho Vallejo Militao Alaba Right Back Carvajal Odriozola Vazquez Centre Midfielders Casemiro Tchouameni Modric Kroos Camavinga Valverde Left Winger Eden Hazard Vinicius Strikers Benzema Luka Jovic Mariano Right Winger Asensio Rodrygo Players who can leave the club If Asensio Mendy and Luka Jovic will leave the club then at least Real Madrid has to buy two players for Left Back position and Right Winger position where Alaba can play as a Left But but the team will need a backup for him Talking about the Right wing position Valverde can also on that position as he did last season in the latter part of the season but the Right wing is not a preferred position for Valverde So Real Madrid can do two things in this scenario Either buy a new player for that position or rely on Asensio for one more year which is not a bad option though As a Real Madrid fan I want my team to win La Liga dominate Spain for another year and do well in all other competitions
