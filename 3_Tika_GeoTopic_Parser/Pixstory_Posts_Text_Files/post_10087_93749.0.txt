Dozens of Kabul residents protested in front of Iran's embassy in Kabul on Monday in response to allegations of abuse of Afghan refugees in Iran.

The protesters called on the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to stop the forced deportations of Afghan refugees from Iran.

In a declaration, they urged the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to review the videos showing the alleged harassment and even killing of Afghan refugees in Iran.

“We do not condone the terror perpetrated by the Afghans there (Afghans have been implicated in serious crimes in Iran), but we support those who have been stabbed and mistreated in Iran,” said Mustafa Stanekzai, head of the Foundation for the Positive Change of Youth.

Protesters expressed outrage over the videos that allegedly show harm being done to Afghan refugees in Iran.

“The United Nations Human Rights Council should review the Iranian government's treatment of Afghan refugees and ensure that justice is provided for Afghan victims,” said Abdul Qudus Amani, deputy of the foundation for the Positive Change of Youth.

“It is surprising that the United Nations and human rights groups have been silent about the increasing persecution of Afghan refugees in Iran. Why should Afghans suffer? Why should Afghans always suffer?” said Rayhan Jurat, a member of the Positive Change of Youth Foundation.

"Iran and Iranians! Say no to humiliation and insult!" is the slogan of another group of protesters who reacted to videos posted on social media about the persecution of Afghan refugees.

“It was also proven in the media that an Afghan child was killed in Iran by a punch. Do not Afghans have the right to live in this world? Or live quietly on this earth? We are asking Iran about this cruel behavior,” said Zwak Ghurzang, a protestor.

The broadcast of videos of the persecution of Afghan refugees living in Iran on social media has caused widespread concern and dissatisfaction among the people.
