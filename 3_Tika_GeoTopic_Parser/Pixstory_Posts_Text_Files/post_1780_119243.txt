And of course my last post for this day had to be Kargil Vijay Diwas Kargil war was fought between rd May and th July th July is now celebrated as Kargil Vijay Diwas The last three wars were not of our making Each time we were forced to defend our territory or respond to cross border provocations And we defended our territory with all our might Also through all these wars both the population and leadership of the country exercised admirable restraint There was no whipping of war hysteria India did not cross the line of control and there were no violations of international treaties In the context of the Kargil War I quote G nations supported India and condemned the Pakistani violation of the LOC at the Cologne summit The European Union also opposed Pakistan s violation of the LOC China a long time ally of Pakistan insisted on a pullout of forces to the pre conflict positions along the LOC and settling border issues peacefully Other organisations like the ASEAN Regional Forum too supported India s stand on the inviolability of the LOC The US President applauded Indian restraint for not crossing the LOC and escalating the conflict into an all out war Today in the event of a war or even a skirmish such restraint can t be guaranteed Forget the leadership the mood of the populace is ugly Let s solemnly remember our braveheart heroes especially those who laid their lives down and made the supreme sacrifice for their country At the same time let s hope that there are no more wars Let the undeniable valour of our soldiers be celebrated but let the burden of war be not placed unduly and unnecessarily on their shoulders
