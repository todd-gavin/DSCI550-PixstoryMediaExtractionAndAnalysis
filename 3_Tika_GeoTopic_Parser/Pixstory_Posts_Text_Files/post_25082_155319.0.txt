Arsenal have had a robust start to the season. A key reason behind their recent success has been newly appointed captain Martin Odegaard. The Norwegian has been at his absolute best so far, and there is an evident improvement in all aspects of his game.
Martin Odegaard revealed that he has improved his game when he is off the ball. He feels deeply connected to the project under Mikel Arteta and is happy with the strong start to the campaign. Speaking in the Europa League pre-match press conference, Odegaard spoke about how he has grown as a player.
“I think I’ve developed a lot in the last few years. I’ve always been good on the ball but I feel like I’m developing different sides of my game; without the ball and how to improve and affect the game in different ways," said Odegaard.
“I'm really happy to be part of this team and the project and I’m happy with where we are at the moment, but we want more," he added.
Martin Odegaard has three goals and one assist so far this season, which includes a brace against Bournemouth. The attacking midfielder will look to maintain his form until the FIFA World Cup commences later next month. Norway failed to qualify for the marquee event, hence the Arsenal captain will have enough time to recharge his batteries.
