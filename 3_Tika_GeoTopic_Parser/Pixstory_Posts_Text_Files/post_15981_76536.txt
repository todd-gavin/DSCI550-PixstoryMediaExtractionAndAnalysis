 Plasminogen activator inhibitor mediate downregulation of adiponectin in type diabetes patients with metabolic syndrome Shaik SarfarazNawazKhalidSiddiqui Introduction Metabolic syndrome MetS is a multifactorial disease characterized by metabolic abnormalities Plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI is a key factor of the fibrinolysis its expression is elevated in insulin resistance obesity and MetS In addition an adiponectin produced by adipocytes is also key factor in MetS This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PAI adiponectin levels in MetS Patients and Methods A total of subjects were analyse in this cross sectional study MetS was defined by NCEP ATP III criteria Anthropometric fasting blood glucose HbA c total cholesterol high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein triglycerides PAI and adiponectin were measured Results PAI levels were higher in MetS compared with non MetS In addition adiponectin levels were significantly lower in MetS compared to non MetS Furthermore increased level of PAI corresponds with increase in prevalence of MetS PAI levels were significantly associated with MetS OR CI p Conclusion PAI increases the risk of MetS PAI and adiponectin regulation is useful in assesing the presence and severity of MetS Further pharmacological targeting of PAI studies are necessary for MetS management
