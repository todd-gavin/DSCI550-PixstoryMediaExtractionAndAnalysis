Staying healthy physically is what most people focus on without considering the importance of mental health Since fitness is a trend these days most people choose the gym over yoga But ironically the gym s extraordinary equipment can t help you attain the peace and fitness you actually want Instead using that heavy equipment can tire you as much energy is used On the other hand yoga will always help you completely it s not the physical health it will focus on instead the complete mind body and spirit It can rejuvenate your internal organs and can heal your mind from the most treacherous times Unlike the gym it will not make you work tirelessly even affecting your health Yoga focuses on spiritual enlightenment and broadens your emotional awareness As a result you feel more in tune with your emotions and grasp what mindfulness is I ll always choose yoga over the gym if it s about my complete well being
