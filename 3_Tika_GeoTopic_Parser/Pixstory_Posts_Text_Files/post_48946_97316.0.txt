“I’m convinced he would win another Oscar for playing Josh, the Navy whistleblower who risked a court-martial to get help for a little dog about to die in a deep-sea diving experiment and who then went on to lead the West Coast Animal Liberation Front teams that freed many more animals who faced certain death,” Newkirk told The Hollywood Reporter. “Joaquin understands what animals go through and lives and breathes animal rights—it’s part of his very being.”

Actor and Vegan activist, Joaquin Phoenix, recently acquired the film rights to Free the Animals: The Amazing, True Story of the Animal Liberation Front in North America, a book written by Ingrid Newkirk, president of the animal-rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, in 1992. (PETA). The book is based on the true story of "Valerie," a Maryland police officer who meets a group of activists who are releasing animals from experimental labs and decides to join them in their campaign to prevent animal cruelty. Several high-profile persons approached Newkirk about buying the film rights to her novel, but she chose Phoenix because of their similar commitment to the animal rights movement.

“Yes, Free the Animals is about the balaclava-wearing heroes who break windows and laws to save animals, but it’s also about everyone. It’s a call to us all to take action,” Phoenix writes in the new forward. “Whether it’s wielding crowbars and bolt-cutters or picking up a pen or a protest sign, every one of us can and must fight injustice and push for animal liberation every chance we get.”

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Phoenix is making no bones about his desire for a potential movie based on the work to inspire a new wave of radicalized, even militant, animal activism.
