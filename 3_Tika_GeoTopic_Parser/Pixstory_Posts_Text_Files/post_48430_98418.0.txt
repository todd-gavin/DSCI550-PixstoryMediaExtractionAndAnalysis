If Roe v/s Wade were overturned, how long could the debate last, people would find other ways to proceed with abortions. Hence overturning Roe v/s Jade won't be practical. Now, women can attain abortions through medication up to 10 weeks into pregnancy. As it is not currently legal for such medication to be allocated by mail, if that were to change, there might be zero way to deter a woman in any state from receiving a bill in the mail in a nondescript envelope. Nineteen states have already banned receiving pills in the mail and another nine states are considering it, according to the New York Times. 

This would only work if a woman knew she was pregnant before 10 weeks, knew about the pill, and could get it in time. But what if a different pill were developed that allowed women to manage their abortions even after 10 weeks? The possibility can't be ignored. This is would be a great opportunity for pharmaceutical companies and scientists! Hence action forward might be more centred in the science community than in politics. But don't forget the struggle a woman has to go through to do what they want. Wait for all the capitalists and politicians to get into their senses! 

Let's not give up hopes. There is something Democrats can actually do. A bill to make abortion access legal nationwide has already passed the House. It is sitting in the Senate, where it is currently dormant because of the filibuster.

Should Democrats decide this is the moment, and thus vote to legalize abortion. President Joe Biden would sign that bill into law.
But Democrats said they needed to crack the filibuster on all kinds of issues in the past year. In a 50-50 Senate, every Democrat (and Vice President Kamala Harris) would have to decide to break the filibuster. Will they do that? It's time to witness some real faces in politics!
