 In the coolest mix ups of all time yet Hollow Knight is now meeting Bloodborne in indie developer Mongoose Rodeo s new game Crowsworn Imitation is the greatest form of flattery as they say and it could not hold any more true here Featuring a hub area a suite of unlockable moves that aid in both combat and environment traversal and a dark gothic art style Crowsworn really seems to bring that Bloodborne influence home while having the same feel and looks as Hollow Knight to the point it could be mistaken for a sequel at first glance Crowsworn s new trailer as part of its Kickstarter anniversary showcased a lot of new footage which included new areas enemies bosses and gameplay mechanics There were also a pair of beautifully unsettling animated cutscenes both at the start and at end of it Taking place in the forsaken kingdom of Fearanndal players must work to unravel an intricately connected world and decipher a self described Dark Souls like story while coming to grips with an intricate move set and a parade of more than thirty boss encounters For most part Crowsworn seems to borrow elements directly from Hollow Knight though it differs in one key area and that is the use of ranged attacks While ranged attacks were possible in Hollow Knight they weren t especially common and required the use of unique charms In Crowsworn players can wield a pair of duel handguns and use them for both attack and defence in pure Bloodborne fashion Crowsworn looks like a highly interesting game though it currently does not have a concrete release date which has yet to be announced and the title may run the risk of being overshadowed by the long anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong
