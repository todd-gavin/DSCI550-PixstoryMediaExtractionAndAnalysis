The first new monarch in 70 years was installed as the head of state of Australia on Sunday: King Charles III. The announcement was made by Governor-General of Australia David Hurley at Canberra's national capitol. There will also be a number of proclamation ceremonies held at state legislatures across the nation, according to CNN.On September 22, when Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has returned from Britain, where he will attend the Queen's burial, a national day of remembering will be conducted. On that day, which has been designated a one-time public holiday, a memorial service will also be held.The Siasat Daily reported that as head of state, Queen Elizabeth II visited Australia 16 times.“From her famous first trip to Australia, the only reigning sovereign to ever visit, it was clear Her Majesty held a special place in her heart for Australia,” Albanese said in a statement Friday.“Fifteen more tours before cheering crowds in every part of our country confirmed the special place she held in ours,” added Albanese.Interestingly, in 1999 Australia held a referendum on whether to remove the Queen as head of state, but it was defeated, reported CNN.
