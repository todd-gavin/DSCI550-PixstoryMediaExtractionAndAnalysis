After 15 years with the Leone Stars, Sierra Leone's Kei Kamara has declared his retirement
from international football. The striker earned his first cap for the West Africans in 2008, and he
went on to make 39 appearances for the team, scoring seven goals.

His last appearance for his country occurred on January 20, 2022, in a 1-0 loss to Equatorial
Guinea at Stade Omnisport de Limbe during the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.

“Fifteen years ago, I decided to wear the Green, White, and Blue, and represent you on the
international stage. I never knew what the journey would bring me, but I tell you, I would do it all
over again if I had the chance,” Kamara wrote on Twitter.

“Today, I am finally hanging up my international jersey to focus on my club career.

Now, when
those international breaks come, I will spend the time with my family, but I will always miss the
games at Siaka Stevens Stadium.

After a conflict with coach Sellas Tetteh,Kamara announced his retirement from Sierra Leone in
November 2019. He made his comeback two years later, scoring against Benin Republic on
June 12, 2021, to assist the country qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time since
1996.

The lanky attacker started all three-group stage matches for the Leone Stars, who drew 0-0
against Algeria, drew 2-2 with Cote d'Ivoire, and lost 1-0 to Equatorial Guinea. 

However, he was
the centre of attention after the team's loss to the Nzalang Nacional, as he missed a penalty kick
that would have put the team in the Round of 16 if the game had finished in a draw.

In the 85th minute, the Leone Stars were granted a penalty, but Kamara's feeble attempt was
saved by goalkeeper Jesus Owono. Fans in his own nation were enraged by the occurrence,
and attempted to set fire to his house. Kamara, the fifth-best goalscorer in Major Soccer League
history, will now concentrate on assisting CF Montreal.
