Finally unveiling its official trailer Amazon Prime s multi million dollar series The Lord Of The Rings Rings of Power is releasing on September of this fall Taking place in the Second Age of Middle Earth the series takes place thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings covering events such as the Fall of Numenor the forging of the Rings of Power and the formation of the Last Alliance There s a lot going on in this trailer there are shots of Numenor Human homes of what will eventually become Gondor and the other Kingdoms in the world of Men the Dwarven underground mining empires and the occasional halfling What is made clear is that dark threats of the First Age to the world of all races once thought vanquished are making a return And of course there is a brilliant rendition of a Balrog which looks just like the one from Fellowship Of The Ring The official synopsis of the series reads Beginning in a time of relative peace the series follows an ensemble cast of characters both familiar and new as they confront the long feared re emergence of evil to Middle earth From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains to the majestic forests of the elf capital of Lindon to the breathtaking island kingdom of N menor to the furthest reaches of the map these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone Unfortunately the trailer seems to have been inspired a lot more from Game Of Thrones and The Witcher rather than any of Tolkien s texts for it certainly does not resemble The Silmarillion lacking in Tolkien s vision mythos lore and themes Though undoubtedly boasting stellar visuals and production the show will fall entirely to the writing which will either make it or break it
