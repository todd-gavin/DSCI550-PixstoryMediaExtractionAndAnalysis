According to recent reports, Paul Pogba is all set to leave his current employer Manchester United at the end of the season.

The player had a contract on his table but had not signed at the moment. Paul Pogba is injured at the moment and might not return before the end of the season.

The ardent followers of the game believe that the player should not have joined Manchester 
United from Juventus in 2016. Were both Paul Pogba and Manchester United wrong in the 
deal? There are both answers for the question.

The answer is based on the agenda that you 
have against the player or the club.

Paul Pogba joined Manchester United when Jose Mourinho took charge of the club. The player had 9 G/A to his name and was pivotal in winning the UEFA Europa League. The number 
continued to rise 16 G/A, 22 G/A in the next two seasons. When it was believed that he was 
finally going to be unleashed, things fell apart.

He ended the next season with 4 G/A and 6 G/A.

The injuries marred his 2019/20 and 2020/21 season. In the ongoing season, he has 10 G/A 
and might end up there.
