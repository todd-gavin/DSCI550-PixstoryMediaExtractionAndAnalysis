Klay Thompson capped his 33-point performance with three late 3-pointers as Golden State Warriors outlasted Los Angeles Lakers 117-115 on Saturday night in San Francisco.

LeBron James couldn’t take advantage of three free throws that could have tied the game in the final seconds for the Lakers. Seeking to end a two-game losing streak, the Lakers blew a late six-point lead, then got a final chance to tie when, down 117-114, James was fouled while attempting a 3-pointer with 2.4 seconds left.

But James, who began the game hitting 75.3 percent from the foul line and had missed two of his first six of the night from the line, failed to convert the first of his three before making the second. The veteran intentionally missed the third, and when the Warriors slapped the ball away from the basket, the Lakers never got another shot.

Thompson, who scored 10 more points than he had in a game after his late start this season, went 5-for-9 on 3-pointers.

Nuggets 110, Raptors 109

Nikola Jokic had 28 points, 15 rebounds and a game-saving block on OG Anunoby in the final second, and Denver ended host Toronto’s winning streak at eight games. Jeff Green scored 19 points, Aaron Gordon had 13, Bones Hyland finished with 11 and Will Barton added 10 for Denver.

Pascal Siakam scored a game-high 35 points and added 10 rebounds, Fred VanVleet had 25 points, Scottie Barnes scored 17 and Gary Trent Jr. 11 for the Raptors.

Suns 132, Magic 105

Chris Paul posted his 30th double-double of the season and Devin Booker scored 26 points, leading host Phoenix past Orlando for its fifth straight win. Paul, who two days earlier became the 31st player in NBA history to reach 500 career double-doubles, dished out 10 of his 15 assists in the first half as the Suns built a 67-53 lead. He also finished with 10 points on 4-of-11 shooting.

Magic rookie Jalen Suggs recorded his first career double-double with 20 points and a career-best 10 assists. Suggs also pulled down six rebounds.
