According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a potentially catastrophic large asteroid will fly past Earth at a speed of 37,400 kilometres per hour on Thursday, May 5. (NASA). According to NASA's Centre for Near Earth Object Studies, the asteroid, known as 418135 (2008 AG33), has a diameter of 350 to 780 metres (CNEOS). 

Official reports say that any space object that approaches within 193 million kilometres of Earth is classified as a "near-Earth object" (NEO), and any fast-moving object within 7.5 million kilometres is classified as "possibly hazardous" by NASA. 

According to the Centre, as they orbit the Sun, NEOs may pass close to Earth on occasion. However, it explained that astronomically, a "near" passage can be millions or even tens of millions of kilometres away in human terms.

As a result, astroid 418135 is likely to pass Earth without colliding, according to Live Science. The asteroid will reach within 3.2 million kilometres of Earth at its closest point, travelling at more than 30 times the speed of sound, which is nearly eight times the normal distance between Earth and the Moon.
