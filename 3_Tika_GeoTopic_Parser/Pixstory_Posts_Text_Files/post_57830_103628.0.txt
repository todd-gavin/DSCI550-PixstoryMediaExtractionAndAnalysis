An old classic that brings nostalgia whenever you see or remember it, Winnie the Pooh actually deals with an array of mental health issues. Each of its characters represents a different thing that we might be struggling with like, eating disorder, ADHD, anxiety, depression, OCD and a couple more. Apart from its distinct idea of a boy escaping into an enhanced fantasial forest where he has animal friends to go on adventures with, these specific wide range of mental health disorders are very important since this Cartoon has been seen by and touched the hearts of many. It shows how you can live in various types of lives and how where you're compulsions lie and what you're afraid of don't have to control your every step in life. You can be used to doing things a certain way so different from the majority and yet you'll still be living a happy and peaceful if you're doing what makes you so. You don't have to fit in, or be brave the whole time or keep yourself in check always, that's not the universe works actually. There's a balance in everything, to attain which different things keep happening. There is no specific routine or perfection to be attained, what is to be done is your best, by giving it your all. Somedays can be bad, be slow and weak but that doesn't make you bad, slow or weak. You just have to live your best life, taking it easy, doing it calmly and what makes you happy. So many obstacles, mental and physical will and do stand before us, conquering them is not some valiant achievement, but it is a grateful recognition of a chance at living a beautiful life. Be aware of such obstacles by introspection and seeking help when you feel like you don't want to do it on your own, people around the globe know and accept these challenges and are ready to help you, just like Winnie and his friends and Christpoher Robin.
