Introduction The COVID pandemic disproportionately affected patients who had comorbid diabetes mellitus COVID patients with diabetes experience significantly higher rates of complications and mortality COVID induced diabetes is a novel phenomenon observed in critically ill patients The aims of this review were to explore the literature about COVID induced diabetes and the pathophysiological mechanisms that could lead to this novel presentation Methods A literature search was performed using PUBMED Google Scholar MEDLINE and Embase for original studies meta analyses cross sectional studies case series case reports about new onset diabetes following COVID infection and the proposed biochemical pathways behind this presentation It was assumed that the authors of the studies used the current diagnostic criteria for diagnosis of type and type diabetes Results COVID causes dysregulation of glucose homeostasis leading to new onset diabetes and hyperglycaemia This is also seen in patients with no previous risk factors for diabetes mellitus The atypical glycaemic parameters and increased rates of DKA suggest that COVID induced diabetes is a novel form of diabetes A spectrum of COVID induced diabetes has also been noted COVID induced diabetes is associated with remarkably higher mortality rates and worse outcomes compared to COVID patients with pre existing diabetes The novel presentation of COVID induced diabetes could be due to beta cell damage and insulin resistance caused by SARS CoV Conclusion COVID induced diabetes is essential to detect early owing to its implications on prognosis Further studies must include follow up of these patients to better understand the trajectory of COVID induced diabetes and the best management plan It is also important to assess the beta cell function and insulin resistance of COVID induced diabetes patients over time to better understand the underlying biochemical mechanisms Keywords COVID Diabetes mellitusSARS CoV PathogenesisBeta cellsInsulin resistance Source
