As per FanSided, Real Madrid could lose out on their famed defensive midfielder in the summer. Casemiro has reportedly drawn interest from at least three European clubs before the summer transfer window. 

According to the report, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring the midfielder. To add to this, a third unnamed "Premier League giant" is also hot on the heels of the 30-year-old. 

Manchester City, Manchester United, and Liverpool are all on the lookout for a defensive midfielder in the summer. Hence, any of these clubs could be the potential third suitor for the Brazil international. 

Casemiro has been part of the Real Madrid set-up since the 2012/2013 season. Over the years, the Brazilian midfielder has played 330+ games for the Spanish giants in all competitions. Owing to his prowess, the 30-year-old has also made 65 appearances for the Brazilian national team.

Casemiro has had a decorated career with Real Madrid over the years. The midfielder has won four Champions Leagues, three LaLiga titles, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles among others. Hence he would certainly go down as one of the best midfielders in the club's history. 

 


Will Florentino Perez let Casemiro leave? 

As per reports, Los Blancos have no interest in letting Casemiro leave at the moment. The midfielder has started 30 LaLiga games this season and is an integral part of the side. 

Other clubs could try and entice Casemiro for a possible transfer. But it is unlikely that even the Brazilian would want to leave at the moment as he seems very happy at Real Madrid currently. 

But with Los Blancos being linked with Aurélien Tchouaméni in the summer, Casemiro's game time could drastically reduce. Hence the Brazilian could consider leaving if the deal between Real Madrid and Aurélien Tchouaméni goes through.
