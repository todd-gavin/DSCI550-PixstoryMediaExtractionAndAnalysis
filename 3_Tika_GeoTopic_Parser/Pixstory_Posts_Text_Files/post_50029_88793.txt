I HEAR America singing the varied carols I hear Those of mechanics each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam The mason singing his as he makes ready for work or leaves off work The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat the deck hand singing on the steamboat deck The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench the hatter singing as he stands The wood cutter s song the ploughboy s on his way in the morn ing or at noon intermission or at sundown The delicious singing of the mother or of the young wife at work or of the girl sewing or washing Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else The day what belongs to the day at night the party of young fellows robust friendly Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs I Hear America Singing is a poem on America by Walt Whitman from his Anthology Leaves of Grass published in The poem represents the vision of Whitman s America The poetry emphasises how America stands united despite its varied carols different kinds of people Whitman celebrates different professions which vary from land to sea into households He asserts that the individuality among the unity of the nations The poem is a reaction against formalism and its rules as Whitman breaks all the traditional expectations of poetry through this poem
