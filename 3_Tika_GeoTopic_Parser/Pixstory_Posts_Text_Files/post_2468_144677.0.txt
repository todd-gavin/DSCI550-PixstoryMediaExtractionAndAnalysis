Todi Ragiņi in Hindustani Classical Music is a melancholy Ragiņi, whose paintings reflect the loneliness of the heroine; yet, it is popular with both musicians and painters. Tōdi Ragini is generally depicted by a solitary nayika wandering through the forest playing her veena and attracting the deer. In the images Hare and deer listen quietly as a pair of birds fly above in a cloudy blue sky.Tradition holds that it was originally a song sung by young girls to lure deer and keep them from foraging in the village fields."Divided from her darling and most unhappy in love, like a nun renouncing the world, Tōḍi abides in the grove and charms the hearts of the does".The Miniatures reflect various moods of the Raagini
