The international commitments of our Juventus players continue, and last night it was the turn of Alvaro Morata who was in the starting line-up for Spain in the all-Iberian "derby" against Portugal in the Nations League. It took just 25 minutes for Morata to net the opener before he was eventually substituted after 70 minutes, as Ricardo Horta scored an equaliser with eight minutes to go as the match ended 1-1.
