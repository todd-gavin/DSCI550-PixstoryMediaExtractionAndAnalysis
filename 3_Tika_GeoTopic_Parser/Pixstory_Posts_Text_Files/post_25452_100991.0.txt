One of my favourite sport to watch on TV is swimming, freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, medley relay, all of them.
It happens so fast that it is fascinating, I also started swimming recently, well technically not recently, but a couple years back.. I can't do all the styles, just freestyle but I'd love to learn all of them if I ever get the chance too and I've realised that I'm a water baby.
So, I just love watching swimming, especially in winters when I can't go swimming here where I live because there aren't any indoor/closed pools here.
But I might get the chance in Delhi, fingers crossed. ðŸ¤ž
