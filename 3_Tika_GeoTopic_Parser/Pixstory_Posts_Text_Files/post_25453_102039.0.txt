When I look at these guys I can't decide eho I love more, the hero? Or the villan?
"IF VILLAN THEN WHY SO HOT?" Was my literal reaction after watching Sukuna on screen.
No doubt, Gojo was the one who got me into anime and this one in particular, yes, jujutsu kaisen was my first one and I started watching it because of the fight he has in ep1, I saw it on billy han's reels on Instagram. Only 2 episodes were out that time in November 2020.
But I continue watching it because of Sukuna, and I'll really say, can't get enough!! And fun fact: None of them are the protagonists and still they are the ones who brought in the most audience.
Who do you gravitate towards? Mr. Captivating eyes or Mr. Heavenly tattoos?
