Former Arsenal favourite Kevin Campbell has touted Arsenal to sign two new strikers going into the season Despite Nketiah s putting pen to paper on a new deal the former Arsenal man is insisting on Mikel Arteta s summer plans of signing two new forwards Arsenal have been linked to a variety of strikers this season with the list containing players such as Man City s Gabriel Jesus AS Roma s Tammy Abraham and Everton s Dominic Calvert Lewin It is unlikely that Nketiah would start for Arsenal this season He seems set to continue in his role as a squad player for the club Speaking to Football Insider exclusively Kevin had to say I think they will sign two more on top of that The way Arsenal will do it is by signing one striker and a forward who can play wide or central Maybe Eddie Jesus and another striker sign I would like to see a taller striker come in Somebody who has a bit of size and presence It is their money they will do what they feel is right One thing I do know is that Nketiah is not being offered a new deal to be a regular starter next season That is why I think two more could come in Arsenal seem to be leading the race for Gabriel Jesus ahead of arch rivals Tottenham but Tottenham will be able to provide the opportunity to Gabriel Jesus to play alongside world class forwards Son and Kane in the Champions League The Gunners on the other hand will point at a young team growing together to compete for the highest honors soon and more assured gametime for Jesus It would be an interesting season to see where Jesus ends up
