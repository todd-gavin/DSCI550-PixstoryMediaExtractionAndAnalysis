He has a keen eye for goals as in Superliga he has contributed 6 goals and 2 goals in Libertadores. He has lethal vision as he likes to shoot from a distance. He has taken a total of 7 shots out of which 3 were on target. He has a total of 2.4 (including both the tournaments) per 90 out of which he has converted 0.6 of them.

From the above, we can see that he has scored 2 goals inside the six yards box. From above, we can see that he had made a few shots from distance but he was unlucky because those shots either hit the frame or were parried away by the goalkeeper or it was a shot that went wide.Â 

We can see that his expected threat is mostly down in the middle of the park. He ranks 2.8 per 90 in the expected threat.

Enzo is another midfielder who is linked to Manchester United along with almost all the players who are linked with the Red Devils. Everyone knows that Man United needs to revamp their first eleven and they are in dire need of a midfielder. United sent scouts to Buenos Aires to watch him in action against Fortaleza, and they were impressed with what they saw. Enzo scored the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Fortaleza. United are looking for that kind of midfielder who also contributes to scoring goals.


United are not the only team Enzo has been linked with, as per rumors, he is also linked with Premier League champions Manchester City who are looking to replace the veteran Fernandinho who declined the proposal to stay at City and is opting for a move to Brazil. Real Madrid is also after him as they are looking for midfield reinforcement. Arsenal, if they make it to the Champions League spot, would require reinforcements, and they have identified him as the man to replace Granit Xhaka who might leave the Emirates this summer.

Will Enzo make his move to United, City or Real Madrid or Arsenal remains to be seen.
