Mock heroic epics refer to parodic or satire that mocks common Classical stereotypes of heroes and heroic literature. Typically, mock-heroic works either put a joke in the role of the hero or overstate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

After the translation of Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes, English authors started to imitate the exaggerated language of Romance poetry and narrative to interpret misguided or common characters. The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the picaresque, burlesque, and the satirical poem is the comic poem Hudibras, by Samuel Butler. 

Poet Laureate John Dryden is responsible for some of the preeminence among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era. While Dryden's plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroic.
