Brazilian youngster Vinicius Jr is undoubtedly one of the best wingers in the world right now.

He had a breakthrough season in 2021/22 for Real Madrid and it was his goal in the UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid that won the Los Blancos their 14th title.

Vini scored 22 goals and provided 16 assists across all tournaments last season which speaks heaps and bounds about the massive improvement he has seen in his performances lately. It would be safe to say that he was one of the keymost players in Real Madrid illustrious 2021/22 season.

However, one of the prime concerns of Real Madrid fans regarding their much loved youngster is that his contract terminates in 2024 and given that rich suitors like PSG are on the lookout for him is kind of unnerving for them, especially after the whole Kylian Mbappe saga. Luckily, Vinicius Jr is a loyal fan of the La Casa Blanca and thus he was quick to refuse an outrageous €40 Million salary offer by PSG last summer. He has made it very clear that he will definitely be staying at the Real Madrid.

Talking about the renewal of Vinicius Jr, Fabrizio Romano said on his Podcast ‘Here We Go’ - “New contracts as we know, Vinicius Jr, we said long time ago - New contract till 2027 for Vinicius Jr to be signed by Real Madrid in the coming days. The Brazilian boys of Madrid will stay for long time because Rodrygo and Eder Militao will sign till 2028. Let me mention that all these players will have a release clause for €1 BIllion.”

Real Madrid signed Brazilian wonderkid Vinicius Jr from Flamengo in 2018 for a national record price of £38 Million when he was not even fully 18. He might not have had much of an impact in his first few seasons at the club but last season he was simply unstoppable and it might be considered as the start of a new beginning for the Brazilian.
