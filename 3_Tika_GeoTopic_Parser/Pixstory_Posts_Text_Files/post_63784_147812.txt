Diablo has been a long time in the making with Blizzard announcing the project all the way back in and keeping it mostly under wraps A few details have recently been brought into light by Blizzard including the build of the Necromancer which has been received favourably Unfortunately for Blizzard however minutes of gameplay footage has been leaked over the weekend in contrast to its plans Reddit user iV rus noticed the videos had been uploaded via a file sharing link Spread across two videos one five minutes long the other clocking minutes the footage appears to be from a Discord stream as evidenced by its signature text notification sounds popping off in the background While the leaked footage does not come from a final build it does show a high degree of polish The user interface is improved the combat seems visceral and Blizzard has introduced new ways to explore the world through climbing while the top down camera perspective remains in place The verticality of the design and vastness of the world make a potent combination that makes it more dynamic than before It is currently unclear just how the person obtained access to the game one theory being shared is that it may be related to the friends and family alpha test which has been going on since last month indicating that it may possibly be a Blizzard employee As of now it is unknown just what stage the development of the game is currently at but the leaks have given several models within the game world remain largely incomplete meaning that the game is still well under development and much needs to be finished Even so the visuals already look incredibly polished meaning that Diablo is going to bring in a lot of aesthetic and visual refinement
