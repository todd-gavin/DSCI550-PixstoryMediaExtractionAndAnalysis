Hurricane Ian strengthened as it headed for Florida and was on track to bring a powerful storm surge and flooding rainfall to large parts of the state this week. National Hurricane Center Acting Director Jamie Rhome told CNN that if the storm slowed significantly near Tampa, under the current forecast, it could be “a near worst case” scenario for the region. Several areas were under evacuation orders.After a slow start to the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Ian formed in ideal conditions, with minimal vertical wind shear, which can tear apart a storm, and warm ocean surface waters providing fuel.Forecasters expect Ian to become a major hurricane – Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, meaning winds over 110 mph – before crossing western Cuba on Tuesday. Its winds could weaken before landfall in the U.S., but the scale doesn’t take water risk into account, and flooding and storm surge are both major risks fromAs a meteorologist living in Florida, I study tropical storms and hurricanes. Here are three reasons Florida’s Gulf Coast is facing a high risk of water hazards this week.Tropical systems are not perfectly symmetrical systems – one side is typically larger. With Ian tracking up the west coast of Florida, the peninsula is expected to be on the “wet” side of the storm. The part of the storm east of the center of circulation generally has more cloud cover and more rain.The most dangerous side of the storm is its upper right quadrant.While Ian travels up the Florida coast, these outer bands will stretch over much of the peninsula and produce heavy rain for many locations, beginning as early as Monday night for South Florida and late Wednesday for northern parts of the state.Some weather models are forecasting 10 inches or more of rain in the region where the storm makes landfall.
