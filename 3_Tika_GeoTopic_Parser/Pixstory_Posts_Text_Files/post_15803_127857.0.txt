The ban slapped by FIFA, the governing body of world football, on India, has come as a shock for the fans as well as the government of India. The Narendra Modi government, for the past few months, was truly gearing up for hosting the Under-17 World Cup for women, but the ban has completely jeopardised the plan. Unless the ban is lifted, the tournament will certainly be moved out of India. It will be a big setback for the under-17 Indian team, who as the hosts, were looking forward to play the maiden World Cup.
But the World Cup is only happening in October. Very few are aware of the fact that there are another set of girls, who are finding themselves in deep trouble because of the sudden ban of Indian football by FIFA. The Gokulam Kerala FC team has landed in Uzbekistan for the AFC Women’s Club Championship, starting on August 20. Though the team have been accommodated in a hotel in Tashkent, it is still not clear whether they will be allowed to play.  
If the FIFA ban continues and is not lifted soon, then another casualty could be ATK Mohun Bagan, who are supposed to play its AFC Cup Inter-Zonal semi-finals on September 7. A look at the AFC website will show that ATKMB's name currently doesn’t feature among eight clubs in the play-offs.
In the men’s national team front, the two friendly internationals against Vietnam (September 24) and Singapore (September 27) will stand cancelled if the ban is not revoked at the earliest. India, who won the U-20 SAFF Cup recently, is due to play the AFC U-20 Qualifiers in Iraq. India are clubbed in a very tough group with hosts Iraq, Australia and Kuwait. The matches are slated for September 14 (Iraq), 16 (Australia) and 18 (Kuwait), respectively, at the Iraqi city of Basra, but may not be played if the ban continues. Overall, Indian footballers, both men and women, are set to suffer a lot because of the FIFA punishment.
