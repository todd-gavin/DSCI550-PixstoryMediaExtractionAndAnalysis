An emergency contraceptive pill (also called the Morning-After Pill) is taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex or a birth control failure. It helps prevent an unintended pregnancy! The ECP cannot stop a pregnancy that has already taken place! So if your pregnancy test is positive, your doctor may prescribe you an abortion pill, which is different from the ECP.

If you find yourself having to take the Morning-After Pill, you may be relieved to know that the common side effects of emergency contraceptive pills are not serious or long lasting. The long term side effects of emergency contraceptive pills are generally not something to worry about! 

Emergency contraceptive pills (ECP) are generally safe for almost every woman. Emergency contraceptive pills have not been found to have any serious or long-term side effects. It may have some side effects which are usually temporary and nothing to stress about. This includes nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, lower abdominal pain or cramps, tender breasts, spotting (i.e very slight vaginal bleeding) between periods, irregular or heavy menstruation, etc. All these possible side effects of ECPs will get resolved in a few days or weeks.

However, it’s never a good idea to rely on the emergency birth control pills as a substitute for your regular contraceptive method – be it condoms, pills, an Intrauterine Device (IUD) and so on. The fact is that the dose of hormones in the ECP is significantly more than something intended for daily use like the daily oral contraceptive pill (birth control pills). As a result, people who overuse ECPs may see their menstrual cycle getting affected – their periods may not resume normally. They may also observe weight gain and so on. ECPs are not recommended as a long term contraception options, or as a replacement to standard birth control.
