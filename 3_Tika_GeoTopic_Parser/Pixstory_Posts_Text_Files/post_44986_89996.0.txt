While some of Manchester City's acquisitions have proven to be fruitful, others have proven to be disastrous. Some of the players signed after the Abu Dhabi acquisition have been disappointing to say the least.

On that topic, let's take a look at some of the worst signings made by City since their Abu Dhabi takeover:

Wilfried Bony

Wilfried Bony earned his name in the Premier League while playing for Swansea City from 2013 to 2015. In 54 games during those two seasons, he scored 25 league goals.

Manchester City recruited the Ivorian striker in the winter of 2015 after noticing this. He was signed to play as Sergio Aguero's backup. Bony's decision was surprising, given that he might have featured regularly for Swansea City.

Bony was loaned out to Stoke City when Pep Guardiola took over in 2016. He was sold back to Swansea City at the end of his season-long loan. For all parties concerned, signing Wilfried Bony for Manchester City was a complete waste of time, money, and effort.

Eliaquim Mangala

In 2011, Eliaquim Mangala joined Porto, a Portuguese club. With his performances there, he impressed Manchester City, and a move was almost completed in the winter transfer window of 2012. The trade fell through due to Porto's high valuation of the defender.

With all the attention on him, Mangala did himself no favours in the Premier League by being reckless and needlessly aggressive. Despite the fact that then-Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini gave him enough of opportunities, the former Porto defender was unable to settle in and justify his big-money move.
