I have to admit, post covid it takes me longest to finish a book . I somehow thought I can’t concentrate and the focus also .  I almost started after the booker was announced, read a few pages and than it was lying around, in my bag, on the tables, everywhere. Till early this week I found the thread and than it didn’t take long, a few metro rides up and down and a little reading in the evening, I could finish it. 
I found the thread, the little old woman, her daughter, her cane. 
The woman so little that she could slip to anywhere, even across the border without visa. A woman who went on a search for an old lover, infact husband across the border. A woman split into two by partition. A woman who still had yearning for her first love while she raised another family, embraced another religion.  Separated by border and boundaries which must have played in every aspect of her life. 
A woman who might have many times been torn between these borders . A woman who would have silently peeked into her life of love while she continued to struggle with destiny. A woman who for the large part of the book is not even visible but she is also omnipresent at the same time. 
Tomb of Sand has a few characters, some
Living some non living , some
Human some non human. It’s about a family, about a maa and beti, about a son infact many sons. It is about a cane and a crow. A partridge also. 
It’s about houses, homes, relationships and countries . Two countries who have come out of one womb . The siblings who have inflicted pain and more pain on each other. The Indias and the Pakistans. 
Written by Geetanjali Shree and translated by Daisy Rockwell, read this one for its gripping storyline, the language, the nuances, the perspectives. The attempt to look deeper into simple lives. The small hints on whatever ails India now, the modern day emperors and their Subjects.  
A must read
