Ethnic differences in pharmacogenomic variants have been well documented in the literature and could significantly impact variability in response and adverse events to therapeutics India is a large country with diverse ethnic populations of distinct genetic architecture India s national genome sequencing initiative IndiGen provides a unique opportunity to explore the landscape of pharmacogenomic variants using population scale whole genome sequences The IndiGen program funded by the Scientific and Industrial Research Council CSIR aims to perform a complete genomic sequence of Indians representing different ethnic groups in India The scientists from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology CSIR IGIB Delhi led by Sridhar Sivasubbu and Vinod Scaria sequenced the first Indian genome and an announcement to this effect was made on December The same IndiGen team at CSIR IGIB led by Sridhar Sivasubbu and Vinod Scaria have come out with another landmark event in Indian scientific history In a recent study published in the journal Clinical and Translational Science the team have analyzed the IndiGen variation dataset along with global population scale databases to map the most prevalent clinically actionable and potentially deleterious pharmacogenomic variants among Indians Read my article in The Statesman
