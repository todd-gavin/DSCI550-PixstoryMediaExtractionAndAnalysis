The seven Barcelona players on the shot-list stoppers did not include the Argentina legend.
Marc-Andre ter Stegen has picked his ideal XI, which includes current and former teammates but excludes Lionel Messi.

During his tenure with Borussia Monchengladbach, Barcelona, and Germany, the goalie has played alongside a number of outstanding players.

With so many huge names to pick from, Ter Stegen has put up a strong XI, but he has left out the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner.

What's been said so far?

Ter Stegen chose a 4-4-2 diamond formation for his team and named seven former or present Barcelona players.

Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, and Frenkie de Jong were all selected.
Messi, Neymar, and Luis Suarez, on the other hand, were all passed over by the 29-year-old.

Goalkeeper Janis Blaswich, Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger, and Germany teammates Marco Reus and Mario Gotze have all been picked to the squad.

Blaswich; Alves, Pique, Rudiger, Alba; Busquets; Xavi, Iniesta; De Jong; Reus, Gotze are the full XI.

Why was Messi left out by Ter Stegen?

When listing his team, Ter Stegen did not mention his old teammate and did not explain why he did not make the cut.

When it was revealed that Messi had left Camp Nou, the shot-stopper sent a farewell message on Instagram, implying that the duo did not always get along.

He wrote in the caption: "Although from time to time we did not share the same opinion, we always went in the same direction and each of us grew as a person regardless of winning or losing."
