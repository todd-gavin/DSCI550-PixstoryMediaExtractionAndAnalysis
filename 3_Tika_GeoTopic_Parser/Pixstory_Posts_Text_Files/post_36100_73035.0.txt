I would be posting some old advertisements. Please tell me how many of you have seen these or heard of such products. 

The first one is of Charminar cigarettes. The brand was very popular among chain smokers. Have you heard of it and from how and whom, do post a note.

The ad features actor Jackie Shroff. 

Here are some links of articles about the Charminar brand.
