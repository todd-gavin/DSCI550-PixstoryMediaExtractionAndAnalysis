The defeat in the quarterfinals of the Miami tournament had hinted that there was some problem. Indeed, Daniil Medvedev himself had said that he was not at all fit when asked at the post match press conference. And so much so that the Russian tennis player himself announced that I have been suffering from a hernia for some time and will have to have an operation I have been playing with a small hernia for the last few months Together with my team I have decided to have a small operation to fix the problem I will probably be out for the next few months and will work hard to get back soon on the pitch This is the message that Medvedev wrote on social media communicating his forced absence for an indefinite time Medvedev will still have to stay away from the playing field for at least a month If not two Translated it means that for a while there will be no run-up to Djokovic for first place in the ATP ranking Overtaking that could have happened again after the very short one a few weeks ago if he had won at the Miami tournament but being eliminated he did not earn the necessary points to make the leap The tennis player could make his return to the Internationals from Italy that will start next May Should it take more, he would risk starting again from Wimbledon
