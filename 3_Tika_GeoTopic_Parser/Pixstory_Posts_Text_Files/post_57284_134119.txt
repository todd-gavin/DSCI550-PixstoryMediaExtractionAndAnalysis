In the heat of the moment it s easy to say something you ll later regret Take a few moments to collect your thoughts before saying anything Also allow others involved in the situation to do the same As soon as you re thinking clearly express your frustration in an assertive but nonconfrontational way State your concerns and needs clearly and directly without hurting others or trying to control them Physical activity can help reduce stress that can cause you to become angry If you feel your anger escalating go for a brisk walk or run Or spend some time doing other enjoyable physical activities Timeouts aren t just for kids Give yourself short breaks during times of the day that tend to be stressful A few moments of quiet time might help you feel better prepared to handle what s ahead without getting irritated or angry Instead of focusing on what made you mad work on resolving the issue at hand Does your child s messy room make you upset Close the door Is your partner late for dinner every night Schedule meals later in the evening Or agree to eat on your own a few times a week Also understand that some things are simply out of your control Try to be realistic about what you can and cannot change Remind yourself that anger won t fix anything and might only make it worse
