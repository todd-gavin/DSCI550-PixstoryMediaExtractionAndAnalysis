Hey, uddeshya!

The quoted image in your post is misattributed to Morgan Freeman. Agreed, that he is one of America's most powerful voices on a myriad of issues. But the quote attributed to him in the image was actually tweeted from a parody account in 2012 and people have been miscrediting him for the quote on the internet ever since. The parody Twitter account associated with the tweet also stands suspended for violation of the rules of the platform. 

Would be nice if you could update the post as I think it is not right to put someone's words in someone else's mouth. It just defeats the very purpose of the thought or idea, more so, when it supports a great cause. Correct?

The below-mentioned articles will let you know more about this misquote:
