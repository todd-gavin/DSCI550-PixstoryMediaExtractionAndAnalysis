The war is entering a stalemate: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/20/russia-ukraine-military-offensive/ To make sense of it, some are drawing similarities with past events. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy compared the Russian invasion with the Holocaust, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson thought the Ukrainians’ response is like Britons choosing Brexit. Does history repeat its templates or is every event unique?

On Sunday, Zelenskyy delivered a speech to Israeli lawmakers, appealing them to support Ukraine. To make the pitch emotional, he drew comparisons between what is happening now in Ukraine and what Nazi Germany was doing to Jews in the 1930s. The Jewish president said Putin was trying to carry out a “final solution” – the Nazi term for their genocide of 6 million Jews. “…you should hear what is coming from Moscow now. They are saying the same words now: ‘final solution’”: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-middle-east-israel-7b59e5ad65dd77cd99a7822404cba8c6

The reference might help him enlist many Israelis to his cause, but Yad Vashem, Israel’s national Holocaust memorial, condemned “this trivialization and distortion of the historical facts of the Holocaust.”

Ironically, Putin has repeatedly justified his action by accusing Ukraine of harboring neo-Nazis, a claim most people find difficult to believe. Yad Vashem had to condemn his remarks too: https://www.timesofisrael.com/yad-vashem-deplores-russian-invasion-condemns-use-of-nazi-rhetoric-by-both-sides/

Meanwhile, the British premier praised the Ukrainians’ instinct “to choose freedom”, and then went on to compare it with Britons’ 2016 decision to quit the European Union. “…it's the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom… When the British people voted for Brexit …It's because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself”: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60809454

There were no takers for the comparisons; neither among liberals nor conservatives, neither at home nor in Europe. Some found the remarks an insult to Ukrainians, others thought they were offensive to common sense. One said voting in a referendum was one thing and risking your life in a war another: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-21/boris-johnson-compares-ukraine-to-brexit/100925710

Though, in defense: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/20/rishi-sunak-defends-boris-johnsons-remarks-about-brexit-and-ukraine

Such comparisons are, partly, mere propaganda, and partly due to the human tendency to wonder how a current situation may evolve by comparing it with a seemingly similar situation in the past.
