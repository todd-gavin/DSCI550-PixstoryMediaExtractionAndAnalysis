I have observed in many ways that people have become quite concerned about their diet They read learn and acknowledge different diet types and throw themselves into following one While there are different reasons and motives for which people choose a specific diet it is not just confined to losing weight It is more about losing weight but with another motto as well The macrobiotic diet is one such kind of diet that is not defined by eating certain foods Instead it s also related to achieving a balance in your life through food choices It was first developed by a Japanese philosopher called George Ohsawa He believed in a holistic approach to health incorporating many lifestyle aspects from diet and exercise to meditation and even the yin and yang energy of particular foods Some people turn to macrobiotic diets in pursuit of better health Others try it when they have a diagnosis such as heart disease obesity or premenstrual syndrome hoping that macrobiotic eating will alleviate their symptoms and support recovery Macrobiotic eating places a strong focus on natural organic food It also advocates for the complete elimination of chemicals and artificial ingredients This no chemical rule extends to personal hygiene products and other products used in the home
