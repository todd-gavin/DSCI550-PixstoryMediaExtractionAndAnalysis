The first thing people do when they hear about diverse sexualities is associate sex with the LGBT community But when it comes to heterosexuality they don t make the leap Teaching young children about heterosexual life including relationships marriage families and having children is entirely acceptable Because the sexual aspect is not the first thing that comes to people s minds when it comes to young children it is accepted as normal and is not given any consideration However this isn t the case with how they see queer people Why The only context in which they may think of LGBT individuals is sex Educating children about the LGBT community does not make them gay it is not indoctrination Whether or not you tell them that you cannot change their sexual orientation or gender identity Without knowing about it however all that happens is their lives become more challenging it does not keep them straight About the part where you said that this indoctrination has led to women being independent and no more at the mercy of men All I can say is COPE I know it must hurt to see your privilege slowly drifting away from you but too bad women are not going to stop being powerful because your feelings are hurt Regarding parents choosing should their children be taught in school about LGBTQ rights or not once again too bad it won t stop them from learning about different sexualities and gender identities It ll just either make their lives difficult or will turn them into bigots
