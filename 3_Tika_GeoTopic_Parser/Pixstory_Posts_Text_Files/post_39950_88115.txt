I was high the other night and figured it would be a good idea to prepare chili I d thawed too many sirloin steaks and needed to use them as soon as possible I crushed them up in my meat grinder and went out to make what is possibly my favorite basic chili recipe Everything was going swimmingly I crushed the meat and despite mashing an onion I chopped enough of it After that I rummaged through my spice cabinet for the necessary powders and seasonings I came out with two chili powders one normal a blend of ground dried chilis garlic powder and other spices and one ancho a blend of ground dried chilis garlic powder and other spices which is just dried and pulverized ancho chiles What s the best way to tell which chili powder you re working with I don t regret any of my choices but I do wish I had known what I was doing at the time and how it would affect my chili and my body Fortunately determining the type of chili powder you re dealing with is simple If your jar of chili powder contains a specific pepper listed in front of the words chili powder such as ancho or chipotle you re dealing with a powder made entirely of dried and ground chiles You re dealing with a blend if the bottle just reads chili powder What about a pinch of chili flakes Chili flakes can be produced from a single type of chili similar to pepper specific powders but mixes are more prevalent Crushed red pepper flakes as seen in pizza parlors are produced from a mix of peppers mostly cayenne that have been roasted or sun dried and then crushed into flaky little bits They re hot and tasty if a little one note but they re unquestionably amazing over pasta and pizza two of my favorite cuisines All of this may seem self evident but it s occasionally necessary to express the obvious especially if you re prone to making culinary judgments while inebriated And let s face it some of the best culinary choices are made in this manner The quality of my work speaks for itself
