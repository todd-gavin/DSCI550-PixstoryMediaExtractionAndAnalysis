Locs, head wraps, and even natural hair have all resulted in black girls being sent home.

Black students face greater suspension rates than their white or latina classmates in schools around the country. These percentages are even higher in charter schools, from kindergarten through eighth grade.

In work environments, natural Black hair is considered unprofessional and unruly. Black people, especially black women, are constantly subjected to racial microaggressions for their hair.

Anti-black hair animosity has existed for generations on American land, or elsewhere to be fair. The end of slavery did not eliminate the concept of acceptable hair; in fact, it entrenched it even further. Straight hair was considered by many as a means of assimilation in a racist environment.

And when you think it can't get any worse and that "America is becoming more accepting of Black hair", it actually does get worse. White women touch to 'feel' Black women's hair without their consent which is, let's be fair, harassment. Black women's hair is treated either like something bad or something amusing. When black women wear wigs, they get unsolicited questions about them. It is unacceptable.

White people need to take responsibility and stop discriminating against people of color, especially black people, for their natural hair. Or styled hair whatsoever.
