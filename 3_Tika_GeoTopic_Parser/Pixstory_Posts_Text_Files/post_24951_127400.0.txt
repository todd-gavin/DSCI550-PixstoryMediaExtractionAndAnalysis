Thomas Tuchel and Antonio Conte were sent off as Tottenham Hotspur held Chelsea to a 2-2 draw, courtesy of Harry Kane’s last-ditch header that secured a point for Spurs in a pulsating encounter at Stamford Bridge on Sunday evening.


The both managers got at loggerheads with each other as Tottenham levelled the scoreboard. Antonio Conte was seen to have celebrated Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s equalising goal in front of the Chelsea bench in the 68th minute. This led Thomas Tuchel to express his fury as he clamoured over a prejudiced officiating of referee Anthony Taylor who ignored a foul play on Kai Havertz in the build-up to the Spurs’ goal. 


Poised to revenge over Antonio Conte’s action, Thomas Tuchel wildly celebrated his team’s second goal ten minutes later; running down the touch line when Reece James lashed a shot beyond Hugo Lloris to restore the host one goal lead. 


Things however went from fry pan to fire at the closing stages of the contest where both managers clashed once again. Harry Kane had just nodded home from a controversial corner to salvage a point for the visitors deep into stoppage time as the referee waived another foul incident on Marc Cucurrella. An exchange of pleasantries triggered Antonio Conte to rage at Thomas Tuchel before been separated by the crowd. In the end, they were both red carded and dismissed for their violent conduct.
