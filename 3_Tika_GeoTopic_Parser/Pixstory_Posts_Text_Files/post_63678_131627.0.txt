A unique, dark and grim game based on Pinocchio and modeled on ‘Dark Souls’ and ‘Bloodborne’, ‘Lies of P’ is an action RPG, whose story combines the tale of Pinocchio and ‘Bloodborne’ influenced gameplay, as the puppet searches for a way to become a real human boy in the decimated city of Krat. A highly dark and gothic shift tilt to the classic fairy tale, the wooden boy will have powerful mechanical killer robots to contend with. While Souls like games are nothing new, Lies of P has certainly twisted the genre into something else entirely that is both innovative and looks awesome.
During Gamescom 2022, ‘Lies of P’ showcased several gruesome scenes as Pinocchio swaps body parts to gain new skills and advantages. In combat, Lies of P utilizes a variety of weapons. In the gameplay reveal trailer, players can see the player character using his mechanical arm to shoot down foes, move heavy objects, and traverse the cityscape, while a variety of melee weapons and elemental powers bolster his offensive arsenal. In the game, Pinocchio possesses a wide variety of parts which he can equip and turn into lethal weaponry, such as an arm cannon and several huge, highly detailed weapons.
Publisher Neowiz mentions that Pinocchio's lying will also be part of the story, cryptically explaining, "The more lies told, the more human players become, with all the advantages and disadvantages it entails." Lying will apparently impact narrative choices but it's not clear exactly how that will play out in the game. There's still no official release date attached to Lies Of P, but we do know that it's set to release at some point in 2023 and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and PC.
