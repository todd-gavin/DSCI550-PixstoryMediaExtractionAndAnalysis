The movie Arrival stars Amy Adams. The film begins with a woman taking care of her young daughter as she dies of some disease. This woman is Louise, a linguistics professor. She's got a lot of papers to grade, but if a bunch of military guys show up and ask for her help. Which is exactly what happens, on account of the alien spaceships that have plopped themselves down in different places all over planet Earth -- twelve to be exact. And because this random teacher is the best goddamn translator on the planet, it's up to her to figure out how to communicate with these aliens. Well these aliens are called hepta-pods and they look like big seven-fingered hands. Louise quickly uses her translator powers to deduce that the hepta-pod language isn't spoken, it's written in circular air tattoos. But then the army guys tell her she has to keep doing the translation thing since China is getting antsy and wants to attack the spaceships. So Louise tells the hepta-pods she's sick of doing all this unpaid work, just give her the answers already. They tell her she's no fun, but ok: the daughter stuff is from the future, which is crazy because it means Louise isn't going to age for at least another ten or twelve years. Man I’m funny. Anyways, Turns out the heptabuddies are here to given humans their language, which has the power to alter time in some magical way that you'll just have to go along with. This gift is sort of a ‘you help us, we help you’ type thing, since in 3000 years they're gonna need Earth's help moving to a new place. Louise gets a vision of herself at some kind of gathering, where the Chinese general is thanking her for stopping his attack on the spaceship and he he tells her his phone number and exactly what to say. Back in the present she plugs in all the info and boom, peace is restored. Ian, the male lead, tells Louise he loves her. And even though she knows he's the future father of her dead daughter, she still marries him.
