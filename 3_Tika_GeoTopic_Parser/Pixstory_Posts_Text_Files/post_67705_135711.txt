Ganesh Chaturthi or Vinayaka Chaturthi is a day festival that celebrates the birth of Lord Ganesha the god of wisdom and prosperity This year celebrations for Ganesh Chaturthi begins on August and end on September when the Ganesh Visarjan will take place So we celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi in our hostel All the arrangements were undertaken by the students of the hostel and that included the Ganesh Sthapana and the aarti too Something that I realized was that these small events occasions not only makes us learn more about our culture but more importantly while working for all the preparation process that goes on behind the events bring together students from various corners it s more like a meeting point for the students It does not matter if they know each other or whether they are friends they nonetheless work together to make the event successful putting in their best foot forward The festival is going to be continued for long days and thanks to all the beloved students of the hostel for making it a success
