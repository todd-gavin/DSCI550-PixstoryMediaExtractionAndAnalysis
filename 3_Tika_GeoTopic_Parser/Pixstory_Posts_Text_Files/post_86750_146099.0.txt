Operated jointly by Madaeen Al Doha Group in strategic partnership with Fusion Hospitality and Exhibitions, the purpose-built Qetai-Fan Beach Fest powered by Unit-Y will operate from early morning until late-night hours during the entirety of the tournament, allowing guests to enjoy a variety of hospitality services, activities, food and beverage offerings, retail outlets and live music performances. 
“We are thrilled to put our vision into action ahead of the most eagerly awaited event in the world. Qetai-Fan Beach Fest powered by Unit-Y is a first-of-its-kind entertainment concept that is meant to take the fan experience to a different level in Qatar,” said Sheikh Nasser bin Abdulaziz Al-Thani, head of business development at Qetaifan Projects.
“With the support of our partners and supporting stakeholders as well as the relentless efforts of our team, we will be bringing a holistic and historical entertainment experience to life, where all fans from all walks of life can gather to create memories and exchange cultures through the universal language that music provides,” he added.
The festival will be a unique entertainment area in Qatar, with direct beach access and a license to operate catered music events designed to offer experiences merging local, regional and international cultures.
As part of the entertainment, resident musicians and artists will perform alongside concerts and special performances by world-renowned and rising artists.
