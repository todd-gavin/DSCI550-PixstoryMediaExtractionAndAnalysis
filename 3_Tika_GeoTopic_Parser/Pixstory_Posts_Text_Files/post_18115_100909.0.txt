Selena Gomez celebrated a successful night as host of Saturday Night Live with a super glam after-party look. After going live from New York, complete with an impersonation of Miley Cyrus, Selena was spotted in a summer-ready 'fit.

The star was photographed hitting the streets of New York City in a sleeveless gown. The black dress was especially chic thanks to a super-high leg slit. In keeping with the evening's glamorous vibes, she wore a pair of sparkly silver shoes from the Paris Texas brand.
