Honestly, children don't care a whit if a man marries a woman, a woman marries a woman, or a man marries a man - until adults come along and scribble intolerance on their innocent minds. Kids are unconcerned. They see happy people, and it makes them happy to see happy people. It is a desire to be happy. They don't perceive it as part of any larger philosophical framework; they simply believe that happiness is nice and sadness isn't.

Not to tell parents how to parent but it's very important to make your children appreciate and respect people different from them, in this case queer people, and to do so, it's crucial to create a home atmosphere that's not bigoted â€“ cis or heteronormative. Let them explore, show them the beauty of diversity.
