Loss or victory two sides of a same coin as far as life of a sportsman is concerned So it seems bit odd that the series loss to South Africa might the reason of Virat leaving captaincy But definately the loss acted as a catalyst to a decision that was in the making it looks for the last couple of months To put it simply Virat had lost the will to remain captain of India He first decided to leave captaincy of T format and led to controversy where Virat ended up contradicting BCCI chief Saurav Ganguly The board then decided to take away One Day captaincy from Virat too as it wanted one captain for the white ball format I think it was then Virat knew he had to leave test captaincy as well And SA loss just hastened the decision Virat is a street fighter a typical West Delhi boy It was trait that suited him well as a batsman but as a captain it just looked bit graceless Saurav Ganguly too had similar touch of gracelessness as a captain and people say current coach and then Saurav s deputy Rahul Dravid would have been a better captain but Dravid totally capitulated before Greg Chappel and his captaincy was one of the worst periods of Indian cricket Virat s team selection at times was but bewildering too and it resulted in losses for India especially overseas But then each captain has favourite players who get bit longer rope than others Raina under Dhoni Chetan Sharma under Kapil Dev are some of the examples of that similary Hardik Pandya or Shikhar Dhawan too were treated bit more leniently under Virat We cant kind fault with it since all captains need a player or two who he trusts implicitly Virat s biggest folly was to plot downfall of Anil Kumble to bring in Ravi Shastri Shastri might be a shrewed tactician but treating a giant like Kumble in the manner he was treated will always be a black spot in Virat the person So Virat knew knives were out for him too and he read the writing on the wall
