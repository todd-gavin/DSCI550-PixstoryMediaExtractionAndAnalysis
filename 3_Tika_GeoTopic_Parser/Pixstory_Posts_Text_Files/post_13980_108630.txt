Who doesn t love a good scandal Well that is what Bridgerton is all about for the most part This series revolves all around one season of ladies coming into society to try to find husbands There is drama sex and a whole lot of gossip I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed this show and how quickly I binged it Things like this are not normally my cup of tea but this was too juicy not to finish
