Till date, only one film has been made on the epic Mahabharata in India. Titled Mahabharat, it starred Pradeep Kumar, Padmini and Dara Singh, and was produced by A G Nadiadwala. 👍Now Bollywood Hungama has found out that his son Firoz Nadiadwala, who has produced classic comedies like Hera Pheri and Welcome, is all set to revisit this classic in a never-before-seen manner. 🙏👍Firoz Nadiadwala has started work on Mahabharat and aims to make it the most visually stunning film ever in Indian cinema. The work on the script has been going on for 4-5 years and the makers would spend a couple of years more on the pre-production. The principal photography will commence in the first quarter of 2025. It’ll hopefully be released in December 2025 in the original Hindi language and would be dubbed in several languages too.” 🙏😳The source further said, “The entire tale of the Mahabharata will be conveyed in three hours. Firoz Nadiadwala is confident that it would be India’s answer to Marvel and DC movies and also that of The Lord of The Rings, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. Believe it or not, its budget is expected to be more than Rs. 700 crores. Thus, it’ll be the biggest Indian film of all time.”👍👍✅✅When asked about the casting, the source replied, “The actors being considered are Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Ranveer Singh, Paresh Rawal, Nana Patekar, Anil Kapoor etc. It’ll be interesting to see who’ll end up playing which part. The makers are looking at casting both established and new heroines too, as well as top actors from the South industry for important parts. The hunt for a director is also underway.”👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏The source then said, “The 1965 Mahabharata film was a huge success at the box office. Firoz and his team are following the similar story and format which was there in that movie. Most of the action would be real, on the lines of Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, etc, and not VFX-heavy. More than the VFX, Firoz wants the selling point of the film to be the characters, storytelling, emotions, dialogues etc.”✅✅✅✅✅
