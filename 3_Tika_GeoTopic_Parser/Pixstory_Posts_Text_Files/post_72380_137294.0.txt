Anurag Basu is  all set to direct  Kartik Aaryan, the star who is currently ruling box office charts in commercial Hindi cinema. He is being offered films by several notable directors and producers.

Kartik has recently signed films with the likes of Sajid Nadiadwala  and  Kabir Khan. He is reported to be  stepping into completely new territory with Anurag Basu.
 
“It is  a romantic film that shows a kind of love story we haven’t seen  in our cinema. Anurag Basu’s film will give Kartik a  chance to extend his performing skills beyond anything he has done so far,” a source informs.

Kartik will next be seen in Shehzada, a mammoth-sized masala entertainer  which after the  blockbuster status  of  Kartik’s Bhool Bhulaiya 2 is the biggest  Bollywood project of 2023.
