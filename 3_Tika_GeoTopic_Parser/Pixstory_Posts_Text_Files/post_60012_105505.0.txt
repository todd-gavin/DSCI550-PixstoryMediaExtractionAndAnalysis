Yesssssssssssssssss I don't have to do anything if I sit under a tree.

It's very pleasant.

When that smooth watery water droplet falls from the sky and travels so far to hit that rough dirt, it creates that wonderful mixture that many of us have experienced, as well as that lovely pleasant smell that makes you happy.

That nice breeze that blows all the way to wipe away all your problems and mood swings and fill you with positive energy.

When you first wake up in the morning, the most beautiful thing you see is the sun, which slowly and gracefully begins to spread its light to that colourless world, brightening your mood and making your Instagram photo of sunlight the greatest and most beautiful it can be.

When you sit quietly under a tree and you can feel that calmness of the surrounding.
Everyone on the planet loves nature, but they have never experienced it.

Make an effort to connect with it, and you will notice that you will begin to sense the natural world as well.

I was fortunate enough to be born in Uttarakhand, where I have a strong connection to the river, mountains, waterfalls, and animals. This is the kind of peace I'd like in my life, I believe.
