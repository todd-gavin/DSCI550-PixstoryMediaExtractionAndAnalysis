Love Aaj Kal 2💖💖

Directed by Imtiaz Ali, the movie projected a clash between professional ambitions and personal life goals and its impact on love life. Despite the hype and Valentine's Day release, the movie tanked at the box office. In fact, Sara's performance became fodder for memes. Nevertheless, the movie only added to Sara's popularity, especially due to the gossip around her alleged affair with Kartik Aaryan.
