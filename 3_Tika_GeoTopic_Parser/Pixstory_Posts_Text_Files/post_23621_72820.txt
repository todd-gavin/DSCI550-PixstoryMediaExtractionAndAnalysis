 th December The last time Chelsea won a Premier League game The Boxing Day fixture away to Aston Villa was when the blues left the pitch with all points Since then the European champions have gone on to draw three and lose one game The defeat came against the English champions Manchester City who now sit at the top of the table with points clear and a game in hand Thomas Tuchel is on his worst run since he managed Borussia Dortmund in October What exactly is happening at Chelsea What s the way forward for the London based team Hit by COVID health issues and injuries Chelsea has been without star players for a major part of the campaign since November Fixture congestion hasn t helped much and led to players getting tired or picking up injuries Players like Lukaku Mount Havertz Pulisic haven t been able to find form and with Ben Chilwell and Reece James sidelined the team can t find a way to move forward After the game vs Brighton Tuchel said we are mentally tired and physically tired You can see it in our performance It s as easy as that Chelsea can still go on to lift trophies If there s any manager who can get this team to bond again and bring back the winning mentality it s Thomas Tuchel
