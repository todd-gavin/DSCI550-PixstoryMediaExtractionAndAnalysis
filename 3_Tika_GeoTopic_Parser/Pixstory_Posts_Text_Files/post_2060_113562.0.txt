It is typical of Hillary Clinton to make this assertion to claim that she somehow had a connection with Justice Thomas in law school and knew of him intimately and emotionally. Imagine some random individual whom you never interacted with in school, but by virtue of their being in the same school as you, went on television and purported to know the inner workings of your mind and the complexities of your personality?

She called him a "person of grievance."  If you grew up as black man in the Jim Crowe South you may feel a bit aggrieved too. Clinton is merely a used up politician in the sunset of her career - she wants nothing more than to bask in the limelight for a last moment before her end.

But maybe it should be Hillary Clinton who we define as something insulting. Wasn’t she the one who dubbed African-American teenagers “super predators?” Didn’t she support laws that triggered the imprisonment of thousands of impoverished African-Americans?

Of course, I don’t expect people who support Hillary Clinton to pay any attention to her unfavorable qualities, after all, if they support her now, they are already too far gone.
