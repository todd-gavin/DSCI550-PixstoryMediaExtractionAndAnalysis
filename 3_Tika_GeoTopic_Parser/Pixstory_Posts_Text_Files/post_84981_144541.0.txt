#3 Ryan Giggs (Wales) 
One of the most decorated players in Manchester United and European history. He is the only Red Devils player with the most appearances. Having won multiple trophies as a United player, it's a shame he never had such a great international player.
Wales has now qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1956. It's a pity Giggs couldn't be a part of that squad. Despite making 64 appearances, he never drove his country to the World Cup.

#2 George Best (Northern Ireland)
He defined football, and the way he played had fans in the chokehold. He was the undisputed king of European football, dominating the game in Europe; the only thing he couldn't do was grace the World Cup, which is a sad fact for football.
A player of such stature failed to make the World Cup squad after Northern Ireland manager Billy Bingham declared him unfit to play due to excessive alcohol consumption, despite appearing in 37 games and scoring nine goals.


#1 Alfredo Di Stefano (Argentina, Spain and Colombia) 
Pele dubbed Stefano the greatest player of all time, but the player who ruled in European clubs and won a slew of trophies was denied the opportunity to represent his country, the irony being which country.
The Real Madrid fantom played for Spain, Colombia, and Argentina but was never selected for the World Cup.
Argentina was unable to compete in the 1950 World Cup, and Stefano was barred from competing in the 1954 World Cup. Stefano played in qualifying games after being granted Spanish citizenship, but Spain did not qualify for the 1958 World Cup, and when Spain did qualify for the 1962 World Cup, he was sidelined with injuries throughout the tournament.
