Fernandinho, a certain Brazilian doing his thing in the Ukraine Premier League almost a decade ago got a move to a then growing club from the other half of Manchester (City) under the Chilean, Manuel Pellegrini.
A player who thrived while playing different roles, a versatile midfielder and someone who really came a long way under the leadership of Vincent Kompany and then David Silva and over the years was a strong presence in the midfield heavy with the likes of Silva, Toure or even Milner. Fernandinho always went under the radar, is what I felt over all these years watching him. An underrated profile in the star studded City squad who always came in handy and someone you can count in on.
He really seemed like a Josep Guardiola guy, the Pellegrini successor but was unfortunately replaced by Rodri. But again, that's Pep for you who wants the absolute best for him and his team. The right need of Fernandinho came to light when the likes of Kompany and David Silva left some huge places in terms of leadership in that dressing room, City lacked that massively and still do as we have seen such instances only recently.
With him leaving as well now, Pep should definitely look for someone to fill those huge huge boots as another great servant for the Cityzens call it a day and leaving it the only way they know of recent, which is with a silverware. On that note, kudos to him and the whole team for another stellar season.
