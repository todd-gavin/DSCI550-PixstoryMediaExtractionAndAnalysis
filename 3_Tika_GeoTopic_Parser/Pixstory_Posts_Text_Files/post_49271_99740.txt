I don t know how unpopular this opinion is but even though I don t listen to this genre a music a lot so correct me if I m wrong J Cole is better than Drake J Cole incorporates more wordplay double entendres and cultural references in his lyrics Drake is more focused on problems of love money and social standing in his songwriting J Cole s topic matter on the other hand is much more engaging and diversified ranging from personal insecurities to relationship struggles racism and corporate greed Obviously Drake is a great artist but in my opinion J Cole takes the cake in the lyricism part Drake s writing style is a tad bit kitschy very much on surface and lacking substance whereas J Cole nearly writes novels His lyrics are quite picturesque and build lyrical pictures in your mind allowing you to visualise the story He s a very good storyteller J Cole s production is better too featuring older and more unique samples not to mention the fact that J Cole produces a large number of his own and others tracks Not to mention Drake has used ghostwriters in the past from what I know and that s a little off putting even though I get that people find it okay It s not to say Drake isn t a good lyricist he is but I still feel a lot of it lacks depth
