Who am I? 
I think I would need a lifetime to figure out an answer to this question. For now, I'm just a person who is doing what I love to do each day. I'm exploring all my interests to figure out what I'm really good at. Every day I wake up with a heart filled with gratitude. I'm happy that I'm alive right now in this moment. 
I think that humans are actually miniscule creatures in this universe. This picture, in my perspective, depicts the truth of how small and trivial we are in this extravagant universe. If we actually admitted that fact, we would be left with no remorse.
