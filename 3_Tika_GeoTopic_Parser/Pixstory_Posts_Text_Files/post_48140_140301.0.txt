As per the instructions given by the Election Commission of India, various activities have been organised to create awareness of the amendments in forms, qualifying dates and collection of Aadhar. Various camps have been organised at various places around the city to collect Aadhar data and facilitate citizens regarding any services related to voter cards.

A door-to-door campaign started on August 22, 2022, till September 7, 2022, around the city. Where, booth level officers personally visited citizens' doorsteps to help them link their Aadhar with voter cards and other services related to voter cards.

During this whole month's activities, we have received Form 6 (5,576), Form 7 (6536), and Form 8 (4,411). Out of 6,403,403 total voters, 3,50,481(55%) voters have linked their Aadhar numbers to their voter cards during this survey.

Furthermore, we are planning a series of camps at college campuses and schools where we will target new voters. 25 ELCs in colleges, 2 in Punjab University, and 135 ELCs in schools will inform new voters regarding amendments, new forms, and Aadhar Linking. Booth level officers will personally visit these camps and organise various activities related to voter awareness.

Dr. Vijay Namdeorao Zade, IAS, Chief Electoral Officer, U.T., Chandigarh, extended thanks to the electors for the response and support given in linking aadhar with voter card and also requested other remaining electors to increase their count by participating in the initiative of linking aadhar with a voter card, which will help in better electoral services in Chandigarh. However, the linking of aadhar with the voter is on a voluntary basis.
