Abstract 

Objective 

To explore the intervention effect of Pender’s model on physical and mental health of patients with diabetes mellitus. 

Methodology 

According to the principle of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a number of databases including CNKI, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, VIP, Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched to collect and select relevant reports for the implementation of a meta-analysis. 

Results 

10 randomized controlled trails in 6 foreign reports and 4 Chinese reports were included in this study. A total of 863 participants were involved, including 439 members in the experiment group and 424 in the control group. The results of the meta-analysis show that Pender’s model has a good intervention effect on the health knowledge, self-management behavior, psychological function and cardiopulmonary function of patients with diabetes mellitus, with the effect better than that on the control group (Z=3.371, 3.781, 2.902, P<0.050). The results of subgroup analysis show that the intervention effect on self-management behavior would not be affected by the measurement tool used (Z=3.295, p=0.001). 

Conclusion 

Pender’s model has a good intervention effect on the health knowledge, self-management behavior and psychological function of patients with diabetes mellitus.
