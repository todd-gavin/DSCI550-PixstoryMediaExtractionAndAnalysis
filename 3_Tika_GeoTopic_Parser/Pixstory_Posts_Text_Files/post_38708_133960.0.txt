Scout Report-Sergino Dest- Revival Under ETH?
Aaron Wan Bissaka
AWB has been replaced by Dalot for his inconsistent performances, and there are rumours about selling or loaning him to Crystal Palace. If we compare him with Dest, we can see that except for short passes, which he excels in, he is very poor in all other areas. If he is not sold, he will be benched or dropped altogether from the first team and the bench.
The Conclusion
After the capture of Casemiro, United is looking to coup at least 4 players in different positions before the transfer shuts. ETH would like a right-back with Dest in sight. Dest was kept out of the first team in Barcelona’s first match against Rayo Vallecano. Barcelona is looking to trim the squad after getting Lewandowski, Kessie, Raphina, and co. Roberto and Dani Alves took the cream of the matches, while Dest got very less game time. He seems to have least impressed Xavi, while he was able to impress Dest.
Dest had a good time under the former Ajax boss. There’s a belief that moving to Man United will help his career move in the right direction. But with a week left for the transfer to happen, do you think United will be able to get their priority signings? Or they’ll be left again reeling. With the Premier League in full flow, United needs as many new players to help the team. Stay tuned in the last few days, to see how the transfer unfolds.
