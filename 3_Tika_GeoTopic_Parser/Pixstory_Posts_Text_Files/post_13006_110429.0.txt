 world was released by the Economist Information Unit (EIU). In that ranking, cities around the world were characterized by "quality of life".

The constituent elements of the quality of life were mentioned in that ranking, including health care, crime, political stability, infrastructure and access to green space.
We probably cannot limit the quality of life to certain factors. Bagness and enjoyment of life, first of all, depends on the expectation and satisfaction of each person. A mother who has lost her young son in the war and has not been reported for many years now, it is clear that people do not laugh when they reach the water. As far as humans, there may be a quality measurement of quality of life. There are many people who endure unequal suffering under similar circumstances. One is not a flower to be left in the grass and lie with equal concerns. At the bottom of the human world, "everyone's pain is related to themselves."
However, from the other perspective, the world of people is not much different. Leo Tolstoy, Volume III of War and Peace NovelLeo Tolstoy ends theIn the end of this novel, the world of people who were full of love, enthusiasm, and passion for many years, the world of people who, even the nights that were supposed to start the war against Napoleon, were crazy and frustrated. Everyone is in a similar situation and in a boring world and in the regret of those happy days. Prince Andrey has the same suffering, the same pains, the same concerns, and the same boredom as Natasha, which is all.
With this account, it can be identified as characteristics and the life of people's lives can be calculated.
