📍- Billu’s hut ( Netaji Subhash palace)

It's a good place to visit in winters as you can enjoy your food under sun but same becomes a little difficult in summers as they have outdoor sitting.

This place is quiet famous for their pastas and Chinese food. I always used to eat their pastaa. 
But today I went to this place only for their thali as it looks soo tempting isn’t it?
And i had a great experience this thali was super delicious you guys must try thiss . 

Do tell me in the notes have you ever visited this place?
