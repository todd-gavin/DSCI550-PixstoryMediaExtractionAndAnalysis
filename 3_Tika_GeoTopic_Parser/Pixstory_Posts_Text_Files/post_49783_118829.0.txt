The White House said Joe Biden is “feeling well” and “doing just fine” after testing positive for Covid. Meanwhile, he was blamed by the opposition too for apparently not taking precautions against Covid 19. 

Appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation, Ashish Jha said: “So it is the BA.5 variant, which is about 80% of infections. But thank goodness, our vaccines, and therapeutics work well against it, which is why I think the president’s doing well.
“I checked in with his team late last night. He was feeling well. He had a good day yesterday. He’s got a viral syndrome, an upper respiratory infection … and he’s doing just fine.”

The White House later released a letter in which Biden’s physician, Kevin O’Connor, said the president’s “predominant symptom now is a sore throat”.

O’Connor also said Biden had finished a third full day of treatment with Paxlovid, which would continue, and was “experiencing no shortness of breath at all”.

Biden’s positive test was announced on Thursday. He is also, as he said, double-vaccinated and double-boosted and has access to the best possible care.

Jha also suggested cities seeing high case rates, including New York, Phoenix, and Miami, might consider re-instituting indoor mask mandates.

“Masks work, right? They slow down transmission. So in areas of high transmission, I think it’s very prudent for people to be wearing masks indoors, especially if they’re in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces. That’s what the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] recommends. And I think that’s a very important and effective way of reducing transmission, protecting yourself as well.

Vaccines so far have been proven effective but still who wants to catch Covid and have a disruption in your life. So please wear masks and take the necessary precautions so that you may prevent any infections.
