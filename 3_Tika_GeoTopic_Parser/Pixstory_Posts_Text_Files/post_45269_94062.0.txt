The Ricketts have officially withdrawn their name from bidding for the ownership of Chelsea. Ricketts had planned to partner with the US billionaires Ken Griffin and Dan Gilbert to buy Chelsea. 


However, after some Islamophobic comments made by Joe Ricketts in the past resurfaced. There was a huge backlash from the Chelsea fan base to remove the Rickett-Griffin-Gilbert group from contention. 


The Ricketts tried to win over the Chelsea fan base but after realizing the graveness of the matter at hand the Ricketts decided to withdraw from contention. 


“The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea FC,” said a statement released to PA Sport.


Ricketts said, “In the process of finalizing the proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans and we wish the new owners well.”


The statement shows that the social media protests’ against the Ricketts didn’t play any role in the withdrawal.


This leaves only the LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Boston Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca as the only three bidders left.
