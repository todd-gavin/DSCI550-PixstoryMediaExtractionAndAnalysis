The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most powerful space-based observatories, helping scientists unravel numerous cosmic mysteries. 

NDTV reported that the telescope has taken over 1.3 billion images of fascinating events over its 30 years of service. It is now concentrating on one of its most difficult missions: determining how fast the cosmos is expanding. According to NASA, the discoveries so far indicate that something odd is occurring in our cosmos. 

Scientists were able to analyse the expansion of the universe more precisely as technology advanced over time. According to NASA, there is a discrepancy between the pace of expansion of the universe as it is now and observations made shortly after the Big Bang, implying "something strange" is going on in the universe.

This has left scientists perplexed. They are investigating Hubble's data on a set of "milepost markets" in space and time, which may be used to trace the expansion rate of the cosmos as it moves away from us, to better explain the peculiar phenomenon.

Letâ€™s hope this mystery gets solved soon!
