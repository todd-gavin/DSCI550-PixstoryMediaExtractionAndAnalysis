In most heterosexual parenthood mothers are expected to be primary caregivers of children while statistically most fathers are absent to their children This is not only unfair to the moms who have to leave behind their lives in order to single handedly raise children that are the responsibility of both the parents but also unfair on the children This is especially true for BIPoC mothers The idea of sacrifice from women is so romanticized by society through media and other forms that it s seen as nothing out of the ordinary They are made to leave their jobs businesses and dreams to dtay at home Black and Brown women who choose to be or end up being stay at home mothers and homemakers are undervalued and ridiculed because society sees nothing unique in what they do since the tasks they take on are considered standard for women Most women who fill these positions don t think of themselves as remarkable since they ve been taught since childhood that their entire purpose in life is to make sacrifices so that others might thrive Working moms are particularly affected by time conflicts in addition to their paid work they are responsible for the majority of unpaid domestic and care tasks The majority of Americans including most working mothers are employed full time And a lot of mothers are either primary or secondary breadwinners for their families But in addition to their paid jobs most working mothers have a second shift at home that involves housework and child care Not to mention the struggles of single moms From workplace discrimination to societal prejudices This mother s day let s pledge to bring equality to all the mothers around the world
