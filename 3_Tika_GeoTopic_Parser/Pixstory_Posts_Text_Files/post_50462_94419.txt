Where shall I start from Science fascinates me because there are so many mysterious unknown phenomena out there that science endeavours to expose and explain that blows my mind As a keen biology student it always blows my mind that we have discovered maybe of the estimated number of species on Earth after all these years Our increasing ability to visualise the large and distant think galaxies and the incredibly small think parts of cells and even down to some molecules and atoms is just awesome After my boards I took PCB and trust me you will find Biology is actually amazing When you study and read about it at a molecular level or even on the basics its fascinating That s the reason why I chose to become a medical researcher rather than a doctor For me I cannot ever come out of this fascination
