NBA All Star Saturday night went out with the bang of a water soaked firework To say the dunk contest the night s final event was a dud would be a monumental understatement This thing was unwatchable Unfortunately my job which I am otherwise quite fond of forced me to watch I wanted to hide under a blanket it was so awkward I mean look at how many times these guys blew dunks Obi Toppin won by default His opponent in the final Juan Toscano Anderson didn t even finish a dunk Toppin could ve laid his final attempt in and still won He wound up doing a pretty impressive dunk actually but by that point absolutely nobody cared If I sound bitter I guess I sort of am The dunk contest should be and used to be must see TV And I m not talking about ages ago with Jordan and Dominique or Vince Carter in Oakland We all remember Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon putting on what I consider to be the greatest dunk show in history in We have more incredible athletes in the NBA right now than at any other time in the history of the event It shouldn t be as bad as it was on Saturday But it was and Giannis Antetokounmpo for one thinks it s Stephen Curry s fault In a pretty funny exchange caught on tape Giannis can be heard telling Curry It s your fault You changed the game It s your fault Giannis is referring of course to Curry s point influence which has indeed played a central role in changing the way basketball at all levels is played Everyone wants to shoot now The pointer specifically the deep pointer has surpassed the slam dunk as the most exciting play in basketball Giannis is obviously joking with Curry but it s sort of true Unless the biggest names in the sport start doing the dunk contest again the NBA has to consider making the point contest the All Star Saturday night finale That has become the marquee event
