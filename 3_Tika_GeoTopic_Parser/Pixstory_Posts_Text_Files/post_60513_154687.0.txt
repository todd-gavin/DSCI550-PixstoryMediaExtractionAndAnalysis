VICTON's Heo Chan Leaves the group
Last month Heo Chan received haters because of his drunk and driving incident. After the incident, Heo Chan halted all his activities and shared a handwritten apology. 
On October 11, the agency stated that after discussing the matter with the members and Heo Chan, who “did not wish to cause further damage” to VICTON and his bandmates, it had been decided that he would be permanently leaving the group.
IST Entertainment’s full announcement is as follows:
Hello. This is IST Entertainment.
We sincerely thank the fans who care for VICTON, and we are making an announcement regarding a change to the member lineup.
After careful discussion with all of the VICTON members including Heo Chan, it has been decided that Heo Chan will be leaving the group.
This decision was made by taking into consideration the opinions of Heo Chan, who said that he did not wish to cause further damage [to the group], and the other members.
We apologize for once again giving fans cause for concern through sudden news, and we ask for your generous understanding.
Therefore, VICTON will be reorganized as a six-member group consisting of Han Seung Woo, Kang Seungsik, Im Sejun, Do Hanse, Choi Byungchan, and Jung Subin; and their “2022 VICTON FAN CONCERT [CHRONICLE]” and their other future scheduled activities will be carried out by the five members apart from Han Seung Woo, who is currently serving in the military.
At present, the VICTON members are working hard and pouring their sweat into preparing their performances for the “2022 VICTON FAN CONCERT [CHRONICLE],” for which their fans have waited a long time.
So that this effort does not go to waste, we ask that you continue to give the VICTON members, who are working hard on their preparations, your unchanging interest and support.
Thank you.
