“We are meant to work on a problem that our children will solve,” and this one quote from Mark Ruffalo summarises the whole movie.

Last night I watched ‘The Adam Project,’ and after watching the movie I can say that this movie is a perfect family entertainer.

The movie is based somewhere in America and the year is 2050 where we see Adam (Ryan Reynolds) is in a tussle with Maya Sorian (played by Catherine Keener) because he was trying to go back in the year 2018 but accidentally landed in 2022.

When he landed in 2022, Adam meet his younger self who is 12 years old. Young Adam (played by Walker Scobell) is smart, he asked many questions with his elder version which includes How you came back in your past and most important why you came back?

He got his answers and after that both Adam goes back to 2018 where they met their Father, Louis (played by Mark Ruffalo).

After that their hustle started to solve the problem made by Louis which affected Elder Adam in 2050. 

Will both versions of Adam and their father be able to solve the problem or will someone have to sacrifice their life just to complete the mission? To get all the answers you have to watch The Adam Project.

The chemistry between the young and elder versions of Adam is a highlight of the movie.

The role of Adam’s mother Ellie (played by Jennifer Garner) is small but made an impact in a movie.

Action scenes are not so of top-notch quality but Director (Shawn Levy) tried something new and fresh and you will like it.

The theme of the movie got so much potential but the director didn’t capitalize on it and ‘The Adam Project,’ becomes another ‘one time watch’ kinda movie because you will not feel connected with the story and characters of the movie.

The runtime of the ‘The Adam Project,’ is 1 hour and 46 minutes. If you are looking for a family entertainer then this movie should be on your watchlist.
