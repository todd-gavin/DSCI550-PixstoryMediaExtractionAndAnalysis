Eating eggs or other high protein foods like meat
without earbs will drop blood sugar levels and
increase adrenaline/ stress hormones. This
encourages tissue breakdown to ereate glucose.
s may result in increased pulse rate, and
lowered body temp after eating

Try including a portion of fruit on the side, a glass
of juice, some sourdough bread or some dairy
yogurt.
These sugars will aid the liver in converting
thvroid hormone to T3, which will increase bodv
temperature and energy levels!
