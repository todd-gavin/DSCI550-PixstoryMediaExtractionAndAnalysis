I m fine with it since I ve been raised to appreciate every day I m alive so I reward myself with my father s money on a regular basis He treats me like a queen He can tell when I m annoyed or need a companion to talk to He cooks for me and takes care of my cramps and headaches He pushes me to attempt new things In my darkest moments he helps me feel stronger He constantly reminds me of how essential I am to him And also teaching me not to settle for less my dad is the reason i love the way i m As a result every day is a celebration for me
