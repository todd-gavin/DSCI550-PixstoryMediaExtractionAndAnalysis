The International Organization for Migration (IOM) expressed concerns over the challenging conditions of undocumented Afghan returnees, saying that over 3.000 undocumented Afghans are returning daily from neighboring Iran, and many of the returnees are forcefully coming back to their country.

In a report, IOM stated that over one million Afghans were deported or returned to Afghanistan in 2021, while thousands more are leaving the country searching for a better life.

The report adds that IOM Afghanistan has launched a program to support undocumented returnees in Afghanistan.

"IOM's Protection teams are providing emergency response to undocumented returnees; IOM is supporting them to access crucial protection services," said the report. 

The organization further said that Afghanistan is experiencing a complex humanitarian crisis with rising unemployment, food insecurity, and uncertain safety. 

Emal, a nineteen-year-old, struggles with difficulties, saying he has decided to leave home for Iran to seek job opportunities.

"Going to Iran is really hard, especially in this cold weather, but I am obliged ... I am unemployed here and cannot pay my home's expenses here," he said.  

After the recent changes in Afghanistan, many migrants have left for Iran; however, fewer people are coming to Iran recently because of the cold season,” said Mohammad Khan Talebi, a migration expert in Iran. 

Meanwhile, the government spokesman, Bilal Karimi, said the Islamic Emirate will create employment opportunities for Afghan youth to prevent illegal travel. 

“The Isla"ic Emirate made serious efforts to prevent our compatriots and youth from illegally going to neighboring countries, to stay in their own country and use their energy for serving the people here,” said Bilal Karimi.
