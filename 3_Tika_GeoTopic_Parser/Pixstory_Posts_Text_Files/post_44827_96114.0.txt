Aleksandar Kolarov

Kolarov is still playing for Roma at the age of 34, having made 100 Serie A appearances in the
three years since leaving City. But it's his performance of Jingle Bells that has us all here.

Nigel De Jong

Since leaving City in 2012, De Jong has played for six different clubs, the most recent of which
being Qatari club Al-Shahania SC, which he joined in 2019. We'd love to see video of him
patrolling their midfield and kicking everyone who dares to approach him into the air.

Gareth Barry

Barry set a Premier League appearance record with West Bromwich Albion in 2017 and stayed
with the Baggies for the two years it took them to return to the top tier after their relegation.

However, he only made six appearances in 2019-20, and now that he is 39 and out of contract,
he must decide whether to hunt for a new club or hang up his boots.

Yaya Toure

Toure joined Olympiakos after leaving City in 2018, although he only appeared in two games
before his contract was mutually terminated.
In May 2019, his agent announced that Toure had retired, but a few months later, he joined with
China League One club Qingdao Huanghai, only to leave again in January 2020.

He's 37, but
he has no intention of retiring anytime soon, and he's training with Leyton Orient to stay in
shape ahead of a planned move abroad.
