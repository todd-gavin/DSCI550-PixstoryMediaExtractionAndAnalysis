Greenhouse effect

The greenhouse effect is the process in which the heat is trapped close to the Earth’s surface with the help of the greenhouse gasses. These heat-trapping gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around the earth, keeping the planet toastier and warmer than it would be without them. Some of these gasses include carbon dioxide, water vapour, methane, and nitrous oxide. 
It has been determined that if one would remove carbon dioxide the earth’s surface would be 33°C (59°F) cooler. Thus carbon dioxide plays a critical role in stabilising the earth’s atmosphere and makes life possible on earth. 
However, humans are now interfering with this energy balance of the earth and the level of carbon dioxide on the earth has been rising consistently for years due to which the earth’s temperature is rising and causing global warming.
