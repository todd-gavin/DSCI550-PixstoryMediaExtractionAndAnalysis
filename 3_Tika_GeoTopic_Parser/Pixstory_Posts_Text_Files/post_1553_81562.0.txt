Many articles have been written about the big trade that sent Sabonis from the Indiana Pacers to the Sacramento Kings Haliburton. The Kings have received many bad grades from pundits around the league because Haliburton is such an extremely gifted point guard and will under contract for the next few years at a low price and under team control for seven years. . Let’s analyze this trade in the context of the Kings reality. 

Reality point number one. The Kings two biggest assets were De’Aaron Fox and Tyrese Haliburton. They both play the same position and were canceling each other out. Imagine trying to play two quarterbacks on the field at the same time or trying to play your quarterback as a running back just because you have another really good quarterback on the team. They wouldn’t perform well. In this age of positionless basketball the assumption is that you can play players out of position and still make it work by playing the best talent. That can sometimes work but can very often be detrimental for a team. This was clearly the case for the Kings this year. Everyone agrees they had a lot of talent but we’re playing very poorly and didn’t fit well together. Too many guards and not enough talented wings and big men. Trading one of these two stars had to happen. The very simple truth is De’Aaron Fox‘s stats have been way down this year largely due to the fact that he has had to share the same position with Tyrese Haliburton. Yes, his three-point shooting numbers are low which is no fault of anyone else but the fact is, nothing has changed with Fox since last year when he averaged 25 points and 7 assists. he is the same player he was and is extremely talented. De’Aaron Fox also signed a contract that pays him over $30 million a year. The combination of his down year and his big contract clearly made him a less desirable asset. In other words, the Kings would not have been able to get back as good a talent by trading Fox.
