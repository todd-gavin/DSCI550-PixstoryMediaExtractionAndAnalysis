One of Scott Morrison s final acts as Prime Minister was to instruct the Australian Border Force ABF to publicise an interception of a suspected asylum seeker boat on election day As voters were going to the polls on Saturday the Operation Sovereign Borders Commander issued a rare statement announcing a vessel has been intercepted in a likely attempt to illegally enter Australia from Sri Lanka The ABC can reveal that the highly controversial move during the election caretaker period followed a direct request from the Prime Minister s Office to publicly release details of the sensitive ABF operation before it had been completed During his final press conference held in the early afternoon of election day the then prime minister was asked about reports emerging that morning about a boat arrival Well I can confirm that that there has been an interception of a vessel en route to Australia That vessel has been intercepted in accordance with the policies of the government and they re following those normal protocols Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney About the same time as the prime minister spoke the statement from Rear Admiral Justin Jones the Operation Sovereign Borders Commander appeared on the ABF s website warning that the Australian government s policy on illegal boat arrivals remains unchanged We will intercept any vessel seeking to reach Australia illegally and to safely return those on board to their point of departure or country of origin Rear Admiral Justin Jones said in the five line statement requested by Mr Morrison s office The unusual disclosure of operational on water matters is now subject to an inquiry by Home Affairs Department Secretary Mike Pezzullo ordered this week by the new Labor government Officials with knowledge of the events that occurred on Saturday say the Department of Home Affairs first examined the legality of issuing a statement during an election campaign because of concerns it could breach caretaker conventions and politicise the public service Eventually it was decided that a statement could be issued by the commander a move that has been privately criticised by Rear Admiral Jones colleagues in the Australian Border Force as well as the Australian Defence Force
