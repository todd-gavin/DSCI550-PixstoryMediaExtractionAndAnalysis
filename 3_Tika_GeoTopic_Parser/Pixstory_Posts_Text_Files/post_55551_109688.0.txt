Not to be confused with the 2012 Gerard Butler movie of the same name, Sundance Now’s Playing for Keeps is a soapy drama ostensibly about the WAGS (wives and girlfriends) attached to a professional Australian rules football team in Melbourne that ends up being so much more than it seems. 

According to vulture, with the very Desperate Housewives promise its trailer makes of Sex! Lies! And Scandal!, it is, in many ways, exactly what it seems. But while sex, lies, and scandal absolutely abound, the show’s decision to really anchor the viewer in the Everywoman perspective of Cecelia Peters’ new-to-the-team Paige Dunkley adds a layer of disarming self-awareness that makes humanizing the rest of the series’ more classically glamorous WAGS much easier than it might otherwise have been. 

When the end of the first episode takes a sharp pivot and someone winds up dead, that same disarmament works further in the show’s favor — what might have felt like tonal whiplash without Paige having already thoroughly rejiggered our expectations instead feels just like one more tick on the Yes, please, next episode checklist. 

All that said, a word of warning: While season two ends on a massive twist of a cliffhanger, the series itself has been officially canceled. So maybe just watch through that season’s villain getting their comeuppance, then shut it down.
