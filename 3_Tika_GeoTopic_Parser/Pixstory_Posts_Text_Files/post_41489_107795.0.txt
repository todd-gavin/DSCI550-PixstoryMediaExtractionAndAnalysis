Rory McIlroy's outstanding opening round at the US Open, where the former world No. 1 made a good start to his campaign for a fifth major championship and first major title since 2014, drew praise from both Brad Faxon and Rich Beem. 

Sky sports reported that the Northern Irishman followed up his victory at the RBC Canadian Open on Sunday with a strong effort at The Country Club, where he carded four birdies and many superb par-saves to take a share of the early lead for the second consecutive major. 

McIlroy's only mistake came on the final hole, when he hit thick rough on his approach and couldn't get up and down, prompting Faxon, a member of McIlroy's teaching staff, to intervene.

â€œHe continued his great putting streak like he had last week in Canada, where he putted brilliantly," Faxon told Sky Sports News. "I think he played with some fire and some inspiration. We saw some anger while he played and I really think the bogey on the last is probably going to help him.

"It will allow him to stay a little bit upset and maybe play with a little bit more passion. We know how much this means to him, especially being the figurehead that he is worldwide, so to add another national title to his resume would be pretty good!
