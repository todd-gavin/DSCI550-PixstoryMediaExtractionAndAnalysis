Danilo Gallinari a new player for the San Antonio Spurs but the blue will hardly wear the Texan tank top The Atlanta Hawks have included him in a trade that brought Dejounte Murray to Georgia in exchange for Gallinari and three first picks in and in addition to the right to the Spurs to trade the choice with the Hawks in The current million dollar contract of the national winger is not guaranteed and San Antonio will not confirm it making him a de facto free agent but with a substantial part of the salary equal to millions still guaranteed By this solid foundation the search for Gallinari&#39;s new team will start, almost certainly an Eastern Conference franchise with the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat in the front row
