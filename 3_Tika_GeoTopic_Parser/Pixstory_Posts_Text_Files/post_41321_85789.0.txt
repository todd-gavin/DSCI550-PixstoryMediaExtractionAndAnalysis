Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been widely chastised for suggesting that Vladimir Putin be assassinated to cease Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The Guardian reported that Graham first proposed the proposal on Fox News anchor Sean Hannity's show on Thursday evening, and he later reiterated it in a tweet that rapidly went viral. 

"Does Russia have a Brutus?" Is there a Russian military officer who is more successful than Colonel Stauffenberg? On Twitter, Graham stated, "The only way this ends is for someone in Russia to take this guy down." "You would be providing a huge service to your country — and the globe."

Brutus was a Roman ruler Julius Caesar's murderer, while Stauffenberg was a German army lieutenant who was murdered in 1944 for attempting to kill Adolf Hitler. 
"The only people who can solve this are the Russian people," Graham wrote in a subsequent tweet. It's simple to say, but difficult to do. You must stand up to the plate unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness." 

Despite immediate backlash from both the left and right in the United States, Graham reaffirmed his position in a Friday morning interview with Fox & Friends. "I'm hoping that someone in Russia understands that he is destroying Russia, and you need to take this guy out by any means possible,” Graham said.
