To Someone who is going through depression I want to start by saying you are doing the best you can I know you do not hear it often and even when you do a part of you does not accept it Every moment that you spend fighting the demons that others cannot see or understand you are winning Depression feels like a bottomless pit Some days you are doing great Everything feels like it is falling into place But depression can hit you at any moment in time It can engulf your mind fog your thoughts All those times you said I am fine even though you were struggling I hope you know you were doing your best All those times you spent your nights crying silently so that no one heard you I am sorry you had to go through that No one should be alone when they are dealing with their demons I hope you found someone who is a shoulder you can lean on And if you still have not found this person I hope they are right around the corner Depression sometimes feels like a shadow Depression also sometimes looks like smiles and laughter that are a cover up to prevent your real feelings Depression is the cuts that go unnoticed the tears that are carefully hidden from the eyes of the world You are not alone You are appreciated You may not believe that you make a difference but there is someone out there in the world who is glad you are alive or waiting to meet you and is grateful for your existence You are a fighter in your way All your tears and pain are valid You are so loved From A stranger who will listen to you any day
