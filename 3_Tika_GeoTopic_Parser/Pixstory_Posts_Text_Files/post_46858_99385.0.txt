Lucy Stone began to fight against the restrictions placed on the female sex while she was still a girl. Her courage to attend college derived in part from her general desire to better herself.

Lucy Stone was a prominent U.S. orator, abolitionist,  suffragist, and vocal advocate and organizer promoting rights for women. In 1847, Stone became the first woman from Massachusetts to earn a college degree. She spoke out for women's rights and against slavery. Stone was known for using her birth name after marriage, contrary to the custom of women taking their husband's surname.

Stone spoke in front of several legislative bodies to facilitate laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in organizing the Woman's National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by earning woman suffrage at the state and local levels.

Her refusal to take her husband's name, as an assertion of her rights, was controversial then and is largely what she is known for today. Women who continue to use their maiden name after marriage are still occasionally known as "Lucy Stoners" in the United States. In 1986, Stone was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Yes you dont need a surname to live as you are enough!
