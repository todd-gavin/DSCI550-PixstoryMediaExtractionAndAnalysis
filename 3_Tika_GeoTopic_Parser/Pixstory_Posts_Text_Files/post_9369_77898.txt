Strategy to Deter Terrorism continues Two of these resolutions are important the Cease Fire Proposal Resolution of August and the Affirming Resolution of January These two Resolutions are the foundation of the call for a plebiscite that is often made internationally and to which resolutions both India and Pakistan were willing parties it is recorded as such in the second Resolution It is wrong to make out that India is unconditionally committed to holding a plebiscite under UN auspices in Kashmir India is a party to the above mentioned two Resolutions which together may be called the Plebiscite Resolutions of UNCIP These two Resolutions designated here as PR and PR are composite and contain a number of pre conditions on which the holding of a plebiscite is contingent Those pre conditions that devolve on Pakistan have never been met and it is doubtful if Pakistan can ever meet the commitments without an internal upheaval For example Part II A Clause of PR states that the Government of Pakistan agrees to withdraw its troops from that state Part II A Clause amplifies this withdrawal to include Pakistani irregulars as well It is doubtful if any government of Pakistan can carry out these commitments and survive If it could not be done in it certainly cannot be done now The Clauses Part II B Clause read with Clause a of PR moreover require to be implemented by Pakistan prior to India taking any steps or for the UN to schedule a plebiscite Hence the attempt to portray India as a country that has gone back on its international commitment to hold a plebiscite under UN auspices is simply not true instead the UN Resolutions on plebiscite have by now become dead letters because none of the conditions precedent for its implementation obtain Nor I would guess would Pakistan even today be able to meet those conditions constrained as it is by domestic compulsions That is self determination not being an abstract concept is dysfunctional today To be continued
