Barcelona president Joan Laporta made headlines earlier in the week as he said that Lionel Messi's story with the Spanish club is not over. But Barça manager Xavi Hernandez has now come forth and squashed the hopes of the supporters for now. 

Xavi Hernandez made it clear that Barcelona will not be signing Lionel Messi for now. The Barca manager said, "At the moment, Leo has a contract with another club, so it's impossible. It's impossible. It doesn't make sense talking about Messi now."

But Xavi has not dashed out all the hopes of the Barcelona faithful. The Spaniard stated, "Leo is the best footballer in the world and the history of football. We will see in the future. 

Lionel Messi had a tough 2021/22 season at PSG. Owing to this, rumours suggested that Barcelona could sign him back this summer as they have to spend big on the likes of Robert Lewandowski and others. Joan Laporta even stated that  "the story of Leo and Barça will continue."

But this story would need to wait for at least one more season! Messi's  PSG contract ends next season but the Argentine can opt to extend it by another year. It has to be seen what the iconic #10 decides to do in a year.
