Travelling across the length and breadth of India is a great learning experience This is an ancient land in which one can always read the imprints of human activities in different periods of history There is scarcely any part of the country which is untouched by the gamut of human activities in earlier eras But the same is a big challenge for the historian who is forced to rely upon imagination and analysis to re create most of the stories and events in the Silent historical timeline The problem is due to dearth of and at times a total absence of authoritative historical records which can yield a definitive picture To render retelling of stories possible in the absence of historical records the historian relies on the study of coins and inscriptions which have survived as the footprints of those times along with a selective appreciation of legends enshrined in popular tradition and also from documents like the Puranas and others which are often interspersed with legends The details left by foreign travelers like Megasthenes Fa Hien Hieun Tsang Al Beruni Abu Rihan Ferishta Barbosa Tavernier Bernier and the like are invaluable The surveys of Buchanan and Cunningham are very original and interesting works to understand how the histories of several parts of India have been recreated to be told to a new generation I have been fascinated by the great heritage of India and have been visiting historical places and monuments right since my school days in order to unearth imbibe and popularise some untold and uheard stories from these bastions of human activity in the past And a study of such silent edifices of the past has been so interesting that I now must begin to share what I have observed during my tours of different places in India To be continued
