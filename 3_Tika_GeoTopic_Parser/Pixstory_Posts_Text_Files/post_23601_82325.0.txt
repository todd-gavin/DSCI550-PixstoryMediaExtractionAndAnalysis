Telfarglobal presented one of their greatest collection during New York Fashion week last night.

Where they introduced a new bag which is made in a round shape, with its logo recognisable “T” logo in the front. 
The bag comes with a crossbody strap as well as handles. The bag is made of faux leather just like the tote bag. 
The round bag is retailing for US$567. Which is keeping all the fans questioning. Since, the brand’s retail were around US$150 - US$257. 

Also the Telfar Tote has become very popular because of its affordable price . 

What do you think about the price hike ?
