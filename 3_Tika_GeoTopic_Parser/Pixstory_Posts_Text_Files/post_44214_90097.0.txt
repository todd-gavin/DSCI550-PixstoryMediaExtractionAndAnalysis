The greatest rivalry in club football, of course, referring to Barcelona and Real Madrid, has always provided spectacular entertainment and high drama. However, their rivalries have deteriorated with time, leading their fans to despise one another rather than nurture mutual respect.

The players who have played for both of these teams have felt the brunt of this rivalry in the never-ending business of football transfers. Here, we take a look at the best players who have managed to play for both of Spain's long-time rivals.

Luis Figo

When Figo joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2000, he moved from being Barcelona's sweetheart to being the public's worst adversary.

At the time, the Portugal great was the top player in the world. Soon after joining Madrid, he won the Ballon d'Or, largely due to his performances at Barcelona, and his signing was the promise that helped Florentino Perez win the president of the club.

Whenever Figo played at Camp Nou, he was subjected to venomous abuse. "By the second or third corner, I turned to Luis and said: 'Forget it, mate," teammate Michel Salgado stated after being bombarded with missiles during a game in 2002. 'You're on your own,' says the narrator.

"I used to offer Luis the chance to take the short corner, drawing up close to him near the touchline, but not this time. Missiles were raining down from the stands: coins, a knife, a glass whiskey bottle."

Figo made almost 200 appearances for both teams, winning two league titles and the 2002 Champions League with Real Madrid.
