What knowing about mental health did to my life Five years back little did I know about what mental health was and what role does it play in my life. Probably if I didn't know about mental health and the other related concepts to it, it would have been difficult to survive many circumstances because of the thoughts we tend to get, that all of these feelings and thoughts we feel them all alone and no one else have these. An absolute seclusion of thinking, maybe. But thanks to social media, education, health articles and health sector for spreading more of awareness about it via various channels as it do help an individual mould an idea about it. Prioritising my wellbeing is the very first change I could start seeing myself, I started moving away from things that costed my wellbeing which I may or may not give an explanation. This very change has actually made me walk away from moments that could actually get worse if I would have stayed there keeping my wellbeing at risk. I'm glad I could know more about mental health through various mediums, but I do understand the need of the hour where everyone in world need to get an access, acceptance and proper intervention and prevention for their concerns of mental health. It's indeed a global priority and let's be there for one another at the most needful time to listen and to help out and seek help from the rightful person.
