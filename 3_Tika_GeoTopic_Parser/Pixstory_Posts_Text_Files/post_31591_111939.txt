Labor law has always manifested a very precise identity from the point of view of the social function it pursues, it consists in the protective vocation of workers deemed economically, socially and juridically weak. In essence, labor law intervenes where it believes there is a need for to protect, through public order rules or in any case external to the individual negotiation between the parties, a worker who would otherwise be unable to determine the wage conditions of working hours, etc. on a par with the business counterpart. The same more recent expansive trend with regard to other workers like project workers was inspired by acknowledging other situations of weak work deserving of protection Labor law seeks to counterbalance the power disparity between employer and employee One wishes to defend the dignity of the worker Others believe that labor law serves to carry out the function of redistributing income to the advantage of the class historically penalized with respect to the holders of capital Labor law is a strongly social right public order that this is imposed on entrepreneurs by virtue of prevailing reasons of public interest consisting precisely in the protection of subordinate workers This matrix has led to the consolidation in these regulations over time of that attribute of mandatory nature at the individual level which is still their salient feature and according to many opinions is the last bastion of labor law identity
