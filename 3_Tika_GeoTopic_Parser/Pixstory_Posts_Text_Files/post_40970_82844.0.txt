Millie Bobby Brown's parents put everything on the line to give her a chance at her Hollywood aspirations, and now they're seeing them come true. Kelly and Robert, the actresses' beloved parents, are here! 

Millie Bobby Brown has already made an indelible imprint on Hollywood, despite the fact that she is only 18 years old. Millie has been in films such as Godzilla vs. Kong and Enola Holmes since exploding onto the scene as the mysterious star of Stranger Things and becoming one of the youngest candidates for a Primetime Emmy Award. Millie requires a reliable support structure to balance a large career with the frantic nature of growing up, which she happily gets in the form of her parents, Kelly and Robert Brown. Kelly and Robert have been together since the beginning.

Hollywood Reporter reported that Millie (born Marbella) has risen through the ranks of Hollywood's elite, but her down-to-earth parents ensure that she always has true support and recalls her humble beginnings. 

Kelly found out she was expecting Millie in 2003, just as she and Robert were preparing to go to Spain, where Robert's parents owned a restaurant. Millie was born in 2004 and showed an early interest in acting. Her parents reportedly sacrificed everything to support Millie's ambitions, even selling their home to relocate their family from the United Kingdom to Hollywood after an agent offered to represent her.
