Bacne or back acne is a type of acne that occurs on the back of the neck and upper shoulders. It's usually caused by an accumulation of sebum (oil) and bacteria on the back skin, which creates an environment that's conducive to acne growth.
There are a few things that you can do to fight back against back acne:
- Make sure you're using a good body wash or soap every day. This should be tailored to your skin type, and should contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to help break down sebum and kill bacteria.
- Avoid using harsh soaps or scrubs, as they will only make your skin dryer and moreprone to infection. Instead, use gentle cleansers that won't dehydrate your skin.
- Apply moisturizer every day after washing yourself up, even if you don't feel like your back is particularly dry. This will help keep your skin hydrated and barrier-protected.
- Avoid wearing tight clothes around your back area, as they can cause friction and further inflammation. Instead, opt for loose clothing that doesn't constrict movement or breathing.
