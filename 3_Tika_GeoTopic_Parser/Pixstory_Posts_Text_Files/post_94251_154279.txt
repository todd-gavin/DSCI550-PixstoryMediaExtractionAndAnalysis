Journey of how you ended up deciding to volunteer at YWP I met a friend who told me about YWP I was always passionate about working for mental health awareness hence I decided to work with this young and dynamic new project on mental health work That is how I became associated in and since then I have been associated with this organization Journey of your strugglesAll my learning and understanding of team management clinical work research skills from A to Z has come from my time in YWP The opportunity was great because one got to explore and wear multiple hats since it was a small organization that always welcomed initiative and enthusiasm It was the perfect place for growth in the field But I have struggled alot as well in expanding my own personal understanding of mental health awareness in practice And I have battled with my own mental health difficulties in this process However this organization transformed into a family that made the struggles much easier to overcome with their support system and understanding Journey of your close ones who understood the importance of mental healthThrough my time working at YWP I have been pushed to expand the narrative of mental health not just in my work space but also at home and in my personal sphere I was able to share the articles we wrote and the campaigns we ran with friends and family and that helped me to expand their thought process and understanding of mental health bit by bit And anything that you would like to share on a platform For any person passionate about mental health and keen to work in the sphere of Psychology I would highly recommend YWP as the one place to gain exposure and on the job training with excellent leadership and an incredibly supportive work environment The novelty is always maintained because of the founders spirit to keep growing hence I would say the organization has grown alot and at this point it is one of the spearheading forces in the country in mental health work
