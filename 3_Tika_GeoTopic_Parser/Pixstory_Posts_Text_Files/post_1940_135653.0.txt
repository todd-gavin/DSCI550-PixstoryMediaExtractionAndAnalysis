Recently, President Biden made an unexpected and foolish remark in which he ridiculed advocates of the Second Amendment who argue that the right to carry weapons is important to guard against foreign enemies and a tyrannical government. He stated, “For those brave right-wing Americans who say it’s all about keeping America independent and safe, if you want to fight against the country, you need an F-15.”

It doesn't take a genius to recognize how troubling this comment is: the President of the United States making a mockery of American’s for defending themselves against bad actors and tyrannical governments.

Did Joe Biden forget that in 1783, the most advanced army in the world, equipped with lethal weaponry and a large, well-trained army, bent their knees to the continental soldiers and their allies, despite the fact that the continental army was armed with makeshift weapons and lacked knowledge of military tactics? Did he forget that despite our advanced armament, the Middle East is currently filled with dispersed and uncoordinated soldiers armed with improvised and low-grade weapons, but our formidable fighting force has not been able to defeat it?  These are only a few instances of small, relatively weak armies overcoming larger, more formidable ones.

This is obviously not a call to arms, yet Biden's assault on the second amendment and its supporters is additional proof that he is not looking out for the people's best interests.
