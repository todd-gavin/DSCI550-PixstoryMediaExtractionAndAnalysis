Barcelona midfielder Frenkie De Jong could be on the move this season, with Premier League
clubs Arsenal and Manchester United reporting interest in the player.

Barcelona will be looking
to sell the player after their financial struggles, with the club releasing talisman Lionel Messi last
year because of the same.

According to reports, Arsenal seem to be a more attractive destination for Frenkie De Jong over
Manchester United. While joining Manchester United could be appealing for the player as he
could link up with previous Ajax manager Ten Hag, the player indicates wanting the join the
Gunners.

The 25 year old has spoken in the past of wanting to play for Gunners like fellow Dutchman
Marc Overmars. While Frenkie De Jong had a proposal to join Arsenal in 2019, he decided to
join Spanish giants Barcelona instead.

Speaking to Voetbal International back in 2019, he said: "I actually thought Arsenal was pretty
beautiful in the past.

In my mind, I have had the following list for a long time: Ajax-Arsenal-Barcelona, call it the Marc
Overmars route. But yes, if you can go directly to Barcelona, then you are also right where you
want to be. Faster than you ever dared to dream."

If both clubs want to bring De Jong on board, they would have to pay Â£58million to do so. Both
clubs are struggling with quality in the midfield, and signing De Jong would immediately boost
the quality of both teams.

Expect a tough battle for the signature of the player.
