Antonio Conte enters the Italian football Hall of Fame Recognition for a career full of successes as a footballer and as many as a coach This one is still ongoing He currently coaches Tottenham in which he has won almost everything that could be won He is missing only the European and World Cup but both managed to get on the podium with the silver medal in and in For me this award is certainly a source of pride, a great satisfaction he said It means working alongside characters who have made the history of our football such as Sacchi Trapattoni Lippi and Mancini Conte the fifth enter the Hall of Fame In Conte&#39;s palmares there are five league titles he won the UEFA Cup the Champions League and the Intertoto Cup then runner-up in the World in and runner-up in Europe in On the bench he achieved two promotions in Serie A on the Bari and Siena before winning scudettos with Juventus and two Italian Super Cups With Chelsea he triumphed in the Premier League and FA Cup and finally brought the scudetto back to Inter I think in the end the recognition was given considering both my careers as a footballer as a coach also because in both cases I had an important path with the luck and the skill to win practically everything there was to win Unfortunately, I just missed something with the national team
