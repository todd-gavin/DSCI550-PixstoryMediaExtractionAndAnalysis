Lord Buddha was on his way walking from one town to another they happen to pass by a river Lord Buddha took some rest under the cool shade of a tree and asked one of his disciples to get some water from the river As the disciple approached the lake he found that women of the nearby village were washing their clothes men were bathing their cattle children were playing and a bullock cart just crossed the river to get to the other side of the village All this hustle and bustle in the water had compelled the water to become muddy The disciple thought How can I give this water to my master He went back and said Master the water has become too muddy and is unfit for drinking so I came back After some time passed Lord Buddha sent his disciple yet again to fetch water for him The disciple readily went to the river This time nobody was there but still the water was muddy due to all the activities that had happened He went back and said Master the water is still too muddy After some more time passed Lord Buddha sent his disciple yet again to fetch water for him This time there was no muddiness and the water of the river was silent and smooth with clear water the disciple collected some water and took it to Lord Buddha Lord Buddha looked at the water and then looking at the disciple and asked What did you do to make the water clean Nothing his disciple said I have done nothing I just let it be and the mud settled down on its own and I got clear water Lord Buddha said Our human mind is the same When the disturbance of anger or sadness comes it disturbs the sentiments and emotions of the human mind and makes it unclear So when it is disturbed just let it be Relax and give it some time to settle down It will settle down on its own You don t have to put in any effort to calm it down It will happen by itself It is effortless
