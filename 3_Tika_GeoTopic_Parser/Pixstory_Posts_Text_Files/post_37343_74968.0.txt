A local middle school lost a talented, charming, all-rounder student 26 years ago and since then, Class 9-3 has been constantly living on the edge of the knife. When a new boy transfers to their class, it invites unavoidable chaos and deaths of many innocents. 'Another' is a binge-able anime which makes you try to decipher the real culprit behind the happenings at all times by adding new plot details every episode while also proving your deductions wrong at the end. It'll keep you hooked straight to the last episode. It can definitely give you the creeps if you're a pediophobiac.
