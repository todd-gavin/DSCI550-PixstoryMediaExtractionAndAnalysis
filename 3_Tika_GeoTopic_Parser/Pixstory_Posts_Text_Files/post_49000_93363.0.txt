Children's attitudes on animal rights are "dramatically" different from adults', with much greater concern for welfare and a belief that eating animals is "less morally acceptable" than adults.

According to new research from The University of Exeter, children believe farm animals "should be treated the same as people and pets," but their views change as they get older. Children aged 9 to 11 were polled on their views on the moral position and treatment of farm animals (pigs), pets (dogs), and people.


In another study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology in 2021, 176 American children aged four to seven were asked to sort 13 meals according to their origins: plant-based or animal-based. Though some inaccuracy was unavoidable when working with such young children, the outcomes are eye-opening.

 "All animal-based foods — with the sole exception of milk — were sorted incorrectly by at least 30 percent of children," the paper states. "With respect to meats, the percent of children claiming that hamburgers, hot dogs, and bacon come from plants ranged from 36 percent to 41 percent. Even chicken nuggets, a food that has an animal in its name, were categorized as a plant-based food by more than a third of the children in our sample."

Both these studies suggest that children do not want to be the participants of the cruel animal agriculture industry, and when they are we tend to hide the horrors of the industry from them. If kids are being lied to about where what they eat comes from, shouldn't we introspect whether our choice to eat that is even moral? Especially when you can get the same nutrients and the same taste without the violence. Of course some people cannot go plant based, but if we can why shouldn't we? Why do we need force our children to indulge in something they stand morally against without even needing it?
