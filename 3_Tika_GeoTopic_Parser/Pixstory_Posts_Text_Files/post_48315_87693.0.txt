Liverpool take on Arsenal in a crucial match for the title and the race for top 4. Both teams are coming in to the match in great form. Liverpool have won their last 8 games on the trott while Arsenal have won 5 matches consecutively. The two teams have already faced one other twice this season, once in the league and once in the Carabao Cup with Liverpool coming out on the top on both occasions. This match will be crucial for Liverpool as if they win, they'll be just 1 point behind Manchester City in the league table. It has been an astonishing turnaround for the Reds as the title race seemed done and dusted in January with Liverpool being 12 points behind their title rivals Manchester City. But City's stumbles in the league accompanied by Liverpool's 8 game win streak have put the Merseyside outfit in a great position to challenge for the title. Arsenal have also shown great form since the turn of the year and have rejuvenated their push for the top 4. They've not played Champions League football since the 2016/2017 season and returning to that competition will be a big success for them. Saka, Odegaard & Martnelli have been in great form for the North London club since the Arsenal switched to a 4-3-3. For Liverpool the new signing, Luis Diaz has really been a bright spark with Salah and Mane also getting goals. Liverpool have also been solid at the back conceding just 2 goals in their last 8 Premier League matches with Matip and Van Dijk being imperious at the back. The Liverpool keeper Allison has also been in good form and is pushing for the golden glove this season. According to me the match will be a closely fought affair with the game being won by the team that controls the midfield. Arsenal have played well but are yet to prove themselves against top quality opponents while as Liverpool might have that extra boost due to City's draw at Palace. I'm going for a 2-1 Liverpool win. This match may be a season defining one for both teams.
