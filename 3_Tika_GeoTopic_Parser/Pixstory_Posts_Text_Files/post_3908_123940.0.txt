So this trip took almost 4 months of planning and it was a trip that got postponed most of them time due to the commitments each of the trip mates had. Finally we fixed on a date and this time I had decided on going for this trip with my friend whose hometown is alleppey no matter who is not there on this trip. 

And finally that day came and for some reason my speculations were right and it was just me and my friend who went on this trip. 

This journey was something I was really looking forward to and it gave me all the vibes of Alleppey. The visit to toddy shop, a boat ride and the highlight of visiting the Alleppy beach. 

All the hypes that my friend gave me was worth it. 

The beach was the best. 

The moment when the waters washed my feet it was a welcome back call that I got from this water friend of mine whom i visited months ago. 

The sky, the water, the sand, each moment of that evening was purely a bliss.  

I loved those two days of joy, love, the hospitality and the care, it was truly one of the best journeys I have ever had in my life. And all thanks to my friend ❤️.
