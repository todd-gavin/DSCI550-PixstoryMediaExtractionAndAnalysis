Between parks and museums I got hungry But after so much beauty I was really looking for a place that matched my cultural Saturday So I went to one of my favorite places The Bar right next to the Gallery of Modern Art A garden restaurant if we want to be international markets which boasts one of the most prominent and privileged positions in Milan between Montenapoleone and Porta Venezia inside the garden of the Villa Reale A unique project of its kind with a secret whose clues can already be revealed by the name The Bar does not derive from the Sicilian dialect and means precisely the bar but it also means the Lu bar to recall the names of the creator brothers Lucrezia Lucilla and Ludovico Bonaccorsi who in gave life to this innovative concept in Sicily and in brought it to sa Milan Their purpose is only one to ennoble and elevate Sicilian street food on the tones of Milanese elegance and prestige It is a pity not being able to convey the flavor of what I have tasted you really have to go there in person
