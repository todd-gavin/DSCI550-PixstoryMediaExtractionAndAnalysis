I moved to a new city at the age of 18,
While being away from family and friends, I learned the hustle and bustle of this new place all on my own.

It wasn’t easy one bit. Everyday felt like a new challenge, a new obstacle. And when you don’t have your parents to confide your sadness and problems to, you learn to be there for yourself.

What’s most important is to find your- WHY.
Your purpose, your meaning. Once that’s known, things seem to fall into place one by one. 

Recovered from mental health is a journey with it’s ups and downs. It was never easy and it never will be easy. 
Take it one step, one day at a time. 
Find your WHY and know HOW to work on it.
