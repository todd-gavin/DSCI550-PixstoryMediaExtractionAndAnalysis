The fifth episode of Obi Wan Kenobi is out and surprisingly it was very good Shoddy direction lazy writing and the gaping plotholes did not seem to ruin the end product even if they posed a bunch of new questions Long story short it was fun The biggest flaw of the whole episode much like all other episode was Reva and Moses Ingram Reva is a bland as hell boring character who from a side character has become the main character and Moses Ingram is just a bad actress no other way to put it At least Obi Wan was back to being the main character in his show somewhat While the reveal of Reva s past was a good way to fill some of the gaps like how does she know that Vader is Anakin and her obsession with finding Kenobi if it is theoretically feasible to assume that by delivering Vader s most hated Jedi she would get a lot closer to him perhaps just enough to kill him The coolest scene here was of Darth Vader being a total badass completely dominating and humiliating Reva to the point he would not even use his lightsaber against her He merely toyed with her using the Force and then stabbed her with her own lightsaber after mocking her in their duel Though of course let practicality go out the window and let her suffer can t let her die because there is one more episode left But the best scene was undoubtedly between Hayden and Ewan duking it out as Anakin and Obi Wan pre AOTC as master student and brothers Even though Hayden did not look in the least both the actors have aged so finely that their age was the last thing on my mind The duel was convincing powerful and a great call back to the prequels which was really nostalgic We also get to see Obi Wan fight more and more like a Jedi Knight and be less of a wuss so things are getting better Excited to see what the last episode has in store hopefully something good and better written
