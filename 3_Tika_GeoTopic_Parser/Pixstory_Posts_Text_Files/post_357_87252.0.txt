Every time I see snow I am reminded of Orhan Pamuk’s beautiful book- Snow

The silence of snow, thought the man sitting just behind the bus driver. If this were the beginning of a poem, he would have called the thing he felt inside him the silence of snow- these were the first few lines from chapter 1.

Snow is nature’s poem.

I wrote it so many times here. I grew up yearning to see snow. Coming from tropical Kerala, snow was a distant dream. It was an aspiration, touching it an achievement, creating a snowman, a dream. Somewhere back of my mind, all these was a sense of achievement. I braved 3 kms from LSE to my hall cutting through the London bridge in heavy snow storm of 2018. Madness. It was so beautiful. Also because I knew I was going to the warmth of my room, a hot coffee and a drink. 

Now take a moment to think of those homeless. All those who I walked past, huddled inside some corner, curled into a small hole between two pillars and at best with the company of their dogs. It’s brutal. As much as I look forward to fresh snow, there is a world out there who dread it. 

It’s such a pity that what is poetic to me is denied to someone who deserves to enjoy it much more than me. 

Snow is poetic to those who have a roof.

With a heavy heart, wishing for a world where everyone can enjoy snow.
