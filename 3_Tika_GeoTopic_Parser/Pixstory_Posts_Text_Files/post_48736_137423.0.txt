The responsibility of modesty has always been put on women and men have constantly gotten away with doing stuff that is deemed unacceptable for women. During this entire roe debate, women have been constantly judged for their sex life, have been slutshamed for being sexually independent and have been policed for choosing for their bodies, but men have not been told one single time to control their own needs which is technically the primary reason for unwanted pregnancy. Reason being, women's needs have always been considered less important than that of a man, especially when it's sexual.
