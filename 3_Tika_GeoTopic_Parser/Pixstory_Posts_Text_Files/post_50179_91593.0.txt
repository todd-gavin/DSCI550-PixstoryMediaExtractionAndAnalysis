At least hundreds of so-far unidentified species of mammals are hiding in plain sight around the world, a new study suggests.

Researchers found that most of these hidden mammals are small bodied, many of them bats, rodents, shrews, and moles.

These unknown mammals are hidden in plain sight partly because most are small and look so much like known animals that biologists have not been able to recognize they are actually a different species, said study co-author Bryan Carstens, a professor of evolution, ecology and organismal biology at The Ohio State University.

“Small, subtle differences in appearance are harder to notice when you’re looking at a tiny animal that weighs 10 grams than when you’re looking at something that is human-sized,” Carstens said.

“You can’t tell they are different species unless you do a genetic analysis.”

The study was published on March 28, 2022, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
