The tale of the first Miracle of Cana is well-known to most of us. At a wedding, Jesus instructs the servants to bring seven jars of water. The water from the well ferments into fine wine. The guests who were without wine are unaware of the miracle, except that the wine is nicer than what was previously offered. Jesus definitely does not refute the concept of drinking.

During the Last Supper, Jesus refers to a glass of wine as His new testament blood, sacrificed for the forgiveness of sins.

While the Bible regularly indicates that alcohol can be beneficial, it portrays drunkenness in a negative way. In reality, the Bible is clearer on this point, with over 72 statements on the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol drinking is a transgression against God.

Drunkenness is forbidden in the scripture. There's no way to get drunk and still be okay to God. Thus, one must keep the consumption of alcohol to moderation.

“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;” – Ephesians 5:18

“For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:” – 1 Peter 4:3

“Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” – 1 Corinthians: 6:9-11
