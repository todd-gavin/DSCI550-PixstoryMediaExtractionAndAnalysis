Matt Reeves has just proved why he s genius again You won t get the colourful tales of a superhero here its a dark gruesome and noir movie which from the very first scene will show you why this is different Reeves has built his Gotham a but like New York a character in itself Throughout the movie the darkness that surrounds Gotham is a metaphor in itself you just can t be ignoring that it s alive as The Batman says he s the shadows Greig Fraser has done a tremendous job with the cinematography its really beautiful how he s potrayed this story through the lens a brilliant job indeed The Music by Michael Giacchino is just perfect it just shows how important background music in a movie is In The Batman Michael Giacchino s music is a character in itself what a score just perfect I couldn t help myseld but scream the lyrics of Something in the Way by Nirvana at the theatre Matt Reeves takes some scenes as inspiration from the previous onscreen iterations of Batman for e g an interrogation scene the car chase scene mirroring The Batman on the wall but he does it better Its like Reeves wanted to show why his batman is The Batman A genius director with knowledge about the comics and the character down to the T Zoe Kravitz is definitely the best onscreen Catwoman ever her movements her dialogue delivery everything symbolises Selina Kylie from the comics Paul Dano as The Riddler brings out an eerie performance he reminded me of Mindhunters for some reason the portrayal of a serial killer by him is magnificent John Turturro as Carmine Falcone for me was a stand out performance for the screentim he got Andy Serkis as Alfred was also very good to show his caring nature Jeffery Wright as Gordon is just too good his chemistry with The Batman is really astonishing Colin Farrell as the Penguin is also pretty good
