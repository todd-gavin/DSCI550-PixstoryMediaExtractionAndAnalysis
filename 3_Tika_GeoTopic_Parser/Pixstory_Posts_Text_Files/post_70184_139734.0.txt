Carlos Pena, the head coach of FC Goa  congratulated the 27-year-old , Brandon Fernandes on his appointment as captain.

“I’m very happy for Brandon because he has the credit of his teammates, people working in the club and all the fans. He’s a good example of loyalty and commitment and is a wonderful individual both on and off the pitch. With his experience and skill-set, all the players in the squad can look to learn from him and develop as a team,” he said.

The former defender also opened up on how Seriton, Glan and Marc will also share the leadership responsibilities.

“Each of them have the ability to lead the team, which is why they have also been selected to the leadership group. I wanted a few captains and not just one, because it facilitates the sharing of opinions and encourages collective thinking,” Pena explained.

Like Brandon, Seriton was also a part of the captaincy group at the Club last season. He further holds the distinction of being the most-capped footballer for the Men in Orange, with 108 appearances across all competitions.

Since joining the Gaurs in 2021, Glan has been one of their vital cogs in the midfield. The 28-year-old’s performances were key as Goa made it to the Hero ISL 2020-21 playoffs, before impressing in the AFC Champions League 2021.

FC Goa will look to lean upon the leadership qualities of Marc Valiente as well, with the Spaniard having led the defence of top Spanish sides like Sevilla and Real Valladolid previously. The 35-year-old was once also the captain of the Barcelona B side that featured the likes of Carlos Pena.
