Florida recently lost hosting privileges: a large gaming event that was to be held in the state, was cancelled by the organizers of Games Done Quick, who cited the state’s anti-LGBTQI+ laws and its COVID negligence. “While we would love to return in-person, we’ve determined that to provide a safe and welcoming event to all, it was best that we move away from our originally planned location in Florida,” the website for Games Done Quick says. “Given the state’s continued disregard for COVID-19’s dangers (including anti-mandate vaccination policies) and an increased aggression toward LGBTQ+ individuals, including the law colloquially known as ‘Don’t Say Gay,’ we do not believe it is a safe place for our community at this time.”Games Done Quick is a series of charity video game marathons that feature high-level gameplay by speedrunners to raise money for charities like Doctors Without Borders and the Prevent Cancer Foundation.Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law attempts to erase any possible conversations about LGBTQI+ folks in classrooms.“Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,” it states. At what point is it “age appropriate” to let children know that they have the right to be who they are and to love who they love? What is the measure used to determine that it is “developmentally appropriate” to let children lead with love, and to not internalize toxic gender roles that translate into their own repression projected onto other students for living their truth?LGBTQI+ youth know who they are, and adults need to trust in them, rather than reproducing the violence of a cisgender-heteronormative binary.
