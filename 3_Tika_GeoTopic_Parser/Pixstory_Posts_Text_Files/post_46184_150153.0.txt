We all know what happened to this pad . Well , not everyone is aware ! Either they don't have sisters , daughters , or mothers or they don't know what's going on !
People are not completely aware about menstruation ! Just because you read about it in school textbooks , doesn't means you know everything . Well , it's hard to find a society , a religion or a part of the world that does not find some way to make women feel dirty , guilty , unworthy because of their monthly cycle .
Imagine yourself in the same situation and being told to avoid household items , religious activities , and beliefs . How will you feel ?? Bad obviously !
This is something which needs to be changed ! Periods are natural . Just like men are proud to call some of their hormonal changes natural ; Understand , periods are the same ! A girl goes through 5 tough days . A lot of you might have disliked the movie ‘padman’ or may have been amused with the concept . but it surely was a ray of hope in the change towards PERIODS . And i loved that movie alot . 
Have you ever discussed it with a girl ? Have you ever asked about a girl's pain ?
If you can’t share the pain with a girl , even if she is not known to you . Its natural ! At least Accept , understand and be the support she needs . We need your support and love in these days not your ignorance and weird behaviours through the phase .
You are born bathed in her blood . And yet the world could teach you so easily that when she bleeds the same blood each mother , she isn't a " Sacred " ! 
Why not show the same respect and admiration to a woman who gives birth to you in her reproductive organs and when she bleeds the same blood every month !
Respect Women , Respect periods !
