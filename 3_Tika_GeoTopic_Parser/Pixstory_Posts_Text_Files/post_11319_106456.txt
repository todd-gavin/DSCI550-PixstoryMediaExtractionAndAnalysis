Hot days can cause dehydration heat stroke sunburn and other health issues but can it impact your brain A new study from the T H Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University says hot weather affects cognition and brain function The study looked at two groups of students those who lived in dorms with air conditioning and those who lived where there was no AC The study was one of the first to look at how a heat wave can affect healthy young people Many studies are done on more fragile patients like the elderly or those with health problems but the team wanted to see what impact a heat wave would have on a population younger subjects with no adverse health conditions The study specifically looked at indoor temperatures and cognition While AC might seem like an unnecessary luxury the research shows that the lack of cooling inside buildings during a heat wave has a demonstrable effect on brain function Jose Guillermo Cede o Laurent is a research fellow at Chan and the lead author of the study He explained Most of the research on the health effects of heat has been done in vulnerable populations such as the elderly creating the perception that the general population is not at risk from heat waves To address this blind spot we studied healthy students living in dorms as a natural intervention during a heat wave in Boston Knowing what the risks are across different populations is critical considering that in many cities such as Boston the number of heat waves is projected to increase due to climate change Extreme heat is a public health concern given the growing challenges of climate change Among meteorological phenomena it s the leading cause of death in the United States Many studies on heat waves and their health impacts consider outdoor temperatures but looking at temps inside a home office or dorm is necessary because adults in the US spend an average of of their time indoors Sources
