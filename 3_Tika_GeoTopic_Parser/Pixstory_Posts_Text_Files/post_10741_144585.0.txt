Introduction of super-sub rule could be a game changer for T20 format: Shastri


Kolkata: In a first of its kind, Legends League Cricket (LLC) introduced a super-sub rule as the tournament kicked off with a special benefit match between India Maharajas and Team World Giants at the Eden Gardens Stadium in Kolkata tonight.

The unique rule states that one “super substitute” will be available for each team which they can use after the completion of 10 overs in any inning of the match. However, the teams have to announce the name of these “super sub” players before the start of the game.

Legends League Cricket Match Commissioner Ravi Shastri feels that the introduction of this rule could be a game changer. With the game evolving every year, the former India coach says that the rule might be used in international cricket in the future. “I see this game evolving all the time. Who knows tomorrow it might be something that’s used even at the international level. Don’t be surprised because this is one format that can evolve, especially in tournaments like these where you are not bound by certain rules. You can create your own rules in tournaments like these or even in the IPL, or Big Bash. If you want to experiment or try something new, this is the place to do it,” the former India all-rounder said in Kolkata on Friday.

The league phase of the tournament will start from September 17 and will feature four teams in Gujarat Giants, India Capitals, Manipal Tigers and Bhilwara Kings. Around 90 cricketing greats will take part in 16 matches across 6 venues.

Speaking about LLC and his role in the tournament, Shastri said, “It’s a fabulous opportunity. It’s a new string to the bow. Sometimes, it can just be the motivator that is needed to keep yourself fit and engage in something different. I am always ready and willing to work for the benefit of the sport and to promote the sport in different parts of the globe.”
