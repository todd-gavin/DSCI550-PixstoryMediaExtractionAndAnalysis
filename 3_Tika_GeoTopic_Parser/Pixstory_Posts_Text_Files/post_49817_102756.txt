The limit had surpassed many years ago still many are getting killed and aren t the overflow of guns responsible America is one of the countries that stand in front of gun violence and isn t the second amendment responsible for this broken nation Yes I call it broken due to the holes guns had put into the lives of many people which are irreplaceable can any pro guns possibly calm down the grief of mothers who lost children Has the second amendment given unlimited freedom to destroy America Has the second amendment promised guns in schools Then why does anyone have to carry it Aren t Americans taking the law for granted Simple question a household with guns and without guns which tends to pose threat or violence Houses may not be safe and may not have protection does a gun ensure protection or a crime scene with bloodshed Many fewer instances wherein guns are used for self defence Is a gun the only way for self defence Many countries have proved themselves safer without guns Americans have a deep rooted fear and prejudice that they can t live without guns guns are ingrained in us Culture is one thing but we have fought against many cultural aspects that were harmful to human beings such as slavery and partriachal notions Isn t it time we do that to guns If not a complete disposal of guns we can bring in stricter gun control and even strict background checks and training for gun owners We can no longer tolerate tragedies in America and make its legacy mass shootings and killing of innocent children and teachers who provide education
