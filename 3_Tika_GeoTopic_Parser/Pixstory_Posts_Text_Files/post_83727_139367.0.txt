Parents all over the world want their children to succeed in life, and the most well-known way to do so is through education, so parents encourage and reward their children for doing so. However, when their child shows talent and hard work, they take pride in it, as they should. Unfortunately, most parents' pride grows to an unhealthy degree because of their competition with other parents and their expectations skyrocket, rivalling their love for their own child.
This is excruciatingly painful for the child because his parents constantly compare and compete with other parents.
Eventually, the child will feel unloved and stressed.
And the parents' goal of instilling in their child a desire for excellence and success is lost in the process. The child thinks I started studying because I thought it would make my parents happy and make them love me more. As I study, their expectations rise, leaving more room for disappointment. So I'd rather not study and instead do something that my parents have always advised me against. As a result, their academic performance starts to suffer.
