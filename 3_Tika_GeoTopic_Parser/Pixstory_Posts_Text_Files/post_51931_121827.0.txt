Queen of Jhansi state, Laxmi Bai, known for her bravery and sacrifice during freedom struggle was borne at Bhadaini locality along the Ganges in Kashi, now, Varanasi on November 19, 1835 and died on June 17, 1858,, near Gwalior). She was a leader of the Indian Mutiny of 1857–58. She breathed her last , fighting against the British force.

Lakshmi Bai is remembered for her valour during the Indian Mutiny of 1857–58. During a siege of the fort of Jhansi, Bai offered stiff resistance to the invading forces and did not surrender even after her troops were overwhelmed. She was later killed in combat
Brought up in the household of the peshwa (ruler) Baji Rao II, Lakshmi Bai had an unusual upbringing for a Brahman girl. Growing up with the boys in the peshwa’s court, she was trained in martial arts and became proficient in sword fighting and riding. She married the maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, but was widowed without bearing a surviving heir to the throne. Following established Hindu tradition, just before his death the maharaja adopted a boy as his heir. Lord Dalhousie, the British governor-general of India, refused to recognize the adopted heir and annexed Jhansi in accordance with the doctrine of lapse. An agent of the East India Company was posted in the small kingdom to look after administrative matters.

The 22-year-old queen refused to cede Jhansi to the British. Shortly after the beginning of the mutiny in 1857, which broke out in Meerut, Lakshmi Bai was proclaimed the regent of Jhansi, being its Queen.
A very good Rani Laxmi Bai memorial place has been constructed at Bhadauni area of Varanasi.
