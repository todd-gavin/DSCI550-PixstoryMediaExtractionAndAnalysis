For B-town stars, any day without their workout sessions seems to be incomplete and hence, many of them love to keep up with their routines religiously. Speaking of this, Janhvi Kapoor was snapped after her Pilates session in the city on Friday. Janhvi opted for maroon colour jeggings and black full sleeves top. She also wore a mask adhering to COVID 19 protocols. 
Janhvi Kapoor was last seen in Roohi, a horror comedy. She will be next seen in Good Luck Jerry and Mr and Mrs Mahi. The actress also has Dostana 2 and Takht in her kitty.
