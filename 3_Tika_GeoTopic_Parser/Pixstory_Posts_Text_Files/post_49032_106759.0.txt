Think about it.

A lot of self help books , I have come to realize, take the same route as a religious book. Of course a lot of them don't have a prophet or a God, but they do thrive on the same goal. Belief. They make you believe that they will change your life if you follow their guidance, much like religion. The fear of failure becomes just as big as the fear of God many times.

It is not necessarily a bad thing per se. Religions can be a good thing. They make you spiritually and mentally stronger when you're aware of what you're doing. That give you wisdom and understanding of how different things work. Faith is a powerful tool. As much as it can be used as a good thing, it can turn bad very soon. Obsession with following a religion takes us down a bloody road, and while it won't turn bloody (or so I hope!), obsession with self help books take you down not only a self destructive road but also makes you dismiss other people's struggles. We start to believe if something's helping us, it will help them much like how we believe our 'God's way' is the only way. We fail to realize every person is different.

Makes me wonder if we weren't so far ahead in technologies, would these self help books have been turned into religions by now.
