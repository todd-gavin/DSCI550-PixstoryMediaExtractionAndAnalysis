An experiment in Dyarchy continues.....

“It is undoubtedly true that a very large number of Hindus and Sikhs were killed and their women abducted. It is also true that a considerable number of Muslims were killed and a number of their women were abducted. The wave of insanity that prevailed in the East and West Punjab took hold of the State territory and with its vast area, limited resources, a scanty number of troops and police, with practically no means of communications, it was not possible for any human agency to meet this unexpected and sudden trouble but I can assure you that no efforts were spared to stop it and it was actually stopped in a much shorter time than it was stopped elsewhere. 

“After 30th October ... killing continued. Since then the Muslims suffered the most in parts of Udhampur and Riasi Districts and in parts of Kathua and Jammu Districts. Two convoys of Muslims under military protections were attacked. Both these convoys were being evacuated under the commands of an Indian Brigadier. The Indian military took very strong action against the attackers and killed about 100 of 120 of the attackers with my full approval and the approval of His Highness as we were definitely of the opinion that a very strong action was needed to stop the process of mutual killing started by the communities. The Muslim population in a part of the Riasi District on the side of the Chenab, in Bhadarwa and Kishtwar and in the Rajouri area became very aggressive after 30th October. In these parts the Hindu and Sikh population has been practically wiped out and a very large number of their women have been abducted and are in the possession of the local Muslim population. In the Mirpur District, the Hindu and Sikh population has been exterminated.
