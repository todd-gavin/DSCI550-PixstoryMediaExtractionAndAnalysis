When David Silva made his Manchester City debut in 2010, he was surrounded by some 
exceptional players, but it didn't take long for the little genius to stand out.

Silva was at the core of City's transition into one of Europe's top clubs after coming from Valencia in 2010. We've looked back at the City team he first joined, with his competitive debut coming in August 2010 in a 0-0 draw against Tottenham.

Here, we look at who David Silva's teammates were at that particular match and where they are currently.

Joe Hart

It's much more pleasant to think of Hart as one of England's most promising goalkeeping 
prospects than as one of England's least promising goalkeeping prospects who was recently released by Burnley.

Micah Richards

Richards, like Hart, had just turned 22 at the time of Silva's debut and was regarded as one of England's best promising talents.

The defender was a significant role in City's first Premier League title win with Silva, getting a 
nomination for the club's Player of the Year award, but injury plagued his career after he joined Aston Villa in 2015. Despite the fact that Richards didn't leave Villa Park until 2019, he last played for the club in October 2016.

Kolo Toure

Toure became an immensely popular character wherever he has played after joining the Etihad 
in 2010 with his brother Yaya. The defender made an impression on Brendan Rodgers at Celtic and is currently a coach at Leicester City under the former Liverpool manager.

Vincent Kompany

Kompany departed Manchester City in 2019 to return to Anderlecht as a player-manager, 
arguably the best leader the club has ever had. He stepped down to focus on becoming a player after the team's worst start to a league season since 1998-99.
