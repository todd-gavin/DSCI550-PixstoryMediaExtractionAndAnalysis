Calling for violence and misuse of freedom of speech isn t just wrong it s also dangerous It can lead to chaos and destruction not to mention the harm that it does to innocent people When you call for violence against a minority group you are putting them in danger This is because they may become the target of violence from others who hear your call This can result in higher rates of hate crimes against them Andrew Tate called for violence on women He asked young boys to hit women and to force themselves on her He told them that rape victims are responsible for their horrors Using freedom of speech as an excuse for such behavior sends a message to other people that their opinions don t matter they can be silenced simply by using violent means This undermines democracy and denigrates the principles on which our society is founded Anyone who engages in this behaviour should be ashamed of themselves
