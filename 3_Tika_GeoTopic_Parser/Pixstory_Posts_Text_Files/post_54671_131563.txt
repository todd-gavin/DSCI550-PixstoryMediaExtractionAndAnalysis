 To see a world in a grain of sand the opening sentence of the poem by William Blake is an oft used phrase that also captures some of what geologists do We observe the composition of mineral grains smaller than the width of a human hair Then we extrapolate the chemical processes they suggest to ponder the construction of our planet itself Now we ve taken that minute attention to new heights connecting tiny grains to Earth s place in the galactic environment Looking out to the universe At an even larger scale astrophysicists seek to understand the universe and our place in it They use laws of physics to develop models that describe the orbits of astronomical objects Although we may think of the planet s surface as something shaped by processes entirely within Earth itself our planet has undoubtedly felt the effects of its cosmic environment This includes periodic changes in Earth s orbit variations in the Sun s output gamma ray bursts and of course meteorite impacts Just looking at the Moon and its pockmarked surface should remind us of that given Earth is more than times more massive than its grey satellite In fact recent work has pointed to the importance of meteorite impacts in the production of continental crust on Earth helping to form buoyant seeds that floated on the outermost layer of our planet in its youth We and our international team of colleagues have now identified a rhythm in the production of this early continental crust and the tempo points to a truly grand driving mechanism This work has just been published in the journal Geology The rhythm of crust production on Earth Many rocks on Earth form from molten or semi molten magma This magma is derived either directly from the mantle the predominantly solid but slowly flowing layer below the planet s crust or from recooking even older bits of pre existing crust As liquid magma cools it eventually freezes into solid rock Read more
