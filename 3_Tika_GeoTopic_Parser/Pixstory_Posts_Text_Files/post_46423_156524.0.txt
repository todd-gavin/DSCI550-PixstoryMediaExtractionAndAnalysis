Do you always have a packet of ENO in your packed ? Do you often feel a burning sensation in your chest and a sore taste in your mouth ?? You might be a victim of acid reflux and heartburn ! Of course , the flavours they sell it in are only for more sales !What happens during heartburn and acid reflux ?? When the food passes through the oesophagus ( the food pipe ) into our stomach , the lower oesophageal sphincter , a muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus , prevents the food from moving back up the pipe  . If the LES opens too often or does not close like it is supposed to , the acids in our stomach can move up the oesophagus . This phenomenon is called acid reflux or acidity !1 Obesity - If you are overweight or obese , the added pressure on your abdomen and stomach can cause the acidity and heartburn .2 Food and Beverage - Certain foods and beverages can trigger acid reflux and heartburn in many people . Some of these are onion , citrus fruits , tomato based products , fatty and fried foods , peppermint , chocolate , spicy food , alcohol , carbonated drinks and caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea .3 Hiatal Hernia - This condition occurs when a part of your stomach lies within your chest rather than your abdomen and affects how the LES functions . If the LES fails to work because of the hernia , it can cause acid reflux and heartburn .4 Bad lifestyle habits - Poor lifestyle choices and bad habits , such as smoking , eating large meals , lying down immediately after meals and eating close to bedtime are also common reasons for acidity and heartburn . Take care of your health ! And thank me later !âœ…
