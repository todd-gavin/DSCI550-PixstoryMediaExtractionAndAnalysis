With almost 1.5 million visitors expected to arrive in Qatar for the FIFA World Cup and six million annual visitors by 2030, Qatar Tourism has offered to waive all fees related to training and awarding licenses for tour guides.
Qatar Tourism said training continues to be held on a rolling basis and the number of licensed tour guides has more than doubled since October last year.
However, it calls on residents to join as tour guides as the demand continues to soar.
Jobs in Qatar
All necessary training to work with tourism companies in Qatar and provide guided tours across the country will be provided.
Applicants must be over 21 years of age and hold a valid Qatar ID to be eligible for the programme.
The training is available in English and Arabic, and candidates with diverse language capabilities are encouraged to apply. Online applications are being accepted through Qatar Tourism website.
For the current year, and in an effort to encourage uptake of the programme, Qatar Tourism has waived all fees related to training, licensing and exams.
By completing the programme, tour guides will be able to help visitors navigate everything from the country’s cultural hotspots to food destinations; provide tips and tricks to business and leisure travellers and give them a better understanding of the history, culture and traditions of their country.
