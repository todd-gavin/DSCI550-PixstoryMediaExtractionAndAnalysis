Willis Reed had a significant thigh injury in the fifth game of the 1970 NBA Finals, forcing him to miss Game 6 and leaving him questionable for Game 7 at Madison Square Garden.

Reed stormed onto the Garden court during warmups before the series' last game in spectacular fashion. He made the opening two shots of the game, throwing the Knicks fans into a frenzy.

Reed's lone points in the game came from those two buckets. Clyde Frazier took taken the spotlight after that. He had one of the best postseason performances in NBA history, scoring 36 points and dishing out 18 assists to lead the Knickerbockers to their first title in franchise history, a 113-99 triumph.

The first 14 moments on this list may be disputed indefinitely, but Willis Reed's heroics and Clyde's leadership comfortably secured the team's first ever championshipâ€”it's clincher as the best Knicks moment ever on the Madison Square Garden parquet.
