Adriana Leon, a Canadian international, has signed a two-year contract with Manchester United. She spent three and a half seasons with the East London club, making 59 appearances and scoring 13 goals, but Leon declined the offer of a new contract.

The adaptable forward has 81 Canada appearances under his belt and was a crucial member of the Olympic Gold-winning squad in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics. Leon ranks among Canada's top 10 all-time goal scorers and has scored 23 goals for his country.

To be the first Canadian woman to play for Manchester United fills me with enormous pride and excitement, said Leon, who is beyond happy and honoured to join this historic football club. She can't wait to join this amazing squad and don the fabled red shirt.

Adriana is a player who will excite our fans and offer valuable experience both on and off the field, according to Marc Skinner, the manager of Manchester United's women's team. Skinner was particularly impressed with Adriana's character because she expressed confidence and fearlessness when we discussed her joining Manchester United.

Adriana's ability to switch between positions with ease and fiercely engage in both one-on-one offence and defence will give a lot of variation to the Manchester United club as it develops. Skinner is eager to collaborate closely with Adriana as they pursue success in the future.
