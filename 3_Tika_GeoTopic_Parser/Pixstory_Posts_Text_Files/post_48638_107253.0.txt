In 2015-16, Robin Lopez performed in all 82 games for the Knicks. He was traded to the Chicago Bulls in the Derrick Rose trade in 2016. Now, strangely, there's a potential that he and Rose will be in New York at the same time.

Lopez's tenacity and zeal would be a great addition to the team.

Lopez played for the Orlando Magic in the 2021-22 season, averaging 7.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.5 assists while shooting 55.3 percent from the field. He only appeared in 36 games in his career.

There have been talks about a potential Noel trade, and if that happens, the front staff may contemplate signing Lopez. He'd be a valuable experienced presence for Sims, and he'd be able to contribute substantial minutes, particularly on offence.
