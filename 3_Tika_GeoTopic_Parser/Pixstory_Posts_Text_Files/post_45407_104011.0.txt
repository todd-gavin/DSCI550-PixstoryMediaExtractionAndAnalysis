Midfielder Steven Davis has extended his Rangers contract, the club revealed on their website recently. In honour of his professionalism and consistent loyalty across 10 years at the club, he's been offered a year's renewal. The 37 year old has played for Premier League teams Aston Villa and Fulham in the past, and most recently represented Southampton before returning to Ibrox in 2019.

Sporting Director, Ross Wilson commented: “It’s great that we will continue to have Steven’s influence and understanding of Rangers with the group over the course of the next 12 months."

Davis helped Rangers to a runner's up finish in the Scottish Premiership, but the real highlight of their season was their dream run in Europe, where they made it to the final of the Uefa Europa league before losing to Frankfurt.

Speaking upon signing his new deal, a delighted Davis commented: "I am absolutely delighted. It was a really important season for us last year, and to finish on a high with the Scottish Cup was important for the team and the group and we want to try and kick on again next year now."

Davis is as fresh and excited as ever, coming off a season where he's made 25 appearances.

"Growing up as a Rangers fan, it was always going to be special pulling on the jersey, and I have been very fortunate to do it the number of times that I have and to have some of the memories I have had." Davis added.

"We know success is what is demanded at the club, and you want to play at the highest level possible, and we have shown we are capable of doing that as a group, so it is really important we try to kick on next season and get our hands on more silverware." He concluded.
