We are always drooling over those scrumptious looking food over social media like Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest..but is it only that what looks good on the surface should necessarily taste accordingly? Then, what about simplified college canteens snacks, street corner junk that has become the staple for the localites? 

I'm not born and brought up in Gujrat but fortunately enough, perusing my Masters in this state which I had mistaken for a place with cuisines that are all sweet. But guess what! Their taste bud varies and the range is weirdly varied. There is not one canteen in my campus, there are several and I personally am not a huge fan of Gujrati cuisine and I've tried every possible locals available in the area including the one within our campus. Canteen inside Msu Vadodara is subsidized, you can enjoy your dinner or lunch only be spending 60-70â‚¹.
Yet, Chole Bhature is something I crave from one particular canteen which is right beside my department. Although it is a Northeastern cuisine, the bhature that chacha makes is beyond delicious. Students from every department eagerly waits for the limited break they get only to have this particular food. In a way it unites students from around the corner.
