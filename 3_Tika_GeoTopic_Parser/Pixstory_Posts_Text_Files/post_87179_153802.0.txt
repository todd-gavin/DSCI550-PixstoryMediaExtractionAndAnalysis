Copenhagen and Man City will be up against each other on Matchday 04 of the UEFA Champions League. Copenhagen are on the bottom of the points table in Group G of the UEFA Champions League 2022-23 while Man City sit at the top spot in the points table.
Copenhagen have done poorly in the Champions League this year with the 3 games that they have played so far. They are currently on the bottom spot in their Group Table with 1 drawn and a couple of losses to their name in this year’s Champions League.
Man City have been a beast this season in the Champions League. In the Premier League, it took them some time to regain their form but this team is looking a different outfit since the arrival of Erling Haaland. They have won all three of their games  in the UCL this season.

Although Copenhagen will be playing this game against Man City in front of their home crowd in Denmark, they are no match to the giant Man City right now. The visitors have been running riots this season in the UCL and we expect them to do the same in this game.
