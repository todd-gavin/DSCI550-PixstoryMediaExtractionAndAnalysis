According to Myntra Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nandita Sinha, the size of the Indian fashion e-commerce sector, which is currently at $8-10 billion, is expected to rise 35 percent to around $30 billion in the next five years. 

She stated that the Indian e-commerce business is undergoing a "transformational" period of growth and discussed the rise of channel-less retail. "As businesses, fashion, and retail digitise to the point where 30% of sales are digital," she said, "all channels will coexist in a very symbiotic relationship allowing each channel to thrive and contribute in a meaningful way."
