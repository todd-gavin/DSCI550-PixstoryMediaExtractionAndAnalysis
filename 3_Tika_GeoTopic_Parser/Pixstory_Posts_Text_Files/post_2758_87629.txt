Russia cannot be serious in imposing sanctions on President Biden and other US officials When the US imposes sanctions on individuals whether they are effective in achieving its purpose or not they do have material impact on those individuals But when Russia goes for the purely formal reciprocity it invites ridicule because Biden his son Hillary Clinton and the rest are not likely to have any assets in Russia which would get frozen and none of them would be disheartened by any ban on their visit to that country The Russian Foreign Ministry said the sanctions were being applied on the basis of reciprocaty after the extremely Russophobic actions of the Biden administration Russia plans to expand the list that includes the Secretary of State Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff National Security Adviser Deputy National Security Adviser and even the White House Press Secretary Since the US had imposed sanctions against the Kremlin press secretary The Russian statement with Roman transliteration however names the US president as Joseph Robinette Biden which refers to the father of the president Biden writes his full name with a Jr at the end White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki in official response to the Russian announcement made fun of it I d first note that President Biden is a junior so they may have sanctioned his dad may he rest in peace She added None of us are planning tourist trips to Russia and none of us have bank accounts we won t be able to access so we will forge ahead Hillary Clinton who does not hold any official position today might ve been surprised but termed it a lifetime achievement award Not reciprocating the US sanctions might ve been a more preferable course of action for Russia as this move has only highlighted the asymmetry between the balance of economic power between the two countries The US dollar is the world s reserve currency while the Russia ruble is tumbling down And Russian officials park their money in the West while nobody from the West would be holding any assets in Russia
