Enter the Dragon: Chinese Invasion 
of Tibet continues...

By late 1956 the Chinese were even sterilizing males in some areas, and forcing Tibetan women to bear children fathered by Chinese’, reported the International Commission for Jurists.

Tibetans were dismembered, vivisected, beheaded, burned, scalded to death, dragged to death by horses or vehicles abused in every way. 

The horrors went on and on. The Han Chinese introduced whole new worlds of cruelty. If there was a hell on earth, it was in Eastern Tibet in 12 1956.’

The thamzing (self-recriminations), which were to become such a feared procedure during the Cultural Revolution later, had also begun in eastern Tibet. When initially no one accused anyone else, they became even more brutal. Gompo Tashi wrote:

‘Now the wives and daughters of the accused men were forced to take part in the public accusation. They were stripped of their clothing in the presence of all, and if the men refused to “confess” to the charges, the women were raped in front of the men. 

There were always enough Chinese soldiers who had not been with a woman for a long time and who were more than willing to participate. 

There were even cases of the man being forced to have intercourse with his wife in front of the others, after which he would be executed, and his daughters and wife then handed over to the Chinese soldiers. There were many cases where monks were disrobed and forced to have intercourse with disrobed nuns, with the Chinese cadre then disdainfully proclaiming such is the religion of the Tibetans and the so-called vows of chastity. Then these monks would be executed and the nuns given to the Chinese soldiers. 

In many areas very few females escaped being raped, regardless of age,and often they were repeatedly raped before being killed.
