After friends I got to see something really nice when it comes to TV series on Netflix this TV series is so well written acted and directed Very intelligently The Good Doctor tells the story of Shaun who is autistic but is amazingly talented and gifted for his understanding of surgery and even spatial genius I don t know if in India we has a sensitivity around autism like there is in some of the developed countries but this series is something everyone must watch to know and understand that autism is just a condition and not some disease We need to accept the brilliance of autistic minds because some autistic legends have created history The ones like Michaelangelo Charles Darwin Steve Jobs Bill Gates and the list goes on I would rate this stars and the effort behind it a out of because it is just so brilliant Apart from the central character each actor has done a brilliant job and the story also highlights the challenging situations that surgeons face on everyday basis The kind of doctors they have in the west is apparent from this series I will recommend it to everyone to atleast watch it once
