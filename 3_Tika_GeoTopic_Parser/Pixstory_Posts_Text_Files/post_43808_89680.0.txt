Hassan Al Thawadi, a Qatar World Cup official, chastised Louis van Gaal for speaking out against the impending finals, implying that the Dutch manager had no concept what the tournament represented for the country and the larger Arab area.

Van Gaal made headlines this week when he called the decision to move the World Cup to the Middle East "ridiculous."

Al Thawadi, on the other hand, believes that Qatar has just as much right to be picked as host as any other footballing nation.

What exactly was said?

"First of all, let me say: for someone with years of experience, who understands how powerful football can be, it is ridiculous to make such a statement," Al Thawadi, whose position as Secretary General of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy in Qatar involves preparing the nation's infrastructure for the upcoming finals, responded to beIN Sports.

"He probably hasn't made much effort to understand what football means for Qatar and the Arab world.

"He should take some time to see what the recent Arab Cup has meant for the people here. Then you see the passion in the Arab world, then you see what football means to us.

"It's not a ridiculous notion that an Arab nation hosts the World Cup."

What did Van Gaal have to say about it?

When asked for his thoughts on the venue, the former Ajax, Barcelona, and Manchester United coach, who secured the Oranje's participation in Qatar last year, didn't hold back.

"I have already mentioned it in previous press conferences. I think it's ridiculous that the World Cup is there," he told reporters on Monday.

â€œWe are playing in a country that FIFA says they want to develop football there. That's bulls*it, but it doesn't matter. It's about money, about commercial interests. That matters in FIFA.

"I can say that in Qatar later, but that won't help the world get rid of this problem."
