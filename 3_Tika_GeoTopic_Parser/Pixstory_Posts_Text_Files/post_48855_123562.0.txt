If you've been on the internet for even a day, you must not be unfamiliar with phrases like "MenToo", "Men are victims too" and of course their most favorite, "All Lives Matter" under posts that are discussing the oppressive issues faced by women. That tactic of trying to shift the conversation from the issue in hand to another - less prevalent one - is called derailment.

Now, it's not the internet that created this. This has been ever-present for ages, it's just that the internet has given a voice to the victims so by proxy, it has always given one to the perpetrator.

It stems from two major places: One, men not liking that women have made a platform for themselves where they can discuss the way they're oppressed freely, and two, them feeling entitled to have their victims speak about the struggles men created for themselves.

The funny part of this all is that the man who derails these discussions has no care for female victims at all. So in the end it's just a hypocritical expectation to ask someone, "hey listen, stop talking about how your community is getting killed and start talking about how my feelings were hurt."

Men have been socially conditioned to have their work done by women to the point they think it's okay to expect that out of women struggling to have basic rights. It's not to say male victims don't exist, but it is to say the main perpetrators of these things are men and they will have to actively work to end it instead of asking and expecting women to do it for them. We're not here to spoonfeed you. We have way too many issues of our own, and unlike you, it's not created by our own kind.

It is totally possible to talk about male victims of abuse without undermining, invalidating and dehumanizing female victims of abuse. But unfortunately all of these "men's rights activists" have only this one thing in common.

Once again, women are not here to do your work. We're already doing enough.
