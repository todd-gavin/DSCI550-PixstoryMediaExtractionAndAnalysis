Had the opportunity this weekend to attend the solo exhibition of artist Divyaman Singh s extensive collection of artworks at the Stainless gallery It s a striking collection worth a peep for sure Some of his work reminds one of the works of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch One cannot look at any of his paintings and not be moved in some way or the other While some of the paintings speak to you and one can feel depths of despair yet others evoke a deep sense of calm and a few even jar the senses Through all his works the artist depicts a collective conscience s journey from despair to hope and living in harmony with elements around us through the pandemic With an undertone of mystique of the universe that the human mind is yet to unleash his creative works meander around the contrasts and connection that supreme elements like the cosmos the oceans draw with respect to human beings who are miniscule tiny specks on the face of the planet yet possess profound and unexplained capabilities to emote endure and accept The two years of pandemic have left their impact on one and all in different ways Divyaman Singh too is not untouched by it and that can be seen as one travels through the rhythm of his paintings Stories of convoluted thoughts deserted hearts and streets in the midst of nature finding its ground yet again flourishing and rejuvenating are showcased in this series The stainless gallery also deserves a mention for its sense of space and display of the paintings It gives one all the privacy one needs in the midst of a crowd to observe and absorb the art displayed there Hope Delhi will have more shows like this one now that things are opening up again
