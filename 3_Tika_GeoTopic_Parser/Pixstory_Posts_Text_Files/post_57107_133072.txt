The attitude of toxic fandom is totally unacceptable perpetuating any idea of abhorrence or toxicity is not a freedom one should be given We do have a right to like or dislike something but that should not promote or support hatred of any kind against someone And most of it is to be blamed on adopting a fan identity when fans think that they have emotionally invested themselves in something then it needs to be protected or defended against everything harming their object of liking Research has shown that when someone in the community of a particular fan group reads a criticism against anything they are a fan of they react defensively and feel personally threatened It gets aggravated when they go on abusing or harming others for their views even bullying them publicly with the help of their fan community It even goes on to propagate the idea of misogyny and racism indeed this is the darkest side of toxic fandom
