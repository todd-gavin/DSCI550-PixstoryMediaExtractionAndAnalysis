Panjsher has always been a special place for me not only because I was born here but also because the whole vibe about the place is unexplainable. 

The moment you enter the valley you are hit by the cool and soothing breeze and fresh air. The valley isn’t explored by many local Afghans due to its security policy but those who managed to legally enter panjsher valley are mesmerized by its beautiful river and sky-high mountains.

As you move along you will see many kebab shops and authentic tea shops from the beginning to the end of the valley. 

The kebab restaurant I visited before the fall of Afghanistan was situated right along the river with a beautiful traditional ambiance. The seating was arranged right in the middle of a huge garden with apple and quince trees around, it also had a swimming pool with water coming straight from the river. We were served freshly made kababs cooked in typical Afghan style along with Afghan bread and chai. 

The fish we had was grilled with butter on charcoal and melted in the mouth. I enjoyed every bit of this outing with my family in the safest heaven of Afghanistan and made a promise with my sisters to buy a summer house right in front of this restaurant for my parents. 

But little did we know that our lives will get upside down with the fall of all other provinces at the hands of the Talibans. I am deeply saddened by this fall and am scared because the Talibans have threatened to attack the last standing province. 

I hope and pray that Panjsher stands tall and strong as it had always like it’s name (five lions). 

May it yet again be the successful focal point of resistance against the draconian Taliban regime.
