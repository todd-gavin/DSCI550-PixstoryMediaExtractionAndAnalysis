An experiment in Dyarchy and it's failure continues .......

Later events made much of these deliberations futile. Slowly and steadily the ruler of each state thought it was wise in the interest of the unity of India to merge his states with it or form unions. Sardar Patelâ€™s greatest contribution as a statesman was his success in wiping out princely states from the map of India. He brought about this result without creating bitterness or animosity by an appeal to the patriotism of the princes for a united India. He, of course, guaranteed them liberal terms in the matter of privy purses and other privileges. it has to be said to the credit of the princes of India that they acted in a patriotic manner and gave full cooperation to the Sardar in making India a country governed by one parliament for the first time in her history. 

One of my main problems when I joined the State was communications. As already stated, there was only one fair weather road 
connecting India at Pathankot with Jammu. 

The telephone and telegraph system worked through Lahore and any message we sent was intercepted by Pakistan. Our wireless code was known to them. Ultimately we changed it. On my request to Sardar Patel, a radio station was set up at Jammu without delay. We were then able to counteract the Pakistani propaganda. Another station was later on built at Srinagar. The telephone and telegraph lines were laid afresh through Pathankot without loss of time.
