Ben White Arsenals Midfield Solution It has today been reported that Elneny is out for an undisclosed amount of time with a reported hamstring injury while Partey is set to miss the next few weeks Lokonga is an option but is far better suited as an Same for potentially Zinchenko although the has such support due to the compact system that sort of short term transition happens With the window shutting on Thursday you re more likely to pay a premium for this profile or of course Youri Tielemans who s supposedly had personal terms agreed for months But should Arsenal not sign anyone or even as an option Ben White could once again prove his Swiss Army knife nature to fill in at this position One of the key benefits for signing White for a premium is his versatility but his adaptability has stood out too Despite being a predominant RCB last season Ben has started the season as a RB will likely continue as that looking flawless so far But with Tomiyasu back Partey Elneny out White as a is one I d be really intrigued to see He played there sometimes for Leeds his aggression but calmness composure passing range anticipation athleticism positioning and willingness to learn could make him a very good homemade solution in an area which is so hard to obtain Moreover Arsenal s current system sees White Zinchenko invert into temporary midfielders especially the latter but White has also found himself with the ball in these areas This concept feels like one I would ve really hoped was tested in pre season but is one which can only enhance your control on the game A very good first touch someone to sit in and around the back with the odd license to go forward be the anchor win duels which he s more than capable to spray passes to help with ball recycling among much more Another example of Arsenal s versatility within the squad an experiment i think would prove to be very successful
