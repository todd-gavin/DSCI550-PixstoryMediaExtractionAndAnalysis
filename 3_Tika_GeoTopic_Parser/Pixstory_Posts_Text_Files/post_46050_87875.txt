Technology is the future and deepfakes are very much a part of it Deep fakes present a wide range of potential and risks Societies may profit from this technology in the future for example in the fields of education healthcare the arts and criminal forensics Coming to its weaponisation what is wrong with it It is very easy to sit in our homes comfortable and safe and talk about ethics of war But we have no idea about what goes on the ground level What it actually takes to protect a country It is a prerogative of every country to defend the nation and its people by hook or by crook Let s talk about Russia for example If Ukraine would have become a NATO member Russia s safety would have been threatened politically and geographically and that s a FACT US and Russia have been enemies for decades now so why would Russia want military drills happening in its neighbour hood Putin has been elected to protect the people of Russia from present and potential threats and they are using deepfakes and AI to do exactly that Moreover even if we don t talk about Russia specifically nuclear weapons decision making in the twenty first century is vastly different from that of the Cold War Countries are developing and updating their nuclear arsenals and working toward utilising AI for warfighting as great power competition has resurfaced The political split between nuclear haves and have nots is expanding and non nuclear governments pursuit of AI is narrowing the technological gap between nuclear and non nuclear states So for the countries who cannot afford weapons deepfakes are a game changer in the area of defence
