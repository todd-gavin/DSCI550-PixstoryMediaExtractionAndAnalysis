Kepler's laws apply:Â -
First Law: Planetary orbits are elliptical with the sun at a focus. 
Second Law: The radius vector from the sun to a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times. 
Third Law: The ratio of the square of the period of revolution and the cube of the ellipse semimajor axis is the same for all planets.

They make a major contribution in Platinary motion of planets.
