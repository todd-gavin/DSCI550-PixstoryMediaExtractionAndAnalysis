It was 2019 when Samsung unveiled its first foldable for the general public in the face of the Galaxy Fold. Since then, a lot has happened in the world of foldables.
Fun fact, it was the Royole Flex Pai, which was the first smartphone to come with a foldable screen. However, when you think of the phone that deserves the title of making foldables popular, well, the honour goes to the OG Samsung Galaxy Fold. So, with a tenure of about 4 years in the foldables business, and 4 generations down, how good are Samsung's latest foldables in comparison to the previous generation models? Read on to know my thoughts about it.
With the launch of the Galaxy Fold, and later on, the Galaxy Flip, consumers were ushered into a new era of how a person can use their smartphone. The ideas were completely new, felt magical, yet had a nostalgic vibe to them. I remember using the first-generation Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Flip smartphones, and how interesting those devices were at the time. However, as innovative as they were, I never really felt confident about their durability.
