Food is a way of celebration for all, and today is the day we celebrate food. It is everywhere around us, most things we do relates to food in some way. It is organised by FAO of United States and is assisted by 
World Food Organization. 
The theme for this year is “Leave NO ONE behind”. The Pandemic came with a lot of hardships as life became stagnant. People lost their jobs and livelihoods. It taught us the meaning of hunger. So this year 
many organizations are invited to come forward to invest in agricultural sector to eradicate hunger. 
This day is to remind us about all those people who suffer from hunger and scrounge around for food while so much food is wasted at every occasion possible.
