Heartbreaks, loneliness, 
and cloves of anxiety wearing a veil of falsified calmness,
Finally clawed me until I was reduced to fine nano particles of ashes, ashes made from the burning pyre of longings and expectations. 

I stare at the face-less wall, 
questioning my existence,
The snoring wall clock sticks its finger into my eyes to make me imbibe the brutal truth!

I am nobody, I was nobody. You, Me and them, we all are made of turquoise emotions detailed with sequins of lovestruck stories and some handful elegy and remorse. 

The hand that extended towards me decades ago promising a lifetime,
Is now caressing the wrinkles of manipulated yesterday. 
The twinkling zephyrs I thought to be my own, 
Is now turning typhoons into supernovae.

The sand in the timer has always been the traitor, 
Betraying you and me,
Seducing her and him,
While the arteries of life loathe for its pulse! 

Letting go the strings of the puppets that once was a part of the timer's opera show,
Will leave me fossiled like the remains of extinction,
Perhaps it would be like taking a stake at heart,
But again, being a history, that will remain mystery,
No amount of radio isotopes and archeological excavations would fill in the colours once lost!

Then the perfect revenge will be served!
