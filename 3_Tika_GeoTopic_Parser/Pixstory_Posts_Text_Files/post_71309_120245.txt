North East Subankhata is the primary club of their region The best players within this place join in in hopes of a possible future in the big league mainstream sports There are various teams such as the Under senior and women s team For football this accounts for more than players During sport seasons several tournaments are organized on a big scale to encourage competition and increased participation The club spreads word when they need new members through their current players and they re eventually inducted based on their potential As mentioned earlier the club has a well established girls team Originally there were players however this number keeps on changing finally evolving around half the initial number It is a known fact that sports is a field dominated by men Women are considered to be physically weak and it is necessitated by the society for them to follow certain norms Thankfully the situation in this region is a little bit better The major profession within this region is farming Women are expected to help their families during proper farming season Unfortunately this season coincides with the football season and that explains the dwindling numbers in the women s team Nevertheless this club has a specific set of women who break that barrier and make it to practice irrespective of what the society dictates This club tries to demolish the gender gap by holding regular practices organizing tournaments and promoting the women s team just as much as men s It prides itself over its women s team and Mr Dewry expresses gratitude for their dedication
