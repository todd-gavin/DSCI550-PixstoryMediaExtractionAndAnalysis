Coach K isn t the last active college basketball great coach Boeheim Izzo Auriemma and John Calipari are still in charge of the programme Coaches like Baylor s Scott Drew and Gonzaga s Mark Few both of whom have been at their schools for more than years and received no seeds in this year s men s tournament are still winning a lot of games at programmes that rely on four year players and consistency Coach K on the other hand has far more clout than the other two Drew has never been referred to as Coach D and fans are primarily watching Gonzaga this season to see Chet Holmgren There doesn t appear to be another generation of Coach Ks on the way The sport s structure has altered as has the reason for its popularity among supporters Coach K has stated that he does not want his retirement to be a source of distraction for his team We can discuss whether or not this is accurate he didn t avoid the distraction by announcing his retirement ahead of time However he is correct in saying that this is their season not his It s not only the players season finally it s their sport too with the old breed of coaches exiting the game
