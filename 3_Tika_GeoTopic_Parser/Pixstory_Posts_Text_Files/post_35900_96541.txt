McKennie yesterday the first steps of the race so better There are not many days left until the end of the season Locatelli still behind I don&#39;t know if he will be able to return before the end of the season These are the words of Massimiliano Allegri in the usual pre-match conference which will see the bianconeri engaged against Sassuolo by Dionisi Locatelli to not return in this last part of the season and therefore Juventus are preparing to embrace him again in the summer for the preparation of the next championship A serious loss for Allegri who now finds himself with the midfield halved due to the stops of Arthur and McKennie
