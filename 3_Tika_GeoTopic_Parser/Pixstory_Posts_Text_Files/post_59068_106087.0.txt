The song has got 167 million views in 2 months. the song is wonderful and I love Harry Styles. 
 
One of the reasons the song got popular is because of Instagram reels. 

Instagram is a great platform to promote or advertise. 

1.7 million reels were made on this song it is not crazy ðŸ˜± the first time I listened to the song was also on the Instagram reels. 

What do you think about Instagram reels and Instagram promotions or advertisements?
