Eating vegetables may not help protect you against heart disease, according to a new study that's triggered strong reactions from critics.

The analysis of the diets of nearly 400,000 British adults found that raw vegetables could benefit the heart, but not cooked vegetables. However, the researchers said any heart-related benefit from vegetables vanished altogether when they accounted for lifestyle factors such as physical activity, smoking, drinking, fruit consumption, red and processed meat consumption, and use of vitamin and mineral supplements.

"Our large study did not find evidence for a protective effect of vegetable intake on the occurrence of CVD [cardiovascular disease]," researcher Qi Feng, an epidemiologist in the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health, told CNN.

"Instead, our analyses show that the seemingly protective effect of vegetable intake against CVD risk is very likely to be accounted for by bias ... related to differences in socioeconomic situation and lifestyle," Feng added.

The study was published Feb. 21 in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition.

The findings challenge a host of previous research showing that a plant-based diet is good for your heart and overall health, including a recent study showing that a young person could live an additional 13 years by eating more vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fruit and nuts.

So it's little surprise that the new study sparked a strong response from experts.

"Although this study found that eating more vegetables wasn't associated with a lower risk of heart and circulatory diseases once other lifestyle and other factors were taken into account, that doesn't mean we should stop eating vegetables," Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, told CNN.
