Acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS is a disease first described in It has now become a worldwide pandemic with approximately million people having been infected with HIV and nearly million having died of AIDS The clinical manifestations of AIDS result principally from failure of the immune system to function normally In the absence of normal immunity AIDS patients are sensitive to opportunistic infections by agents viruses bacteria fungi and protozoans against which a healthy individual would be resistant People with AIDS also suffer a high frequency of some types of cancers particularly lymphomas and Kaposi s sarcoma although it is the opportunistic infections that are responsible for most deaths A vaccine to prevent HIV infection is being actively pursued although several features of the biology of HIV pose difficulties to this approach Alternatively drugs that inhibit virus replication are now providing effective therapies for HIV infected individuals These drugs either act as inhibitors of the HfV reverse transcriptase or of the HIV protease which is an enzyme required for processing viral proteins
