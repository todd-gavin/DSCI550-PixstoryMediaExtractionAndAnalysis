Following viral videos of the incident where she is chased and hectored by a mob of young Hindu men in saffron shawls, Bibi Muskan Khan, a teenage Muslim student from Karnataka, is being admired nationwide for her bravery and defiance, but her tryst with fame came after a prior act of courage.

The mob, who she said were not students from her college, stopped her at the gate of the PES College in south Karnataka’s Mandya town and refused her entry unless she took off her hijab. She refused, instead gunned the accelerator of her scooter and sped past them. 

They rushed in behind her and as she walked towards her class, they mobbed her.

“I was initially scared,” the B Com second year-student told Article 14. “But as soon as I took the name of Allah, I felt courageous and shouted Allahu Akbar.”  

The incident took place amidst controversy and violence in Karnataka over the ban on entry of Muslim girl students  in several colleges across the state. The move comes after Hindu students started wearing saffron coloured scarves and shawls in opposition to hijabs worn by young Muslim women. 

The bravery shown by Muskan was widely hailed, with many calling her (here and here) an icon of the ongoing resistance of young Muslim woman against a hijab ban. It even attracted international attention with Pakistani Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai tweeting: “Refusing to let girls go to school in their hijabs is horrifying. Objectification of women persists — for wearing less or more. Indian leaders must stop the marginalisation of Muslim women.”

Her father Hussain Khan, who runs a gym, described her as a “courageous girl” and said he was proud of her for resisting the mob.  He said her ambition was to be a lawyer.
