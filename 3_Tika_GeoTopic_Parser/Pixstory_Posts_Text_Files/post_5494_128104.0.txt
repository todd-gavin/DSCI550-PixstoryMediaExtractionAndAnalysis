The protection of the environment is one of the Democrats' key positions. However, it seems that this problem has shifted from "we can do better to "we must act now to save the Earth from destruction."  Alexandria ocasio-Cortez, for instance, notoriously said that the world will end in 12 years if climate change was not handled, instilling terror in her fans and driving a new generation to think that our planet is on the verge of annihilation due to climate change.
 
These urgent cries for reform are not novel. People have forecast the end of the world due to the climate crisis for decades, yet the end seems never to be near. Despite all of the statements made by experts about the effects of climate change, it seems that they have all overlooked one crucial factor: that when the environment changes, so does technology.

We have seen the rapid development of technology over the last several decades, and particularly of artificial intelligence over the past few years. Numerous efforts are presently being made to use technology and artificial intelligence to make our systems more efficient and environmentally friendly. In the future decades, it is not improbable that green energy will become cheaper than fossil fuels and that technology will be developed to ameliorate the impacts of fossil fuel use in the past.

We have already seen the positive effects that COVID has on the environment during the year when the world was essentially shut down. With more sophisticated technology that reduces dependency on fossil fuels, we might potentially reverse the trend of climate change that has been seen since the industrial revolution.
