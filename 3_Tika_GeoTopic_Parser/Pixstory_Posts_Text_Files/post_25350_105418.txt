Tine and Sarawat are one of my favourite couples of all times this was my first every Thai series and I love it by all my heart I didn t even knew it was Thai I watch all my KDramas on Netflix and i just saw that its a gay couple and ckicked on it then after a few minutes into the drama i realised that their names and their language both the one being spoken and the one in the backdrops isn t Korean then I got to know its a Thai drama But its the type of drama that gives you butterflies and makes you want to just hug them its a slow burn and there are a lot of moments when you re like just kiss each other already but its a from my side pride recommendations
