Another experience Leveling When we got off in the new housing some of our compatriots were also standing and helping us to carry furniture and buy immediately Among them was a seemingly distinguished compatriot who spoke English fluently His look at us and the way he spoke was sharp disgusting and pessimistic According to him it was as if we had come to difficult refugee camps in Indonesia or Greece I met him and talked So the next day I was moving towards their rooms when it came out of the way I talked from a distance he did not say anything about the weather and the storm that was going on he approached me with a frown with a smile I greeted him he turned around and he was sad and he passed away His body language said that if you help me it s not me I asked the story he was one of the high ranking employees of one of the institutions when he came here and found his position equal to the bodyguards motorcyclists cleaners etc who were transferred from Afghanistan he was a little disappointed and disappointed because he was welcomed and He expected a higher and more stylish attitude towards himself It has caused controversy and selfishness but it has been useless Now it is upset and frustrated because it expects for example to still be called the owner or manager of the owner and to have a higher status The relocation of local colleagues and people at risk from Afghanistan has a constructive impact on them For some this is prestige and for others the status of straw sometimes in terms of a culture of life that creates difficult mass communication situations of course if the displaced people are housed in communal homes Sabir mehtar Ebrahimi New delhi India
