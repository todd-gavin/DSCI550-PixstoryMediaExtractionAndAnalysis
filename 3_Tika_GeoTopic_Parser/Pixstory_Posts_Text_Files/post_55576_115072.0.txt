A favorite of families (and adults!) the world over, Bluey is one of the rare shows — made for kids or otherwise — that might reasonably be called an Instant Classic. 

Following the mostly domestic adventures of 6-year-old Bluey Heeler*, her little sister, Bingo, and their parents Bandit (David McCormack) and Chilli (Melanie Zanetti), Bluey takes as its central concern the inherent value of imaginative play. 

From a magical xylophone that renders its targets utterly motionless to a home “surgery” that follows literal cat-and-mouse procedural logic to a cross-cultural camping experience where the language of play transcends every linguistic barrier, Bluey presents its viewers with a world in which no game is too far outside the imaginative bounds. 

More importantly, it presents a world in which no adult is ever too grown-up to set aside their Grown-Up Worries and join in. Truly: a joy.
