Two teams came to the Premier League season after having contrasting fortunes in the previous season. However, the tides have turned where Arsenal have started the league strongly whereas Liverpool find themselves outside the top four. Both teams go head to head on Sunday at Emirates.

They were 3-2 ahead with 20 minutes to go. However, the defensive lapse cost them three points as the game ended 3-3 at Anfield.
