The temple at Jaimanglagarh seems to have existed since very ancient times since it is regarded as one of the important ‘Shaktipithas’ in India and even as the date of establishment of the Pitha remains unknown, the report mentioned that the site of Goddess Jaimangla was found mentioned in Mithila-tattva-Vimarsa and Mithila Darpan. Jaimangla was also found mentioned in Mithila Mahatmya, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Devi Bhagwat and Pran-Toshini. It was believed that Lord Shiva had killed Tripura Rakshas and established the ‘Pitha’. From folk tales, the team gathered that Jaimanglagarh and Mangalgarh (in Samastipur district at a distance of 14 miles to the east of Jaimanglagarh) were allied sites, and, were in the possession of one king named Mangal. Traditionally Mangalgarh was also known to have been connected in some way with another adjacent site named as Balirajgarh (in Madhubani district, where a Pala inscription was also recovered) and Mangalgarh’s ruler was said to have been a powerful monarch and a contemporary of king Asoka. 

The king of Mangalgarh was said to have extended his sphere of influence up to Jaimanglagarh and discovery of similar punch marked and cast coins at both sites led the exploratory team to believe that these were definitely connected with each other during a particular period. Sri Luro Jha, the then Panda, informed Prof. Choudhary that one Mangal was referred to as king in Devi Bhagwat. It was said that king Mangal was harassed by Asoka. The team had also learnt that the Raja of Balirajgarh had destroyed Mangalgarh, but, in absence of any authentic history of these sites, it was difficult to ascertain the facts out of these confusing statements. The folk-tales, however, did assert that Raja Mangal had established the ‘Pitha’ and named the Goddess Jaimangla.
