Sometimes it may seem like you are constantly pursuing something that is out of reach Our vanity and self esteem which we latch onto the object or subject of our desire are somewhat to blame for this We assume that something must be extremely valuable if we can t afford it Instead of the other way around we want to be worthy of things We constantly have a desire for things we want but can t afford We work our entire lives to attain them but regrettably as soon as we do we want more As rightly said selfishness is the greatest curse of humanity However feeling this way is also normal We can grow addicted to the adrenaline of obtaining it making it one s short term objective Because the highs from achieving are greater than the joys of having It takes a lot of mind and time to start being happy with what one has but with time nothing is impossible
