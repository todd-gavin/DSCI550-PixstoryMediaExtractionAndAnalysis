Update on a short term cocktail party. Pairing up a white Urbanic top with a black fitted jeans and sneakers. Wise choice I'd say. 
Thanks to their clean aesthetics and contrasting tones, black jeans and a white shirt make an excellent pair. The colour combination also provides a traditional touch and is ideal for smart casual occasions.
If you're looking for some interesting colors to use with black and white, you should consider adding green, blue, pink, yellow, red, or lavender. However, both black and white are neutral colors that go well with nearly any color, so there are endless color combinations to try.
