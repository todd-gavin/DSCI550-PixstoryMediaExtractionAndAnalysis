Everton has announced that they will host Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv in a preseason friendly to benefit aid organisations working in the country's war-torn region. On July 29, the two clubs will square off at Goodison Park in the Toffees' final game before to the start of the upcoming Premier League season.

In order to raise money for the victims of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, Kyiv played exhibition games against a number of teams from throughout Europe throughout 2022. They have previously faced Borussia Dortmund, Galatasaray, and Basel, and on Wednesday they will play French team Lyon.

The final match Frank Lampard's team will play before the Premier League season starts is against the Kyiv club. The Merseyside team will go to the United States before that match at the end of July to play Minnesota United and Arsenal before coming back to England to play Blackpool on July 24.

In their opening match of 2022–23, Lampard's club will have a difficult start to the league season when they face the manager's previous team, Chelsea.

On Tuesday, Everton announced that they will host the Ukrainian powerhouses and that all earnings from ticket sales and other matchday activities would be donated to organisations that support those affected by the conflict, which has been raging since February.

Tickets for the game will cost £15 for adults and £5 for those aged 18 and over, with the opportunity for additional donations of £1, £5, or £10.

For the final ten games of the previous campaign, Everton's players wore the emblem of the Disasters Emergency Committee Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal on their shirt sleeves, and in March, they made a donation of $250,000.
