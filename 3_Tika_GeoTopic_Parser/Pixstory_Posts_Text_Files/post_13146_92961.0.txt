The Taliban say the Bureau of Statistics and Information has distributed 1.5 million electronic Identity Card in less than eight months.

The Identity Cards are being distributed as former government officials have expressed concern about the issuance of Afghan citizenship to members of global terrorist groups.

"The Taliban are distributing Afghan Identity Card and passports to members of international terrorist organizations, including al-Qaeda, to hide their ties to international organizations," said Massoud Andarabi, the former Afghan interior minister.

Mr Andrabi claimed that "the Taliban did this in consultation with the Pakistani military."

The Bureau of Statistics and Information recently issued a statement saying that the bureau has 73 centers across the country and has been able to speed up the process of distributing electronic Identity Card.

According to the statistics of this office, 811,858 electronic Identity cards have been issued to men and 688,142 electronic Identity cards have been issued to women.

The distribution of e- Identity Card in Afghanistan has always been accompanied by wide-ranging political controversy.

In recent years, controversy over issues such as the inclusion of ethnicity and nationality has repeatedly delayed the distribution of identity cards.

The process of distributing electronic Identity cards after many controversies finally began in May 1397 and Mohammad Ashraf Ghani was the first person to receive this ID card.
