The rationalization of the bureaucratic control procedures in the stables where the pigs are raised for the production of PDO hams and cured meats of the Made in Italy tradition, as requested by Coldiretti, was successful, as stated by Paolo Carra, vice president of Coldiretti Lombardia in commenting positively on the note from the Ministry of Agricultural, food and forestry policies which introduces the possibility of carrying out multiple checks on farms within the same inspection visit Our stables are going through a delicate phase explains Carra caught between the increases in energy and animal feed with production costs already grown of the swine fever emergency brought about by the invasion of wild boars As if this were not enough continues Carra, companies have found themselves facing new expenses due to the multiplication of photocopy checks in the PDO hams and cured meats circuit, the costs of which are always borne by the farms A difficult and unfair situation that had to be resolved quickly to avoid seeing the national production potential reduced due to ever-increasing costs The Mipaaf communication that arrives after Coldiretti&#39;s requests allows optimization of control procedures Carra concludes This means improve efficiency which on the one hand guarantees the quality of production and on the other allows companies to continue working to ensure food supplies
