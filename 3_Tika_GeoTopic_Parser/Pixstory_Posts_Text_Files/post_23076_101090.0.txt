Yesterday, after coming back from school, I got to thinking about the need for closure and whether finding that closure was overrated or not. It is no secret that my school life was something that I do not recall fondly and whenever I do so, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. 
While people in my life—family friends and colleagues—would say that it was time to move on and things like “it was a long time ago”, while they mean well, sorry to say, it was not their experience. It was mine and it is each to their own when it comes to dealing with their experiences. From personal experience, I have learnt that there is no right way of dealing with the past. There is only your way.
I went to my school in hopes of what I thought I wanted—closure to my horrendous past. But when I exited my school, I did not get that instead I got a realisation. 
Before I tell you what that realisation is, I would have to say that it was amazing to meet my teachers again and awkwardness ceased to exist. Well, to be honest, I was not 17 anymore. I was moving on with my life and to newer adventures. I am in touch with my teachers on social media and boy, do they know what I am up to. I guess, a teacher never stops observing their student till the very end. 
That made me happy—knowing that they are proud of me of what I was able to make of myself post high school. I have had some rough years to say the least—they knew too. But I have outgrown that—something I realised as I spoke to my Chemistry teacher. Seeing the fact that they were proud of me and my achievements gave me a license to be proud of myself too.
