Haute couture fashion week has arrived. From exquisitely crafted dresses to conceptual, state-of-the-art separates in the wildest of fabrications, expect to see theatrical moments both on and off the runway. Day one has already brought us Emma Watson putting a streetwear spin on high fashion. .
To attend the Schiaparelli autumn/winter 2022 couture show, the 32-year-old actor chose an eye-catching ensemble that was the perfect mix of luxury and streetwear style. The standout item was an immediately recognisable black blazer equipped with power shoulders and monumental lapels, from the opening look of Schiaparelli’s spring/summer 2022 couture collection. To balance out the dramatic piece, Watson threw on a crisp white collared shirt, grey skinny jeans, and a chunky pair of black leather Dr Martens Chelsea boots.
