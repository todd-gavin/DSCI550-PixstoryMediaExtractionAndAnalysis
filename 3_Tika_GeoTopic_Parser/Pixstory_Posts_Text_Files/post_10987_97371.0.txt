Khargone, Madhya Pradesh: “Amrita Namkeen kisi Muslim se kisi prakar ka koi vyavahar nahi aur apni dukan se namkeen bhi nahi dunga purn vahishkar ki shapath leta hoon.”



“Amrita Namkeen does not have any business dealings with Muslims and will not sell to them either. I take a pledge to boycott them completely.” 


This is what Hari Om Patidar, a 52-year-old confectionery shop owner, declared on his Facebook page, two days after communal riots erupted in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh (MP), on 10 April 2022, after which the MP government arrested most Muslims, and demolished mainly Muslim properties. 


“I took this pledge because I do not want to associate with them [Muslims], and this should have an impact,” Patidar told Article 14, as he attended to customers from the narrow counter of his small establishment in the corner of the deserted market in Khargone.
They need to realise their mistakes,” he alleged. 


Patidar has been running his shop since 2013, and said that he was not worried about facing losses as a result of his pledge. 


“I used to sell to Muslims earlier but I never bought from them,” he said, adding that the pandemic had slowed business in any case. 


He made his decision after several members of the his Patidar community, a dominant agrarian caste, pledged immediately after the violence on 17 April to economically boycott Muslim residents.

Similar calls have been issued by other Hindu communities in Khargone, including the upper-caste Mahajan community, many of whom took a pledge after the violence to boycott Muslims under the banner of the Sakal Hindu Samaj, a collective with over 500 members, 60 of whom are active, and among those who travelled recently to 11 Khargone tehsils to persuade Hindus to shun Muslims at local fairs.
