A$AP Rocky has been charged in relation to an alleged gunshot in Los Angeles in November 2021, according to the announcement made by Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón on Monday (15 August). 

Hollywood Reporter said that the rapper, real name Rakim Mayers, is accused of using a firearm personally on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic weapon. 

According to a news release from Gascón, "dispersion of a firearm in a public location is a serious offence that could have ended with disastrous results not only for the person targeted but also for innocent bystanders visiting Hollywood."

 "After carefully examining the facts in this case, my office concluded that it was appropriate to add a particular firearm charge."

Let’s see what the future holds for him!
