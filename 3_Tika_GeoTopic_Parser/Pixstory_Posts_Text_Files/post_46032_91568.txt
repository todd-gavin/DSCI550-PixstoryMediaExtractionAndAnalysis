Music is passion that is shared by all People may have different tastes when it comes to music but it is equally enjoyed by all But what exactly makes a song tick What exactly leaves a strong impression in the mind of listeners It s all in the beats According to me beats can make or break a song Yes lyrics are important They give soul to a song but if it is a competition beats win it any day for me When one is enjoying a song or maybe even dancing to it our majority of attention is not on the lyrics but the beats It is the beat of any song which takes us to the dance floor Even when one forgets the lyrics of the song the beats are always on the lips This is because beats straight away touch the heart of a listener One of the prime examples of beats being more important than lyrics is people enjoying songs that are not in their native language Music is something that transcends language Nowadays we see people going gaga over BTS but very few people are fluent in Korean So what makes them such a big sensation It all boils down to beats and rhythm of a song So next time you are enjoying a song pay extra attention to the beats because that is where the real magic lies
