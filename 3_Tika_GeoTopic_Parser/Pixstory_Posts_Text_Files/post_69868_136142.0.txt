Hollywood movie lovers in India can expect a festival feast this year with superhero flicks Black Adam, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Shazam! Fury of the Gods reaching theatres over the next few months, followed by the hugely-anticipated sequel to James Cameron’s Avatar in December.
A robust slate of movies in the second half of the year, following successive hits such as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder in the first half, is expected to help Hollywood maintain or improve its share in the Indian box office this year. Trade experts said American films that are increasingly finding an audience in small towns are driving the need for large-format cinemas in such places, where young viewers closely follow franchises and characters.

In 2019, Hollywood movies made ₹1,250 crore- ₹1,300 crore out of the total ₹4,400 crore made by theatrical releases across languages in India. Hollywood has also rebounded far better than Hindi films in the post-pandemic period.
“Along with large-scale south Indian films, the general perception among audiences today is that Hollywood cinema is best enjoyed in theatres which explains ₹100 crore plus numbers even for a film like Thor that was panned by critics," Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema said. This comes at a time when top Hindi film stars such as Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn have been struggling to woo audiences to theatres to watch their tentpole films, Mohan pointed out.

Close on the heels of Spider-Man: No Way Home that made over ₹218 crore upon its release in India last December, Hollywood has given hits like The Batman ( ₹48.10 crore), Doctor Strange ( ₹130 crore), Top Gun: Maverick ( ₹34.50 crore), Jurassic World Dominion ( ₹68.56 crore) and Thor: Love and Thunder ( ₹101.71 crore) over the past few months.
