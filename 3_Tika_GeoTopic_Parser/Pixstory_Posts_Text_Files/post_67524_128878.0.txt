We all enjoy eating at home and in restaurants, but street food holds a special place in our hearts. When it comes to Indian street food, delicacies like aloo tikka, onion bhajji, kachori, and bhalla papri are simply the tip of the iceberg. The use of large amounts of mayonnaise, butter, and cheese in street food recipes has recently become a weird trend that has taken over the street food scene. This is done to enhance the recipe's rich flavour and deliciousness. However, opinions on this feature among fans of street cuisine vary. Twitter user balsher sidhu used the platform to discuss this, and his tweet quickly gained popularity. 

The Twitter user was making reference to the practise of topping almost every type of street food, including Pav Bhaji, Dosa, Momos, and street-style pasta, with grated cheese or mayonnaise. "(Unpopular?) opinion: Too much mayo and shredded cheese are ruining the Indian street food industry. They merely eliminate the flavours themselves. Indian cuisine is already tasty enough without being drenched in mayo or cheese "In his tweet, he stated. Even though cheese and butter were added, the dish became more tasty and decadent, but the traditional version was spoiled by the extra calories.

Since it was posted, the tweet has accumulated over 21k likes and 2.6k retweets. Many others agreed with the user's first viewpoint that was expressed. "Yess! Let's Indianize Indian Street food again," wrote one user.

What do you think about this trend?
