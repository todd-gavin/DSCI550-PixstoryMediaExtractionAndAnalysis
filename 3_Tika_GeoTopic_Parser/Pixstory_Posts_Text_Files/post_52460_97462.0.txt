Of you know yourself you know world because you're the World.

We try to know different things, different people, different places, different cultures, and everything, but
Do we ever be curious to know ourselves?
No!

We never put efforts to know ourselves because it's Depressing. We cannot think of ourselves going/ doing wrong, We're always good in our Eyes.

You and your Thoughts are Different so Fight with your thoughts, You're Strong.

Try to know yourself, You're the world. You're Unique.
