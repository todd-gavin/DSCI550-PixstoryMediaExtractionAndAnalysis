I think we have reached that point of humanity where you can t just get something done on the basis of emotion It s sad but it is what it is Long gone are the days when people would look at a poster and feel touched This generation is too critical too forward and too out of touch with empathy which is not necessarily a bad thing but it can prove to be tedious to get things done by them Given the short lifespans of people in comparison to the age of the earth the burden of duty for its upkeep falls too heavily on a few generations I believe that caring about the environment entails more than merely asserting that nature is valuable in and of itself In today s society defending the environment can no longer be done solely on the basis of emotion In the past many environmental advertisements have emphasised on Mother Earth and the importance of respecting the Earth simply for being the Earth for giving us what it does While they understand the value of conservation these quotes really don t work on them
