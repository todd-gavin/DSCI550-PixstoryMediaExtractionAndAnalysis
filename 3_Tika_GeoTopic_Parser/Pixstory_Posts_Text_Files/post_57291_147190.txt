Well knowing the correct way to take steam is necessary So grab a big fluffy towel and choose your spot But again comfort is critical so if you re doing this over a sink you ll want to use a chair or stool that offers the right height Otherwise a bowl on a table is your best bet And yes secure your hair so it s off your face and cleanses using a gentle exfoliating cleanser Don t forget to wash your neck too Bring to cups of water to a boil in a kettle or pot depending on the size of the sink or bowl Add a handful of herbs once the water begins to boil and stir Don t forget to reduce the heat cover and simmer for or minutes Then carefully pour into the sink or bowl If you re using essential oils this is the time to add a few drops to the water Have a seat drape your towel over your head and the pot and hold your face inches above the water Raise or lower your head for more or less heat and lift a towel corner to cool off if needed Steam your face for to minutes Please don t do it for more than minutes as it might create some other health issues
