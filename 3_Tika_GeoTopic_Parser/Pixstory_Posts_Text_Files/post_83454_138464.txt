Tracks in my playlist Tracks in my playlist Walking along the streets Passing by the busy nbsp markets Amidst those frown faces I burst my happy packet Tracks in my playlist on loop Takes me to an elated mood Suddenly a touch of charm Takes me from coldness to warmth My favourite playlist Revives my soul to bliss The coldness suddenly vagues away Giving peace a way Happiness pours down from lyrics To my heart I get swayed away with magic Reality being apart Leaving the boredom aside I walk into a lyrical ride
