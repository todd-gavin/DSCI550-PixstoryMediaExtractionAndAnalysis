Tottenham are said to be "highly interested" in signing Christian Eriksen this summer, as they prepare to compete with two Premier League rivals for his services.
Since his incredible recovery for Brentford following his heart scare at the Euros last summer, the Danish star has excelled.
As a result, he was fitted with an ICD so that he could continue to play.
However, his former club, Inter Milan, was forced to release the midfielder due to Serie A restrictions prohibiting him from playing with a defibrillator.
The Bees were able to pounce on him in January, and the 30-year-old has since thrived, even returning to international duty for his country with a bang.
On his international return, he captained Denmark in a friendly match against Serbia when he played at Parken Stadium for the first time since suffering cardiac arrest there during the European Championship.
Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said on Monday that Kasper Schmeichel, who has been the stand-in captain in the absence of the injured Simon Kjaer, made the suggestion to hand the armband to Eriksen.
Eriksen's fine streak continued as he scored his first goal for Brentford against Chelsea in a 4-1 thrashing.
Spurs, where he spent seven seasons before joining Inter Milan in 2020, want to bring him back and are showing more eagerness to close a deal than their rivals.
Manchester United and Newcastle have both been linked with a move for the player.
Antonio Conte, on the other hand, looks to be leading the charge for a reunion with the person who helped Inter win Serie A last season.
Eriksen's contract with Brentford is set to expire in June.
As a result, he'll be available for free transfer at the conclusion of the season.
They'd like to keep the player for a long time.
However, both sides are said to be "relaxed" about the situation right now.
In the end, itâ€™ll be great to see who wins and gets his signature. ....
