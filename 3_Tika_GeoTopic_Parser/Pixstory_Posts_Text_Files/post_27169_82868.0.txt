Final score: Leeds United 2 - 4 Manchester United 

Elland Road was set up for a scintillating day of football. With horrible weather conditions, a pitch filled with slush and a deafening atmosphere meant that ‘magic’ would be needed to tame Leeds United. 

Leeds vs Manchester United, commonly also known as the “War of the Roses”, did not disappoint, with its high-intensity and sometimes rugged football. Both teams pressed, counter-attacked and tested each other’s goalkeepers throughout the game. With an inspired Raphina substitution at HT, Leeds looked like they had turned momentum and were going to score the winner against an inconsistent Man United. However, the heroic 2 assists from Jadon Sancho and a goal and an assist from Bruno Fernandes put the game to bed and Man United took 3 points to Old Trafford. 

In the last half-decade, there has been no other signing that has had the impact that he has had on a Premier League team. Coming to Manchester United from Sporting CP in the middle of the season and instantly uplifting Old Trafford can only be done by a special player, with a leader mentality. Bruno has not only been involved in 20+ goals and assists this season, he has also raised the bar for what fans should expect from the Red Devils. He controlled the midfield, created numerous chances and pressed Leeds’ backline relentlessly. He really is a magnifico in all its senses.

Leeds United now go into the last leg of the season in a relegation battle while Manchester United are fighting to finish in the top 4 and book themselves that golden Champions League spot. We are all curious to see how the season ends for them!
