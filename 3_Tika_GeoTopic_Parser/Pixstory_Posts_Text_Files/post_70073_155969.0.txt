According to Michael Sage, “Experience is a lesson of the past to lessen the burden of the future.”With the election of the President’s post scheduled on October 30, Goa Football Association (GFA) will be looking to bank on an experienced hand to revive its sagging fortunes. And there could be no better person than Jose Welvin Maximo de Menezes to steer the GFA ship.Menezes, who is vying for the top post, is armed with a vast experience of sports administration under his belt, and knows the inner workings of GFA.One of the main issues that needs urgent attention at GFA is the financial aspect. With funds drying up and sponsors unwilling to come on board, Menezes is determined to bring about a turnaround.“GFA needs to work in association with the state government for support. GFA and Goa Football Development Council could work together to promote youth football. There are a couple of sponsors who are ready to come on board if I get elected,” he said.  His biggest achievement, says Menezes, is streamlining various processes at GFA. "During my time as the Hon. General Secretary of GFA, I had ensured that all records were maintained in both forms (manual as well as electronic). My friends from the football fraternity helped me out to complete the registration in double quick time wherein we worked 24 hours non-stop to ensure that our target was achieved," Welvin says proudly. Menezes says that he has the support of football clubs. "Some GFA members and clubs had approached me to contest the election due to my vast experience. I want to tell the 180+ clubs to have trust in me. I had initated several measures during my tenure as secretary viz bringing discipline among players, restricting players to their respective  villages during inter-village tournaments, etc. I can share my experience with the clubs," he said.
