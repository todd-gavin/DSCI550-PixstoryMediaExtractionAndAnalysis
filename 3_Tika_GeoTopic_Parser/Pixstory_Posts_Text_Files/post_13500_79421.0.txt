Thirty-five years ago, on February 6, 1986, Mina Kamal Keshvar, the leader of the Revolutionary Association of Afghan Women, was assassinated. Long before the assassination, he was threatened with death by fundamentalist and extremist groups.

Thirty-five years after her assassination, a similar chapter in the terror and assassination of female protesters and activists in Afghanistan appears to have begun.

The Taliban have detained Zahra Haqparast, a dentist, and Mursal Ayar, a journalist, over the past three days. The two were both women who had protested against the Taliban imposing strict restrictions on women. Before them, Temna Zaryab Kouhestani with her three sisters and Parvaneh Ebrahimkhel with one of her relatives were abducted and taken to an unknown place.

Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the fate and health status of these women. UNAMA has called on the Taliban to clarify immediately where these women are being held. Amnesty International has also called for the immediate release of these women. The Taliban have not yet responded to these requests.

Mina Keshvar Kamal was one of the figures protesting against the Soviet army's invasion of Afghanistan and a serious critic of the Islamist jihadist parties. In 1980, she founded the Revolutionary Society of Afghan Women (RAWA).

Mina Keshvar led protest rallies against the Soviet invasion and wrote an article in Payam-e-Zan. During his trip to Europe, he addressed the Congress of the French Socialist Party and was widely acclaimed.

Mina Keshvar had established schools, hospitals and factories in Pakistan to provide public services to Afghan refugees. Mina Keshvar Kamal was assassinated on October 6, 1986 at the age of 31 in Quetta, Pakistan.

Sources have attributed his assassination to the Khad security organization and other sources to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Islamic Party.
