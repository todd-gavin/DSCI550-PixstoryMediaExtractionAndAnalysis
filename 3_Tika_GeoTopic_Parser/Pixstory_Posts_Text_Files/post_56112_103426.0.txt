Margaret Atwood – You Fit Into Me

you fit into me
like a hook into an eye

a fish hook
an open eye 

So much power is in such short words. Atwood positions a tightly knit couple as hooked together, but while a hook is strong, it isn’t comfortable. Atwood is exploring the idea of imbalanced relationships here. Pain and pleasure are often juxtaposed, but Atwood recognises that these feelings are dimmed. A relationship may feel snug and tight, but what if you’ve merely been hooked like a fish, just waiting to be killed at the opportune moment. She explores the idea of problematic relationships through these very few lines. The poem can also be inferred as being specifically about the gender dynamics of heterosexual love in a patriarchy, or a world in which men primarily hold positions of power throughout society. In such a world, the poem indicates, the romance between men and women is complicated by male dominance and the chance of violence. The association of “you” with the “hook” and “me” with the “eye” also gives the reader a sense that the speaker is likely a woman in a relationship with a man: the hook can be read as a phallic symbol and the eye as a vaginal symbol. A society in which men wield broad structural power over women—even a loving relationship between a man and woman always carries an implicit threat. The man’s power, the poem implies, is always a presence, even when it isn’t enacted violently.

Atwood also makes use of repetition in ‘You Fit Into Me’. It is the use and reuse of a particular technique, word, tone or phrase within a poem. The word “eye” seems at the end of lines two and three, a technique known as epistrophe. Additionally, there are multiple occurrences of words like “into” and “hook” Normally this would not be noteworthy, but when a poem is this short, these moments stick out.
