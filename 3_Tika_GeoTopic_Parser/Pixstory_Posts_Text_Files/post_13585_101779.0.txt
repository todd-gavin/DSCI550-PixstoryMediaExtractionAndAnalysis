The train of life does not stop, nor can our misery be revenge for any oppression and oppression of the past and today. Most of the things in the world that we fight for in ourselves and for ourselves: oppression, injustice, poverty, corruption, etc. are fed by our misery and misery, these conditions make us ordinary and poor people poorer, sad And our anxiety narrows the field for us and forces us to make emergency choices in order to sell ourselves, our work, and our possessions cheaply, and to feed the unequal and oppressive conditions that exist. The governing structures of the world ask us to be compelled and helpless, so much so that we do not enjoy our joys and small possessions, our humble gecko house and the smiles of our children, to reach out to them in search of happiness and bliss. They want us to be trapped and helpless and to kiss the chains of slavery on our own hands and feet. The structures of oppression today are more complex than can be discerned by immature reason and urgency, but contemplation, which requires self-esteem combined with inner security, requires that you do not sell yourself cheaply by begging. And do not make yourself miserable with your own hands.
Enough joy for the smallest achievements and occasions, appreciation of the smallest possessions gives us the peace needed to make a more rational decision, to do a little good in sharing human dignity in this world.
