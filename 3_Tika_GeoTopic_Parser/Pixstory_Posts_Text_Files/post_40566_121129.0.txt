Cricket is an unconventional space. Not everyone makes it to the apex. It requires a lot of consistent hard and smart work.

Cricket was just something I would casually see on television. Who knew a few years later others would be seeing me in it! I was introduced to Cricket in 2000. My parents took me to a local academy. However, there was no professional outlook attached to it. I would practice out of obligation but that soon turned into interest. When I felt that Cricket is a field I can look at professionally, my family was all for it! Every member of my family showed immense support and belief in me. My coach really pushed my boundaries after noticing my capabilities. I followed in his footsteps and that was one of the factors that led me to a successful career. Finally, in 2002, I stepped into my first stadium, the Nehru Stadium. I represented Assam as a part of the Under-14 team. 

There have been a lot of ups and downs in my career. The best moment still stands to be when I was a part of the Mumbai Indians team. I met the one and only Tendulkar sir and what a moment it was! I was in an extreme state of euphoria. Seeing someone who Iâ€™d seen on television so many times was surreal. 

There's a lot more to achieve still! With a strong mindset and my future goals in place, more success is on the way!
