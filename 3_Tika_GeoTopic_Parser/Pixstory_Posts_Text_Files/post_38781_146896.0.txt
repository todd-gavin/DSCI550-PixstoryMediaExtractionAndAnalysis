Jude Bellingham- The Golden Goose Amongst the Big Sharks
Cristiano Ronaldo
The prodigal son who made his mark on United with 1 UCL, and 3 Premier Leagues. He came to United after conquering Spain and Italy, in hopes of reviving United to former glory. But how he was mistaken. His 24 goals in total,18 in Premier League was not enough to save United as they faced the drop to Europa League. In the summer, his agent Jorge Mendes made some noise by linking him to top clubs which play in the Champions League only to be turned down by them. So he stayed at United and he has yet to register a goal. Though he scored 1 in Europa League against Sheriff, he needs to score in the Premier League.
Now coming to Jude Bellingham, OGS was a huge fan of him. He tried to prise him away when he was in Birmingham. But he chose Borussia Dortmund to help him build up for 25 million. 
United should thank their lucky stars as the Englishman was not in the market. Or else big clubs would have snapped him up already. 
United can go after him in 2023 if United makes it top 4. ETH would have a chance to negotiate his price. As BVB would ask a hefty fee for him. But it would show that the ETH revolution is well and truly underway. 
If Jude makes his transfer to United expect United to line up this formation in the 2023/24 season:
It looks like a strong line-up, but expect ETH to go for other positions and especially in the striker position. Expect the line-up to be changed.
Liverpool
Liverpool's case is different. They are well stocked in all the departments. They lost Sadio Mane, they replaced him with Darwin Nunez. But how the mighty have fallen. Their 4-0 loss to their arch rivals Manchester United in pre-season, and 2-1 loss to them once the season started. Then 4-1 loss to Napoli.
