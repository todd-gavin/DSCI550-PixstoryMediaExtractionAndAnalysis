I ve never had the opportunity to donate blood in my life But I ve seen it done by my parents and family and I once questioned my father why he did it What is the explanation for this Why do people participate in it And his response was that it s just as essential as saving a life if it s in your hands He told me that in India there are more accidents reported and even more persons suffering from one of the other diseases and that some of them die as a result of blood loss while operating It s practically difficult to save every single person in peril but you can at least try Regular blood donation camps are organised by various support groups and anyone who meets the minimum standards such as age weight tattoos and being non alcoholic diabetes free or free of other significant diseases can donate blood Before beginning the process they will go over all of the essential prerequisites with you and give you the green light to donate blood A capable person should take the initiative and donate blood in order to contribute to something positive for humanity
