‘Formula 1 - Drive to Survive’ is not a normal series, it’s an emotion. Today I watched Season 4 of ‘Formula 1: Drive to Survive’ on Netflix and I can say that this is one of the best sports docu-series available on OTT platforms.

If you know nothing about this series, so let me tell you that this series is a documentary where viewers will see more behind-the-scenes footage and what teams and drivers went through throughout the season. Basically, Formula 1 hired Netflix to shoot their daily vlogs but the quality of each episode is top-notch.

There are ten episodes in season 4 and each episode will tell you the story of a particular incident, struggles of the drivers, teams fighting to win on any circumstances, and so on.

If you start to watch this series you will binge it for sure. This show got pace, entertainment, thrill, emotions, adrenaline rush and there is no dull moment.

There are many moments that I liked out of 10 episodes but I’ll tell you my top 3 moments and will let you enjoy the rest of the series.

1. The most gripping episode of the series is the last episode where the build-up for the last race of the season is shown very well and if you never saw the F1 then some moments will make you think that who’s gonna win this race.

2. The second episode is my favorite out of all. In this episode, we got to see the tussle between the two drivers (Lando Norris and Daniel Riccardo) of Mclaren and their competitiveness on the race tracks and how Norris is not helping a new driver (Riccardo) to get along with him as well as Maclaren team.

3. The eighth episode will be 3rd on my list. In this episode, viewers will see the team spirit of  Valtteri Bottas and how he helped his Mercedes team to win the constructor’s championship even though he knew that he will get replaced by George Russell next season.

So, what are you waiting for, just go and watch this series?
