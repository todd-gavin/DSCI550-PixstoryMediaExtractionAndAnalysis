The Quebecois dramedy Audrey's Back, which won the Grand Prix at this year's Canneseries festival and is about a coma victim coming out of it, has been picked up by Italian public broadcaster RAI and French pay-TV company Canal+. Hollywood Reporter said that Beta Film of Germany, which is in charge of the show's foreign sales, has agreements in place with Canal+ and RAI as well as other potential partners. Earlier this year, Beta debuted Audrey's Back at the MIPTV market. A decade and a half after being in a coma due to an accident that occurred on prom night, Florence Longpré, who also co-wrote the 10-part series, stars as the titular Audrey. Audrey slowly comes to after waking up, learning to walk, talk, and remember who she was before. Audrey's co-creator Guillaume Lambert refers to it as a typical coming-of-age story “just 15 years too late.”What do you think about this drama? Have you watched it?
