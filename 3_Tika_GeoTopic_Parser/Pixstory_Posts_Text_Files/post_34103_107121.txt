After Walter Sabatini&#39;s words came the response from the president of Salernitana Danilo Iervolino The divorce between the manager and the company from Campania was one of the most discussed topics in recent days and the feeling that we are still far from the conclusion Sabatini thinks he thinks everyone is stupid but there is only him as a misunderstanding He thinks he is the smartest but he was a liar He wanted to pay the commission to the agent we argued because I do not accept these distortions Thus begins the outburst of the number one of Salernitana who then goes into more detail We wanted to correspond with Lassana Coulibaly a salary increase of euros but to complete the operation we would have had to pay his agent a million, a commitment that Sabatini had made perhaps to prevent the same agent from showing sensitivity to other offers I will never bow to this system if a player receives a good offer from another club free to go And so we arrived at the fracture Sabatini instead told me that with certain logics he has been living together for some time And in the chat that we share with the Salernitana boss and with the public relations manager he wrote that given my position regarding commissions he believed he was not the right man for Salernitana Now I read that he hears from the Champions League we will see where he goes he doesn&#39;t even know how to operate a computer or send an email There is also room for a background on Cavani&#39;s dream Also on that occasion Sabatini bordered on the ridiculous. If I want a player, I&#39;ll buy him. Mica could have rejected my purchase. This is Iervolino&#39;s Salernitana, not Sabatini&#39;s.
