Rafael Nadal won the French Open for the record 14th time on Sunday, smashing Norwegian Casper Ruud 6-3 6-3 6-0 to capture his 22nd Grand Slam championship in men's singles. 

The 36-year-old Spaniard now has two more titles than Swiss Roger Federer and world number one Novak Djokovic of Serbia, having lost only three sets at Roland Garros since his debut in 2005. 

After being broken early in the second set, Nadal, the fifth seed, cruised through the first set and went on to win 11 games in a row. 

After winning the Australian Open earlier this year, he converted his second championship point with a backhand winner down the line to keep his hopes alive for the calendar Grand Slam.
