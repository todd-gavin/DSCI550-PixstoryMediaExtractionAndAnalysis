According to a recent survey, Tom Hardy is the actor who most Americans have trouble understanding, requiring many to turn on subtitles. 

As per TimeOut, the poll using a language app The mobster drama Peaky Blinders was also chosen by Preply via The Wrap as the programme that Americans had the most trouble understanding. Hardy plays Alfie Solomons in the grimy series, which is set in Birmingham. 

In his acting career, Hardy has adopted a variety of dialects, including New Yorker, Russian, Southern American, and cockney (The Kray twins in the crime thriller Legend) (Venom). 

Maybe we can lay some of the blame at the feet of filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who chose to use actor Tom Hardy in two of his most notable performances to date, both of which featured a mask that masked the actor's words. These jobs consist of villainous Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, and an aircraft fighter pilot in World War II drama, Dunkirk.

It’s not the first time that Hardy has come under scrutiny for his diction. In 2018, US publication Dallas Observer ranked his movies ‘by how hard it is to understand what he’s saying’.
