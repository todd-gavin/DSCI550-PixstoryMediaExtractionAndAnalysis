The likes of Iftikhar Ahmed and Khushdil Shah have proven in Pakistan s domestic set up that they are talentedbatsmen and possess the capacity to score big runs in the middle order however they have failed to transfer this to international cricket This shows how reliant Pakistan are on theiropening pair and while Babar Azam has endured poor form in the Asia Cup Mohamad Rizwan was the highest run scorer in the Asia Cup as he had the responsibility of anchoring the innings and helping the team to post fighting totals One reason why Pakistan s opening pair is their biggest weakness in T is is that both Rizwan and Babar s strike rates are not brilliant When chasing scores of this is not a big issue as both batsmen possess the intelligence to pace the innings but this weaknesshas been exposed when Pakistan have batted first Accumulation of dot balls has also been a big issue as they fail to rotate the strike effectively in the first six overs This then leads tothem being forced to play a big shot which means the bowling side have an opportunity to take their wicket This has been exposed further in the middle overs especially and both of players struggle to dominate spin bowling Spin bowlers are utilised in middle overs and when both Babar and Rizwan struggle to rotate the strike and hit boundaries consistently which creates further pressure on the side This also adds pressure onto the middle and lower order as they do not have many balls at their disposal therefore they have a responsibility to play aggressively which they have failed to do especially in the Asia Cup
