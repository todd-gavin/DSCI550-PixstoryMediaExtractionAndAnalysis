Fabio Vieira scores on his first league start for the Gunner, as Jesus and Saliba complete the goal tally. 
Arsenal secured their 6th win of the season, and climbed back to the top of the table with 3-0 win over Brentford. Young Portuguese sensation Fabio Fabio Vieira was given an opportunity to start and he delivered a peach of a goal (49') in return. Saliba (18') started the scoring and Jesus doubled their lead after around 10 minutes. This was their third cleansheet of the new season. 
With the loss, Brentford are at 9th with just2 wins and 3 draws. Gabriel Jesus scored his 4th goal in the match.Â  
Earlier Arsenal made three changes from their loss to United. Tierney, Vieira, and Partey replace the injured Oleksandr Zinchenko and Martin Odegaard. The first goal came from a corner, which Saka delivered from the right side. Saliba flicked it into the far bottom corner with his head. Second was a striker's goal. Jesus peeled away from his marker to nod Xhaka's gentle left-footed drink into the top left corner. The Brazilian put all his force into that header. Ethan Nwaneri, 15, became the youngest player in Premier League history after coming on as a substitute in Arsenal's win against Brentford. He came in as a substitute for Fabio Vieira as midfielder. Harvey Elliott had held the record, aged 16 years and 30 days when he played for Fulham in 2019.
Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur were putting pressure on Arsenal for the top spot before the match. As both the teams won yesterday, Arsenal had to win this to stay on top. Their next match is with Arsenal, which will decide the top spot next week.
