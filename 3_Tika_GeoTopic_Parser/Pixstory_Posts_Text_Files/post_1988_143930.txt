Republican Senator Lindsey Graham recently introduced a new bill in the Senate That would create a nationwide ban on abortions after weeks Now empowered by the supreme courts overturning of Roe v Wade Republicans are looking to seize an opportunity and show voters that if they want to win on one of the most important issues in our country and they should vote Republican While I am inclined to agree that abortion ought to be banned I can t help but wonder whether seeking a national abortion ban simply does the exact same thing that Republicans complained about when Roe v Wade was ruled on initially After all the entire point of the opinion in the overturning of Roe was that it was up to the voters of each state to decide If Republicans agree that voters should decide then there is clear hypocrisy in the fact that voters of some states are sending their representatives to Congress to make decisions for other states Abortion is an extremely consequential issue but it shouldn t be resolved on a nationwide level If it is then a divide will continue to persists forever Abortion debates persist now because Roe took the decision away from the people If Congress takes away that opinion then the debate will persist and public opinion will never move far enough one way to end the debate for good
