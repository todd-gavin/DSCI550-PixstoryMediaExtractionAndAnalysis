Another season in the top flight for Southampton has produced a wildly inconsistent season, with The Saints fans questioning where exactly is their club placed in the Premier League.

For a while, there was hope at the South Coast.

Young right back Tino Livramento shined on 
loanee Armando Broja bagged in the goals.

James Ward Prowse continued his hot streak of 
scoring from free kicks, picking up a few goals this season. Until it all came crumbling down and became a fight for survival in the Premier League.

It has been 4 out the last 5 seasons now where Southampton have failed to score more than 45 points. This season was incredibly inconsistent for Southampton, coming off the back of having lost key players in the previous season.

One day, the team was capable of beating Tottenham at their own ground, the other day it lost away to Norwich City of all teams. There is growing discontent at the club, with many believing Ralph Hasenhuttl is becoming part of the very rot he was supposed to fix.

Southamptonâ€™s policy of selling their star players and sign replacements has finally seem to have caught up to them, as their signings struggled this year to make an impact.

Southampton were plagued with defensive woes, with the side dropping a mighty 29 points from winning positions - the most in the Premier League. Sitting back and playing on the counter does not help when the team is not defensively solid, and they have paid for the same.

The finishing was poor and the football had become slow. 43 goals scored this season was not good enough, with some of them moments of brilliance conjured up by James Ward Prowse.

Such a low tally is not feasible for clubs looking to move up the Premier League table and eventually competing for European positions.

The next three months for Southampton are set to be crucial, as the squad needs a overhaul to be competitive in the division. Hassenhuttl might find himself fighting for his job this season if the same trend continues.
