The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped two chairpersons of powerful statutory bodies get a second term by amending appointment rules—using a grammatical loophole relating to a conjunction—just before their scheduled farewell last year.

 
The union ministry of women and child development amended (here, here) the rules for Rekha Sharma of the National Commission for Women and Priyank Kanoongo of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights just as they were nearing the end of their terms in August and October 2021.


To push through the amendment favouring Kanoongo, the ministry used the solicitor general of India’s off-the-record opinion on how the conjunction “or” in the legal text on appointments could be used favourably, according to previously unpublished documents reviewed by The Reporters’ Collective.



Sharma and Kanoongo head commissions that are powerful enough to initiate inquiries, summon any person from any part of the country and examine them on oath, recommend to the government for action or approach high courts or the Supreme Court for further orders.



In the past, the Supreme Court has even allowed the child rights commission to intervene and produce its own findings while examining appeals by the Tamil Nadu government against a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the suicide of a minor girl.



Unlike central agencies, such as the CBI, which cannot probe a crime without the state government’s consent, except when asked by courts, the commissions don’t need permission from state governments to conduct investigations—an attribute that is valuable to organisations allied with the union government, even though they are not supposed to be.


With these powers, the two have been criticised (here, here) for going after dissenters and critics of the government. Kanoongo had shot off notices that targeted activists, dissenters and even Netflix for a show the child rights commission believed could “pollute young minds”.
