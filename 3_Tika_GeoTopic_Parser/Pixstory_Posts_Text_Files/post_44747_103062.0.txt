Red Coralâ€”The Gemstone of Mars/
the God of War continues....

Those who are not in a position or unable to perform the ritual given above should donate a red coral to a celibate man on a Tuesday at noon time. 

One can also donate a red carnelian or a red agate for similar purpose.

Donation in such a way pacifies the negative results of the planet Mars and blesses the individual with health, wealth and happiness.

Period of effect of Red Coral

Once worn in an auspicious time frame the red coral is effective for a person for 3 years and 3 days. On completion of this time frame one should wear a new red coral. The existing red coral should be sold or given to a loved one. The same red coral is effective for that person for 3 years and 3 days. If such a red coral is Jyotish quality then it will be effective for the time span mentioned for every new individual it reaches. The same principle also applies for the substitute of the alternative gemstones for Mars- Red Carnelian and Red Agate.
