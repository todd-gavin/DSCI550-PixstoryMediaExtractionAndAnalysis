I truly do not know how the brain processes the fact that there s nothing worthy of eating in the fridge Because this happens most of the time There s nothing there you close the fridge door but something clicks in your brain that you extend your arm to open and look again Maybe it s the possibility the brain takes into account of your eye getting caught on something in there that might just be good enough
