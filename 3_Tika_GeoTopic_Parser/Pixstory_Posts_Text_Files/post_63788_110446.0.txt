Bon Jovi is a name in the hard rock/metal community that even with the 80s way behind, always invites a sort of hatred. And it is not really hard to understand why. On one hand Bon Jovi is so cheesy that it can make you cringe, but on the other so catchy that it can also make you sick due to just how much they have a knack for getting their tunes stuck in your head. Just listen to “It’s My Life” or “Livin’ on a Prayer” and tell yourself that you did not find yourself singing along.
 
Normally one would put bands such as Motley Crue at the helm of pop metal, but let’s be honest here. Except for their look and lyrics, there was nothing pop about them, these guys were not posers pretending to be hard rockers. Rather, playing heavy music by adding sleaze and cheese, but with style was in their blood, and they did it perfectly.
 
Though they looked ridiculous they bore the name of being a metal band, being often been called glam metal or hard rock.

But they never created the ballsy, attitude filled heavy riffs of any actual hard rock band like Guns’N Roses, or even glam metal bands like Motley Crue despite of being called so.
 
At its core, Bon Jovi was always brain dead happy go bubblegum pop rock, but was also a bit endearing. Making music that is automatically and naturally memorable is also a talent, and Bon Jovi definitely designed some of the greatest hooks in rock history. Plus there was an edge just hard enough to call them hard rock, though definitely not close to metal.
 
In conclusion, cheesy, corny, repetitive, poppy music is not really bad if you know how to grab the audience and Bon Jovi certainly know how to do that. As such, if you actually want some attitude filled hard rock, then forget Bon Jovi, because despite their hard rock tag, you will be disappointed. But if you want a sing along rock band with some heavy open chugs, then you have found it.
