Abstract Type diabetes T DM as a non communicable disease imposes heavy disease burdens on society Limited studies have been conducted to assess the effects of short term air pollution exposure on T DM especially in Asian regions Our research aimed to determine the association between short term exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide NO and outpatient visits for T DM in Chongqing the largest city in western China based on the data collected from November to December A generalized additive model GAM was applied and stratified analyses were performed to investigate the potential modifying effects by age gender and season Meanwhile the disease burden was revealed from attributable risk Positive associations between short term NO and daily T DM outpatient visits were observed The strongest association was observed at lag with per g m increase of NO corresponded to increased T DM outpatient visits at confidence interval CI Stronger associations were presented in middle aged group years old male group and cool seasons October to March Moreover there were cases of T DM outpatient visits attributable to NO Middle aged adults males and patients who visited in cool seasons suffered heavier burdens Conclusively short term exposure to NO was associated with increased outpatient visits for T DM Attention should be paid to the impact of NO on the burden of T DM especially for those vulnerable groups Sources
