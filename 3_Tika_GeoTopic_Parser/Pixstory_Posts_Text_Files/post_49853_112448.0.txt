Following last month's landmark Supreme Court ruling which put an end to the state's restrictions, New York has passed emergency legislation to prohibit guns from many public places.

The rules also compel gun buyers to prove they can use a gun and submit social media accounts for review. Analysts say the new regulations may end up in a fresh legal challenge. The Supreme Court's ruling, effectively broadening gun rights, is it's most important on guns in over a decade.

It imposes harder checks on young buyers and makes states eliminate guns from people considered a threat.

The New York law which comes into force on 1 September envisages:
•	A ban on carrying firearms in "sensitive places", including New York City's Times Square - but also schools, universities, government buildings, public protest venues, healthcare facilities, places of worship, libraries, playgrounds, parks, bars, theatres, stadiums, museums, polling places, and casinos.

•	People will not be allowed to take guns into any business or workplace unless owners put up signs saying guns are welcome.

•	Those applying for a license will have to provide four character references, take firearms safety training and practice shooting, undergo periodic background checks, and turn over contact information for their spouse, domestic partner, or any other adults living in their household.

•	Applicants will have to turn over a list of social media accounts they have had in the past three years.
