Mind and body go together. Dualism is a metaphysical position that says that the mind and body are two separate things, each with a different basic nature. A well-known version of dualism is named after Rene Descartes, who lived in the 17th century. According to him, human beings were made up of two very different things that couldn't work together. The biomedical model in medicine was made up of two things: human nature and analysis. According to this, humans were thought of as living organisms (materialism) that could be studied by looking at their parts (reductionism) using the principles of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and physics.
