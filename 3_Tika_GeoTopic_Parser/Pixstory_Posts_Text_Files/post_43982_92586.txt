Thursday night s conference league game at the Orange Velodrome saw Dimitri Payet s screamer from yards as Marseille saw off Greek side PAOK Payet s goal got people talking as it is without doubt a strong contender for this year s Puskas award Supporters of both the home and away team indulged in misconduct at the stadium with fireworks and flares a common sight during the match This isn t atypical behaviour of either team s fiercest fan groups Flares are very usual in French league matches and Greek fans are as hot headed as they come With the PAOK fans seated on the away end far from the home fans It remains unclear which side of the equation was responsible for the altercation but with fireworks and flares being thrown at crowds of thousands of people in a seater stadium that hardly matters European football s governing body UEFA will launch investigations into the situation as they should really Situations involving passionate groups of football supporters can escalate very quickly with one thing leading to the other Thankfully this situation was handled fairly well by the stadium staff at work Putting public safety at risk is as far from being a football fan as one can imagine hooliganism is objectionable and has no place at games of any level It is being reported that riot police were called upon as hundreds of French supporters stormed to a particular hotel where Greek fans were staying Most neutrals expect some level of action on Marseille s end in the following days Stadium bans for those involved are a real possibility This was an example of a game wherein the action on the pitch was overshadowed by the display of recklessness off it
