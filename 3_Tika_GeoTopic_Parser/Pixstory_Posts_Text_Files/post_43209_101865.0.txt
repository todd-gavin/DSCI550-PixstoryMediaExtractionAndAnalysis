Depp has come off as unperturbed during the trial, and some fans think that the actor's tranquil demeanor might have to do with his courtroom companion.

Observers have noted that Depp seems to get along well with Camille Vasquez, who has been conducting cross-examinations of witnesses called by Heard's team all week.

Depp and Vasquez have been spotted whispering to one another -- which is not unusual courtroom behavior between attorneys and clients -- but many believe these interactions are more than just professional.


On Thursday, a courtroom reporter approached Vasquez after the day's proceedings and asked point-blank if she and Depp are romantically involved.

"The people want to know: Are you dating Johnny Depp?" the reporter can be heard asking in footage first published by TMZ.

"It's all over the internet. Can you set the record straight: Yes or no?"

Vasquez merely smiled and turned her attention to the many Depp supporters who had assembled outside the courthouse.

Only time will tell if there's anything going on between these two.
