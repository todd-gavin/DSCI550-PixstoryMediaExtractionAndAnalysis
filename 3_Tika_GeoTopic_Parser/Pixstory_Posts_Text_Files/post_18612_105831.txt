After that of a year ago, the telenovela starring Inter Chelsea and Lukaku is ready to restart This time the roles are reversed with the Belgian forward who would like to take the opposite path to that of months ago and therefore leave London to return to Milan If until to date it seemed more like a market suggestion than a realistic hypothesis with the Blues&#39; interest in Lewandowski a real negotiation would have opened for his return to the nerazzurri What seems obvious is that Chelsea have no intention of selling Lukaku or rather cannot afford it for budgetary reasons having paid it millions of euros only a year ago The solution would be a very expensive loan over millions of euros Chelsea could also pay the salary The news that would represent a turning point in the Inter transfer market was given by Sky Sport
