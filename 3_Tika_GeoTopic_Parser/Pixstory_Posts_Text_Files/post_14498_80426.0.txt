The world records more than 400 million cases of COVID19 And about 5.76 million deaths on 9th February 2022,Wednesday. 

Vaccinated population have been registered over 10.09 billion. the Covid numbers are still "absolutely staggering", according to a senior World Health Organisation adviser, the Guardian reported.

It's a very dangerous virus," Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the body's Director General, was quoted as saying on BBC Radio 4's Today.

"If we look at the situation today -- there's still 2 million reported cases alone, over 5,000 deaths every single day right now," he said.

Many experts have argued that the pandemic is on its end stage and slowly moving towards becoming an epidemic.

However, the WHO has maintained that this is not the end and a more severe variant of Covid is expected. The global body has thus been calling for increasing vaccine coverage, especially in low income countries.

"The numbers are absolutely staggering, and what we're learning to live with is not just this virus, but what should be an unacceptable burden of disease, an unacceptable number of deaths every single day, especially when there are the tools to stop or at least slow this thing, manage it, control it," Aylward said.

Meanwhile, the WHO on Wednesday also called rich countries to pay their fair share of the money needed for its plan to conquer Covid-19 in developing countries by contributing $16bn as a matter of urgency, the report said.

Aylward said that protecting the whole world is critical and that $16bn investment is needed to get out of the "acute phase" of the pandemic.
