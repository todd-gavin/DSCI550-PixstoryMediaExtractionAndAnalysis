Abstract
Background
Recommendations for patients with T2DM from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) may be inconsistent, and little is known about their quality.
Methods
To systematically review the consistency of globally available CPGs containing nutritional recommendations for T2DM and to assess their methodological and reporting quality, PubMed, CBM and four main guideline websites were searched. Four researchers independently assessed the methodological and reporting quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, 2nd edition (AGREE II) instrument and Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in HealThcare (RIGHT) checklist.
Results
Fifteen CPGs involved 65 nutritional recommendations regarding six sections: 1) body weight and energy balance, 2) dietary eating patterns, 3) macronutrients, 4) micronutrients and supplements, 5) alcohol and 6) specific, functional foods. Current nutritional recommendations for patients with T2DM on specific elements and amounts were not completely consistent in different CPGs and failed to assign the specific supporting evidence and strength of recommendations. To use nutritional recommendations to guide and manage patients with T2DM, it is important to address the current challenges by establishing a solid evidence base and assigning the strength of recommendations. Overall, eight CPGs were classified as recommended for clinical practice used AGREE II. The 15 CPGs adhered to less than 60% of RIGHT checklist items.
Conclusion
High-quality evidence is needed to potentially close knowledge gaps and strengthen the recommendation. The AGREE II instrument along with the RIGHT checklist should be endorsed and used by CPG developers to ensure higher quality and adequate use of their products.
