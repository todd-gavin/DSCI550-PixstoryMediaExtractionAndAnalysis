I don't know why but people value hard and fast life over an easy going peaceful life. 

We were not put on this earth to live and die while being stressed about work. 

Peace is very underrated and any effort made towards it is awesome. Start with something as easy as meditation or yoga and build on that. 

Also STAY AWAY FROM TOXIC PEOPLE
