Gareth Southgate is reportedly set for a bonus of £4million if he guides England to World Cup glory in Qatar.
According to The Sun, Southgate is being offered almost three times as much as the £1.5million which he would have received if England had won the 2018 World Cup.
His current contract runs until 2024 and is worth around £6million a year. 
England will face Iran, USA and Wales in the group stages in Qatar. 
Southgate's side endured much frustration in the Nations League as they were relegated, but going into the World Cup they will take confidence from having reached the final of Euro 2020.
England also got to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup under Southgate's guidance.
Initially placed in temporary charge in September 2016, Southgate became permanent England manager two months later.
England have been dealt a blow ahead of the tournament, with Chelsea defender Reece James ruled out due to a serious knee injury.
James suffered the injury during Chelsea's Champions League victory against AC Milan.
