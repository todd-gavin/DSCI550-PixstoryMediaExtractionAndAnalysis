The race in Imola Italy was supposed to be Ferrari s big chance to prove their title winning intentions in front of their home crowd The Ferrari fans lovingly called tifosi flocked from all over to the circuit in Imola Those who couldn t made sure they supported their Prancing Horses from wherever they could I too was one of them The last decade for Ferrari has been just short of miserable was the last time a Ferrari driver had a real shot right till the end of the season to win the championship This year tifosi once more sees that hope in Charles Leclerc the Monagesque driver Coming off a strong showing in the previous races of this season everyone s hopes of seeing a Ferrari home win were insanely high Maybe this pressure is what was ultimately the undoing of Formula One s most famous team I went to Pebble Street with my buddies to watch the Imola GP Our hopes were sky high Out of the four of us one was new to the sport but had the most extroverted personality Lack of knowledge coupled with an unearned confidence usually results in embarrassment That s exactly what we went through as the noob friend blurted out the most irrelevant obvious stuff at the most inappropriate of times Ferrari was on the back foot from the very get go on Sunday Carlos Sainz beached his scarlet red car in the gravel right at the very beginning Charles Leclerc the driver on whom the hopes for the title lie losing out on two positions as the lights went out This picture was taken by the venue photographer at the exact moment Charles Leclerc went too harsh over the curbs while chasing Red Bull s Sergio Perez for second place It was here that Leclerc lost control of his Ferrari and spun right into the barriers As the race ended we were visibly upset That is when I felt the love of the Ferrari community for the first time All the Ferrari fans in the venue got together and consoled each other Onto the next Forza Ferrari
