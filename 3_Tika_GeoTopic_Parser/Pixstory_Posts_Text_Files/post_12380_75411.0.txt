To put it simply, mental exhaustion can happen when your brain receives too much stimulation or has to maintain an intense level of activity without rest.

You might notice mental exhaustion, sometimes called mental fatigue, if you:
▪️frequently work or study for long hours with few or no breaks
▪️spend a lot of time each day dealing with ▪️overwhelming responsibilities
▪️live with mental health symptoms
▪️devote a lot of mental energy each day to thinking ▪️through problems, worries, or other sources of stress

It’s not at all uncommon to feel physically fatigued from time to time, and the same holds true for mental fatigue. Still, lingering mental fatigue can affect your ability to think, solve problems, or process and regulate emotions. Eventually, it can even lead to challenges in your daily life and in relationships.
