The Covid seems to have subsided for the time beingðŸ¤ž. We don't know yet how it behaves in the near future.

So, till the time numbers are down, plan your travel and do share your experiences. 

I will be travelling to Kashmir, undoubtedly the Paradise on Earth. 

This summer, the valley is witnessing unprecedented tourist rush especially from North India that is reeling under the intense heat wave. A few days ago, Delhi recorded a temperature of 49.2 degree Celsius. 

It may touch 50 degree Celsius in some time given the impact of climate change is being felt worldwide. 

Residents of Kashmir never used ACs but many have installed the air conditioners in their houses especially in Srinagar. 

While growing up, we would use fans for a very brief period in June but now these have become a necessity. 

It's beautiful in Kashmir and the weather is perfect. It's been raining for the past some days and woollens are also back.

While it is around 40 degree Celsius in Delhi today, the temperature is 21 degree Celsius in Srinagar. 

Places to visit in Kashmir: Srinagar, Pahalgam, Aru valley  Tarsar Marsar, Gulmarg, Tangmarg, Sonamarg, Verinag, Kokernag, Yusmarg, Daksum, Gurez, Khilanmarg and Doodhpathri. 

There are several religious and spiritual centres in Kashmir apart from taking a shikara ride in Dal Lake. 

Looking forward to your stories. I will tell mine after my visit.
