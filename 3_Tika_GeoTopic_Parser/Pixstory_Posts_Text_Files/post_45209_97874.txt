At one point the Switzerland international midfielder appeared to be on his way out of Emirates Stadium but he has now re established himself as a leader on the pitch Granit Xhaka was deprived of the Arsenal captaincy in November after a public outburst against the club s fans but the Swiss midfielder has since re established himself as a fan favourite and claims he would be willing to reclaim the armband The year old appeared to have no future at Emirates Stadium after reacting to jeers from his own fans after he was substituted during a Premier League match against Crystal Palace by swinging open the exit doors Since then he has been heavily linked with a move to Roma but Mikel Arteta has persuaded him to stay and has re established himself as an on field leader for the Gunners to the point where he could be named as a permanent replacement for the departed Pierre Emerick Aubameyang when another call for skipper duty is made Xhaka has recently watched the likes of Alexandre Lacazette and Martin Odegaard assume captaincy duties but when asked if he may be in the running he told Sky Sports I will never say never I was not ready for that again A captain of Arsenal can be without an armband and I am trying to lead the game and the players without the armband but if tomorrow someone from the football club comes and asks if I want to take it I will be here because I know I am ready again to do it Xhaka has made appearances for Arsenal in all competitions this season putting him on the verge of reaching appearances for the club He has a contract until and is hoping that his decision to stay in north London will be rewarded with Champions League qualification this season with Arteta s side aiming for a top four finish
