A latest generation capillaroscope for Carlo Poma&#39;s Rheumatology The Alomar association of Mantua and the associates of the Alomar office in Como donated it to ASST, thus making available to professionals a tool of great help in diagnosing, monitoring and defining prognosis in microcirculation diseases increasingly common also in the population of Mantua Rheumatology belongs to the Day Hospital Center for Allergology and Clinical Immunology led by Maria Teresa Costantino Capillaroscopy is a non-invasive investigation method of considerable clinical importance for the recognition of morphological and functional anomalies of the microcirculation its use dates back to the beginning of the twentieth century but only in the years that it reaches a precise collocation in the rheumatological field. Today video capillaroscopy with contact optical probes has opened up new and original perspectives in the study of the microcirculation at the level of the periungual skin. largest of the capillaries is parallel to the skin surface and therefore to the observation plane The capillaries in the periungual site have a characteristic hairpin shape and are arranged to form a very regular palisade in the healthy subject In other body areas the capillaries take on a ball-like shape pinpoint or comma and cannot be easily evaluated Capillaroscopic images are displayed directly on the monitor, making it possible for us to study the microcirculation due to the sharpness and breadth of the field of observation Capillaroscopy is therefore a fundamental diagnostic screening technique in the early recognition of microangiopathic alterations especially of scleroderma but there are numerous applications in rheumatology for example in the differential diagnosis of microcirculation alterations in diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome and dermatomyositis. Furthermore, with this method there is the possibility of monitoring the effect of specific therapies by verifying the response to drugs directly at the microvascular level
