During my entire journey, I've had a lot of learnings. More than winning, losing a game has given me more inspiration. I've won more than 250 championships, but the ones I lose are the one I actually remember more than those I've won.
The most difficult time for me was in 2011. I had just performed well in the Ahmedabad youth nationals for Under-21. A week later, I had to head to Jammu and Kashmir for another tournament. That day, I was casually returning home, and my train was in the evening. On my way back, I met with a horrible accident that left me badly bruised. I was taken to the hospital, and to my utmost shock, my wrist had broken! In a sport such as Table Tennis, your wrist governs your entire game. I had a major breakdown and couldn't believe this happened to me. The doctor said it could take a year or two to fix this. It's very easy to fall back in your game if you don't play for a month, and here, a year would have ended my career. I was hopeless as they plastered my hand. After a while, they took off my plaster, and I was asked to begin physiotherapy. All this while, I was just looking at my friends who continued playing and were getting better. Another setback was when I wasn't selected for the national team, and there was a new champion now.
At that point, I decided that I'd had enough, and I needed to do something. I didn't tell anyone and headed to a local trainer's house. He had a practice robot where that robot threw balls for you to practice individually. The doctor had told me that trying now could ruin my chances forever, but I was stubborn. I couldn't sit in one place anymore, so I stood there with my racquet in hand as the ball came toward me. As soon as the ball touched, I blacked out. I was crying because it hurt so bad, and I dropped it there. The immense pain made me even more hopeless.
