7 Alex Stepney
Manchester United won their first-ever First Division league title with him in goal in 1965, earning the club entry into European competition. United were the first English team to participate in European competition, and Alex Stepney was an influential figure between the posts. He was a key player in United's European Cup victory over Benfica, making one of the best saves from Portugal legend Eusebio, and helping United win 4-1, as Alex Stepney went on to make 539 appearances for the club.
6 Wayne Rooney
Rooney joined United from Everton in 2004 and the rest is history as the player went on to emerge as one of the most prolific players. Rooney won 16 trophies during his time at United, and he and Michael Carrick are the only players in club history to have won the Premier League, Champions League, FIFA Club World Cup, and UEFA Super Cup. He is also United's leading goalscorer, with 253 in all competitions and 183 in the Premier League, trailing only Harry Kane. The Englishman has made 559 appearances for the club in total.

5 Gary Neville
Gary Neville played his entire career for Manchester United, where he captained them for five years and was the club's second longest-serving captain after Ryan Giggs. He was one of the few players who was a one-man show. Neville came through United Youth Academy, began his senior career in 1991, and retired in 2011. The player won 20 trophies at the club during those years.
The Englishman made a club record 602 appearances and won two Champions Leagues.
