The native Kashmiri tomatoes start to appear in the local markets around September. When they do, individuals rush to bring them home, cut them into pieces, and dry them over their rooftops, with a determined individual occasionally turning them upside down to ward off predators. Once prepared, these can be kept in storage for weeks at a time and used to create a spectacular cuisine.
