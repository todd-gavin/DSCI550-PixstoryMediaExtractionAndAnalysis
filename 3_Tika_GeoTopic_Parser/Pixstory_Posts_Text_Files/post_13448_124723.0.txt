The Secretary General of Reporters Without Borders has said that journalism has been destroyed in Afghanistan in the past year. The media and journalists in this country are subjected to unfair regulations that limit freedom and open the way for repression.
He emphasized that the current rulers of Afghanistan should commit to ending the violence and harassment of media workers and allow them to do their work without being disturbed.
Reporters Without Borders added that women suffered the most damage in the collapse of Afghan journalism last year and have completely disappeared from the media scene in 11 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.
