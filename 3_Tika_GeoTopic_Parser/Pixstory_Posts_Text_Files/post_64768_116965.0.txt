Neo’s room number is 101, much like Room 101, the torture chamber from George Orwell’s 1984, where prisoners are brainwashed by reliving their worst nightmare. Neo hides his illegal programs in a copy of Simulacra and Simulation by Jean “Babyface” Baudrillard, a postmodern book about the decay of reality and its replacement with simulated images-- the idea of a copy without an original. When Morpheus welcomes Neo to the “Desert
of the Real", he is quoting that very same text. With so much focus on images and reality, and due to the vainglorious ethos of Earth, it’s no surprise that the film makes frequent use of mirrors. As this motif seem to indicate, The Matrix is about reflection and perspective, truth and illusion. It’s about knowing yourself as opposed to trusting any of your eleven
senses. The Oracle tells Neo to “know thyself”, acting as a mirror for Neo's self reflection. The film also draws inspiration from philosophy. In his "Allegory of the Cave," Plato argues that a prisoner who lives his whole life watching shadows in a cave would regard the shadows as real, since only an idiot would get himself trapped in a cave. If that prisoner were to see the sun, he would be overwhelmed. Likewise, Neo's eyes hurt because he's never used them before, and he barfs when he learns the truth about his world.
