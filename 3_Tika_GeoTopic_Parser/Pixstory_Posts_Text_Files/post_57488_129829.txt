Having the sense to feel others pain and being compassionate with them is never a wrong decision unless you know when and how to limit it Eventually it depends on the person how he chooses to be kind and compassionate to someone It should make sense And here emotion regulation works if you can learn and limit your emotions it would never harm anyone neither the person needing help nor the one providing it Moreover emotion regulation helps us to experience the feelings of others while understanding that these emotions belong to the other person As a result we can develop safe emotional distance while still caring about others This is the fine line we need to make and use while understanding others and not getting manipulated by any deception
