Love poem written by Ramses II and immortalized forever on the tomb wall of Nefertari Notice particularly how he describes her skin My Love is unique no one can rival her For she is the most beautiful woman alive Just by passing she has stolen away my heart She who fills the colonnaded halls with her perfume from the land of Punt Her perfect breasts are draped in the finest of white linens Slender neck Gold is nothing compared to her arms Her fingers are like lotus petals Her waist is narrow Round buttocks Her skin is as fair and soft as milk Her hair is the color of the dark eclipse Beautiful of face My love for her is unique no one can rival her She is the most beautiful woman in the world Beloved of Mut Nefertari The Beauty of The Beauties
