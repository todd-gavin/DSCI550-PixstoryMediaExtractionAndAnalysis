President Vladimir Putin of Russia hosted Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday. A day after he ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Khan had arrived in Moscow the previous day on a two-day visit. It was called a "working" visit by a Pakistani prime minister in 23 years.

But he has been criticised within his country and outside for the timing of his visit. Should he have called off the visit knowing that Russia was so close to attacking Ukraine? 

When he was received at the airport by Russian officials, Khan made the first blunder of the visit, saying that he could feel "excitement" in the air regarding the war clouds.

Analysts in Pakistan say that the country could pay a heavy price for this visit as Western countries led by the U.S. would view it negatively. Although Pakistan has not either supported or opposed the Russian invasion saying that it hoped talks would solve the problem.

"The leaders of the two countries discussed the main aspects of bilateral cooperation and exchanged views on current regional topics, including developments in South Asia," said a brief statement from the Russian government.

Foreign affairs analysts say that it was a victory of sorts domestically for Putin. He could portray to his country that it was not in panic and that everything was normal enough to host a foreign leader. And a signal to the West that he was not isolated globally.

In the meantime, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that visit to Russia was a well thought out decision and that it signalled a "shift in the country's foreign policy towards geoeconomics," and "Russia being onboard will fortify our [shift in] focus towards geoeconomic regional connectivity."

Although some agreements were supposed to be signed, including one on a gas pipeline to Pakistan, these didn't take place. Many Pakistanis are awaiting the reaction of the U.S. and the EU on the visit and consequence of it.
