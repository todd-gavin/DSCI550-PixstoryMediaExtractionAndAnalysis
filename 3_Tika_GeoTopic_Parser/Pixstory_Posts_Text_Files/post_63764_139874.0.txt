A new snippet from God Of War: Ragnarok footage walks us through the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim and introduces some new environmental puzzles. God of War: Ragnarok will allow players to travel to all of the nine realms, meaning areas previously beyond the scope of exploration in God of War (2018) will new be open for exploration bringing in brand new experiences to players in Ragnarok.
The gameplay footage shown revealed a giant, industrialized dwarven realm, complete with "technical marvels like mine pits, artificial water channels, and sprawling cities," which will no-doubt lead to a number of environmental puzzles.
The video shows off some of the puzzle mechanics in Svartalfheim (one of the nine realms) and how Kratos can use his new abilities to engage with them. The geysers around the realm can be frozen with the Leviathan Axe to form a makeshift platform, for instance, while Kratos' Chaos Blades can dismantle some dwarven machinery.
The original God of War (the 2018 reboot, that is) focused on six of the nine realms of Norse mythology: Midgard, Alfheim, Helheim, Jotunheim, Muspelheim, and Niflheim. In Ragnarok players will visit revamped versions of these realms, and in addition will also gain access to Svartalfheim alongside Vanaheim and Asgard.
