Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps will be the Numero Uno for the Lionesses this summer after an impressive club season. Sarina Wiegman has trusted Earps between the sticks and she will be looking to repay that same trust as England go into this tournament as one of the favorites. 

This is the first major tournament for the dynamic duo of Ella Toone and Alessia Russo. Toone and Russo have excited a lot of people this season and have been used as impact subs in the last few warmup games. A lot of people have touted for this duo to start in the tournament after impressive performances for both club and country in the recent months. 

The trio will be at the forefront of England’s quest to lift their first ever Euro trophy after finishing as runners-up in 1984 and 200. Head coach Sarina Wiegman won the competition in 2017 as the head coach of the Oranje.

Jackie Groenen, who is often called THE SYSTEM, is a part of Mark Parsons’ Dutch side for the 2022 Euro. The Netherlands are the reigning champions of the European Championship, having won the tournament in 2017 under the leadership of Sarina Wiegman, who is now the head coach of England. 

Jackie is like a silent guardian; one won’t see her on the scoresheet much but that doesn’t mean she has no impact in games. A box-to-box midfielder, the former judo practitioner has been an everpresent figure in the Oranje and Manchester United side. The Netherlands go into this tournament to defend their title and will be glad that one of their best midfielders is a part of the squad. Parsons’ side has struggled lately but with players like Groenen, Miedema, Martens, van de Donk in their ranks, one shouldn't underestimate them.
