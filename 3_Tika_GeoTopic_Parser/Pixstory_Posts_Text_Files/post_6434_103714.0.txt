“ It’s so easy to give up when it feels a lot harder to keep going.”

I said this to myself tonight as I think about and have been through some of the most difficult times in my life. You push so hard to make each step count but then get exhausted and start to question each move that has been made. Yes it’s easy to give up but what is the purpose of giving up when you came this far, by yourself? All the sweat, tears, pain and sacrifices made while getting to where you are; just to let it go….. 

I think not! Keep going, keep pushing and follow your path that has been made out for you. No one ever said it was easy and you didn’t come this far to throw all that hard work away. You got this and I love you❤️🌹 

This is a message to all who simply can resonate. You are brave, you are loved, you are light. Keep going ✨
