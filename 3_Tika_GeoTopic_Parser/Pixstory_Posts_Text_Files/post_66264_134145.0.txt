Actually one of the most underrated movies of all time. Destined to become a cult classic in future, before eventually being rediscovered in the mainstream for the awesome that it truly is. 
Great writing, music selection, solid performances and location-loving photography fly beneath the critics' radar who are seemingly blinded by the headlights of the simple tropes they identify. But the film is so much more than its familiar tropes, prejudiced critics are just blinded by their desire to put a car action flic into the non-serious box, too scared to be seen to endorse or even find kinship with the very real universe its fleshed-out characters inhabit. 
The film captures Tokyo at its most over-the-top eternal neon city peak, full of alt-fashion-loving energetic youth, swarming to a moving soundtrack, pushed forward by a universal and nuanced story about coming of age, love, responsibility and right and wrong. 
It's up their with East of Eden, but because it's part of a car-loving action flic franchise, most critics will be hobbled in their ability to appreciate it for the next 60 years. The emotional climax is also the visual climax and music climax, drifting in the mountains near Tokyo.
It's a really fantastically paced, entertaining, well-performed and beautifully shot classic. Give it a try and go to it without trying to pick holes, and if you're open you'll be delightfully surprised and rewarded for your lack of bias and empathy with this wonderful film.
