Yes, it is a move worth celebrating but fir many other reasons than you mentioned!

Forgiving student debt will help lessen the racial divide in our country. In times where black people are constantly fighting to achieve the “American dream”, this move is a ray of hope. I know countless of black people who were not able to afford education because of fear of mounting loans. Moreover, even the most successful of people in their fields could not bear the fruits of their hardwork because of loans. This furthermore increased the divide in the society, but now no more!

Data on the disparities in the effects of student debt on white and black students has been accumulating for years. 

According to reports, here's one of the more eye-catching figures: The average white borrower has paid off around 95 percent of their original sum after 20 years, whereas the average black borrower has paid off only 5 percent. As a result, student debt was widening the racial wealth gap among younger borrowers, this move of eliminating a significant portion of it would help to close it.
