 Rajasthan's Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot decides to run for party president, the Congress today gave the impression that it would rethink its "one man, one job" policy.
The Gandhis' preferred candidate for Congress president is reportedly Ashok Gehlot, 71, but he is a nervous candidate. He spoke about his major concern with Sonia Gandhi this evening.
Gehlot reportedly fears that if he assumes a national position, challenger Sachin Pilot, whose uprising nearly toppled his government in 2020, will take over as chief minister of Rajasthan.
After the meeting, a prominent Member made a shocking remark. When asked about the "one man, one post" rule in the event that Gehlot is elected Congress President, Venugopal responded, "It will depend on who contests and wins."
Gehlot has made it known that he wants to keep both positions. Although it is not prohibited by the Congress constitution, the party approved the "one man, one post" rule earlier this year in Udaipur, Rajasthan, where internal changes and elections were covered over a three-day meeting.
Before meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Gehlot told reporters that "one individual can continue to be a minister and still be elected Congress president."
He declared, "I won't back down, I'll do whatever that helps the party, one post, two posts, or three posts.
The signs do not look good for Sachin Pilot, who stated today that he would follow the wishes of his party leaders.
On Monday, Gehlot will submit his nomination. Shashi Tharoor, who has previously received approval from Sonia Gandhi to run for Congress president, will be his opponent.
