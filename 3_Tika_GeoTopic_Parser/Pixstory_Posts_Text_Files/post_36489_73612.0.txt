Agrasen ki Baoli aka Ugrasen ki Baoli stands in the heart of Delhi as an exquisite example of splendid architecture and ancient engineering skills. In the 14thÂ century, it was rebuilt by the people of the Agrawal community who are known to be the descendants of Maharaja Agrasen. Ugrasen ki Baoli was built to serve not only as a water reservoir but also as a community place. It is believed that women of those times used to assemble at this well and the cool ambiance of the baoli provided them with the perfect spot to relax and spend some moments away from the scorching heat outside.
