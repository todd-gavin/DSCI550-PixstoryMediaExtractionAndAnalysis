#3.    Joao Cancelo 

From one Manchester City player to another. Joao Cancelo is one of the best full-backs in the world right now. Even though he hasn’t been playing from his favoured position of right-back still he has managed to play in sublime fashion in the season. He is in great form right now and holds a key to Manchester City’s success. Cancelo is one of the most technically proficient players in the world. In his 38 appearances, this season Cancelo has scored three goals and provided eight assists.


#2.    Diogo Jota

Diogo Jota has been excellent for Liverpool this season. It is tough to perform with the likes of Mohamed Salah who has been phenomenal for the reds. But Jota has managed to show what he is capable of by putting up some phenomenal performances. He is one of the sharpest attackers in the Premier League. His finishing ability, agility and work rate are par excellence. Jota has scored 18 goals and provided three assists in his 38 appearances this season.


#1.  Cristiano Ronaldo 

Cristiano Rolando is arguably one of the greatest players of all time. His fitness levels, his ability to score goals in any given situation, his mind-blowing free kicks are just some of the few things that make him such a great player. He has been at the top for a long time, however, after coming back to Manchester United the Portuguese player hasn’t been able to live up to the unattainable standards that he had set for himself in the past. His stature and his goal-scoring ability make him the best Portuguese player in 2022.
