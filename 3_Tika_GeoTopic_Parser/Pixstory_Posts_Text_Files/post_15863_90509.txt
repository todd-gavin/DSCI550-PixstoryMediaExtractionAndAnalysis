Sascha Reiff Stephen Fava Abstract Background and aims A J shaped relationship between HbA c and mortality has been reported in subjects with type diabetes T D The postulated mechanism linking low HbA c with increased mortality is increased hypoglycaemia risk We tested this hypothesis by comparing the relationship between low HbA c to mortality in patients on therapies with different hypoglycaemia risk Methods We selected patients on any type of treatment for diabetes from a national electronic database n and linked to other databases including laboratory database and the national mortality register Results We observed a J shaped or U shaped association between HbA c and all cause mortality in the whole type diabetes patient cohort as well as in patients on metformin monotherapy and in those on metformin sulphonylurea combination therapy but not in subjects on sulphonylurea monotherapy or in those on insulin Conclusions Our data confirm the J shaped relationship between HbA c and mortality in type diabetes but suggest that a low HbA c is deleterious even in absence of hypoglycaemia and that subjects with type diabetes might require a slightly elevated blood glucose for optimal outcome Our data also suggest that the increased mortality associated with sulphonylureas cannot be mediated solely through increased hypoglycaemia risk Sources
