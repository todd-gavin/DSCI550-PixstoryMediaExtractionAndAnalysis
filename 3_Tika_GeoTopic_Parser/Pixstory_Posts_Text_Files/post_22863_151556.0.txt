5) Nottingham Forest 
The Sleeping Giants have awoken but are not doing so well in the PL. Nottingham do have a good squad given the amount of signings they made. Can you take the former CL winners to their glory days?
4) Leeds United 
After merely surving relegation, and the departure of Philips and Raphinha leaving a hole in the squad. Leeds are going through a rebuild and you could guide them through and even take them to the CL.
3) Everton
Similar like Leeds, Everton also merely survived relegation. And the departure of Richarlison the Toffes are thin up front. Everton do have a good transfer budget and are a massive club. So can you make the toffee the higher power in Merseyside. 
2) Liverpool
The aging Liverpool team looks like they have hit their peak. Their is a major rebuild and you do have exciting players like Nunez, Jones and Diaz to work with 
1) Manchester United 
I guess you could do a better job than most of the United managers that took the hot seat at Old Trafford. Unlike real life you do have a massive budget to build a dream team that could challenge the likes of City.
