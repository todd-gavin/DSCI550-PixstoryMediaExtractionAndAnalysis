Augustine Eguavoen has resigned as Nigeria national team coach, effective immediately, just three months after taking over from Gernot Rohr.

This news comes just two days after the Super Eagles were denied qualification for the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. Needing a win to beat Ghana to the ticket, his team could only manage a 1-1 tie at the MKO Abiola Stadium. Thomas Partey put the Black Stars ahead in the ninth minute, but William Troost-Ekong equalised from the penalty spot after Ademola Lookman was fouled.

Following their inability to produce a winner, their dream of appearing in the Middle East nation's global football showpiece faded into thin air.

While Eguavoen was unavailable for comment, a member of the country's football governing body confirmed the news.

"Well, this is very true. We can only wish him the best of luck," a top NFF official who pleaded anonymity told GOAL.

"Everyone is really down at the moment as we will not be playing at the 2022 Fifa World Cup. It is a step backwards for our football but I am very optimistic we will bounce back better."

Eguavoen, who played for the Super Eagles for 11 years, was named interim manager of the West Africans in December after Gernot Rohr was fired after five years in charge.

After the 33rd edition of the biennial African football showpiece in Cameroon, his contract called for him to make way for Portuguese tactician Jose Peseiro.

In his first assignment, he led Nigeria to the Round of 16 of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, which will be hosted by Cameroon. Despite winning all of their group matches, the three-time African champions were eliminated by Tunisia following a 1-0 loss at Garoua. Following the failure of that expedition, Nigerians expressed their desire to see the African football icon continue in that capacity, having won against Egypt, Sudan, and Guinea-Bissau in Cameroon. Regardless, the 56-year-old will continue to serve as technical director of the Nigeria Football Federation.
