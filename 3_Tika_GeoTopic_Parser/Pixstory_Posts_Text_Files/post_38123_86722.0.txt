Kerala Blasters beat Jamshedpur FC by a scoreline of 1-0 in the first leg of their semifinals clash. Here are a few key points from the game

1: Jamshedpur miss early chances. Their striker Chukwu was guilty of missing two key chances and it ended up costing them dearly in the end!

2. Sahal Abdul Samad continues his dream run for the Blasters. The Kerala-based midfielder scored his 5th ISL goal of the season. 

3. Adrian Luna hit the bar in the second half with another dangerous strike. The fan favourite could have doubled the Blaster's lead but TP Rehenesh deflected his effort to the post

4. Owen Coyle needs to stage another comeback in the second leg. But the Scottish manager is surely the best person for this. Hence, the Jamshedpur fans would remain positive with their manager at the helm. 

5. Prediction for the second leg: I expect Jamshedpur FC to come in with all guns blazing. There is a real possibility that we could see the game going to extra time in the second leg!
