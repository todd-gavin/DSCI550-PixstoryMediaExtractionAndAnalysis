Most of us might have used the ear bud at least once in our lifetime. Now we may think this cleans the ears by getting the earwax out, but that's absolutely not right. 

Out body is well equipped to handle with the earwax that it no longer needs. By chewing, with other jaw movements and with the skin growing inside the ear will push out old earwax naturally. By using a cotton swabs, it could push the wax deeper into the ear canal. And this could seriously damage our ear canal skin or our eardrums. 

Earwax building up is not bery  ommon. As per American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery, about 1 in 10 children and 1 in 20 adults have this problem. Some people might be prone to have earwax builded up. 

Here are some signs of too much earwax that's stuck or blocking the ear canal 

• Pain or itching 

• A feeling that your ear is full 

• Ringing in the ear (tinnitus) 

• Hearing loss (or a change in how well hearing aids work, for those who use them) 

• Odor or discharge 

If you experience any of these symptoms, you will have to consult a doctor or other health care provider.
