Working women , even in today’s day and age , have to battle with the questions of “ Why do you need to work ?” and “ You are not the breadwinner for the family then what’s the point ? ” 
Working women tend to be like a pendulum clock oscillating between work demands and home chores ! Between these oscillations , there are social expectations to match up to and the constant anxiety of keeping up with demands of both the worlds , knowing that the slightest error can cost her so much .  
Most women find themselves messed up between responsibilities at home and outside . And this leads to emotional burden ! At the same time , at home , a woman is expected to continue fulfilling her ‘natural’ duties as a mother and wife ! The combination of workload and family responsibilities together results in the risk of experiencing mental distress .
women in full-time jobs are nearly twice as likely to have mental health problems as men with full-time jobs . Working conditions and environment can have a huge impact on mental health ! This leads to the negligence of wellbeing , with sacrifices made of the body and mind . Sleep disturbances interfere with dopamine levels , leading to an imbalance associated with bipolar and schizophrenic disorders ! 
The guilt of working all the time – even after regular working hours – has become a norm . For women to be able to find some time to focus on the self has been challenging .
So in between all these responsibilities , try to take time for yourself too ! ✅
