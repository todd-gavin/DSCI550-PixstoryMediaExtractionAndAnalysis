But for young Sanju, those bowling records were just in score sheets. He drove, sweeped, hit, cut and pulled away, had taken runs briskly and took team to the target with 5 overs left. He was bowled by slow medium bowler Nagaraj in a Yorker while going for another slog hit to finish off the game in style. 

His score read as
SV Samson B Nagaraj 104 (approx 76 balls)

He showed his masterclass, proved why he is different and unique in cricket. His style of cricket was attacking the opponent from ball one and to watch the game was another visual treat for our eyes. 

He never looked back from there on, moving to higher levels of Kerala cricket, IPL - Rajasthan Royals, under 19 Indian team, and finally Indian Cricket Team. 

BCCI should realise and respect his skill and potential and give enough opportunity for his contributions to the game of cricket.
