 I can t take a stance on this case Live streaming on multiple platforms featuring a wide range of celebrity witnesses what not How interested are people in the lives of celebs and how can they make everything about them even a serious and private issue public I mean advertising on it and too much PR work Everyone has an opinion including myself on this issue between two individuals and of course they have live streamed it What was this all about defamation concerning an op ed Heard wrote in for The Washington Post in which she names herself as a figure of abuse without naming Depp But Depp s lawyers contend that the implication was obvious that Heard undermined Depp s reputation and lost him several roles Even before Depp s victory at the court the public had a winner Johnny Depp is a superstar who enjoys the advantage of a dedicated fanbase he has to cultivate for decades billion views for his hashtag and million for heard and other tags for her including offensive ones Plain and simple psychology it is unusual for men to come out on domestic abuse causing attention to the inconsistent information Moreover Nobody wants to see their heroes fall and Heard s accusations against Depp spurred a defensive backlash that has since altered into a misogynistic witch hunt Depp s fans have normalized a level of hatred and mockery of her Amber Heard is a considerably younger less influential actor than Depp no goofy alter go to shield her accusations The beginning of the trial showed some pretty damning evidence against her such as an audio recording of Heard admitting to hitting Depp and gaslighting him But the two recorded each other quite a bit during their lowest moments painting a more complicated picture Intimate intoxicated conversations revoltingly misogynistic texts outbursts of rage and violence blades broken bottles intact bottles and trashed hotel rooms as Heard s team brings out more witnesses and evidence All we know is that this way a two way toxic relationship why is one person being blamed and another being celebrated
