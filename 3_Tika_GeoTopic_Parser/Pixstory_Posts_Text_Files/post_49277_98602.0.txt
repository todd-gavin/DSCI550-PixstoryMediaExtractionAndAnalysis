A Florida teacher, Casey Scott, alleges she was fired after sharing her pansexuality with middle school students. After that, students at Trafalgar Middle School made flags that represented their own sexuality and gender identities, which ranged from transgender to non-binary to gay.

She, then, pasted those drawings at her classroom door before the administration asked her to remove them. When the kids shared it with their parents, the school was met with displeased responses. Parents, angry over this discussion, wrote to the school to fire the teacher.

Scott was told not to return to campus and that her contract would be cancelled. She was on probation and not a member of the teachers union.

Cishet teachers have been telling the stories of their marriages to the kids in schools forever, love stories like Romeo-Juliet and Cinderella-Prince Charming are shown to kids in dramatized, lavish manner but a queer woman talking about her life gets her fired.

Not to mention, the kids who finally had courage and a safe space to present themselves as they are, to talk about their identity and come out as who they feel they are were also silenced by this act of queerphobia. How long will queer people face such discrimination in America?
