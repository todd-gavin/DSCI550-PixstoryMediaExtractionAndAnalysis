Kevin De Bruyne gives Manchester City the advantage The game between Manchester City and Atletico Madrid was a very cagey affair Diego Simeone had set his team in a defensive formation and the Spanish giants hardly made any errors off the ball Despite dominating the possession stats Manchester City had not troubled Jan Oblak Hence with a scoreline at halftime City needed inspiration from somewhere This inspiration eventually came from Phil Foden The young Englishman provided the crucial assist just minutes after coming on Kevin De Bruyne did the rest as he slotted the ball past Jan Oblak to give Manchester City a crucial advantage in the UEFA Champions League tie Atletico Madrid took zero shots against Manchester City Yes you read that right Atletico Madrid did not register a single shot in the UEFA Champions League game against Manchester City It seemed as though Diego Simeone had set up Atletico Madrid to get a draw on the night But Kevin De Bruyne might have spoiled his plans as the Spanish giants trail by a goal after the first leg Diego Simeone refused to shake Pep Guardiola s hand Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone refused to shake Pep Guardiola s hand at the end of the game But this could be a ritual for the Argentinian rather than a way of protest Diego Simeone has done the same in the past with Jurgen Klopp as well The Atletico Madrid manager had also stated earlier that he doesn t like shaking hands with the opposition manager after the game Hence this explains why he chose not to do it after the first leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter finals tie All to play for at the Estadio Wanda Metropolitano Atletico Madrid will welcome Manchester City for the second leg of their UEFA Champions League tie on the th of April But the tie could still go in anyone s favour as a advantage is not very significant Both Pep Guardiola and Diego Simeone would certainly be aware of this as well Hence a moment of genius from any of the Atletico Madrid players could take away City s advantage
