We all go through difficult times, and I did as well, but it was no great deal.

Whenever I meet someone new, I want to know everything about them, which leads to all the good and bad times, making me realise that if they can cope with their bag, I can deal with mine as well.

My flaw is that I can't read people, therefore I've met a lot of individuals who aren't right for me, but I've also met some amazing infants who are aware of my flaw, and I now have a large number of personal bodyguards.
