Defying the Supreme Court, more than 80 of the nation's top elected prosecutors declare that they would not press charges against any woman for having an abortion because doing so would "run counter" to their oaths of office and "make a mockery of justice."

“Not all of us agree on a personal or moral level on the issue of abortion,” according to the joint statement released by the 83 prosecutors. “But we stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions. As such, we decline to use our offices’ resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions.”

Resistance is a form of protests and I'm so glad people who have the power to bring change are trying to do so. It's saddening to see all those who are just misusing their power to exploit the marginalized.
