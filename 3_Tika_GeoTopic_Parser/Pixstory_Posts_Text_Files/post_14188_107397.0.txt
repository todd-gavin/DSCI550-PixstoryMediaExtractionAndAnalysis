James Garner will get the chance to prove his worth to new Man United boss Erik ten Hag in pre-season before they decide whether to send the young midfielder out on loan again after impressing with Nottingham Forest 

Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has said he wants to take a look at James Garner during pre-season before making a decision about his future at the club.

The 21-year-old academy product spent the 2021-2022 campaign out on loan at Nottingham Forest - helping Steve Cooper's side secure promotion to the Premier League. 

Garner has since returned to Old Trafford and could be awarded a place in the United XI next season as Ten Hag is struggling to reinforce his defensive midfield.
