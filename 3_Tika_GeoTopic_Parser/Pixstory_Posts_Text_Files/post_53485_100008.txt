When people talk about ways to slow climate change they often mention trees and for good reason Forests take up a large amount of the planet warming carbon dioxide that people put into the atmosphere when they burn fossil fuels But will trees keep up that pace as global temperatures rise With companies increasingly investing in forests as offsets saying it cancels out their continuing greenhouse gas emissions that s a multibillion dollar question The results of two studies published in the journals Science and Ecology Letters on May one focused on growth the other on death raise new questions about how much the world can rely on forests to store increasing amounts of carbon in a warming future Ecologist William Anderegg who was involved in both studies explains why What does the new research tell us about trees and their ability to store carbon The future of forests is on a knife s edge with a tug of war between two very important forces the benefits trees get from increasing levels of carbon dioxide and the stresses they face from the climate such as heat drought fires pests and pathogens Those climate stresses are increasing a lot faster as the planet warms than scientists had expected We re seeing immense wildfires and drought driven forest die offs much sooner than anyone had anticipated When those trees die that carbon goes back into the atmosphere We re also seeing evidence that the benefits trees get from higher levels of carbon dioxide in a warming world may be more limited than people realize This tells us it s probably not a great idea to count on forests for a widespread carbon sink through the st century particularly if societies don t reduce their emissions A female forestry technician cuts a fallen tree with a chainsaw in a forest with dead and dying pine trees whose needles have turned brown Droughts have made trees more vulnerable to fires and beetle attacks Read more
