When it comes to periods it can be sometimes be difficult to know what s normal and what s not Particularly when what s normal vs not isn t always discussed This really holds true for heavy periods or menorrhagia menorrhagia is defined by a volume of blood losing more than mLs of blood but who knows what mLs of blood is Thankfully there s been a change in what we look at as abnormal or too heavy Menorrhagia can REALLY interfere with your quality of life and any of these things deserve to be looked at and discussed with your doctor Soaking through pads within an hour Needing to combine pads and tampons Using menstrual products and flooding through onto clothes Needing to change menstrual products overnight or flooding onto bed sheets Passing large clots Larger than Causing very low iron This may cause symptoms like being short of breath tired ringing in your ears chest pain and sometimes will even need a blood transfusion Having periods that last longer than days Menstrual cups typically hold mLs so you may be able to measure your volume of blood loss if you use these Any bleeding that interferes with you quality of life and ability to work go to school go out I hope this is helpful for identifying some of the things which may not be normal
