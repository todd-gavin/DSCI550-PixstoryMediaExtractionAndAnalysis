Bollywood legend Aamir Khan on Sunday hosted a pre-match show ahead of the exhilarating IPL 2022 final between Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals and got to speak to Afghan star cricketer Rashid Khan – who is a big fan of the actor.  

For Rashid, it was a dream come true and following their conversation, Rashid was invited to Aamir Khan’s home to put his culinary skills to the test.  

Speaking to Rashid, Aamir Khan said: “I heard you recently cooked for the Gujarat Titans team. I would love to taste the food cooked by you. Next time, when you are in Mumbai, come to my home to make food for me.”   

Rashid immediately accepted his invitation and said he had always wanted to meet the Bollywood star.  

“I have a dream to meet you in person, and I would definitely come to your house when I am in Mumbai,” said Rashid. 

Rashid’s cooking skills came to light recently when he posted a video on social media of him cooking what looks like a mouth-watering chicken curry for his fellow teammates.
