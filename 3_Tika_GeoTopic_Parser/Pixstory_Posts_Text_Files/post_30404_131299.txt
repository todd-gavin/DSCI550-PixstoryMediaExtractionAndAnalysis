The farewell of Dries Mertens to Napoli was not painless after years of militancy in the blue team. The Belgian who moved to Galatasaray spoke for the first time about the separation in an interview with Dazn. My wife cried at the thought of leaving that house. we decided to keep it and try to spend as much time there as possible It was nine wonderful years in which we met extraordinary people for this I can only say thank you The divorce took place over the summer when the new season was just around the corner Mertens believes that the company Campana could have moved differently It could have ended differently the club could have talked about it sooner but I hope that we can learn from this so that Napoli becomes even bigger I will always be the first blues fan I saw the match against Monza I must say that the very high level I am happy because the players are showing enthusiasm they are strong young and willing to win I hope they continue to grow
