Cont …..When you strive to be in the moment and not drift away in contemplation, it reinforces your ability to be in the spirit of receptivity. The moment you pay attention, the speaker will soften and connect better. The body language,  facial expressions,  eye contact, and verbal responses encourage or discourage the speaker. An atmosphere without interruptions is effective for communication and understanding. 
Like any other skill, practice will make us perfect, and we learn along the way, increasing our understanding of the world around us. Lack of it is making us intolerant and isolated so we need to put aside our ego and really listen. Non-defensive attitude, whether you agree with the speaker’s point of view or not, will take the dialogue further. Be mindful while talking, well aware of the purpose, and concerned about the listener’s capability and interest to make the conversation delightful. It is the art of being a good human who has a genuine interest in the other person. 
Communication experts believe that one needs to engage in a dialogue, not a monologue. Be clear about what you want from the conversation and do keep in mind the interest of the listener. Empathy and compassion are handy tools when we are on either side of the conversation.
