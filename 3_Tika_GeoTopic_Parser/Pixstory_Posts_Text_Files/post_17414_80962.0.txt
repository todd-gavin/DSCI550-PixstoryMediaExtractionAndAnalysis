Full of confidence following their massive 5-1 win at Lille last weekend, Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) welcomed Rennes to the Parc des Princes on Friday night.

To everyone’s surprise, Mauricio Pochettino’s men struggled to get a foothold in the game and could not find a winner in the normal 90 minutes. Their blushes were finally saved by a Kylian Mbappe strike from a Lionel Messi assist three minutes into injury time, which sealed a narrow 1-0 win for the hosts.

The win saw PSG go 16 points clear at the top of the table, having played a game more than second-placed Marseille.

PSG, as expected, had more of the ball, but chances in the final third were at a premium. The first real opportunity of the match fell to Rennes in the seventh minute when midfielder Benjamin Bourigeaud drew Keylor Navas into action with a header.

For the home side, it was Mbappe who first had a crack at Rennes’ goal. Unfortunately, his curling effort was a smidgen wide of the target.

Mbappe continued to torment the Rennes defense in the second half and saw a dizzying effort hit the side netting. The two teams exchanged a couple of blows, but could not land the knockout punch inside 90 minutes.

Finally, in the 93rd minute, the Paris Saint-Germain No.7 broke the deadlock from a neat Lionel Messi pass, shattering the hearts of away supporters.

It was not the most convincing of displays by PSG but it was certainly enough to clinch them three points.
