Ever since Shah Rukh Khan’s photos from Brahmastra leaked online, there has been speculation that the actor is playing a special role of Vanarastra in Ayan Mukerji’s film. While the makers have stayed mum about his appearance, actor Mouni Roy has spilled the beans about the same.
In a recent chat with Bollywood Hungama, Mouni casually mentioned Shah Rukh Khan’s name as she spoke about her co-actors in Brahmastra. Talking about working with stalwarts, she said, “When you are working with Ranbir, Alia, Bachchan sir, Nagarjuna sir, Shah Rukh sir has also played a guest appearance in it.”
Mouni shared that she started working on Brahmastra years ago and was initially approached for a special appearance. “I came on board as a special appearance to it becoming a lengthier role, to me becoming the antagonist and the main villain in the film,” she said. The Naagin actor added, “It’s one of the most challenging roles that I have ever played.”
Brahmastra is scheduled to release in theatres on September 9. The film is planned as a trilogy and will release in multiple languages across the country. “All these years, Brahmāstra has belonged mainly to me and to the core team around me. But from September 9th – it will belong more to the audiences who experience it and hopefully appreciate it ! Very emotional, nervous, exciting, non-stop work days as we prepare to let Brahmāstra go out fully into this World! #brahmastra,” Ayan had earlier shared on Instagram.
