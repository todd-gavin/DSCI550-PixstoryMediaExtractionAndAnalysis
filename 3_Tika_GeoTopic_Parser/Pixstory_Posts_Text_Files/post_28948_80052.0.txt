The conduct towards the LGBT community in India has not been very progressive even after homosexuality was decriminalized. To add salt to their wounds, a recent incident highlights the atrocities faced by them. A 21-year-old student, Anjana Hareesh, committed suicide. While the exact reason behind her death is unknown, it is alleged that there is a link between her suicide and the fact that she was forced into conversion therapy by her family for months after coming out as bisexual.

Conversion therapy is a practice to change the sexual orientation of an individual, from homosexuality to heterosexuality. This practice has been denounced by the medical community as unethical because it is done assuming homosexuality as a mental illness, even though there exists no scientific evidence.
Instances also highlight the usage of electric shocks to treat homosexuality, which is not only violative of human rights but also the fundamental right to life protected under Article 21 of the India Constitution.
