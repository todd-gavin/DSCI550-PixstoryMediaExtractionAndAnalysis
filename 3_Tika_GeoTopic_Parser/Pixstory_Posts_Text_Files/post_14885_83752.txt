The erucine active ingredient contained in rocket but also in broccoli and cabbage which together with rocket are part of the Brassicaceae or cruciferous family a prodrug capable of releasing hydrogen sulphide gas with the characteristic smell of rotten eggs the same that we find in some thermal springs and which the Romans already exploited for its beneficial properties The body is able to produce hydrogen sulphide autonomously but in some pathological situations such as arterial hypertension it is lacking and therefore it is necessary to take it from external sources In particular, erucine has a dual effect on the cardiovascular system, on the one hand, it induces the dilation of blood vessels, lowering blood pressure, on the other, it has antioxidant properties, therefore it protects the blood vessel wall from the oxidative phenomena of aging. We have been studying erucine for more than years, explains Alma Martelli, associate professor of Pharmacology at the Department of Pharmacy of the University of Pisa and member of the Italian Society of Pharmacology first through in vitro tests then on cultures of human cells from the wall of the aorta and endothelium then on isolated vessels of animals and finally on intact healthy and hypertensive animal Currently thanks to the collaboration with The internal medicine department of the University of Pisa is studying the effects of erucin on human vessels from obese patients taken during bariatric surgery. After this phase, we will move on to clinical trials with the administration of erucin to patients. The data obtained so far are very promising but there is still a lack of data on a significant number of patients In the meantime we can be optimistic A Chinese and an Australian study verified the general cardiovascular parameters of patients who used to eat arugula, broccoli or cabbage showing a significant reduction in deaths from cardiovascular causes Compared to cabbage and broccoli it must be said that rocket has an advantage since it is eaten raw it preserves the active ingredient intact from the deterioration resulting from cooking, something that cabbage and broccoli inevitably encounter since they are vegetables that are eaten cooked
