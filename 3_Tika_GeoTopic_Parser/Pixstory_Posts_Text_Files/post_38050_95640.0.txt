As per the Hard Tackle, Manchester United  have shortlisted Sergio Ramos as one of their potential options.

The Paris Saint-Germain defender is one of the best center-backs to ever grace the game owing to his legendary tenure at Real Madrid. But Ramos' time has been disastrous with PSG up until now.

Nevertheless, with the future of Eric Bailly and Hardy Maguire up in the air. Manchester United are reportedly looking to take a chance with Sergio Ramos. The Red Devils are hoping to recreate the Varane-Ramos partnership from their Real Madrid days.

Injuries have plagued both Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane since they left Real Madrid in the summer. Both the players have struggled to keep themselves fully fit. But the Spaniard has experienced it worse among the two.

Sergio Ramos has played just 8 games for Paris Saint-Germain in all competitions since joining the club in the summer of last year.  Owing to this, the defender has failed to get going in the 2021/22 season. 

Owing to his injuries and a loss of form, Sergio Ramos was excluded from Spain's squad in the UEFA Euros 2021 and the UEFA Nations League 2021 competitions. With PSG looking to re-haul themselves, Ramos could eventually be forced to leave in the summer.




Should United invest in Ramos?

Though the 36-year-old center-back is one of the best defenders in history, his current form isn't up to the mark. To add to this, Manchester United are still coping with the injury concerns of Raphael Varane and shouldn't make a similar mistake with Sergio Ramos.

MLS side Inter Miami are also keeping an eye on Sergio Ramos as they look to sign him in the summer. Hence it has to be seen if United go for Ramos or they instead sign a younger defender in the summer
