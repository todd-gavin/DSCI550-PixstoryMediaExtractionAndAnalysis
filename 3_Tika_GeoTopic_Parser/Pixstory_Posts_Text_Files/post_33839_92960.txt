Convincing victory for Lazio by Sarei at Genoa This is Sarei&#39;s analysis at the final whistle We&#39;ve made a few missteps lately Unfortunately we made it in the only match we shouldn&#39;t have and this is something I still feel against me because that was the game not to be missed I reminded him every day That is a life lesson not a sporting one just so they don&#39;t forget Ciro doesn&#39;t need defense attorneys He has numbers that speak for themselves The first question they asked me today if he was in shock for the national team He is a certainty He makes news if he stays two games dry, not when he scores
