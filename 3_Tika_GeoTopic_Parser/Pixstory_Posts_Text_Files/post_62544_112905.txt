You must have heard stories of squirrel adopting orphaned or abandoned babies somewhere At the very least you must have seen a post like that being circulated on social media But why does that happen American red squirrels tend to adopt However there s a catch They only adopt their own kin Complicated Yeah it is It is a lot like humans for that matter If someone in our relation is orphaned especially as a child we tend to offer them help while we may not always adopt someone who we don t know Red squirrels when nursing to their own pups would adopt a pup of their relatives or parents They do not adopt a lot though because they have to take care of their own children that are already in the litter They might adopt their nieces nephews grandchildren or siblings
