A tsunami of intolerance has engulfed the sporting world. Wave after wave of prejudice continues to make equitable sports participation difficult, and the most recent news heaves trans athletes of all ages overboard into a swirling current of exclusion and stigmatization.

The International Swimming Federation recently implemented measures so absurd — an athlete must fully transition by age 12 — that trans athletes are now functionally banned as few jurisdictions offer such therapies until after puberty.

But it isn’t just swimming, the International Rugby League recently barred trans players while it reviews its own policies.

Some of the most shocking and exclusionary measures, however, have been concocted more locally in the United States, where children are being denied the opportunity to participate in sport on the basis of their gender identities and some state legislatures are even contemplating prohibiting access to trans-specific medical care.

Excluding children for political gain
In a recent poll from the Washington Post and the University of Maryland, a majority of Americans opposed the inclusion of trans athletes in girls’ and women’s sports at the high school (55 per cent), college (58 per cent) and professional (58 per cent) levels.

When it came to youth sport, the results shifted somewhat. Forty-nine per cent of those polled opposed the inclusion of trans athletes in youth sport, with 33 per cent in favour of inclusion and 17 per cent expressing no opinion.

Republican lawmakers, however, are excluding trans youth from sport at a shocking rate, with state after state passing legislation to limit their access to sport.
