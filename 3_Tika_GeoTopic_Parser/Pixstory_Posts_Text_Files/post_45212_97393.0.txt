Mauricio Pochettino recruited Son from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, and he has been at Spurs
ever since. As a result, the winger is one of the club's longest-serving players, having seen the
club's recent highs and lows.

The 29-year-old was a key member of Pochettino's team that advanced to the 2019 Champions
League final. Tottenham has had three managers since Pochettino's firing just over five months
later, all attempting to turn the club back into a Premier League and European force.

Conte is the current holder of the position. He took over from Nuno Espirito Santo and Jose
Mourinho, and has experienced similar challenges during his tenure.

Son addressed the contrasts between the managers he has worked with to Stadium Astro.

Indeed, the winger included Roger Schmidt, his former Leverkusen coach, in the mix.

“Every single training session he’s always shouting, always giving details because if somebody
doesn’t do what he asks for, he’s angry.

“The details what he asks for is really important for him and really important for us as well.

Everyone is following this direction and everyone just loves it.”

Son indeed declared that “I fell in love” as training sessions designed to make players “perfect”
are sometimes gruelling, but will pay off because Conte “knows how to win”.

Conte has had a strong start at Tottenham, with a 2-2 draw against Premier League title
contenders Liverpool being a highlight. His Spurs team subsequently defeated Manchester City
at home, but that victory came after a period of inconsistency.

In the days leading up to the triumph over City, Tottenham also lost at home to relegation rivals
Burnley. Spurs, on the other hand, are back in contention for a top-four finish and have big
matches against Arsenal and Liverpool coming up.
