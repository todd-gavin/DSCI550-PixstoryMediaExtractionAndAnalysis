In the 5th test between India & England, it looks like the english will emerge victorious as less than 60 runs remain to the end.

This is Japsreet Bumrah's first test as the test captain of the Indian cricket team after he replaced Rohit Sharma.

Bumrah's first outing as the test captain is proving to be futile and it might be seen as a wrong decision as India is inching closing towards defeat.

Bumrah has played good innings as he created a new record for most wickets taken by an Indian bowler during a Test series in England which is no small feat. But the team is loosing the match. 

So does that mean Bumrah is a fabulous bowler but not as much when it comes to leading the team.
