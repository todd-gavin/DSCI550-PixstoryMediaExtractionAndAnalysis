 MAKES CUPCAKES OR ONE LAYER INCH CAKE A favorite with kids this recipe takes our classic vanilla cupcake and pairs it with a fudgy milk chocolate frosting While milk chocolate s qualities can sometimes feel diluted I wanted to find a way to reflect it perfectly in a frosting Upon remembering that top quality chocolatiers make milk chocolate by adding milk solids to dark chocolate I borrowed the method and mellowed a dark chocolate frosting base with cream cheese yielding a mightier milk chocolate experience cups all purpose flour teaspoon baking powder teaspoon baking soda teaspoon fine sea salt cup whole milk teaspoons pure vanilla extract cup stick unsalted butter slightly softened cup sugar large egg large egg whites Milk Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting Preheat the oven to F Line a cup cupcake pan with paper liners In a medium bowl whisk together the flour baking powder baking soda and salt In a small bowl stir together the milk and vanilla In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter and sugar on medium high speed until light and fluffy to minutes Reduce the speed to medium low slowly add the egg and egg whites one at a time and beat until creamy to minutes Slowly add half the flour mixture then the milk mixture then the remaining flour mixture beating until just blended after each addition Divide the batter evenly among the liners and bake until the tops are just dry to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean to minutes Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting with milk chocolate cream cheese frosting For frosting see support post
