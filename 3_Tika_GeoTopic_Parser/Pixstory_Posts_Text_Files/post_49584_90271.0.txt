Verstappen has been trending on twitter for hours with more than eighty six thousand tweets post his win at Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.

After a dramatic duel with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Red Bull's Max Verstappen won the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah on Sunday, the second round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship.

Sergio Perez of Red Bull led from the start of his maiden F1 campaign, but his race was derailed when he pitted just before a safety car, allowing Leclerc to take the lead ahead of Verstappen and Sainz.

After a furious duel in which they swapped the lead between them, Verstappen overcame Leclerc. With four laps to go, Verstappen made the critical move after a furious game of chicken over who would cross the DRS line first.
