hijab was imposed on Muslim women to protect them from the male gaze Those who wear it do so in the presence of men from outside the family Like the burqa the hijab too turns the wearer into an object that needs to be protected from the prying eyes The Quran we are told advises both men and women to dress modestly though in practice it is obviously only the latter who have to do their utmost to hide themselves The hijab veils much in other words but only unveils male chauvinism Given crimes against women in all societies everywhere Muslim women chose to embrace the imposition The custom over the centuries became a matter of identity for them But that does not take away from the fact the practice stems from gender politics that must be acknowledged Source Internet
