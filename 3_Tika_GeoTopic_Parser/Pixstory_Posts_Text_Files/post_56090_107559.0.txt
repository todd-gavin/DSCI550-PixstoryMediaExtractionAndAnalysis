“There Will Come Soft Rain” by Sara Teasdale

There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,

And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools singing at night,

And wild plum trees in tremulous white;

Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Whistling their whims on a low fence wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one

Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn

Would scarcely know that we were gone.

 Sara Teasdale published this lyric poem just after the start of the 1918 German Spring Offensive during World War I, and the 1918 flu pandemic. 

The poem is bout nature's establishment of a new peaceful order that will be neutral to the outcome of the war or mankind's extinction. 

The poem includes six stanzas, each made up of a rhyming couplet in irregular tetrameters.

The antiwar message is given through the poem. Dwelling on the loss caused by war—all of which reflect pacifist sentiments. 

Teasdale's point of view in "There Will Come to Soft Rains" that the universe has no caring attention to the existence or any actions of human beings expanded from her readings of the works of Charles Darwin, which began in earnest in 1913. The same principle applies to all of the other living things mentioned in the poem. Thus, given that swallows, frogs, and robins must kill other creatures to feed themselves, the serenity in the poetic settings for them symbolizes the dearth in their natures of war that is in human nature and not an idyllic world without violence.
