Every writing of Angelou is a work of art we want to visit again and again.
The words, the reflection of her intrepid nature, and the beauty she portrays being a phenomenal writer never fade.
Every time I'm turning pages to read some great American poets, her name appears first.
Some rare artists create such an impact, and she is one of them. The actual manifestation of a woman who wants to achieve everything they want, trying to eradicate all the stereotypes that would hinder her growth.
No doubt, Maya Angelou is a true inspiration to all women and will be in the future.
Her writings can do wonders.

Here's how she described her writing habits in a 1983 interview with Claudia Tate 

"I usually get up at about 5:30, and I'm ready to have coffee by 6, usually with my husband. He goes off to his work around 6:30, and I go off to mine. I keep a hotel room in which I do my workâ€”a tiny, mean room with just a bed, and sometimes, if I can find it, a face basin. I keep a dictionary, a Bible, a deck of cards and a bottle of sherry in the room. I try to get there around 7, and I work until 2 in the afternoon. If the work is going badly, I stay until 12:30. If it's going well, I'll stay as long as it's going well. It's lonely, and it's marvelous. I edit while I'm working. When I come home at 2, I read over what I've written that day, and then try to put it out of my mind. I shower, prepare dinner, so that when my husband comes home, I'm not totally absorbed in my work. We have a semblance of a normal life. We have a drink together and have dinner. Maybe after dinner I'll read to him what I've written that day. He doesn't comment. I don't invite comments from anyone but my editor, but hearing it aloud is good. Sometimes I hear the dissonance; then I try to straighten it out in the morning."
