Anyone who loves reading thrillers knows that criminals prefer to toss a delicious chop over the fence before breaking into a house in which they have concealed a few sleeping tablets When the watchdogs finish their second meal they go into a deep slumber After then the lady of the house s jewels pass through the hands of strangers with much less fuss Tumor cells frequently act in a similar manner releasing sleeping medications that paralyse the immune system They are surrounded by a cloud of adenosine an essential endogenous messenger They do so by inhibiting the body s own killing cells which would normally kill cancer cells This is because adenosine molecules attach to the A A receptors which are small antennas on the surface of immune cells the abbreviation stands for type A adenosine receptors This effectively eliminates the defending forces As a result scientists all around the world are seeking for compounds that might inhibit the A A receptor and prevent adenosine from paralysing the body The A A receptor controls the innate immune system s ability to target sick cells For the first time researchers at the University of Bonn have been able to demonstrate how an essential inhibitor attaches to the receptor The findings will help in the future with the targeted hunt for compounds that boost the innate immune system s punch These might be utilised in the battle against cancer as well as brain illnesses such as Alzheimer s and Parkinson s disease The study s final form was published in the Angewandte Chemie International Edition journal
