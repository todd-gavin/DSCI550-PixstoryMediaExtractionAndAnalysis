 Abstract Despite an increasing interest in the effect of health information on health behaviours evidence on the causal impact of a diagnosis on lifestyle factors is still mixed and does not often account for long term effects We explore the role of health information in individual health related decisions by identifying the causal impact of a type diabetes diagnosis on body mass index BMI and lifestyle behaviours We employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design RDD exploiting the exogenous cut off value in the diagnosis of type diabetes provided by a biomarker glycated haemoglobin drawn from unique administrative longitudinal data from Spain We find that following a type diabetes diagnosis individuals appear to reduce their weight in the short term Differently from previous studies we also provide evidence of statistically significant long term impacts of a type diabetes diagnosis on BMI up to three years from the diagnosis We do not find perceivable effects of a type diabetes diagnosis on quitting smoking or drinking Overall health information appears to have a sustained causal impact on weight reduction a key lifestyle and risk factor among individuals with type diabetes Sources
