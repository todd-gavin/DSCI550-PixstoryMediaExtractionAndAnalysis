I went to mcleodganj and Dharamshala last year with my family and my friend. It is a perfect choice for some chilled out time in the Himalayas. The beautiful monasteries, waterfalls, lakes and quaint cafes in the backdrop of the mighty Dhauladhar Himalayas, contribute to making Mcleodganj an interesting tourist destination. I did paragliding for the very first time there and that was an amazing experience the view was super amazing the height of 2400 mtrs, is one of the best sites in the world for paragliding. 
First picture was taken at the top of triund trek. It’s a 5-6 hours of trekking , there were facilities of eating and staying overnight. We did camping 🏕 for first time and experience was amazing and it was toooo cold there . 
You guyz should visit this place atleast for one time you won’t regret it .
