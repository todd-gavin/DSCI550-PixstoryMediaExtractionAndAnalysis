Nigeria, South Africa and Cameroon never missed the tournament since its inception. 


Morocco is hosting the 14th edition of WAFCON from 2 to 23 July. 12 teams will be competing in the biennial tournament. Uganda, Burundi, Zambia, Senegal, Togo, Nigeria, Tunisia, Burkina Faso, Botswana, Cameroon and Cameroon are the qualified teams. 

Nigeria are the favorites in the tournament, winning 11 out of 13 previous times. They are the defending champions also. Equatorial Guinea were the champions (2008,2012) in the other two occasions and they failed to qualify this time. So, this time if Nigeria fails to lift the trophy again, a new champion will be there in African Women's football. Nigeria are also the top ranked team among the participants(39). Cameroon(54) and South Africa (58) follow them. 

The tournament also served as a qualifying competition for the FIFA Women's World Cup. Four teams will qualify directly, while 2 will get a chance to take part in inter confederation play offs. 

Cameroon were runner's up in 1991,2004,2014 and 2016. South Africa lost in the final 5 times (1995, 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2018). Burundi, Togo, Burkina Faso, Botswana are debutants in the tournament. Zambia are another good team taking part in the competition, who had a good Olympics in 2020. 22 year old Captain Barbra Banda will be their key player. She shined in the Olympics scoring consecutive hat-tricks against Holland and China. She became the first female player in Olympics history to score back-to-back hat tricks and the first to score two hat tricks in one tournament. She has scored 22 goals so far from just 14 matches.
