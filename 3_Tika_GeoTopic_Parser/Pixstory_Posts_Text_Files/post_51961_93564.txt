In simple words Home refers to Heaven a place where you find peace I have gradually started to understand it s true worth Everyone is elated by the thought of travelling or staying in another state But when that actually happens you feel so homesick You start missing each and every part of it each and every part of you wants to go back home When you finally return back you feel at peace nothing matches the comfort it gives the relief that you experience Nothing compares to it
