According to new labor department data, The consumer price index rose 9.1% from one year earlier, the largest increase consumers have seen since the end of 1981. The increase exceeded economistsâ€™ estimates for the fourth month in a row.
Wall Street stocks fell Tuesday resonating with a grim inflation report.
Inflation in May hit a yearly rate of 8.6 percent and analysts expect it to reach 8.8 percent in the June figures. Now traders are of concern with another report indicating hot inflation that might lead the federal reserve to double down on the large interest rates hikes. Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia this week is to persuade Riyadh to pump more oil to bring down prices that are fuelling the sky-high inflation in the US.

Now everyone will be affected most, including low-income families. The relentless spike in inflation has diminished consumers' confidence in the economy, sent President Joe Biden's approval ratings tumbling, and extended a major political threat to Democrats in the November congressional elections.  Though inflation may slow later this year, it's not clear by how much. Oil prices fell Tuesday to about USD 96 a barrel. And other commodities, including metals such as copper, have also become less expensive, mostly because of recession fears in both the United States and Europe.
