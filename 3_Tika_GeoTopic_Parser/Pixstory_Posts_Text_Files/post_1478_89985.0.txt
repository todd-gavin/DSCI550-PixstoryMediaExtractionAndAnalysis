Prosper Africa is a U.S. Government initiative to increase trade and investment between African nations and the United States.

African nations play an important role in the global economy with some of the fastest-growing economies in the world and a young, growing, and rapidly urbanizing population.

The United States, in turn, offers a large consumer base, the worldâ€™s deepest capital markets, and a commitment to job creation, transparency, and social responsibility. Increased economic engagement between the United States and African nations creates jobs, fuels economic growth, and advances shared prosperity.

This is where Prosper Africa comes in.
Prosper Africa brings together services and resources from across the U.S. Government to empower businesses and investors with market insights, deal support, financing opportunities, and solutions to strengthen business climates.
