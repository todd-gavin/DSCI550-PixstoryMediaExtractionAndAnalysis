Indigenous athletes who claim they were subjected to racial abuse by a head coach at the Melbourne-based Hawthorn Football Club have made "extremely serious allegations," according to the Australian Football League, which is looking into the matter.  IE reported that the former Hawthorn player claims that he was instructed to have his partner's pregnancy terminated by the AFL team's previous coach. The same man served as coach of Hawthorn from 2005 to 21. Three Indigenous families who were involved there claim they were bullied and told to choose between their football careers and their families. Indigenous players on Australian rules football teams, including numerous great players, have frequently complained about fan abuse at stadiums. However, this is the first time that a team's coaching staff has dealt with real prejudice.“The experiences outlined in the document are extremely serious and require further and full examination,” the AFL said in a statement on Wednesday. “The AFL is finalizing a process to investigate the allegations and has sought further details of those who shared their experiences in order to progress its investigation.” Hawthorn added that the review “raised disturbing historical allegations that require further investigation”.
