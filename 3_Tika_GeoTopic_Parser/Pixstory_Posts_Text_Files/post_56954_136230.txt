I don t think comfort zones are that bad I mean what s wrong with just staying in a happy place when everyone around is worried or tense Instead of finding a therapist to allay your pains you can just find a comfort zone So whenever you feel stressed or sad it can help you come out of it Maybe the nonchalant attitude can make your work a little slow but what s wrong with actually moving at your own pace and not competing with the world for some time We need some recharge or rejuvenation after a long day of work and there it works And most importantly staying in your comfort zone would not make things worse and it s not necessary that we ll lag behind Moreover the comfort zone is a place where you ll learn what works for you This opportunity one will not get when they re out of the space Also it is a place where we find answers to those relentless questions which can never be answered in daily life chaos So staying in your comfort zone is not harmful
