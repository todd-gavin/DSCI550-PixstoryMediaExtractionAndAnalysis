After scoring in Inter's 3-1 win over Roma, Denzel Dumfries explained why he did what he did in
his goal celebration. With goals from Dumfries, Marcelo Brozovic, and Lautaro Martinez, the
Nerazzurri continued their march towards the Scudetto by defeating Jose Mourinho's Roma 3-1
at San Siro.

For the Giallorossi, Henrikh Mkhitaryan snatched a late consolation goal, but their 12-match
Serie A unbeaten streak came to an end.

“It was not easy, Roma had good matches and we know how important the win is today. We
were very confident, played very well in defence too and deserved the victory,” Dumfries told
DAZN.

He celebrated by booting Danilo D'Ambrosio up the behind for his fifth Serie A goal of the season.

“Inter is home, I like my teammates and the fans. D’Ambrosio always helps me, the celebration
was a joke between us. I feel good, so let’s continue like this.”

Since the 1990s, no Dutchman had ever scored five Serie A goals in a season for Inter. Inter
currently leads the table with a one-point advantage over Milan, with both teams having played
33 games. That's because the Rossoneri have a game against Lazio tomorrow evening, while
the Nerazzurri have a game against Bologna scheduled for Wednesday.

“We take every game step by step, we have a very experienced team, we’re calm and focused
to win the next game.”

Despite a few hitches this season, José Mourinho has left his mark on AS Roma, instilling a
feeling of confidence,determination, and grit in the team that hasn't been seen in several years.

The Mourinho Makeover at Roma is a three-year project at the very least, and in the first 12
months, The Special One has stripped the club down to its studs, revealing what the team is
made of. And now that the demolition is almost finished, the real work may begin this summer.
