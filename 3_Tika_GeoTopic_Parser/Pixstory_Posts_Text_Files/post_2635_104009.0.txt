Today is Birth Anniversary of Nargis. She sealed her place as one of the most successful actresses in the Golden Era of Bollywood with her performances in several classic films like Mother India, Awara, Barsaat, Kala Bazaar, Shree 420, Chori Chori among others. Her charismatic personality and enchanting beauty made her stand out.
She made her acting debut as a child artist in 1935 in the film Talaash-E-Haq. It was produced by her mother Jaddanbai. It was then that her name was christened Baby Nargis in the film credits and it stuck on.  
 Nargis was only 28 when she delivered the spectacular performance as Radha in the Academy-Award nominated film Mother India. It was the first Indian film to be nominated for the prestigious honour. In 1958, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.
One can never have enough of Nargis Duttâ€™s songs. 
Aawara ai mere dil
Mujhe kisi se pyar ho gaya
Jab se balam ghar aaye
Ga mere man ga
Uthaye ja un ke sitam
Un ko ye shikayat hai
Rasik balma
Last three based on Raags Kedar, Malgunji and Shudha Kalyan.
