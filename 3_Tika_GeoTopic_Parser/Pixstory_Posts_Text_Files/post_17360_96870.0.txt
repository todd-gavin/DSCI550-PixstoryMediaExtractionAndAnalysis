Paris Saint-Germain must overturn a 3-2 first-leg deficit as they welcome Lyon, the most successful club in UEFA Women's Champions League history.

• Aiming to reach their tenth final, Lyon had to come from behind in the first leg on 24 April following Marie-Antoinette Katoto's early strike. Wendie Renard marked her historic 100th appearance in the competition with a 23rd-minute equaliser from the penalty spot before Catarina Macario's double (34, 50) gave the seven-time winners a two-goal cushion, only for Paulina Dudek to reduce the Paris deficit with a 58th-minute spot kick.

• This second leg is the tenth UEFA club competition match between the teams, level with the mark reached earlier this season by Wolfsburg and Chelsea. This is the sixth time, in the space of eight seasons, that the pair have faced off in this competition, equalling the record of Lyon and Wolfsburg.

• Last season Paris ended Lyon's five-year reign as holders thanks to a 2-1 comeback win at OL Stadium in the quarter-final second leg, progressing on away goals after a 2-2 aggregate draw. Grace Geyoro (25) and Renard's 61st-minute own goal cancelled out Macario's fourth-minute opener after Renard's late penalty had given Lyon a 1-0 first-leg win in Paris.

• These sides are meeting in Europe for the third season running, Renard's 67th-minute header having settled the one-off semi-final in Bilbao in 2019/20.

• A Lyon side coached by Gérard Prêcheur beat Paris 7-6 on penalties after a goalless draw in the 2016/17 final in Cardiff. Geyoro was one of two Paris players to miss in the shoot-out.

• Lyon have won five of their last seven European meetings with Paris, including an emphatic 8-0 aggregate success at this stage in 2015/16.

• Both of Paris's European wins against Lyon have come away from home, Fatmire Alushi scoring the decisive late goal at the Stade de Gerland in November 2014 to clinch a 2-1 aggregate round of 16 win after a 1-1 draw in Paris.

• Paris have lost three of their last four UEFA Women's Champions League semi-finals, the only win in that sequence a 5-1 aggregate victory against Barcelona in 2016/17.
