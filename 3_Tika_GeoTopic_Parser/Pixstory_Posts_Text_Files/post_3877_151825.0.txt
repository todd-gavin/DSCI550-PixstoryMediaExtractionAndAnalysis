We may be a culture with an abundance of festivals round the year, never in need for a reason to celebrate, but it’s always this time of year that feels like the quintessential festive season. As the weather begins to turn, we brace ourselves for the months of festivities that will see us through what remains of the year.While I’m not big on any kind of celebration, I must admit that this autumnal season makes me truly happy. Of course, even if I didn’t care for the season, it would have been hard to ignore the surfeit of festive “looks” and festive discounts popping up on social media, urging us to participate in the commerce of these festivities. Today, I’m curious to know what this festive season means to you, whether or not you celebrate it, and if you do, then how so.
