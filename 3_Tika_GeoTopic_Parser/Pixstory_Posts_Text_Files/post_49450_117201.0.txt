Boosted 

Included in google play's top productivity apps, it helps you sort your activities into projects and subdivide the projects into tasks. You can switch on the tasks as you're doing the same, as a stopwatch works, or add the time you worked on it, thus helping you keep track. It also had timers and timely reports with charts that help you understand where and how you spent your time. 

Forest 

This app lets you plant cute virtual trees everytime you work on something, the size of the same varying according to the time spent, which then helps you get points and this buying different types of trees.
The app is also partnered with Trees for the future - which is involved in planting actual trees in Africa.  

Donut Dog 

Similar to the Forest app, here, you can choose the time that you wish to be work on a task and start working on the same. As long as the app is open and you're working, it keeps generating donuts that you feed the pet dog called "Focus" with the same. 

Flipd 

This app is less of a timer and more of a planner. It lets you hide apps and allot time and later on in checking progress made by you over a period of time. The app also comes with a "breaks" feature.
