Chelsea submitted their bid for Jules Koundé to Sevillla. Fee €65m, Chelsea now feel confident with their proposal as they came back with a better offer after a bid worth €55m (add ons included) was rejected earlier. Now since they came back with an offer of €65m with even better payment structure, Chelsea are optimistic to get this deal closed waiting for the final green light by Sevilla. 

Deal until 2027 offered to Koundé.

Player in talks with both Chelsea and Barcelona. While clubs are yet to reach an agreement.
