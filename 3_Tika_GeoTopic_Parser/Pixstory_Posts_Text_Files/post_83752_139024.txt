I am a designer so i like to create random designs This is a model of a kitchen that was done using a free software called SketchUp It is cery simple to use and all it takes is just drawing shapes and extruding them to make it a D sketch It s a very interesting tool that i have used since I was on a very Low Spec laptop This is probably one of the most useful softwares I ve used and its something that everyone must learn
