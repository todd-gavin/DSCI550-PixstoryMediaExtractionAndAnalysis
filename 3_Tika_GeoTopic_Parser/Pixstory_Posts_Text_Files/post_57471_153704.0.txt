Overcoming your fear is necessary because no one would want it to develop as something more harmful.
Many people with claustrophobia will avoid the spaces that trigger the condition. But that may not be a good long-term solution because you may eventually find yourself in a scary but unavoidable situation. Here are some ways to cope during an attack:
What you can do it breathe slowly and deeply while counting to three with each breath.
Focus on something safe, like time passing on your watch.
Remind yourself repeatedly that your fear and anxiety will pass.
Challenge what’s triggering your attack by repeating that the fear is irrational.
Visualize and focus on a place or moment that brings you calm.
It’s also important not to resist the attack when it’s happening. You may want to stop the attack from happening, but if you’re unable to stop it, your anxiety may increase and make the attack worse.
Instead, accept that the attack is occurring, remind yourself that it’s OK to experience these feelings, reassure yourself that the attack isn’t life-threatening, and remember that it will pass.
