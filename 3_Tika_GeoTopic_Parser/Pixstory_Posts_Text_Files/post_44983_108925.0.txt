When Porto wins a trophy, there is only one spot in the city to celebrate: the Avenida dos Aliados in the downtown area. Fans congregate there to watch players and coaching staff celebrate victories together. It was the same in May, when the northern giants were crowned Portuguese champions for the second time.

Fabio Vieira, one of the team's breakout stars, feared he wouldn't be able to join his teammates on the big stage for a brief moment. He was questioned for identification by a security official who did not recognise him. Vieira couldn't believe what he was hearing. Despite the fact that he had just ended the league season with six goals and 14 assists, he was being halted at the party's entrance.

Last season was his first in professional football, and while it wasn't enough to establish him as an unquestioned starter - or even for his face to become instantly recognisable in town - it was enough to convince Arsenal to pay 40 million euros (Â£34.2 million) for the 22-year-old attacking midfielder.

Mikel Arteta, Arsenal's manager, now has the task of harnessing his footballing intelligence and ensuring that he reaches his full potential. After Luis Diaz's transfer to Liverpool last winter, he finally established himself as a regular, scoring 11 goals in his final 12 league outings.

Arsenal will be able to utilize him in a variety of ways due to his versatility and eye for a deadly pass. He's played in all three midfield positions, but he's mostly been seen cutting infield from the right flank. He's quick in the offensive third and will give Martin Odegaard a run for his money.
