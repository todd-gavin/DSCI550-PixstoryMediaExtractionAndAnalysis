For many of us a world without  flights is nothing but flight of fancy. 
But aviation has long been a pain in the neck for those working to cut human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. It is the pinnacle of a "hard-to-decarbonise" sector: energy-intensive, lacking in immediate technical options to make it lower carbon, and strongly associated with the lifestyles of the richest and most powerful in society, says this report on BBC. 

It has also become one of the fastest growing sectors emissions-wise. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from planes grew 30% between 2013 and 2019 while the CO2 emissions growth in the wider economy between the same years was just 4%.

The pandemic, of course, stopped this trend in its tracks. As flights were grounded across the world, aviation's CO2 emissions plummeted by up to 60% in 2020. But some experts still expect Covid-19 to only delay aviation's overall contribution to warming by a few years: one recent paper by leading climate scientists projected that the sector will contribute a 6-17% share of the remaining carbon budget to avoid exceeding 1.5-2C of global warming.

But does that mean other modes of transport  can take the place of airtravel?
