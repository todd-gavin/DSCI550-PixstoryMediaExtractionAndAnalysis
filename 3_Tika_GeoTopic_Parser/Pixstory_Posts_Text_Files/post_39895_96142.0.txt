fastcompany reported that the non-profit NewClimate Institute had recently analysed 25 significant corporations aiming to achieve net zero emissions and found that they were only on pace to cut their emissions by 40%, rather than 100%. (The report's methodology, according to certain firms, was incorrect.) As part of its investigation, a new UN panel will look at business net zero plans in an effort to determine how much of this is simply greenwashing and provide recommendations on how to establish net zero targets that can be trusted. Some authorities are also ratcheting up the enforcement of false promises, which is good news for consumers. During the previous year, the number of advertising in the UK that were prohibited for greenwashing skyrocketed.

Apparently, Amazon is taking action against merchants who say their items are environmentally friendly, compostable or biodegradable.. And it appears that the European Commission is mulling new restrictions prohibiting assertions that can't be proved. There should be stricter laws and regulations in place to prevent  corporations from making false claims to their clients.
