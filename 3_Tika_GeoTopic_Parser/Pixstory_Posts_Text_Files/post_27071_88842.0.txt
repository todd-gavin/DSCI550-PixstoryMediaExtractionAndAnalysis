After the two years of horror that Covid gave us, most of us have become somewhat superstitious. Our superstitions have a variety, there is so much variation that at points we see people restricting themselves of usual joy in life. The crucial point of life is, if it gives you joy and does not negatively affect or hurt someone else, then it is fine, so maybe try and get rid of the superstition you have. 

Listening to particular songs before every meeting, not watching a particular movie, not walking in a particular manner, these are just some of the superstitions that control us. The question that we need to ask ourselves is very simple, if you are an atheist and believe in the universe, you know that the universe is way too vast and full of opportunities, then why are you getting limited on the basis of certain notions that have nothing in relation to the work of your life and your life in general. 

And if you believe in god, Iâ€™m sure you know that god gave us free will, so we are responsible for our actions and he must be very disappointed to see his favourite child stop a meeting just because his right eye kept flicking. 

A friend of mine once stopped his car in the middle of the highway because he had a superstition that whenever he listens to Charlie Puth songs, something wrong happens. So naturally when i played a charlie puth song, he asked me to drive because he is superstitious that something wrong will happen. I ended up driving a 150 kms on his car on a drive which was supposed to be his escape. 

This is the most basic example of how superstitions cloud our level of judgment and constantly make us blame ourselves for every little thing we do or say. 

Ofcourse keeping a open mind for the notion is important but to limit yourselves on the basis of superstition is wrong. We choose our own destiny.
