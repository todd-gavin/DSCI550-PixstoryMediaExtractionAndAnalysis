Franz Kafka is a well-known  German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer and a major figure of 20th-century magical realism.
‌
‌The term "Kafkaesque" is used to characterize theories and situations reminiscent of Kafka's work, particularly Der Process (The Trial) and Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis).
‌
‌Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overwhelm people, often in a surreal, nightmarish situation that evokes feelings of senselessness, distortion, and helplessness. 
‌
‌Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to break out of a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex.
‌
‌Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly well-known in dystopian science fiction. Works in this genre that have been thus described include Patrick Bokanowski's film The Angel (1982), Terry Gilliam's film Brazil (1985), and Alex Proyas' science fiction film noir, Dark City (1998). Films from other genres which have been similarly described include Roman Polanski's The Tenant (1976) and the Coen brothers' Barton Fink (1991). The television series The Prisoner and The Twilight Zone are also frequently described as Kafkaesque
