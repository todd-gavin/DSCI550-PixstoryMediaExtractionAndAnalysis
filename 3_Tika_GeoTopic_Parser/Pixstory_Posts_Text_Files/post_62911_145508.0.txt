While we're at it, there are a lot of thrilling things you can do on your vacation if you're looking for something different. Here are my best:
1. Hiking in the mountains: There's nothing like a challenging hike through beautiful scenery to get your adrenaline pumping. Not to mention, hiking is a great way to get a good workout while on vacation!
2. Bungee jumping: This might sound scary at first, but bungee jumping is actually one of the safest activities you can do. In fact, it's considered one of the world's most exhilarating sports!
3. Kayaking: Kayaking is another great activity for those who love adventure and excitement. It's safe and easy to do – just make sure you take proper safety precautions before getting into the water!
4. Scuba diving: If you're an avid diver, then scuba diving is definitely an activity you should add to your vacation list! Not only will it be fun and exciting, but scuba diving can also be extremely rewarding and educational.
5. Witnessing a safari: A safari is a quintessential adventurous experience that everyone should try at least once in their lives – or at least on their vacation! Watching wild animals in their natural habitat is something that will stay with you for a lifetime. 
6. Skydiving: This is definitely an adrenalin-pumping adventure that's perfect for thrill seekers who love adrenaline rushes – as I mentioned in my other post. No matter how experienced you are, jumping out of an airplane always feels like something out of a movie scene! 
7. Paragliding: If you're looking for a less-obvious activity to do on your vacation, then paragliding may be the right choice for you. It's easy enough for beginners but offers plenty of excitement and thrills for more experienced flyers as well. 
8. Snorkeling in tropical waters: There's nothing like swimming with colorful fish in crystal-clear water!
