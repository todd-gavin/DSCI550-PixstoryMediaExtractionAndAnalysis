Are the legends officially in their endgame Maybe so but that doesn t change the fact that they revolutionised world football We should feel grateful to have lived in what could only be referred to as the Golden Era of football Everywhere you look you find unbelievable and abundant talent but Messi and Ronaldo serve as the inspiration to all those young talented players This question comes to light after Messi was booed by the PSG fans recently for a player of his stature to make his way out of Barcelona and join PSG must have been a difficult shift Messi is struggling due to the conditions and still making a change on the extreme difficult conditions of PSG PSG has often been referred to as their own worst enemy Champions league defeats and poor performances in key games have been their mantra Messi may not have been in form lately but to disrespect a player of that stature is definitely shocking He is without a doubt one of the greatest players to have ever graced the sport As we move to Ronaldo the disrespect he gets is absolutely abysmal and pointless Ronaldo is in race with a peak Mohammed Salah in premier league golden boot Ronaldo is He scored a match winning hattrick against Spurs last week at Old Trafford He is way past his peak but he certainly isn t finished He has outscored the super expensive Romelu Lukaku and a in form Harry Kane How people come to the conclusion that Ronaldo is finished is beyond me He is without a doubt in the list of the current best players playing in the Premier league the toughest league in the world Football certainly has no memory people forget how their legends once were while treating them on their form Messi may have had a bad season till but he has Balon D ors to show Ronaldo may not be at his best but he is the most prolific goal scorer in the history of the sport Think twice next time before you question their abilities
