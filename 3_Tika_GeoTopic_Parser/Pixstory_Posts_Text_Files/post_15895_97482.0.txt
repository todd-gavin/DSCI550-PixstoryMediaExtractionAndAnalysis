Abstract 

Aims 

To investigate the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in relation to retinopathy and nephropathy in type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM). 

Methods 

4358 inpatients with T2DM were included in this cross-sectional study, and divided into four groups: T2DM without complications (DM group), T2DM complicated with retinopathy alone and nephropathy alone (DR alone and DN alone group), and T2DM complicated with both DR and DN (DRN group). AIP was calculated by the formula of log [triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol]. 

Results 

AIP in the DR alone, DN alone and DRN groups were significantly higher than that in the DM group, and DRN group had the highest AIP level. Moreover, patients with proliferative DR had higher AIP than patients with non-proliferative DR in DR alone and DRN groups, and patients with macroalbuminuria had higher AIP than patients with microalbuminuria in DN alone and DRN groups. The highest AIP quartile group had the greatest proportion of DRN compared to the other quartile groups. The DRN group had a maximal AUC for AIP by ROC curve (AUC=0.735). In the subgroup analyses by age, the AUCs of patients aged <65years were all larger than those of patients aged â‰¥65years. Logistic regression analysis showed that AIP had the highest correlation with aged <65years individuals with DRN, and this association still remained significant after adjustment with three models. 

Conclusions 

AIP is positively associated with the occurrence and severity of diabetic microvascular complications, as well as can well predict their presence in T2DM, especially in aged <65years individuals with DRN.
