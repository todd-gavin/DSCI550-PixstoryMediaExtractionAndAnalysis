Before missing a critical penalty in Egypt's shootout loss to Senegal on Tuesday, Mohamed Salah was targeted by laser pointers.

Sadio Mane and Senegal got the better of Salah's team for the second time this year from the penalty spot, ensuring Egypt's absence from the World Cup this winter. Salah was spotted with numerous lasers shining on his face by spectators at Senegal's Stade Leopold Sedar Senghor in the build-up to his penalty, which he missed.

What went wrong?
Following a 1-0 first-leg victory, Egypt conceded a goal in the fourth minute, resulting in a 0-0 draw that went all the way to a penalty shootout. The fanatical home audience was spotted shining lasers onto the pitch throughout the game, with the pointers out in full force for the penalty kicks.
Salah's face was covered in a slew of lasers before he missed from the spot, and Egypt went on to lose 3-1 and miss out on the World Cup.

Following the match, Egypt manager Carlos Queiroz resigned, bringing an end to his term in control of the team, which he had taken over in September.

Egypt's Football Association has issued a statement:
The Egypt FA acknowledged that they have submitted a complaint based on the environment in Senegal, albeit they did not mention the lasers directly.

“The Egyptian Football Association have lodged a formal complaint against its Senegalese counterpart to the match observer, the security official, CAF, and FIFA, before the start of the match between the two teams," the federation said.
“The Egyptian team was subjected to racism after the appearance of offensive banners in the stands aimed at the players, specifically Mohamed Salah.

“Moreover, the Senegalese fans terrorized the Egyptian players by throwing bottles and stones at them during the warm-up, as well as attacking the Egyptian team bus, which caused glass shattering and some injuries, which was documented with pictures and videos attached to the complaint.”
