‌Sylvia Plath is known for her zealous poems, novels and short stories. She was a pioneer of confessional poetry. She is best known for her poems like Bell Jar and Lady Lazarus. 
‌
‌She published her first poem at the age of eight. She married the fellow writer Ted Hughes, but she referred to it as an abusive relationship. She suffered from depression life long which eventually became the cause of her death. Her poetry contained all her mental struggles including anxiety and depression.  Her attempts at death and depression overwhelmed her writing career. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt on August 24, 1953, by taking her mother's sleeping pills and crawling under the front porch.
‌
‌Her works are boldly autobiographical, and in her poems, she explores her mental anguish. There are imprints of her failed, unhappy marriage, troubles, and conflicts with her parents and the problems caused by her vision of herself. Her poems are hyperactive, always accelerated. The oppression she faced as a woman is the cause of her depression to which she reacted through her poem. She is one of the reasons why mental health has been discussed seriously by many writers. She was an example for many of how cruel Bipolar disorder can be.

‌She was honoured with Pulitzer Prize for poetry posthumously.
