Looking back at old photographs of the news anchors of the s always brings back a sense of nostalgia In the late s the group of young women had become synonymous with television news Among them were Salma Sultan Rini Simon Gitanjali Aiyar Meenu Usha Albuquerque Manjari Joshi Sarla Maheshwari and Neelam Sharma Every night at pm on Doordarshan Prasar Bharati a female anchor would deliver the news of the day in impeccable Hindi and English Their tone was calm without any aggression Dressed in crisp saris and with their hair and make up done up elegantly these female news anchors were an epitome of grace style warmth and composure It has been more than two decades but it s hard to forget those anchors who kept us updated with all the latest events and current affairs Those were the days when only two channels DD and DD were available on the idiot box
