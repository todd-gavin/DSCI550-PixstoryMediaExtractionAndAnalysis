As tonsillitis takes over me for the 5th time in my life, I find myself craving a warm bowl of soup all the time. I always wondered why soup is the ultimate sick food. 

There are a few factors that complement one another nicely. The psychological is the first. It's likely that when you were a child and were ill, your mother, grandmother, or another nurturing person would prepare you soup. You would eventually feel better. Additionally, because the soup doesn't taste medicinal, you are just pleased about it. If that occurs frequently enough, you will develop a love for soup and it will become a comfort food.

The second factor is that dehydration is a common side effect of illness. Your fluid consumption will decrease if you have a fever, stomach issues, or a loss of appetite. The body has a harder time distributing nutrients when you are dehydrated. You'll lose strength and heal more slowly than you would if you were properly hydrated. Due to its higher liquid content than most foods, soup aids in rehydration.

In many cases, soup is simple to eat and digest. Depending on the type, soup can frequently be easy to swallow and keep down even with a sore throat or digestive issues. Even if you are unable to consume a complicated soup, your body will typically take a stock that is either vegetable or meat-based. It's hardly surprise that your body likes it given its combination of nutritional value, ease of digestion, and ease of consumption.

Additionally, foods with a lot of salt can help with sore throats because they work well for them. Personally, I think canned soup is one of the reasons it is so comfortable and would suggest a salt gargle and some nice soup instead.

The fact that soup is frequently served to sick people so they can simply lay there and groan while coughing feebly is arguably the greatest explanation for why it tastes so good and is so comforting to those who are ill. Maybe it's just me :)
