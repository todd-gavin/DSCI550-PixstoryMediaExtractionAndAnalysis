Farewell, Bharat Ratna | Nightingale of India.

There was, is and will be no one like you. Loved by the world, revered by the countrymen, your voice will stay with us till eternity.

Words always fall short when we talk about godly spirits and when it comes to someone who is revered time and again by people such as an incarnation of the "goddess of music" herself, no word will be able to justify itself.

I'll rest my words by quoting Maya Angelou here:

"A great soul serves everyone all the time. A great soul never dies. It brings us together again and again".

So, I strongly believe that her soul will always keep us united, tied in a bond of love and harmony through her divine melodies.

Heaven awaits to welcome you, you will always remain in our thoughts and hearts .🙏💟  

ॐ शांति ।। 🙏
