Korean New Year or ‘Seollal’, falling on February 1 this year, is a festival and national holiday that usually occurs in January or February on the second new moon after the winter solstice, unless there is an intercalary 11th or 12th month in the lead-up to the New Year. It marks the first day of the Korean calendar. It is one of the most important traditional Korean holidays.
Seollal is a cultural holiday, which has its roots in traditional Chinese Confucianism and is celebrated on the first day of the Korean lunar calendar. It usually lasts three days the day before Korean New Year, Korean New Year itself, and the day after Korean New Year. The “Book of Sui” and the “Book of Tang” have the first recorded histories of Silla, an old kingdom from 57 B.C. to 935 A.D, that celebrated Seollal. The Joseon dynasty, a renowned kingdom that ruled from 1392 to 1897 also has traces of government officials gathering in the five grand palaces to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
Seollal is a unique Korean tradition, influenced by China, and is based on the lunar cycle. Each year represents a different animal and the cycle is repeated every 12 years. The 12 animals are the following: mouse, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. The order of the animals is thought to have been based on the sequence in which they were invited to see Buddha. Koreans believe that the animal representing the year that a baby is born will attribute certain characters and qualities to that baby. There are even some parents who plan the birth year of their children by this belief.
