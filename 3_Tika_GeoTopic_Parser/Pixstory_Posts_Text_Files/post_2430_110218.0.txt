Pixstory Users Question 
People go to dietician for reducing weight. There is another category like me who don’t put on weight no matter what we eat. I am too underweight how do I gain a few kilos to reach a healthy weight? 

My Answer
It’s a clear example of something wrong in absorption of food by your body. It takes you back to the issue if food sensitivities. Do a food IGG test to help to know what you are sensitive to. 
If you keep eating food just like that, it will be a shot in the dark. You need to know what is wrong . 
If tests are not available you can do your own elimination - like remove gluten containing food and cereals and see if it works. 
If it doesn’t work you can remove milk and milk products and see if your body weight changes . 
But surely consult someone for sure .
