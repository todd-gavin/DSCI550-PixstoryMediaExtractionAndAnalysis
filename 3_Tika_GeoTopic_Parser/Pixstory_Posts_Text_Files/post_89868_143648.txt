Yes Nature is always beautiful The moon the stars snow capped hills rivers lakes and budding flowers are the objects of nature The sight of these majestic and charming objects gives us a thrill of joy They give solace comfort to our minds That is why various poets have written poems in praise of these objects of beauty These objects cast their spell on other persons as well We have only to wander a while on the bank of a lake to realize the attraction of flowers We cannot put into words the feast of natural beauty they present to our eyes Why is nature so beautiful Emerson says that nature is beautiful because it is alive moving reproductive In nature we observe growth and development in living things contrasted with the static or deteriorating state of the vast majority of that which is man made Nature is beautiful everywhere She is marvellously beautiful on the top of a mountain She is mysteriously beautiful on the bed of the sea Forests springs waterfalls gardens and meadows all surpass in beauty Nature presents a vast scene of exquisite beauty All objects of nature their colours and their forms are a source of joy forever Nature has an irresistible appeal Nature has created beauties for our enjoyment He who has no eyes to see and appreciate and no heart to leap with joy at their sight must be a man with a dead soul
