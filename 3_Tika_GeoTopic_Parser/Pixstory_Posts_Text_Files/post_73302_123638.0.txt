A couch, also known as a sofa, settee, or chesterfield, is a cushioned item of furniture for seating multiple people (although it is not uncommon for a single person to use a couch). It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows.
