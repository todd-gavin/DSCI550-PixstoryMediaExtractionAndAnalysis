Today is birth anniversary of  Kishori Amonkar. She belonged to Jaipur Gharana. She alongwith Pt Mallikarjun Mansur were purists in music and very difficult to please. Jaipur Gharana was renowned for Raags which lesser singers  would/could not sing.
The inheritance of the this gharana can be marked out to Nath Vishwambhar. He was famous for setting the tunes of the sankrit hymns (shlok) to Raags, while he would perform  his puja. The great musician composer Swami Haridas was also born in this family. Musical giants Tansen and Baiju were his pupils.
This Gharana is also called as Jaipur Atrauli Gharana in Hindustani Classical Music. Ustad Alladiyan Khan was the pioneer in spreading fame of this Gharana. He was from the Uniyara village in Rajasthan. He wrote many Bandish in the praise of Hindu gods and goddesses
. ‘आदिदाता अनंत दयावंत तूही जगतकरता एकही निराकार’
 is his one of the very famous Bandish in Malkauns . His family roots are traced back to Atrauli near Aligarh (Uttar Pradesh), from where it later migrated to Jaipur. 
Unfortunately with demise of both Mansur and Kishori Amonkar , these difficult Raags may well be consigned to posterity.
