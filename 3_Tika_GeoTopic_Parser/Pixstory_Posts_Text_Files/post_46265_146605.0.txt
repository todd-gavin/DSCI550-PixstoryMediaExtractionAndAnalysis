The blue sky is calling to me , 
Asking me to join the clouds . 
Rising above the earth , 
I will soar to new heights and find freedom in the wind . ✨🤍
Cloud above cloud , a glorious sight , contrasting with the deep-blue sky ! I feel like a cloud floating around in the wide blue sky ! Let the blue sky meet the blue sea , and all is blue for a time . ✨🤍
