Hello ðŸ‘‹ everyone, so I'm Sonali and I m a student at the Bennett University of Delhi. Studying BA in journalism and Mass Communication. Okay okay, the boring part is done. 
So I m doing this internship on Pixstory. It's quite interesting. 
Like to talk to new people every day. Love ice cream. And talking about the picture where I m pretending to be cool by taking a mirror picture but according to trend if you don't have an iPhone in a mirror picture then you are not cool... Right, my trend followers?????

Nothing more to share about this picture so

Bye
