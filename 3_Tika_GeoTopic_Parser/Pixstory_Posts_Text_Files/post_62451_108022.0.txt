Pangolins are adorable creatures but other than being forever-nervous looking, they're very interesting too.

The Pangolin, often known as the scaly anteater, is the world's only mammal covered in keratin – the protein found in human fingernails and hair – scales from head to toe. The weight of these scales can contribute for up to 20% of a Pangolin's total weight. Pangolins come in eight different species.

A pangolin's sticky tongue can grow to be as long as its body, minus the tail, which can be up to 28 inches long!

They are over 80 million years old as a species and have inquisitive, intelligent personalities.
