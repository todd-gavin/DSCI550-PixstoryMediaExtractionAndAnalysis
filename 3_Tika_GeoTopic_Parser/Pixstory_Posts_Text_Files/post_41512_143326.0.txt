In place of Jordan Pefok, Haji Wright, and Brandon Vazquez at forward are Josh Sargent, Ricardo Pepi, and Jess Ferreira. US News reported that Gregg Berhalter, the head coach of the United States, revealed his 26-man roster on Wednesday for the country's final two World Cup warm-up matches. He emphasised that players still have time to sign or withdraw before he releases his final World Cup roster on November 9.“I know we're not going to be the most talented team at the World Cup and we're going to have to compensate for that by being a cohesive unit, by working for each other, fighting for each other and having a great team spirit,” Berhalter said. “So part of it is leaning on guys that have been there before and been around the group before and understand the team culture and understand their teammates extremely well.”Sergio Dest, Chris Richards, Sam Vines, and winger Gio Reyna were all selected after missing the previous four games in May and June, similar to Sargent and Pepi. Other significant absences included James Sands, a midfielder/defender, John Brooks, Tim Ream, and Shaq Moore, as well as midfielder Djordje Mihailovic.
