“Ian is expected to become a hurricane again by this evening and make landfall as a hurricane on Friday, with rapid weakening forecast after landfall,” reads the NHC advisory released this afternoon.
“Ian forecast to produce life-threatening flooding, storm surge and strong winds across portions of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.”
Ian, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm, is forecast to intensify into a hurricane later tonight and is now heading toward the north-northeast at a speed of about 9 mph or 15 km/h.
