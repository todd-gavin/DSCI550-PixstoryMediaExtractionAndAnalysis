The joy of food in Australia is based not only on home cooking, but also on eating out. This, combined with the ability to bring your own (BYO) wine and beer to restaurants, has resulted in a relatively inexpensive and cheerful alternative. The variety is impressive, and the selection of excellent wines has enhanced the flavour of everything. For dinner, most Australians still preferred familiar, traditional fare. Steak and vegetables, roast lamb or chicken, spaghetti bolognaise, and lamb chops are among the most frequently requested dishes. Some of Australia's favourite and well-known foods include barramundi, Sydney rock oysters, Australian prawns, avocado on toast, bacon and egg roll, Lamington cake, potato cake, and yellowfin tuna.
