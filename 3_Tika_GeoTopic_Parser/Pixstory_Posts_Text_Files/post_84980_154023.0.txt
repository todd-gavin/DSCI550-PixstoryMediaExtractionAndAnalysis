Napoli and Ajax will be up against each other on Matchday 04 of the UEFA Champions League. Napoli are on the top spot in the points table in Group A of the UEFA Champions League 2022-23 while Ajax sit at the third spot in the points table.
Napoli have been one of those unstoppable teams in Europe this season. After having wreaked havoc in Serie A, Napoli have been utterly dominant in the UCL too, having beaten Liverpool , Ajax, and Rangers in the threef games that they have played so far.
Ajax won’t be too encouraged with the results that they have got in this year’s UEFA Champions League campaign. They have done well in Eredivisie and are on the top spot in their league but their UCL campaign has just one win so far.
