Various reports say that Sri Lanka’s financial crisis, its worst since independence, is swiftly becoming an alarming health crisis. 

There is no prize for guessing here, actually. 

The government is running out of money faster than it thinks and last week the country was forced to default on its international loans for the first time in its history. 

That means Sri Lanka has not enough foreign currency in its vault to spend on essentials.

Without crucial foreign currency, Sri Lanka has been unable to import the essentials: food, fuel – and medicine.
That's a huge problem for a country that hardly produces anything and depends heavily on imports. 

Sri Lanka imports more than 80% of its medical supplies. Now almost 200 medical items are in shortage, including 76 essential, life-saving drugs, from blood-thinners for heart attack and stroke patients to antibiotics, rabies vaccines and cancer chemotherapy drugs, a report in UK Guardian has said. 

Essential surgical equipment and anaesthesia is running out so fast that the decision was made this week for only emergency surgeries, mostly heart and cancer patients, to go ahead. All routine surgeries – anything from hernias to swollen appendixes – have been put on hold. Some government hospitals have been instructed to only admit emergency patients.

Hope things get sorted fast
