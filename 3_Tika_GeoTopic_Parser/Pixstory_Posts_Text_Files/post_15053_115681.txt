An all-Italian cardiovascular research task force coordinated by Maurizio Pesce Head of the Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering Unit of the Monzino Cardiology Center has just published the results of the first study on a possible mechanical heart therapy in the prestigious journal Circulation Research. which the mechanical stresses that arise due to the structural variations in the infarcted myocardium activate the process of cardiac fibrosis and have discovered that a commonly used drug, Verteporfin, is able to interfere with this mechanism, significantly reducing its impact. In particular, they have shown that the forces of deformation mechanical compression induce cardiac fibroblasts the cells of the connective tissue which have a reparative function and intervene for example in the healing of a wound to deposit abnormal fibrous connective tissue in the heart muscle It should be emphasized that those suffering from fibrosis, in addition to presenting various disorders due to a stiffer and less contractile heart at high risk of heart failure and that unfortunately at the moment there are no treatments capable of restoring the natural architecture of the myocardium even if various treatments are able to alleviate the symptoms and slow down its course The discovery of the anti-fibrotic activity of Verteporfin therefore a reason for hope for thousands of heart patients Explains Pesce, there was no explanation for the chronic nature of this process which continues even after the improvement of the acute pathological conditions We therefore hypothesized that the missing link in this conversion was the response of the fibroblasts to the mechanical stresses resulting from the structural alteration of the heart after an infarction We analyzed the role of these stresses in the transformation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and verified how to block this process through the use of a drug Verteporfin which prevents the function of a transcription factor YAP which is known to be activated by mechanical forces The results obtained in a D cell model showed that the drug blocks the fibrotic evolution of cardiac fibroblasts and that the block also occurs in the presence of humoral stimuli such as treatment with TGF beta
