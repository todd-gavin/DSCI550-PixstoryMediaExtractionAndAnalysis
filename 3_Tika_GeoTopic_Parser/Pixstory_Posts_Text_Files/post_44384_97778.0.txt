After joining the club from Marseille in the summer of 2012, Azpi had to wait until late 
September to make his first appearance in a blue shirt. The opposition for a League Cup 
third-round fixture at Stamford Bridge was Wolverhampton Wanderers, and it was a triumphant start for the Spaniard, as we won 6-0 on the night.

Obviously, you're aware of Azpilicueta's current activities, but let's catch you up on the rest of 
the team since his Blues debut.

Ross Turnbull

Turnbull's four-year stay at Stamford Bridge, where he was our back-up goalkeeper in the 2012 Champions League final, was by far the most decorated of his career, albeit also the most inactive, as he only made 16 starts during that time. One of them came in Azpilicueta's first game with the Blues, and it was his only clean sheet. Turnbull is now the goalie coach for Hartlepool United.

Gary Cahill

Our first goal in the 6-0 triumph over Wolves came from a player who had only been at Chelsea for a little over six months but had already won a European title and the FA Cup.

There was plenty more to come â€” Cahill had eight winner's medals around his neck by the time he departed us in 2019, having made 290 matches.

John Terry

Many felt JT was nearing the end of his career as he approached 32; little did they know, however, that his best season was still to come, in 2014/15, when he played every minute on his 
way to a second Premier League title.

Ryan Bertrand

Bertrand had made history a few months prior to this game when he became the first player to 
make his Champions League debut in the competition's final. His greatest season as a Blue was 2012/13, when he played regularly throughout the season, but a year later he was out of favour and on his way to Southampton, where he is still playing now.
