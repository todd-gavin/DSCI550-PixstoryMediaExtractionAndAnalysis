1. Sweet Tooth - Netflix
A show that starts off reminding us of the pandemic that we’re currently living in, things however get much worse in Sweet Tooth. A new strain of the virus has plagued the planet and a new breed of hybrids are born in hospitals. While many believed that the hybrids cause the Sick, they are still only children with some animal-like features. We pick up the story in a remote forest where a man brings his hybrid child to live in the wilderness, but the truth will come out one day or the other. Sweet Tooth has a decent first season that ended quite strongly.
