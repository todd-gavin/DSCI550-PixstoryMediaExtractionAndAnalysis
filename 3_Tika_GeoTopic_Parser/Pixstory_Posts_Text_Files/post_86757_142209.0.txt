The contribution of Indian community to Qatar 2022 World Cup, which will have many firsts to its credit including being the shortest in FIFA history, as well as the first to be held in the Middle East and entire Arab world is enormous.
For the records, the Qatar 2022 will be a 29-day affair -- the shortest in FIFA World Cup history -- with the tiny Middle East country hosting the mega event at eight venues -- Khalifa International, Al Janoub, Educational City, Al Rayyan, Al Bayt, Al Thumama, Stadium 974 and Lusail Stadium.
And as per a report inÂ aljazeera.com, of the 1.8 million FIFA World Cup tickets sold across the first two phases of Qatar 2022, more than 23,500 were bought by fans in India.
After the first phase of ticketing, India was ranked seventh in ticket sales.
Perhaps, it was just a coincidence that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided sign a Memorandum of Understanding (Mou) with the Qatar Football Association (QFA) to boost the football ties between the two countries.
AIFF's newly-elected office bearers -- Kalyan Chaubey (President) and Shaji Prabhakaran (Secretary General) -- on their recent visit to Doha, met with QFA President Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed Al Thani, General Secretary Mansoor Al Ansari and other Senior Board Members to discuss a strategic alliance for the mutual benefit of football in both India and Qatar.
