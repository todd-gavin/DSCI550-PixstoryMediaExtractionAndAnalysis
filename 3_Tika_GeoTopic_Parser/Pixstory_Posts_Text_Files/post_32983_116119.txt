Milena Bartolini&#39;s Azzurri didn&#39;t go beyond that in the second match of the Euro group in England and clung to the hope of qualifying Many regrets because, above all in the second half, the clear chances and the passing of the ball were everything for Italy, who fell behind after just a goal from Vilhjamsdottir In the second half, the addition of Bonansea gave strength to the national team who equalized with a goal from Bergamaschi following an assist from the new entry and pressed the islanders for the remaining minutes without finding a goal. Now we have to hope that France with which the Azzurri lost in the opening match, beat Belgium in the evening match and then beat them too in the third and final match of the group hoping that France won&#39;t let Iceland win
