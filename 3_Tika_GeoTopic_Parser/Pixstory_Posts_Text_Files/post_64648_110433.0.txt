So in this post i will explain you how to print some text to your program using c++ coding language 

In any compiler like turbo c++ or any write this code and you will see the text will be printed 

#include
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello Compiler, I am C++";
    cout<<endl;
    return 0;
}
