The US added another gold to its collection in Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on Saturday. This marvellous feat was achieved by Lindsay Jacobellis alongside her partner Nick Baumgartner. For Lindsay who is 36 years old, this was a second gold. This was the debut of the mix gender team in snowboardcross but they managed to win the gold irrespective of being the oldest team in the game with a combined age of 76. 

This was most likely Baumgartner’s fourth and final Olympics. Unfortunately, he failed to advance in the men’s individual final so the combined win with Lindsay was all the more special. 

In other news for Olympics, USA Today reported that In men's hockey, the USA defeated Canada 4-2 to improve to 2-0 in its bid to win the pool and get a bye to the quarterfinals.

In ice dancing, the U.S. teams of Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, plus Madison Chock and Evan Bates, are in medal position after the rhythm dance portion with a score of 87.13 while skating to a compilation of music from Janet Jackson. Madison Chock and Evan Bates, the reigning national champions, are in fourth — but trailing their compatriots by almost 3 full points (84.14).

So far, the medals tally for the Winter Olympics looks good and fans are hoping that many more feathers will be added to the cap of USA in the coming events .
