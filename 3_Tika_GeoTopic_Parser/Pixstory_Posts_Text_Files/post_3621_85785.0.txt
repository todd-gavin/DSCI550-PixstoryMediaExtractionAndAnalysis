The organisers of the Cannes Lions have expressed their solidarity with war-affected Ukraine and decided not to accept submissions or delegations from Russian organisations into Cannes Lions or its associated awards programmes.

“We stand together with our friends in Ukraine, and our many partners and community members in Russia who strongly oppose the actions of the Russian Government,” the organisers said in a press statement.

The organisers also announced that Ascential and LIONS will make a significant donation to humanitarian charities working in the affected region.

Additionally, Cannes Lions will not charge any and all Ukraine creatives who are able to attend Cannes Lions.

"Refunds on awards submissions for Ukraine agencies will also be honoured,” the statement added.

The international festival of creativity has created a talent directory for affected members of the creative community on the LIONS platform. “We encourage the global community to commission and support our friends during these troubled times. Affected members of our community can create a profile here,” Cannes Lions said.
