Background Carotid plaque is one of the typical manifestations and precursors of diabetic cardiovascular complications As a new adipokine asprosin participates in the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and is considered to be closely related to insulin resistance and glucolipid metabolism This study aimed to analyze the relationship between serum asprosin level and carotid plaque in patients with type diabetes mellitus T DM Methods A total of patients with T DM were selected The basic parameters and biochemical indexes of the subjects were measured and the serum asprosin concentration of the subjects was detected by ELISA The carotid plaque was evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound Results The level of serum asprosin in the T DM with carotid plaque group was significantly higher than that in T DM without carotid plaque group vs ng mL P The incidence of carotid plaque in the low middle and high quartiles was and respectively Correlation analysis showed that serum asprosin was positively correlated with BMI WHR SBP DBP FIns LDL C HOMA IR and HOMA P Linear regression analysis showed that WHR DBP FIns and LDL C were independent influencing factors of asprosin Logistic regression analysis showed that serum asprosin was still significantly correlated with carotid plaque in T DM patients after adjusting for multiple confounding factors The area under receiver operating curve ROC of asprosin predicting carotid plaque was in T DM Conclusion The level of serum asprosin in T DM patients with carotid plaques is significantly higher suggesting that asprosin may play a role in the occurrence and development of carotid plaques in T DM Detection of this index can provide new clinical evidence for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiovascular disease Sources
