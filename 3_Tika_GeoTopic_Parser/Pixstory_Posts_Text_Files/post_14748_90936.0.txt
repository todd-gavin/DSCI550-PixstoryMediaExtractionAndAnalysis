Seems like even sun is lazy to come out of the clouds after the late night unexpected summer shower. Sun took an off today as he was not in a mood to burn much. A very pleasant summer day here in Cochin, Kerala. Hope it continues like this. My childhood was probably the last generation of Kerala who enjoyed the typical tropical climate.
