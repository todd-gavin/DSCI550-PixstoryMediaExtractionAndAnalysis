We've all seen these golden, crescent pastries,  either on the silver screen or basking in the warm glow of a bakery counter. But what exactly makes them so special? 
A croissant is a buttery, flaky French pastry in the shape of a crescent. They're a popular breakfast item, and they can be eaten as is or with a large variety of sweet or savoury fillings. 
A croissant is different compared to other pastries in one way: it is both laminated and fermented. 
In pastry, doughs are folded with butter to form layers, which give them their signature flakes. This is called lamination. These doughs often do not contain yeast. In a croissant, however, the dough which is laminated does contain yeast. The dough, once shaped, is fermented until it is light and pillowy. 
Due to the combination of fermentation and lamination, a croissant has a bread-like interior structure with a flaky, pastry-like exterior. This combination of textures is only seen in croissants and its variants. 
A popular variant of the classic croissant is the 'pain au chocolat' which translates to chocolate bread in French. It is also known as chocolatine in the south-west part of France and in Canada, and couque au chocolat in Belgium. 
Pain au chocolat uses croissant dough as its base. The dough is wrapped around sticks of chocolate. Once baked, the flaky exterior gives way to a rich, gooey chocolate interior. It is truly decadent.
