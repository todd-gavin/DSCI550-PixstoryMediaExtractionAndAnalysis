City may not have as rich a history as their rivals Manchester United, but the club is on the rise thanks to a new set of players led by one of the game's greatest managers. But not everything works the way you want it to; it takes years and decades to build something.
And Manchester City did improve their position in European football after Sheikh Mansour bought the club and splurged money to turn it into a competitive force. We saw many players come and go as a result of Sheikh Mansour's investment, and money made history.
In this list, we rank the top ten strikers who have worn the sky-blue t-shirt since Abu Dhabi made City a household name.
Â  
10 Edin Dzeko
Dzeko was not a first-team starter for City, but he added tenacity to the squad by being as good as Sergio Aguero. He was dubbed Super-Dzeko and was the football equivalent of a spice rack; he wasn't a regular starter but showed his worth when called upon. He established himself in the Premier League, scoring 19 goals in the 2011-12 season and being named Premier League player of the month.
The Bosnian's four years at the club were rewarded with two Premier League titles and 72 goals in 189 games.


9 Craig Bellamy
Bellamy was worth signing from West Ham after being snatched from the hands of Tottenham. The Welsh international saw frequent action and scored 15 goals in 50 appearances over two seasons. Later in his career, he became a bore and spent most of his time on the bench, being replaced by Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli. Bellamy was later sold to Cardiff in 2010.

8 Haaland
However, he may be too young to be on the list; the Norwegian promises to be a prospective striker for Manchester City; he has already broken one of the club's prolific strikers record, and Haaland shows no signs of slowing down. He has only gone one game without scoring.
