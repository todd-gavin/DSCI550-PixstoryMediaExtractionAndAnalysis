There are no perfect feminists The definition of what it takes to a good feminist is ever changing It is a whole process of learning and unlearning Common folk like us have the privilege of doing this is private but the VP does not have this privilege That doesn t mean she is not a feminist And even if one thinks so her role in the feminist movement cannot be discredited Her election as the first black woman and the first woman to hold the position is the genuine culmination of black women s decades long battle to actively engage in American politics Despite the existence of feminist movements black women s struggles are distinct from those of traditional feminist movements As Mara El Shinaw points out The black feminist movement or womanism as it was dubbed by famed writer Alice Walker decided from the start to pursue a different path and to have broader goals for the improvement of American society as a whole putting men and women of all colours on an equal footing This stands in stark contrast to traditional feminist movements which seek to defend the rights of just white women while excluding women of colour as if they were a different gender with different demands and requirements Yes she may have made some mistakes over the years but in contrast to the sexism she and every woman of colour has faced over the decades the pros overweigh the cons Instead of looking things from a bird s eye view we should be looking at the larger picture and how her power and image can inspire women of colour over the world
