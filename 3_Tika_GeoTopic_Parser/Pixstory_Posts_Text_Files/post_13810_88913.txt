A comfortable lead in the points table does matter in the long run Especially when you are playing a marathon rough and tough league like La Liga or Ligue A title on the card keeps the club fans happy the sponsors pleased and most important bigger success on the pitch means lesser worry on the financial front But not always the scenario remains the same certain results can truly spoil the show even the best of trophies sometimes fail to make up for the painful loss suffered Currently Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain are going through this phase Real have little worry about winning the La Liga title all they need to do is to bag more points in their next nine matches to make it impossible for others to catch up But the defeat against Barcelona on home pitch is surely going to haunt them for a long time The joy of winning the league title would not be as much as it should have been So much so the recent Champions League match success against PSG may taste sour It was a humiliating defeat against the arch rivals and fans are not going to accept it silently Carlo Ancelotti could be shown the door at the end of the season even if he returns to Santiago Bernabeu with the Champions Trophy in hand In no better position are PSG whose Ligue title this season is virtually assured with a runaway point lead over second placed Marseille But the two recent defeats against Real Madrid and Monaco were enough for fans to start talking PSG played terrible football in the loss against Monaco They are already out of the Champions League and are suddenly struggling at the home front too If a team having a forward line Kylian Mbappe Lionel Messi and Neymar reduce themselves to this level then the fans have the right to feel worried To say Karim Benzema or Mbappe were missing from the line up are lame excuses nobody is going to take them seriously
