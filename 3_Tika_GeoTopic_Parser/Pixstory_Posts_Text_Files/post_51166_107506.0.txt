How often have we all adored a perfect dress on someone, staring  in awe from head to toe, only to realize that their shoes (or footwear) spoiled it all! That’s true, its an understated reality which so many of us do not pay much attention to, at least most of the time; your footwear can make or break your whole outfit!

Now for the purpose of the guide, let’s divide the dress lengths into 5 general categories: Full or Maxi length, Calf length, Knee length, Above the Knee or Thigh length and Minis.

Full or Maxi length :
With full length skirts or dresses, strappy sandals are a great idea, so are bellies or ballerinas, wedges and flip flops. 

Calf length:
Footwear ideal for any calf length or below the knee length skirt or dress includes wedges, kitten heels, peep toes, sneakers, loafers and stilettos. 

Knee length:
Of course, today sneakers are making a great fashion trend and are seen being paired even with lehengas! But truly, sneakers do make a great combination with knee length dresses and skirts and look very sporty and chic.

Above the Knee or Mid Thigh Length :
Wedges, bellies, loafers, ankle length boots and sandals are perfect to go with dresses that have a hemline above the knee or of a mid thigh length.

Minis:
Golden rule: The shorter the hemline or length, the lower the heel. A miniskirt worn with stilettos may end up looking tacky than trendy, but when paired with loafers, ballet flats or even white sneakers will look chic and polished.
