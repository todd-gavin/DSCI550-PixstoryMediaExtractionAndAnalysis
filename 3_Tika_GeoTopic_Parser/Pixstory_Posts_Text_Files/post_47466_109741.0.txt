Nick Pope's focus in the 2022 Summer Transfer Window has taken longer than most would
have anticipated, but it now seems as though the Burnley cult icon is just days away from
signing with Eddie Howe's Newcastle United.

With 127 Premier League games so far, Martin Dubravka has excelled during his five seasons
in England's top division. However, with Eddie Howe increasing his pressing intensity and
ambition, Newcastle are right to sign a keeper who offers greater movement and pace in behind
a backline at the age of 33.

Pope, who is thirty years old, became well-known as one of the best
"Sweeper Keepers" last season for his fast thinking off the line behind a Burnley defence that
was already well-built and low-block.

Following the departure of Tom Heaton, the Clarets frequently lacked a reliable back-up
goalkeeper. Martin Dubravka fills that void. Last season, Dubravka successfully avoided 4.1
goals (PSXG +/-), admirably matching Nick Pope's 4.4.

Dubravka might have easily retained his
top spot for an additional year, but Nick Pope provides superior shot stopping and sweeping
skills simultaneously, making it a straightforward upgrade for a low cost.

Pope shown his enormous ability to play long passes over large distances and contribute to the
offence with averages of 52.8 yards from open play passes and 65.9 yards from goal kicks.

Newcastle prioritises speed and directness for the goal, though not as much as Burnley does.
They have a natural target man in Chris Wood who is capable of winning aerial duels and
controlling the play. Players like Jonjo Shelvey, Kieran Trippier, and Pope's predecessor Martin
Dubravka enjoy to send long passes forward into the attack.
