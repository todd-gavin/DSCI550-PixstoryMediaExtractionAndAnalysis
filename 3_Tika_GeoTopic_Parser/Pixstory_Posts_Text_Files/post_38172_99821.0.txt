As per the Mirror, the Spurs are being linked with Joao Palhinha in the summer. The 26-year-old currently plies his trade with Sporting Lisbon in the Liga Portugal.

This would not be the first time that the Spurs would approach Joao Palhinha. The North London club were linked with the Sporting Lisbon player in the summer. But the Portuguese club rejected their advances for an attempted loan deal. 

Nuno Espirito Santo was in charge of Tottenham Hotspur back then. Even though the Portuguese manager has been sacked, the Spurs have retained their interest in the central midfielder as they look to sign him in the summer. 

Wolverhampton Wanderers are also interested in Palhinha. But the Spurs are reportedly looking to outbid their Premier League rivals. As per reports, Sporting Lisbon value the midfielder at around £35 million. Hence it would certainly not be a cheap deal for the Spurs. 

Having graduated from the youth team, João Palhinha has played 90+ games for Sporting Lisbon in all competitions. The midfielder has also represented Braga, Belenenses, and Moreirense in the Liga Portugal over the years. 

Owing to his prowess, Joao Palhinha was called up to the Portuguese national team in 2021. He has since scored 2 goals in 12 games for the Selecao and would certainly be a shortlist for the 2022 World Cup squad.
