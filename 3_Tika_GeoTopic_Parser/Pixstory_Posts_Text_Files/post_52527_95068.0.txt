Met gala is one of the most decorated annual celebration of fashion. A night of  fashion full of celebrities. Organised and presided over by Anna Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala has become a much-loved annual celebration of fashion. Considered a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, it has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums – 2019’s edition raised a record $15 million (£12 million). In short: it’s a secret. For this reason, guests must abide by the no phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy. However, the rules were famously broken by a cluster of celebrities smoking (ahem) and taking selfies in the bathroom in 2017. The event usually involves a high-profile performer (like Rihanna), and guests always explore the gallery before sitting down together for dinner. Until the evening before the event, the guest list is top secret. But some of the biggest names in the business regularly attend – from Beyoncé and Lady Gaga to Madonna and Rihanna. More often than not, designers attend with their muses: think Marc Jacobs and Kate Moss, or Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière and Emma Stone. That's the story how met gala happens.
