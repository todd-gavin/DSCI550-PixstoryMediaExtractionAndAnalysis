Mary Dennett is a superwoman in all sense She was a women s activist pacifist and pioneer in the areas of birth control sex education and women s suffrage She suffered huge due to the lack of information on birth control She said I was utterly ignorant of the control of conception as was my husband also We had never had anything like normal relations having approximated almost complete abstinence in the endeavour to space our babies Dennett worked for the cause of women s suffrage from to one of the significant periods Dennett co founded the Twilight Sleep Association which supported the use of scopolamine and morphine to lower the pain of childbirth Statistics indicated that twilight sleep reduced infant mortality and the risk of injury and infection due to lessened use of forceps Dennett wrote a sex education pamphlet for her children as the outcome of the lack of any existing educational material that met her standards which included scientific correctness sex positivity and discussion of the emotional side of sexual relationships This is why she deserves to be called an excellent mom amidst her divorce and the ridicule she faced She chooses to give the right kind of information to her children She was even arrested for her work in sex education and women s rights Her conviction in awakened a national storm of protest With the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union she won a reversal of her conviction in the federal Court of Appeals in March She fought for what we fight for today Thank you for putting so much effort into an unsupportive and discouraging era
