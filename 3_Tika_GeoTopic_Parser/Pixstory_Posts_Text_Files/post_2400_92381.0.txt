There is a need  to build a food aware society to address the problem of diet- related health crises in the country.
The burden is huge & efforts are needed to arrest growing trends of various types of non-communicable diseases, malnutrition , obesity and food-borne illnesses on one hand & the negative impact of the current food system on our planet including climate change & food waste .
The best option would be to follow right agricultural and food practices. 
Going back to our traditional food practices is the way out. Anything that goes through industry processes be it sugars, carbohydrates, oils changes it’s properties. It’s laced with chemicals . Hence we see rural people have better health compared to those living in the cities . 
Try to eat the way your grandmother used to may be the best practice.
