Understanding the love for K Pop is beyond me Looking into the whole thing K Pop aka Korean Pop could be translated into basically taking mediocre Western pop and turning it into a better Korean product but as of now it has gone exactly the same way that ruined Western pop in the first place making it no better than its Western counterpart The reasons for hate are plenty but the biggest of all has to be its toxic fandom comprised of an army of oversensitive people who go bonkers as soon as you utter a word against their beloved pop gods Seriously K Pop fans are worse than the most hardcore metal purists or prog heads A case in point is the BTS fandom The level of obsession that K Pop fans harbour for the whole idol phenomenon is unreal They are delusional to the point that they refuse to see just how manufactured and brain dead this music is though granted the overall dancing and choreography even the music as a whole is superior to American pop but given what American pop is today that really is not a compliment Not to mention they even refuse to acknowledge the dark side of this industry of just how much the agencies behind the outlets have criminally dictator tendencies pushing young people to the breaking point and having teenagers do sexy borderline perverse moves exposing them to all sorts of nefarious audiences including paedophiles and rapists Most of these people go through who knows how much surgery to look that perfect Once you enter the K Pop industry you are the product of an agency nothing more The formulaic same chord progression and same rhythmic structure and the overuse of the same tropes across various K Pop artists can quickly kill the appeal instantly making it dull The formula is as repetitive as it gets even the lyrics are banal K Pop is fake soulless bubblegum factory manufactured music with no space for original concepts and ideas it does a horrible number on its artists and has resulted in the world s most obnoxious fandom Seriously the world would be better off without it
