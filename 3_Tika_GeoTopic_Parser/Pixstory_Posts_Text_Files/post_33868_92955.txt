Away defeat for Atalanta which does not follow up on the good performance in Germany against Leipzig and falls at Sassuolo This is the analysis of the Dea Gasperini coach I changed many men because playing such demanding matches in the Cup and then on Sunday afternoons is not easy I sent a lot of fresh players onto the pitch and despite this the game was in the best conditions to exploit We didn&#39;t have the quality and precision It was an open match in the first half we made a gross mistake on goal and opened up a counterattack and this made it difficult a match that I expected could go better Today there was a lot of turnover and in these conditions it&#39;s not always the same obvious thing that in the second round for many reasons including injuries particular situations we didn&#39;t do well we did enough badly We were penalized by the return of the national teams and the league matches after the cup matches We were hardly able to be competitive after this The watershed Thursday If we were to go to the semi-finals a good goal for the season if this does not happen it seems to me that there will be matches and we will have to do something important to achieve Europe
