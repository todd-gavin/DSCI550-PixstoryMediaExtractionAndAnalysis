Amartya Sen in his book titled Identity and Violence emphasized on the plurality of identity that all the humans have acquired such as I am an Indian a student a male a reader a researcher and much more Among all these several identities he mentioned all of them are equally important and should be used simultaneously according to the situation and location we are in and here today I want to identity myself as your friendly neighborhood writer I am an amateur writing for the sake organizing my thought process For the soul within me writing is not scary activity It screams loudly to not to engage myself in a futile activity as I neither do I write professionally nor do I wish to take it as a career choice Then you must be pondering that I must be an idiot to identity myself as a writer Here is the thing I believe writing helps me organize my thoughts which is usually scattered all over the place I am extremely clumsy and fellow and could express in an articulated manner only when I write Apart from being a clumsy writer I am an idealistic person I want the world around me to be like I read or write I wish to be a world where the good and bad evil and virtuous are as clear as daylight like how we see in the movies which makes me a daydreamer too It goes without saying that I am talkative person too I love meeting various people and sit with them and just talk for few hours exchange views on shared ideas and topics This identity of mine has really help me a lot to make friends easily improve my behavior by learning from others made me realise how small as unit in a society we are It tethers my idealistic world to the realistic one in which I live in
