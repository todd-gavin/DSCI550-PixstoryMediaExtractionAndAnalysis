One of the core and often overlooked features of rock and metal music is the bass. Usually because of the vocals, booming loudness, heaviness, distortion, riffs and guitar solos, people often overlook the bass, but in reality, if riffs shape the song then bass supports the entire structure.

 Without a good bass player, a song no matter how good will collapse, because the bass is the supporting pillar on which everything else is constructed, but still unfortunately suffers from a thankless and daunting responsibility. 

Being a good bassist depends more than just skill, but also requires creativity. That doesn’t mean slapping the fretboard or playing a bass solo, but rather understanding the total sound of the band, and what bass line would best suit the song in unison with the supporting instruments.
