Coming from a non Hindu background I never knew the significance of celebrating Raksha Bandhan Around this time of every year I hear a lot of my friends and family reminding me about this day but I never made an effort to understand the reasons for commemorating this event But when I was in my th grade one day we had a small Raksha Bandhan celebration at school where we were asked to bring a Rakhi and tie it on someone s wrist with whom we have a brother like relation And that day after that event teachers came to class as usual to teach But one of my teachers took a moment to explain the historical background of this event And that s when I came to know about this wonderful tale explaining the beautiful sibling bond between Draupadi and Krishna which is an excerpt from the epic Mahabharata And from that day on whenever I find any of my friends confused about the purpose behind celebrating Raksha Bandhan I straight away explain the whole tale to them with much eagerness And years later I read another incident from the past related to Raksha Bandhan It s an incident about Roxana wife of Alexander the Great and King Porus the King of Pauravas When Alexander invaded India Roxana was much worried about his safety And out of concern she sent a Rakhi to King Porus and asked him to take care of Alexander and not to hurt him And during the battle Porus noticed this Rakhi on his wrist and he chose to withdraw from the war inorder to not cause any harm to Alexander And Porus lost that battle Gratified by the act of Porus Alexander offers Porus an authoritative post in the administration of his kingdom So on this auspicious day let us celebrate and cherish our bond with our dear siblings and be eternally grateful for having such beautiful souls in our journey Happy Raksha Bandhan Thanks for reading Wishing you all good health happiness and prosperity
