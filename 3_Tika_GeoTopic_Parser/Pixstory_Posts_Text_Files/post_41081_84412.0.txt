During the 28th Screen Actors Guild Awards (SAG) on Sunday night, Ukraine was on many people's minds. 

Several Hollywood celebs paid tribute to those affected by the Russian incursion and offered prayers. TNT and TBS broadcasted the ceremony, which took place at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California. 

Lady Gaga, who was there to promote her film "House of Gucci," said on the red carpet that she was "very honoured to be here," but that folks in Ukraine should not be forgotten at the lavish event.

Fox News reported that she said "This is a beautiful night where we all get to celebrate art together and celebrate each other," the 35-year-old told E!’s "Live from the Red Carpet". "There’s so much going on in the world and my heart goes out to Ukraine. I think tonight we should all really sit in the gratitude of this."

Michael Douglas, who wore a blue and yellow pocket square to commemorate the colours of the Ukrainian flag, expressed a similar opinion. 

"This is not the Los Angeles Rams," the 77-year-old emphasised to Access Hollywood, referring to the Los Angeles football team of the same name.

Andrew Garfield added that it was a difficult day to rejoice.

He said that it's strange to keep what's going on in Ukraine in our hearts. It's a little strange that we're all dressed up right now, but I'm grateful to be here with our community – a community of love.
