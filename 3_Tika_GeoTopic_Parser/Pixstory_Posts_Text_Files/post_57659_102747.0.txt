I cannot stop myself from completely agreeing with this post as it says everything so correctly. I have a bunch of people in my professional circle who choose to do this every time I send a message or ask something; it always makes me feel sad, I thought it was such a mere thing to overthink about, but now that is all said so appropriately, I feel it has justified how I have felt all those times.

It is not something to make an issue out of it, but it would not harm a person if they would take some time to respond to a message. However, since I have these times when I have to communicate often on messaging apps, it becomes hard and disappointing if the other person does not do it correctly.
Maybe their intent to do so is not wrong, but I think it should be an apt behaviour while communicating professionally.

To some extent, we tend to ignore this behaviour or instead deal with it our way regarding personal communication. Still, if it is regarding someone who is part of our office, we refrain from doing so as it could lead to losing the job or staying on bad terms with the person. 
Messaging behaviour should be a priority during these times when all the work goes around WhatsApp or other messaging apps.
