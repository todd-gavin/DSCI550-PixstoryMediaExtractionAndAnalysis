Lionel Messi has no intention of returning to Barcelona, according to The Sun. Recent reports suggested that the Argentinean was being urged to consider a departure from PSG. The 34-year-old joined the Parisians last summer, but is yet to assert his dominance in Ligue 1, scoring just once in 11 games.

It was reported that Messi's wife Antonela is unsettled in the French capital, and wants to return to Spain. There was also interest from the Blaugrana in a reunion with Messi, especially with Xavi at the helm and Dani Alves back. However, the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner is not looking to leave the French giants right now.

Lionel Messi has a contract with PSG that runs till 2023, and is determined to honour the deal. The Argentinean is desperate to stamp his authority in France. The 34-year-old has been a shadow of himself in Ligue 1, but he has been a beast in the Champions League. He has scored five times in as many games for his new club this season. That suggests it's only a matter of time before he gets going in the league too.

Messi has helped PSG ease into the knockout stage of the Champions League. With a blockbuster knockout tie against old foe Real Madrid ahead, the 34-year-old is determined to come good for his new team. As such, the Argentinean is not thinking about moving to Barcelona right now.
