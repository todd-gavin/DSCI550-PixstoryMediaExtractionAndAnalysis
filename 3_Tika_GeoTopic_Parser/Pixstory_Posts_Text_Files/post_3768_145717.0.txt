Another e-commerce leader, Flipkart has also launched a series of advertising campaigns featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Alia Bhatt, ahead of its Big Billion Days sale.
Through the campaign, Flipkart is reaching out to consumers who are on the lookout for upgrades and makeovers but are unable to do so because of inflationary trends. The platform is urging them to break free from the clutches of adjustments and purchase products at affordable prices from it.
The new player in the block, Meesho is also competing against the e-commerce behemoths through the launch of its ‘Mega Blockbuster Sale: Saal ke Sabse Kam Daam’ campaign.
The campaign features popular stars ranging from Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Rohit Sharma, Rashmika Mandanna, Ram Charan and Sourav Ganguly, amongst others, the sale will run from September 23 to September 27.
