Empoli surrenders to Vlahovic and Juventus and comes out defeated for the match valid for the day of Serie AL the coach of the Tuscans intervened like this at the end of the match to the microphones of DAZN The performance makes me smile and be proud I asked the boys to be such and which ones in the first half and they did it all the way The situations weren&#39;t favorable for us and therefore we always had to scrape the barrel But by now we&#39;re used to it We can&#39;t collect for what we do but these performances give us more and more conviction what can be done even against those more gifted than us as long as we put in the race what we put in tonight too When you compare yourself with a quality like this it is clear that you cannot hope not to pay if you then fail to get what you create It happens to us often but I am convinced that this is our path The defensive phase is certainly a weakness It is true that we have also scored twice as many goals that distinguish the band to which we belong Then we know our weaknesses but knowing our qualities we go our own way And it is clear that many goals have been conceded but I believe that once again tonight the team under the defensive aspect did an enormous job against a super-equipped team On the episode that raised a lot of controversy due to Rabiot&#39;s intervention on Zurkowski he replied like this I don&#39;t know I was far away They told me they were examining it and I trust it blindly At that point I took a penalty against Juve Bennacer Dybala and compared to that parameter today&#39;s was much worse If I were the referee I would give more to my team but it&#39;s not possible I repeat, I blindly trust what they do and who does it. The important thing is that you work to improve things and not complicate them. And sometimes you try to complicate life for those who go on the field. It seems to me that there is a bit of a mess.
