Hello!!!
I'm posting for the first time on this platform and I'm very confused about what to post. So let's start with an introduction.
I'm Shivani, you can call me Shivi. I'm an introvert person. I don't open up to people's easily. I'm a National level Chess player but missing my practices nowadays because my sleep schedule is messed upü•¥. I love dogs üêï more than anything. I'm so much into photography and that's is why picture for this post is easily available with me without any confusion.
Thank you‚ù§
