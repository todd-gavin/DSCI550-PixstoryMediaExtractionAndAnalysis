The most significant responsibility a mother has is to raise her children. 

But exactly what does that mean? The majority of us have a general idea of what it feels like to be nurtured, but here are some details. 

A loving mother is more than just the child's "maintenance person." She does more than simply keep a child nourished, clothed, warm, and dry. By giving her children life, she also facilitates their entire development. She exudes passion and joy. Giving your child nurturing means nourishing them with life.

And where this is involved, there is no room for burnout!

You decide before having children. Therefore, it is your duty to give them your 100% AND MORE. Your kids did not choose to be born. You bought them in this world, and they deserve your best!

If you think you are a person prone to burnout, simply donâ€™t have kids!
