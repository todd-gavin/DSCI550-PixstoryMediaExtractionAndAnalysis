Jack Wilshere has revealed that he is highly unlikely to join Arsenal again The former England international is currently training with the Gunners to keep his fitness up in the search for a new club However he doesn t believe that Mikel Arteta will hand him a chance back at the Emirates The year old revealed on talkSPORT that he would love to play for the Gunners once more but that Mikel Arteta doesn t want him to sign Wilshere also revealed that he was talking to a few clubs but I think you can rule Arsenal out You could argue that Arsenal are short in midfield and Wilshere has the quality to play in the Premier League and make a difference If he were to play it would be a romantic return for a player who Arsenal released in the summer of However if we look at this logically and practically I see why Arteta might not be that keen to hand his former teammate a contract The year old only played matches last season for Bournemouth and he only played ten in the season before transfermarkt So you would have to say that he would be well short of any match fitness and he hasn t played in the Premier League since July Unfortunately with Arsenal pushing for the Champions League or Europa League they don t have time to be sentimental and they would need Wilshere to hit the ground running Now he could because he has been training with the Gunners but training and playing in the Premier League are very different and if I am honest I don t think Wilshere would be capable Therefore a return to Arsenal doesn t look likely but I hope Wilshere finds a club because he could still do a job in the EFL
