You may have heard the name of Taylor Swift ,if you listen to English songs.

Taylor Alison Swift is an American singer-songwriter.

Her songs doesn't only contain a genre but various genres.

But you know why she's one of my favourite artists?

Cause she 
• writes her own songs,
• explored various genres,
• shuts the mouth of people talking about her politely, 
• is self made, 
• never fail to show creativity, 
And most importantly
• respects and loves her fans.

3) Speak now
4) Red
5) 1989
6) Reputation
7) Lover

9) Evermore

These are the studio albums with a large number of songs.

My favourite one's are 
Blank Space, Betty, Willow, Everything has changed, and more & more , the list goes on.

So if you want to try, listen to her songs definitely.
