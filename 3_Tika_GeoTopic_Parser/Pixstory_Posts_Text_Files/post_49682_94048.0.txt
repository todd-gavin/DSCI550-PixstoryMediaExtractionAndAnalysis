‌President Joe Biden in his visit to North Carolina urged Congress to negotiate their differences on the Bipartisan Innovation Act, a bill that will improve domestic semiconductor production and strengthen competitiveness with China, as he also admitted the inflation problem around the country and pointed to supply chain issues for the cause of high prices. 
‌
‌He also persuaded Congress to shortly pass the bill, which will also invest in STEM education and support the creation of a Regional Technology Hub program, among other initiatives. Semiconductors being the most needed in the US are mostly produced outside of the US. He wished to build supply chains in the USA, not from any other sources.
‌
‌He also addressed the issue of inflation and said it is also one of the reasons why we should endorse made in America. Moreover, it is always better to build in our country than to export from China. If we make enough and more we could easily help other countries who are also in constant debt of supply from China with the high-quality products our country can assure.
