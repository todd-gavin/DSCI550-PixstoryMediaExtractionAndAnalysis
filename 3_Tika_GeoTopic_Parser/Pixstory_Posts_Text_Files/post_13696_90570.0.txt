Golghandi Hill, also known as "Judas- tree ", used to host thousands of spectators from different provinces on Nowruz in previous years, but this year, compared to every other year, it sees a lower number of visitors. A number of citizens from neighboring Parwan provinces, who came to Golghandi hill on the first day of Nowruz 1401, attributed the low attendance to economic problems. In addition, this year, unlike other years, women have a specific place (women's park). In the first 1401, women were not allowed to tour all areas of the hill. On the first Nowruz, on the Golghandi hill, muhtasban (agents of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil) roamed among the people and advised the citizens on "the right ways of entertainment from the point of view of Islamic law."
Golghandi hill in Charikar city, the capital of Parwan province, is one of the scenic and recreational areas, especially in spring. Every year, the National Purple Flower Festival is held with the participation of some government officials, poets, writers and residents of different provinces of the country. Current local officials also say that preparations have been made to celebrate the 10th Arghun Flower Festival, which is scheduled to take place in the near future.
