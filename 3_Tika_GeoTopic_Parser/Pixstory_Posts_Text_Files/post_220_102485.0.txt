The pastel-brushed colorblock homes of Notting Hill’s Portobello Road, layer upon deep royal blues and reds of antique shops offering wedgewood cups, world maps, ornate clocks and stoned rings.

Pockets of a claustrophobic past concentrated into little shops at the corner of the road, keep haunting you in whiffs parting the newness of a rain-scented wind – the naivety of a ‘becoming’ is constantly made self-aware by the already ‘becomed’.

While Notting Hill is primarily associated with Julia Roberts, it’s also home to the beloved Paddington Bear, who came from a typewriter clacking in a flat around Portobello Road, after Thomas Michael Bond brought home a lonely teddy bear from Paddington Station on Christmas Eve in 1956. 

Paddington would take his elevenses everyday at an antique shop owned by his family friend Samuel Gruber: “Mr Gruber was born in Hungary and his antique shop in the Portobello Road is an oasis of peace and quiet in Paddington’s life: a retreat where every day he can share his elevenses, discuss the world in general over cocoa and buns, and seek sound advice from his friend whenever the need arises,” according to The Library Time Machine.

The past moves forward at the pace of time at Portobello Road, sometimes faster than your present self has the stamina for.
