It's beem 21 years to the terrorist attack that shook America and claimed countless of lives. 21 years to those victims and many more.
9/11 did not claim only the victims of the attacking organization but also so many more out of that. It brought in America, an unbelievable rise in racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia. The targets were anyone from middle eastern and south asian brown people, muslims or anyone who looked like any of them.
Racial profiling is the practice of targeting individuals based on their perceived racial characteristics. This can involve any kind of policing action, from stop and search to conducting invasive interviews.
Racial profiling is harmful in a number of ways. It leads to discrimination and prejudice, as well as increased tensions and violence between different groups in society. It also puts innocent people at risk, as they may be targeted for reasons that have nothing to do with their actual criminal activity.
There are a number of ways that racial profiling harms individuals: 
- It leads to feelings of injustice and resentment among those who are targeted. 
- It creates barriers to social integration for those who are targeted. 
- It leads to the targeting of the individuals of specific groups, usually minorities or immigrants, by the locals and outside of the authorities.
- It undermines trust between law enforcement officers and the public, creating an environment where justice is not always believed or served.
