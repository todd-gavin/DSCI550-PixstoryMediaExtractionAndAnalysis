I believe food is in general an amazing thing to have in human life. You can never get over food, and that's the best part about it. And when we talk about fries they are trending thesedays. A menu is incomplete with fries. My college canteen fries also adds up in this. It's the yummiest and quickest snack of our canteen, always a go to.
