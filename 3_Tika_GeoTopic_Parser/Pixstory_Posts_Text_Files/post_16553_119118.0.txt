After three rocking episodes, Koffee With Karan 7 is back with yet another crackling episode. The promo of episode 4 is out and this time on the couch will be the fresh Jodi of Liger, Ananya Panday and Vijay Deverakonda. 😙😙

The promo will surely raise the excitement levels of all the fans as these two stars seem to have spilt a lot of beans. From Ananya talking about what’s cooking between her and Aditya Roy Kapur to Vijay talking about wanting a threesome, the promo is every bit of an entertainer. 🤪🤪

{The promo begins with a fun introduction of the two stars by Karan Johar who then goes on to ask Vijay Deverakonda that does he like cheese? }

The expression on Vijay’s face on hearing this question is too cute. 🥹🥹

Then we can see a small clip from Sara Ali Khan and Janhvi kapoor’s episode where they talk about Vijay being on a cheese platter. 

To this Ananya Panday asks that can she be on the same cheese platter leaving KJo in splits. Then the question was directed to Ananya asking her about what’s brewing between her and Aditya Roy Kapur? 
{The promo ends on a rather exciting note by Vijay admitting that he wouldn’t mind being in a threesome. }😧😧😂❤️
