Real Madrid are unlikely to sign PSG striker Kylian Mbappe in this summer’s transfer window, Geremi believes. The France international is Florentino Perez’s top target as he looks to bring more Galacticos to the Bernabeu. Yet one of their former players is doubtful whether a move will happen.

Real Madrid wanted to sign Mbappe back in the summer transfer window of 2017 after he’d burst onto the scene at Monaco.

With Cristiano Ronaldo’s spell at the club winding down, Los Blancos explored ways for a deal to be struck.

In the end, however, they missed out.

PSG were able to sign Mbappe from Monaco, initially on loan, adding to the capture of Neymar from Barcelona earlier that summer.

The player’s stock has since risen majorly, with Mbappe now recognised as one of the best forwards on the planet.

The 23-year-old has scored 10 goals from 19 matches in Ligue 1 this term, while also scoring five in the French Cup and four in the Champions League.
