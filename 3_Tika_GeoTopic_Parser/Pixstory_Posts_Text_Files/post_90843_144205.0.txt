         'Annual Art Contest' 
Concept note:I belong to a small village called Dadra Nagar Haveli. Most of the people there are agriculture workers. There is a wide difference in the quality of life in the village and the city. I can sense this difference very acutely. The way people speak,live, dress here really intrigues me. I try to express this connection with the people I meet and see through my work.
Experiences and sights which surprise me and also ones which I see daily in mundane everyday life are the inspiration for my creations.
In my work I try to express all the things I see and how I feel after seeing them. I strive to express a three dimensional image through my works, as i try to capture and display time , place and an emotional connection in what I create.
