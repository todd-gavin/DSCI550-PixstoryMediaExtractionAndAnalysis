Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has established his complete control over the government and the Shiv Sena legislative party The Shiv Sena Shinde faction and the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP won the Speaker s post securing of the total votes BJP s Rahul Narvekar was elected the new Speaker with a clear majority With this Shinde has sought the control over the Shiv Sena legislative party and established his faction as the one that has majority in the assembly Earlier in the day his faction also sealed the party s legislative office in the assembly complex With today s development the fight between the two factions is set to escalate as Uddhav Thackeray is likely to step up his public interactions across the state He is expected to go to the people to highlight how the rebels betrayed him the Shiv Sena and it s founder Bal Thackeray The Speaker s post was vacant after Congress leader Nana Patole stepped down to become the state unit chief The move proved counterproductive for the Maha Vikas Aghadi MVA as the coalition could not expel the rebel Shiv Sena members in the absence of a Speaker This was the biggest blunder by the Congress given that in the matter of defections the Speaker s post is extremely crucial as seen in Rajasthan during the crisis triggered by Sachin Pilot s revolt against chief minister Ashok Gehlot in In fact Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis today thanked Patole for vacating the post and enabling them to form the government Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya have now a tough task cit out for them to restore confidence of the cadre and the people in them This is the worst crisis faced by the Shiv Sena in its history though there have been revolts in the past too one led by Narayan Rane who is in the BJP now and the other by Chaggan Bhujbhal at present with the NCP The test for Uddhav Thackeray will be how he emerges out of this crisis and rebuilds the party All eyes are on him now as he embarks on the important and tough mission
