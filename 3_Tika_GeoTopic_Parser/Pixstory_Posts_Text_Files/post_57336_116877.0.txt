1. Eat more "water-rich" fruits and vegetables like watermelon, strawberries, grapefruit, peaches and cantaloupe. Other good options include cucumbers, lettuce, zucchini, celery and tomatoes.

2. Try iced coffee (caffeine-free is always a great option). You may be surprised to know that coffee count as part of your daily fluid intake. In fact, about 98 per cent of your morning cup of coffee is water.

3. Try iced tea. There are many types of tea (white, black, green and oolong) and flavours to choose from. In general, tea has about half the amount of caffeine as coffee. There are also herbal and fruit teas that are caffeine-free.

4. Eat cold soups, preferably those that are broth-based. Gazpacho is one popular cold soup that originated in Spain. The main ingredients are tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, garlic, and onions.

5. Choose coconut water over fruit juice. Coconut water generally has fewer calories and added sugars than fruit juice. It's also a good source of potassium.
