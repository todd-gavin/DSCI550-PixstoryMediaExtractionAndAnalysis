Every traveller has his own way of travelling pack tonnes of stuff or just a duffle bag Book a ride ot hitchhik Depends on how daring you are and how safe your destination is Sometimes daring can turn to dumb after all But something that I ve seen a lot of people argue on is whether it s better to travel alone or with a guide Many people claim if you enjoy travelling and exploring it is usually a good idea to do your research Gone are the days when you had to rely on guides to accompany you on your journey through their stories There s no information Google can t give you no place navigation can t take you to So whether you re doing it for fun or to travel the world it s always better to save some money on your own and help yourself with your knowledge A tour guide is not always open to you doing your own exploring Others suggest you always take a professional with you Travelling is a risky game as fun as it is You might not know the local destinations culture language or even the crimes that can take place there They say curiosity killed the cat and there s enough stories to back it up Stories of lone wanderers stepping into an unknown zone and never coming back I have travelled both ways and I have to say this I enjoyed going alone better but felt more informed with a tour guide What s your get go
