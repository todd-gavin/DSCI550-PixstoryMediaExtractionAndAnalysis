The United Nations Plan of Action on Journalist Safety and the Issue of Impunity strives to establish a free and safe environment for journalists and media workers in both war and non-conflict circumstances around the world, in order to strengthen peace, democracy, and development. 

Its initiatives include, among other things, the creation of a coordinated inter-agency mechanism to deal with issues related to journalist safety, as well as assisting countries in developing legislation and mechanisms that promote freedom of expression and information, and supporting their efforts to implement existing international rules and principles.

To strengthen prevention, the UN Plan of Action recommends collaborating with governments, media organisations, professional associations, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to conduct public awareness campaigns on a variety of topics, including existing international instruments and conventions, the growing dangers posed by emerging threats to media professionals, including non-state actors, and various existing practical guides on journalist safety.

Mr. Gyanendra Bhadaur Karki, Nepal's communication and information technology minister, is the event's chief guest.

On the occasion of the United Nations' tenth anniversary, they have organised a safety programme for journalists who travel around the world to report news. It will last two days, from the 31st of May to the 1st of June. The event will be held in Kathmandu, Nepal.
