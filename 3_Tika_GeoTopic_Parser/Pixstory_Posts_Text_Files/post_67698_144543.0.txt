Research studies tell us that playing chess significantly improves children's visual memory and attention span. 
Children from Youth Club in our Ngo, Friends Society are being taught chess, scheduled every Tuesday. The first day was indeed a very interesting session where their teacher Bhagat Sir sketched out a historical background study of how the game originated which can be traced back to nearly 1500 years, how it was born out of the Indian game Chaturanga before the 600 AD and later spread throughout Asia and Europe.
Here are a few snippets of a fun yet interesting session on chess.
