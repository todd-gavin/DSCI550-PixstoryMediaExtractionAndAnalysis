Red Bull star and reigning Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen admitted he is ‘very happy’ his Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton is finding form as he hopes the Silver Arrows will take points off Ferrari.

Ferrari started the season on fire with Charles Leclerc winning two of the first three races as he held a solid championship lead over Verstappen. However, as the season has unfolded, Red Bull have found form while Ferrari have suffered from a combination of errors in crucial moments and strategical blunders.

It means Leclerc now finds himself 80 points behind Verstappen, who has won eight Grands Prix in this 2022 season. The Ferrari man crashed out from the lead at the French Grand Prix, opening the door for Mercedes to enjoy their best result of the season.

Both Hamilton and teammate George Russell made it onto the podium for the first time since the former Williams man switched to the octuple world champions. The W13 performance at the Circuit Paul Ricard and the Hunagororing - where the Mercedes duo once again finished P2 and P3 respectively - means the earlier problems linked to the porpoising phenomenon appear to be a thing of the past.

After admirably fighting from 10th on the grid to take the win, Verstappen was asked about the increasing threat of Mercedes amid a deteriorating battle against Leclerc. The Dutchman surprised reporters by suggesting a competitive Mercedes was a ‘good’ thing.

“No, it's good that they are competitive because then they can steal more points off Ferrari,” Verstappen said. “So I'm very happy. They’re doing very well.”
