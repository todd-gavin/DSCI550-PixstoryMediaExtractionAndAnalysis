1. Simple carbs
simple carbohydrates with small amounts of protein, fat, or fiber for staying power and energy.

Bananas or apples with peanut butter, avocado toast, or hummus with carrots or crackers can work best for this.

2. Energizing snacks
It could be fruit and nut butter, a smoothie, toast with avocado, or anything that feels energizing.

3. Easy-to-digest foods
Before yoga, choose foods that digest easily and give you balanced energy, such as a combination of whole grain carbohydrates, protein, and fat for staying power.

4. Avoid spicy, fatty, and acidic foods.
These can upset your stomach, can cause acidity and sometimes even can go to peptic ulcers.
