Launching the Ukraine invasion, Putin had made a veiled reference to Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Now he has put the nuclear forces on alert. The country has the biggest n-stockpile in the world, and it has never directly threatened its use since the Russian Federation was established in 1991. All of a sudden, for the first time in a long while, a nuclear war has become a real possibility, even if all efforts to avoid it can be expected. 

Even minus the nukes, a World War III could be in the offing. As the Russian military action began in opposition to the NATO expansion threat, the US and allies remain part of the equation, even if they are not yet participating in armed action. 

To bring more pressure on Russia, the West decided during the weekend to cut off Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a messaging system that runs international finance. Quite a drastic move, the French finance minister described it as a “financial nuclear weapon.”

In response, Putin turned his attention to actual nuclear weapons, putting them on high alert: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-invasion-war-putin-nuclear-forces-high-alert/

Putin’s speech of Thursday announcing the invasion too had referred to Russia’s nuclear capability: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/putins-speech-declaring-war-on-ukraine-translated-excerpts 

This is too swift a turn, when the world had come to think of n-weapons as relics of the World War. Putin and Biden too had said in their joint statement after the Geneva summit less than a year ago that “Nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-joe-biden-europe-united-states-f58746ab66c61c6a9b474db2b402ba02

Experts, however, wondered about Putin’s instructions to put n-forces in a “special regime of combat duty” because, like the American arsenal, they are expected to be always so: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-moscow-2e4e1cf784f22b6afbe5a2f936725550

The Biden administration has chosen not to join in by matching Putin’s “escalatory” move, but officials are scrambling to respond to the situation: https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/02/27/ukraine-russia-nuclear-alert/

The Ukraine-Russia talks that began Monday are the first opportunity to defuse the crisis. Otherwise, as some of Ukraine’s neighbors are part of the NATO, the offensive can spill over and trigger into a World War: https://jewishcurrents.org/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-an-explainer
