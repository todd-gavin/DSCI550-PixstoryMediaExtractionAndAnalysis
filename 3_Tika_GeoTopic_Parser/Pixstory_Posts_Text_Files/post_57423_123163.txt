Although it cannot be denied that athletes have more chances of getting concussions if they re involved in playing contact sports some show that these injuries and diseases could be found in a person without any history of contact sports CTE can affect people having neurodegenerative diseases or drug addictions Moreover bumps blows or jolts to the head could also occur due to any accident that does not involve a contact sport Of course not everyone can get it but if the intensity of the blows is high then there could be chances Even military personnel are at risk of getting CTE However since the disease could only be diagnosed after the person s death there is less evidence to show who and how many general people have developed CTE One rare example showed the prosecution and harms caused by domestic violence or any form of violence involving banging the head can cause CTE So CTE can be found in both general people and athletes
