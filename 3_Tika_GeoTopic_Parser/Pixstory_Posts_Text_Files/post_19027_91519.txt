After the defeat against Leicester at the end of December and the draw with Chelsea in January, Liverpool have always won Ten league games with only one result thirty points that brought Klopp&#39;s team head-to-head with Manchester City who now seemed very fast towards the final victory Instead the Reds are always present and even today in the advance against Watford the victory arrived, albeit more painful than expected. The match was played in Liverpool but it was the guests who started better and were the first to nearly score Kucka tried on the twentieth but Alisson was careful The first goal arrived with a precise header from Jota on the overturning in front of it Not an easy match for Liverpool despite the opponents not being well placed in the standings, in fact they are in third from bottom place on points from Everton and with games already played more The match goal arrived almost at the end of the second half with Fabinho from a penalty kick Anyone who missed a little today Salah the striker probably felt the effects of the matches played with the national team and probably also felt the effect of the bad elimination from the World Cup
