Although the Bible never explicitly states Jesus is the answer we can discover how he is the answer to our needs You ll see how Jesus removed our sin reconciled us to God gave us a clear conscience took our cares helped our relationships healed our bodies gave us hope and never left us alone in the following texts He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness by his wounds you have been healed Peter Therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand And we boast in the hope of the glory of God Romans Therefore if anyone is in Christ the new creation has come The old has gone the new is here All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ not counting people s sins against them And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation Corinthians So let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith with hearts that have been purified from a guilty conscience and with bodies washed with clean water Hebrews GNT Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death Romans Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear your heavenly Father knows that you need them But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well Therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself Each day has enough trouble of its own Matthew
