Payton Gendron, who allegedly used an AR-15 assault-style rifle during the May 14 attack in a supermarket, was already facing the possibility of life in prison if convicted after becoming the first person in the state to be charged with domestic terrorism motivated by hate. The new federal charges comprise 26 counts of hate crimes and firearms offences.

As all the people in the shooting were black, it is understood that the crime was racially motivated.
According to the federal criminal complaint released on Wednesday, it was found that the motive of the mass shootings was to prevent black people from replacing the white.
The profound prejudice against black people is so apparent in the statements.


Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference recently,
"No one in this country should have to live in fear that they will go to work or shop at a grocery store and be attacked by someone who hates them because of the colour of their skin." 
Following the incident, authorities said the accused gunman drove more than 320km (200 miles) to a predominantly black neighbourhood in Buffalo - New York's second-largest city - with the specific intention of ending "as many black lives as possible".


Hate crimes can torment the victims and society to the extent that they might lose the hope of living; hence understanding and punishing a hate-motivated crime is of utmost importance.
