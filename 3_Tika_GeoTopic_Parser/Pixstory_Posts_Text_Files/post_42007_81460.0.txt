An average American buys almost 300 pieces of clothing per year. That is almost as wearing one piece of cloth per day and discarding it forever. Do we wear 300 pieces of clothing per year? No necessarily. But do we own them? Yes. Why do you ask? Fast Fashion is the answer. Fast fashion capitalises on trends. But the problem is trends move as fast as a running train. Fashion that moves fast from the ramp walk to the retail stores, to our wardrobes to landfills or dustbins in third world countries is an emerging and an extremely concerning problem that lies at the heart of privilege and capitalism in the first world countries. To keep up with the trends, these clothes are manufactured in humongous numbers using extremely unsustainable and very environmentally harmful techniques in third world countries. Human trafficking and child labour in the manufacturing sites in 3rd world countries for such clothing is an everyday sight. A person living in the first world country walks into an H&M store, buys that piece manufactured under exploitative conditions, wears it hardly once due to the ever changing impossible to keep up with trends and discards it in the bins which eventually ends up in landfills in the third world countries we began with. This is the story of fast fashion. There is an urgent need to move towards more sustainable fashion that can be worn for longer periods of time.
