The format of the UEFA Champions League has faced severe criticism in recent years with several top European clubs proposing a change in its format.
The situation peaked when clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Juventus openly declared the formation of an autonomous European Super League last year.
Needless to say, UEFA have been trying to find ways to reinvent their competitions in recent years to appease both the clubs and the public. David Ornstein brings to light a new proposal on the table that the association consider introducing next year.
The new event will be a mini-tournament with four participating teams. It will be held before the start of the new season and will be called the 'Opening Tournament.'
The winners of the previous edition of the Champions League will be given a guaranteed spot in the competition with the other three participants being top-performing European sides, likely semi-finalists.
Some powerful club executives have also been considering the possibility of hosting some matches in foreign markets like the United States, China and the Middle East. One of the main promoters of taking the games out of Europe is said to be PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi.
Needless to say, Real Madrid will be amongst the favourites to take part in the event given their terrific form in Europe in recent years. Moreover, Florentino Perez has always been in favour of playing tournaments with stronger opposition and the new tournament is a mini version of the Super League he planned.
