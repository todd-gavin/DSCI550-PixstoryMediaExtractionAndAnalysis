Carlo Ancelotti believes that flexibility is key in modern football and, echoing Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti's recent comments, suggested that nowadays teams need to be able to play in all manner of ways.
The Real Madrid coach is wary of Barcelona ahead of this Sunday's Clasico, despite their Champions League struggles and is focused on securing a win and regaining top spot in LaLiga Santander. He has praised Barcelona's approach to the game, but has made it clear that he prefers a more versatile team and an idea that adapts to the players he has at any given moment.
"They're clear on their history, and they continue with a style that the fans and the club like," Ancelotti said of the Catalans. "It is an idea that has given them success that they continue to enjoy.
"Other clubs have a different idea. I think that having only one style is not the most appropriate because sometimes players change. It's about looking for an idea in which the players feel comfortable".
Ancelotti provided an update on Antonio Rudiger's condition, while also ruling Thibaut Courtois out.
"He [Courtois] is pretty good, but it's true that he has trained very little, he's not comfortable and is ruled out," Ancelotti said.
"We'll see for the next game, but he only needs to train.
"[Rudiger] is fine, he's not in any discomfort, he's comfortable, a warrior, and ready with a lot of enthusiasm."
The coach is fully aware of the threat that the Catalans pose, and saw no need to rewatch last season's humiliating loss to their rivals.
"I haven't played the video back, we know the opponent very well," Ancelotti said. "It won't affect this year's game, it's another Clasico, we have the joy of playing in front of our fans.
