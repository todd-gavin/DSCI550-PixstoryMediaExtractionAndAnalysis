The Miami Heat have put themselves in a strong position in the NBA season holding the best record in the East However they re not resting on their laurels Just last summer they made major changes to their roster bringing in the likes of Kyle Lowry and P J Tucker Recent reports now suggest Miami is interested in signing Bradley Beal provided he wants a new home Bradley Beal of the Washington Wizards has a player option worth million for but opting out might help him earn a better offer Beal has featured in games this season averaging points rebounds and assists but an injury to his left wrist and surgery thereafter has forced him to the sidelines The Miami Heat have a veteran roster capable of making noise in the playoffs Jimmy Butler Kyle Lowry Bam Adebayo and P J Tucker are all reliable players who have experience in playoff basketball along with a young core that includes Tyler Herro Max Strus and Caleb Martin Victor Oladipo has made his return after a long injury adding firepower to an already skilled roster The Miami Heat are first in the East three games ahead of the defending champions the Milwaukee Bucks in second The Heat have a well oiled defensive system that will come in handy over a seven game series in the playoffs and a lot depends on how the postseason pans out for the franchise Bradley Beal is likely to be a serious target if their aspirations for the title are not met in the current season That would put pressure on Pat Riley to adopt an approach similar to the LA Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets of creating a super team Beal has a lot of time in hand to make decisions about his future landscape in the NBA The Wizards recent addition of Kristaps Porzingis and the surrounding talent of Kyle Kuzma Rui Hachimura and Kentavious Caldwell Pope is enough of a reason for Beal to be excited
