I don’t have any favourites as such. I don’t believe in racism and the same applies to both human beings and food. Food is love and how can you have a favourite one among things you love. It is like asking someone who is your favourite parent or asking a parent, who is your favourite child. Everyone is lovely, everyone is special and so is food. 
I am a sucker for home cooked meal. Anything which is made at home is my all time favorite be it a home rendition of chole bhature or pasta. As long as it is made in home, I am sold.
