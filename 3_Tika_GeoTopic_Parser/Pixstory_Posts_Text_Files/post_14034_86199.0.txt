Even if we look back at the tenure of Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r, one thing was clearly evident during his last days that the players had given up on him. Now, coming to the present situation at Manchester United, Rangnick has brought in a breath of fresh air with his new tactics but the players just don't get along with them. As Manchester United Legend Roy Keane said that a player wearing the United shirt shouldn't give up but if we look back at United matches, they have been giving up constantly. It's become a regual practice now. 

The players can't even handle Rangnick's high pressure tactics, whether it be down to the players egos or just pure lack of fitness. We've seen it before when they're pressing they can only maintain the same intensity for the first half and they're doing nothing in the other. In the game against City, even though Rashford had been brought on just after half-time, he wasn't rushing up to players, he seemed very lethargic same goes for Lingard. When we look at Pogba, he is a player with that one moment otherwise he can also be seen leaving his defence alone. In the defence, their leader isn't vocal enough, they don't push each other up but just stay silent. A defence requires a proper leader and it seems like Maguire can't be the one to lead this team.

There are constant leaks to the press about the inner situation of the dressing room, which has become quite frustrating for the club and even the fans. Rumours have started to float the players responsible for these leaks have been identified and might be let go off in the next transfer window. The dressing room is in complete shambles and if Rangnick wants this situation to improve, he will have to instill a sense of responsibility and discipline in this squad. One proper leader is also the need of the hour, till the next manager comes in.
