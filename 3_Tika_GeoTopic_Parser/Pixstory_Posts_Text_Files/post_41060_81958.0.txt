Things are not looking good for Hollywood actor Zachary Horowitz. He lived a luxurious life consisting of yachts, jets and fast cars, but the source of all it was not legal, it seems. The above was financed through a $650 million Hollywood Ponzi scheme. 

NDTV reported that Zachary Horwitz created fake contracts that he told investors were with HBO and Netflix to trick them into handing over vast sums of money, which he splurged on private flights, top-of-the-range autos and a luxury Los Angeles mansion, complete with a wine cellar.

Horwitz, who acted in small-time horror films under the name Zach Avery, told investors he was buying foreign distribution rights for US movies, and then selling them to streaming platforms.
The 35-year-old gave each victim a note promising a handsome profit six or 12 months later.

He kept the scheme going for a time period of seven years while using new investors' money to repay the old ones. Over a period of time, when all hell broke loose,more than $230 million had vanished.

Furthermore, He admitted security fraud in October, and acknowledged that he had never bought any film rights, or secured any distribution contracts.

Los Angeles Times reported that it would be "difficult to conceive a white-collar crime more egregious," prosecutors said in a memo to the judge, noting he started his life of crime by swindling university friends.
