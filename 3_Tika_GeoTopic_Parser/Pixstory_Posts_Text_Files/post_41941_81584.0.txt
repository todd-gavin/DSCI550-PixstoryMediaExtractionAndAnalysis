Elementary-aged students in schools with uniforms do not display any consistent differences in engagement, social or behavioral outcomes when compared with students in schools without uniforms,‚Äù No differences in bullying or social anxiety emerged among them.

But there was one key difference: Asked about their sense of school belonging and spirit, fifth graders who had to wear uniforms reported lower levels than their peers in schools with no uniform requirements.This study has demonstrated findings that suggest uniforms do not create a student who is more focused, more cohesive with their peers, and with a stronger sense of identity.
These are some of the findings of a study that was conducted . But even i have felt the same way in school, our uniforms were not made to be comfortable and it was really difficult to do sports in them. If they are made to make everyone feel equal why girls and boys have different uniforms ? Why girls have to wear skirts and salwar while boys have a near consistent shirt and pant. 
People in favour of uniforms should also think again. Im not against uniform if they are made in such a way that everyone feels included and comfortable, but i couldn't see it in any school.
