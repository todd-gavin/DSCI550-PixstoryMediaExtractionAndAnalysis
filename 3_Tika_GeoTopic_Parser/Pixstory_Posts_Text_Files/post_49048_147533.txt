When a plant species goes extinct it can have a huge impact on the ecosystem For starters it can lead to a decrease in the number of animal species that live in that area In turn this diminishes the availability of food for these animals and affects their survival rates The loss of all this biodiversity can have a serious impact on ecosystems in general not just the one where the extinct plant species used to live Another major repercussion of a plant species extinction is that it can change the physical environment in which plants grow If a particular type of plant used to grow near an extinct plant species for example then that plant may no longer be able to survive due to its lack of preferred nutrients In turn this could lead to a decrease in biodiversity overall since fewer different types of plants will be present While it doesn t sound so bad in theory extinction of a plant species often causes disruption in the natural environment and changes in rainfall patterns This can lead to alterations in soil composition and an increased susceptibility to pests and diseases Overall extinction of a plant species can have a wide range of negative consequences for the ecosystem as a whole
