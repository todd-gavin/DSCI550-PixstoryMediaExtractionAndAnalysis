How exactly is this executed After all in spite of modern day capitalism implies that originality is dead the means to achieve profit are inconsequential trends this feature remains almost eerily unique to Studio Ghibli There are many facets to this answer obviously the grappling soundtrack composed to the unique likeness of each film the clothes and colours utilised to convey each emotion or bond camouflaging with backgrounds to show comfort and accord friends being attributed colours from the same kind of palette such as the warm red and yellow of the protagonists in Ponyo the immersing themes et cetera We have to keep in mind though that this is all being achieved through an animated medium so the fundamental problem arises in grounding all this to a reality that is perceptive to children as whatever elements of world building are featured have to be put in deliberately Here is where Miyazaki s forte lies in literally animating in bringing to life He possesses an unparalleled ability to weave real life into the tapestry of the story through intent in the characters movements whether in the way that they run fast paced erratic for younger ones while a more controlled Disney style straightforward approach is taken for elder characters in My Neighbour Totoro or eat in bouts to show desire while having intense reactions such as crying in Spirited Away Thus he uses each frame each split second to add intricacy to his characters Having a child protagonist only further justifies the enigmatic charisma and dreamy quality of these movies and implicitly appeals to younger audiences as essentially this is how children perceive the world the larger functioning of which is equally if not more mysterious than the films to them With The Wind Rises for example a more mature delving into the consequences of war and how passion finds itself ingrained in the larger wheels of capitalism most people would not consider animation to be the most accurate medium to portray a biopic Miyazaki though has spun the story in such a way that more than his life we understand the character through his dreams and aspirations
