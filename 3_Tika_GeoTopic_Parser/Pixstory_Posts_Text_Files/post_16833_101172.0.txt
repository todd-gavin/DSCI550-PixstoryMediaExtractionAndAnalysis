Aishwarya Rai at the Cannes Film Festival is nothing like the ordinary. Global fashion and beauty icon, she leaves no stone unturned.
She wore a voluminous black one-shoulder Dolce & Gabbana gown with 3D floral panels trailing upwards to the shoulder and peeping through her black skirt. The flowers of all the many colours were a fresh dose of summer by the French Riviera that you can trust Aishwarya Rai alone to make it look mighty good. Her hair and makeup was left simply beautiful with some more colours for her eye makeup and her hair neatly tied to the top and left silky straight towards the end. Sorry men, we won't be accepting a bouquet of flowers anymore. A Dolce & Gabbana gown is all we will need
