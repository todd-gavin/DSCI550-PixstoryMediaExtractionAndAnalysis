Nicolas Pepe is back in Arsenal training, and it seems as if he is ready to fight for his place in the starting XI.

The 26-year-old has returned from international duty with the Ivory Coast, and he posted a simple two-word message, 'I'm back'.

Despite being the Gunners' record signing, Pepe has been frozen out of the starting XI by Mikel Arteta this season.

The Spaniard has selected the likes of Bukayo Sako and Gabriel Martinelli over Pepe in recent months, and he has had to make do with a place on the bench.

Now, he had a pretty strong AFCON as he scored twice and provided an assist, but he couldn't help his country get past the last 16 as they lost to Egypt on penalties.

Now he is back in London, and he must be hoping that he can contribute towards a strong second half of the season for the Gunners.

So far in the Premier League, Pepe has only played for 501 minutes and has provided a single direct goal contribution (transfermarkt).

Given that he cost over Â£70million, you would hope that he can rectify this in the remaining games, but first, he has to force his way back into the team, and that won't be easy.

Martinelli and Saka are in the starting XI on merit, and it is down to Pepe to change Arteta's mind.

If he can't, and he continues to be on the bench, I wouldn't be surprised to see him leave the Gunners in the summer and try and rebuild his career somewhere else.
