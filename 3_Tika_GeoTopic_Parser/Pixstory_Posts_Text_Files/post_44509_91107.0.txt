Life at the Parc des Princes has not been very kind to Lionel Messi. Modern Football's very own superstar has struggled to find his form, atleast to an extent match his own lofty standards and fit into the Parisian's multi-million dollar project. 

With the Champions League exit last month and Kylian Mbappé's inevitable exit, patience is growing thin — both for Messi and the club's Qatari owners. While not much has been made clear on the Argentine's side (both Leo and his dad insist he will take up a non-football role at the club someday), his former team-mates have said words. Significant ones.

Barça manager Xavi Hernandez has opened his arms to an old friend. In veteran Sergio Busquets' own words, — “I miss him and I am sure he misses me too”

“Of course I would like Messi back, but he has a contract with another team. It’s also complicated because of the way he left us. Nobody else has given us what Messi did. I miss him and I am sure he misses me too.

“Xavi said Messi’s doors are open to return. I’ll give him the captaincy, he has my respect and admiration.”

Confirming the manager's thoughts. President Laporta has never stepped back from talking about the player cules learnt to love and adore all these years. A return would be a lovely homage to a player who now enters the final embers of his career. 

However magical, it wouldn't be the crowning Jewel in Barça's project, which seems to be going very smoothly with La Masia's finest talents at the heart of it. With Ousmane Dembele possibly staying, other stars like Ferran Torres, Pierre Emerick Aubameyang and Adama Traore are additions consistent with the direction in which the club is heading.

Busquets himself will take part in a 4th world Cup and will probably extend his stay in Spain, so a return shouldn't be completely out of the question for Messi. Only time will tell.
