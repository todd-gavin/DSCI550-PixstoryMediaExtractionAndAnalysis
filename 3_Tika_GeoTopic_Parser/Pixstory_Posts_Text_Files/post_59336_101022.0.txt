Music, you guessed it correctly.

And, Music Festival like Ultra Music Festival, or Sunburn Goa are famous all over the world.

I have personally seen that these festivals one of the few places where you can enjoy freely, irrespective of any background. These festivals are like carnivals with people dressing up brightly and dancing and enjoying throughout the moment.

And, I am sure that of you try it once, you will get hooked to it like nothing else.

For those who are in India or planning to visit India in winters, you should definitely go amd enjoy the Sunburn Music Festival which happen evry year.
