I left for college at the usual time that day I took the metro from Noida and was travelling through blue line Usually I have to change two lines to reach my college I was sitting and was studying in the metro as I had an internal exam too After some time I got to know that a technical issue had occurred in the blue line I got scared I was already short of time I struggled with my stuff and managed to come out I rushed and changed four other lines I bumped into many people coming on way but I didn t bother I was just worried about my exam I finally reached the college minutes past I was late but somehow I convinced the teacher and was let in by her Thankfully the exam went well But the metro experience was just not good
