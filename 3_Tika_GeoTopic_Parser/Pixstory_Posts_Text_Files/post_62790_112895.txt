From childhood s hour I have not been As others were I have not seen As others saw I could not bring My passions from a common spring From the same source I have not taken My sorrow I could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone And all I lov d I lov d alone Then in my childhood in the dawn Of a most stormy life was drawn From ev ry depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still From the torrent or the fountain From the red cliff of the mountain From the sun that round me roll d In its autumn tint of gold From the lightning in the sky As it pass d me flying by From the thunder and the storm And the cloud that took the form When the rest of Heaven was blue Of a demon in my view Poe never published this poem in his lifetime Nobody really knows what was going on in his mind when he wrote this Some say he was depressed others say he was mourning Fanny Allan s his foster mother recent demise One thing is clear that he s reflecting back on his childhood How he saw the world differently how it kept him alone How his sorrows kept him away from others
