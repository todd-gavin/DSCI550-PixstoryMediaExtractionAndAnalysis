Judy Garland's "Wizard of Oz" dress, which had been missing for decades before being discovered at a Catholic university last year, could fetch more than $1 million at auction. 

NBC News reported that, from April 23 to 29, the classic blue and white gingham dress will be on display at Bonhams New York. It will next be auctioned in Los Angeles on May 24 for somewhere between $800,000 and $1.2 million, according to Bonhams. 

“The iconic blue and white gingham dress is one of only two existing dresses retaining the white blouse and only one of four blue and white dresses in existence," the release said. "This incredibly rare and iconic Hollywood costume has also been matched to a specific scene in the beloved movie, namely when Dorothy faces the Wicked Witch of the West in the Witch’s Castle.”

But then it was gone. As the years passed without anybody seeing the dress, rumours of it being gifted grew less and less likely. 

However, while the department was undergoing renovations last summer, Ripa observed a bag atop teacher mailboxes. Inside of the bag was a box, and inside the box was the dress.
