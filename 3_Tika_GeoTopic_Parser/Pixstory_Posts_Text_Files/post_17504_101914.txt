The Los Angeles Lakers have been stuck at home watching the NBA Playoffs and they must be disappointed they are not in the mix to win their th championship LeBron James has now missed the postseason twice since coming to Los Angeles and the organization has to feel the pressure of winning now while he is still donning Purple and Gold This offseason is going to be one of the most crucial in franchise history as they look to get past their failure of a season and hopefully keep James past the season As far as the playoffs go there have been the usual complaints about the officiating as nearly every game in each series has had questionable calls The Lakers star has been intently watching the games and he pointed out one aspect of the game that he believes needs more attention via his Twitter account James has not been shy to let his opinion be known publicly especially when it comes to officiating In this case it seems watching the illegal screening in the playoffs caught James eye and it was enough for him to speak about it though there is no specific instance he referenced The inconsistent officiating is a major source of frustration for fans and teams though that is nothing new considering how much referees will let players get away with However to the NBA s credit they have been receptive to feedback from coaches and playoffs so perhaps James gripe with screening will prompt some change in the near future
