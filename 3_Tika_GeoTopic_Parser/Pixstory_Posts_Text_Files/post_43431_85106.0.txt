A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national),[2] and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs

Why does the notice of Income Tax Department come?

If your income is taxable and you do not pay tax, then the notice does come, but if you show less income and the income tax department sees more income then the notice also comes. Not only this, due to reasons like mistake in calculation, not filling income correctly or showing excessive loss while filing ITR, you can also get notice from Income Tax Department.
When you may get Notice from IT department ?
- If there is any Discrepancy in Return Filed by you.
- If there is mismatch in the TDS amounts and AIS information.
- Incorrect or insufficient supporting documents
- Escape High value transactions to be updated in the Income Tax Return
- Misreporting LTCG
- For non-disclosure of income
- For not declaring investments made in the name of spouse
- If your return is picked for scrutiny
To avoid getting notice: Report all your income and other income taxable in your hands, pay full tax due and in general be tax-compliant.
Keep documentary and other evidence as proof of whatever is claimed in your return so that you can use it for future reference when asked by department.
