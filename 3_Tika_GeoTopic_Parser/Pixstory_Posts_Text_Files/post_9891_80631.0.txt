There is someone in me who, if she is in a bad mood, gets upset inside me.  If I open my lips to smile, the dark world of my mind merges with eternal light.

 There is someone in me who walks and takes care of my stature and knows the shape of my laughter.  If I hide my grief, from my artificial laughter â€” the suffering of the chaotic city understands the realm of my heart.  She is the one who introduced me to myself.

 There is someone in me who has given meaning to my non-existence and has freed my predatory sorrow from the grip of the events of time.
 There is someone in me who taught me to write and wrote the alphabet of love on the white board of my memory.  If it were not for that, I would have lost my displaced soul in the angry layers of the world.

 There is someone in me ... When she is sad, her voice changes.  Wrinkles on his forehead become more.  Depth - The catastrophe is manifested by the swelling of the bruised veins of the face.

 There is someone in me who suffers from illness ... he eats his bones with a machete.  And in his own words: "out of the sight of life."  She is the one who saved me from nothingness. If he worries, I will start dying.

 My mother understood the concept of being.
 Being human makes sense.  Absence makes being lighter.
