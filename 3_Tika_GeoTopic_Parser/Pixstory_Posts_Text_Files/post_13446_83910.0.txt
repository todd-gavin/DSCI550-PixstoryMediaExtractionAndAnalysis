It was one of the longest and most painful moments of my life. The media reported that the President of Afghanistan, Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, had escaped blindness. Believing this news was the hardest thing I could hear. I trembled like a tree. It disappointed a nation. It was a difficult day for the Afghan people. The Taliban in the capital, on the one hand, and the high-ranking government council, on the other, fled. It was something unpredictable.
It was a dark day. All the media in the world were talking about the situation in Afghanistan. It was a nightmare that passed, but it still has an impact on my mind.  Ashraf Ghani left all the hopes of the Afghan people behind and left!
Afghanistan fought for many years. Many sacrifices for peace, freedom, peace.

The current situation in Ukraine is similar to that in Afghanistan a few months ago. Innocent people become destiny because of the politics of the East and the West. Our president "Ashraf Ghani" escaped, but the president of Ukraine, along with the people, accompanied by his country's police, sings shoulder to shoulder for the independence and freedom of their country. There is a great hope for the people of Ukraine. I pray for the freedom and independence of Ukraine.

This is the greatest historical shame for Ashraf Ghani and the high council of his previous government. I declare explicitly! I wish he would learn that this is responsibility towards the country, not escape

We just understand that honesty, loyalty, commitment to the country and the people are in action, not in words!
