I could not upload this last year because I was not on the app at that time I could not hold myself until the next time Christ University is known for its Christmas time decorations and celebrations Last year was ny first time experiencing this but it was truly marvelous The university typically starts putting up decorations in Novemeber and it gradually spreads throughout the campus I had had my end sems at that time and would spend long hours in the library It was exhausting to study for long hours but after walking out of the library it was rewarding to be met with the decorations that flooded the campus with pretty lights in the evening What time on campus do you enjoy the most
