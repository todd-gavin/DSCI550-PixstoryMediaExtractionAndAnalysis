Akshay Kumar, who is among the biggest superstars in India, delivered Bollywood's first post-pandemic hit last year with Rohit Shetty's Sooryavanshi. However, his last two releases, Bachchhan Paandey and Samrat Prithviraj, turned out to be epic flops. 👎🏻👎🏻❌😵‍💫

Post delivering back-to-back flops, there was a buzz that Akshay might change the release date of Raksha Bandhan to avoid a clash with Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor starrer Laal Singh Chaddha. However, the clash is very much on as both the much-hyped projects are slated to hit the theatres later this year, on August 11.🔥🔥🔥✅
