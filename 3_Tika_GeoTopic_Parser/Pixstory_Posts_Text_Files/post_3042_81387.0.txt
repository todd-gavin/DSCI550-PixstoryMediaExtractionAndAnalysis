It’s now about a month since war drums started beating in Ukraine. Finally, it could be this week when the picture will become clear if there’s going to be war or peace – or stalemate. Several events over the next few days are likely to decide the future of Ukraine and of US-Russia equations.

* In the run-up to this week, the US administration said on Friday that Russia was likely to invade Ukraine any day now: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-invasion-any-time/ Next day, Biden and Putin had a phone call, which failed to ease the tensions: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/12/putin-to-biden-us-failed-to-address-russias-security-concerns

* The US and NATO have rejected Russia’s demands, and this week they are expecting a formal response from Moscow: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/world/europe/us-nato-response-russia-demands.html

* When Russia carried out military exercises in Belarus next door, the move was seen as part of its deployment for Ukraine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXYO9xZsiZs The drill ends now and all eyes are on where the Russian troops go from there.

* The coming weekend will see a key security conference in Munich, to be attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top European officials. The NATO secretary general will be there, and Russia will not be there: https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_191733.htm

* To counter the US, Russia tried to build ties with European powers. Nothing came out of it. But Putin did meet French President Emmanuel Macron last week. In the same vein, he is meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday: https://www.rferl.org/a/germany-scholz-moscow-visit-ukraine/31686469.html

* Winter Olympics should not be an issue for Putin, according to the US, but many think it might be. The games conclude on February 20 – a date some observers believe might be crucial for the timing of Russia’s next move: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/02/11/russians-and-ukrainians-wage-fragile-peace-winter-games/6731597001/?gnt-cfr=1

This is the coming timeline which makes diplomats and commentators believe this week and early next week might be a make-or-break period for Ukraine. Over the past few days, the stakeholders have worked up a crescendo and the inflection point they have reached now cannot be stretched longer. Therefore, signals coming out of the above events of this week will have a sense of finality: https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-ian-kelly-europe-moscow-russia-4bf5d42906c582c36972b076e73c430f
