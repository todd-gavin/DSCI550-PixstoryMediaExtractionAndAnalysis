Osama is a film directed by Siddique Barmak Now with the advent of the Taliban and the Afghan peace talks there is a serious need to examine the Taliban community This film gives us an insight into the Taliban community which I find necessary to address in the context of the war I must remind The Taliban will soon be forgiven by the international community and of course the poor community is devoid of collective historical memory and I believe the Taliban s suicides and atrocities against the people are being forgotten right now as fast as they are happening If this film and a few other works of art did not give an insight into the Taliban society and the performance of the Taliban the other half of the century would have been among the acquitted men of history Those who have fought against the tyranny of the international community Fortunately Osama s film has well screened Talabani and the defeat of humanity and saved history from oblivion
