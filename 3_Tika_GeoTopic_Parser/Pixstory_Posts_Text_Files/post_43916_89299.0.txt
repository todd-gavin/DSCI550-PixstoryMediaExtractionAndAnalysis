#3 Leonardo Bonucci

Leonardo Bonucci has been a constant and reliable presence in the Azzurri. He and Giorgio Chiellini didn’t allow even a single ball to go past them at the Euro 2020. Bonucci started his career as a midfielder and then slowly transitioned towards becoming a defender. The 34-year-old is great at tackling and aerial duals which makes him the third-best Italian player in 2022.

 

#2 Jorginho 

After receiving a lot of unwarranted criticism in the past few years the Italian midfielder was on a mission to prove himself. And he was successful in doing that. The 30-year old proved his mettle by winning the UEFA Champions League, Euro 2020 and UEFA Super Cup. Jorginho managed to shut the criticism through his unbelievable performances for his club as well as the country in the past few years.

#1 Gianluigi Donnarumma

After his heroics in the penalty shootouts at the Euro 2020 against England, there is no doubt that Gianluigi Donnarumma is the best Italian footballer in 2020. Donnarumma even won the Euro 2020 Player of the Tournament for his unbelievable performance. He is undoubtedly a prospect in becoming one of the best goalkeepers in the history of the game and is often compared with the legendary Gianluigi Buffon. At the age of 22, he has a long and successful career lying ahead of him.
