Neymar Jr is on absolute fire right now for PSG in Ligue Since his big money move from Barcelona to PSG in August Neymar has had mixed fortunes throughout his time primarily down to fitness issues PSG came close to winning the Champions League in the season but he couldn t help steer PSG over the line alongside Mbapp Over the last three seasons excluding Neymar has missed between games per season so it is fair to say he hasn t ever felt fully fit and on top of his game So far this season he s in the form of his life producing Ballon D or like numbers goals and assists at this time of writing will be the headlines but it s everything else that will catch your eye key passes per game for possession won final third per game touches per game Neymar is maxing out other metrics such as take ons attempted fast breaks and fouls won in the league check out Squawka s platform to see these Though these are just numbers on paper I d argue the eye test backs up the types of performance he s producing That Brazilian flair is kicking For Neymar to really cement himself for the club alongside Mbapp and Messi they must push the club into deeper territory such as winning the Champions League which is the endgame scenario for the club This is what they are working towards so it will remain to be seen how far they go Anything less then Neymar will have an ordinary season The elite players don t have ordinary seasons What are your thoughts
