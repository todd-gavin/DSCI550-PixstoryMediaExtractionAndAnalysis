It's funny when people tell me we have reached the saturation of equal rights when in reality even not smiling is a form of resistance.

Men feel entitled to nice behavior from women. They think it’s their right to have a woman be pleasant with them, and if she isn’t pleasant, it’s her fault and she’s a b!tch, wh*re and all other similar things.

It is both sad and funny at the same time. Many men don't even realize what they did was harrassment and catcalling because that's what is ingrained in them. They are told that a woman owes them a smile at an unsolicited compliment. They look at women like objects who they can randomly pass comments on without consequences, and we have to be thankful for them to it.

We don't owe anyone politeness. We are just as human as men, we have the same emotions as them – well, except the need to constantly make others uncomfortable. You are not entitled to a smile or a thank you when you make us uncomfortable. We will not smile more, we will not be any more 'feminine' than we are, we will not behave more pleasantly than we feel. We are allowed to express the emotions we feel.

And ladies, always remember you don't have an obligation to be polite to someone who makes you uncomfortable. Call them out, walk on them, ignore theit existence. Do what you deem best, just remember they don't own you.
