It appears that the long-running saga surrounding Franck Kessie will come to a conclusion with him joining Barcelona for a fresh adventure.

According to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio, Franck Kessié has finished his physical with FC Barcelona.

According to Di Marzio, the medical took place recently in Lugano, Switzerland.

Kessié will join the La Liga club on a free transfer and is set to sign a contract that would keep him at the club until 2026.

The midfielder will earn €6.5 million net per season at Camp Nou, according to Fabrizio Romano.

He has 196 Serie A games and 40 goals between Atalanta and Milan, with whom he has 214 official appearances and 36 goals in all competitions.

Kessié instantly stated his desire for Barcelona since he wanted to join a "famous club," and a phone call from Xavi emphasised how important he will be in his game plans.

While contacts will continue to tie up the loose ends, Kessie did not hesitate to give the green light, and it looks that the 25-year-old has made his decision.

Kessié to add dynamism and versatility
A dynamic player with an excellent engine, Kessié has made 29 appearances for Milan this term, scoring six goals and supplying one assist. He will bring something different to a squad that already has a wealth of options in midfield, in Sergio Busquets, Frenkie de Jong, Pedri, Gavi and Nico. Xavi felt that Barça lacked a midfielder with Kessié’s versatility.

Having attended the youth academy at Ivorian club Stella, Kessié has spent his entire professional career in Italy. After signing for Atalanta in 2014, he joined Milan three years later, initially on loan.

He has won 52 caps for the Ivory Coast, scoring five times for Les Éléphants.
