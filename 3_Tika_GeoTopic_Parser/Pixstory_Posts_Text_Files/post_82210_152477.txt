Today is Dashami the last day of Durga Puja We immerse ourselves in the bittersweet celebrations while feeling the pangs of separation after a week of festivities The married women perform Boron to prepare Maa Durga for her journey back to Kailash They smear vermillion and feed sweets to Goddess Durga and her children After this the married women indulge in Sindur khela They greet each other and smear vermillion on each other s cheeks They dance and enjoy and spend the last few hours with Maa Durga creating happy memories After this the idol is immersed in water in nearby waterbodies indicating her departure from mortal world We chant Aschhey bochhor abar hobe meaning come next year we will celebrate again
