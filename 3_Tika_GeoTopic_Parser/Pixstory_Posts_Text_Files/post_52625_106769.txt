When you ask Naaguja Yamatji man Derek Councillor about his dreams for his fledgling Geraldton based tourism business his eyes light up with pride The Daarragi Naaguja founder sees a future where his business spans the entire Mid West and Murchison region and employs people from all tribes to share their knowledge of country and culture Right now however his one year old business is struggling to gain a foothold due to a question which has long plagued tourism in the region how do you get the hordes of backpackers and grey nomads driving through to the Kimberley to stop Those tourists will more than likely engage in multiple Indigenous tourism experiences at their destination but the options on the km coastal drive from Perth to Broome are limited Councillor has quickly found work for his business in cultural awareness training and smoking ceremonies but the tours are yet to attract sustainable numbers We started when COVID came out so it hasn t really been that successful he said It has been successful in working with schools and cultural awareness but it has been quiet we aren t doing a lot of tours Speaking at Thursday s Aboriginal Business Forum in Geraldton Wula Guda Nyinda Eco Cultural Adventures owner Darren Capewell provided telling insight into the struggles of the region s tourism industry While the Yamatji region has significantly more tourist visitation than the Kimberley the tourist product is lacking Just Aboriginal businesses are registered in the Mid West In the Kimberley there are spanning tours art galleries services and accommodation Capewell said it was time to look after the guts of West Australian tourism referring to the Yamatji region s place in between the Kimberley and South West WA s two premier tourist hotspots They gotta drive through here and they gotta drive back through here he said You also have people on all these big buses flying through here pull up at caravan parks they gotta stay somewhere It is part of the great cultural awakening of Australia and tourism is the vehicle that makes it happen
