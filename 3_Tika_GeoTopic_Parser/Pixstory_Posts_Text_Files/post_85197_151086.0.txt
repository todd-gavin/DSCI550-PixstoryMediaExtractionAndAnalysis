The gesture was seen by many as an anti Semitic one. Jewish groups who were watching the game or came to know about the celebration from Anelka regarded it as a "Salute to the Nazis". Anelka's use of such a gesture this created a considerable amount of outrage among several groups and resulted in serious problems for the French striker himself too.

Another similar incident of a player saluting the Nazis takes the top spot in this list. It was in the year 2013 when a 20 year old Giorgos Katidis from Greece scored a goal for AEK in the later half of the season. He celebrated his goal by making a "Nazi Salute" right in front of the crowd. This resulted in his being omitted from the squad for the remainder of the season. Despite trying to convince the football federation back then that he wasn't aware of the meaning of that gesture,the youngster was handed a lifetime ban from all levels of the Greek national sides.
