Unemployment, or being unemployed, is the outcome when an individual is looking for a job but cannot find one. While it's a negative event for both the individual and the economy, a person can become unemployed in several ways:
* 		Voluntarily leaving a job.
* 		The individual was fired or laid-off from a job.
* 		The individualÂ left the workplace for personal reasons, like maternity leave, injury or illness.

The unemployment rate in India rose to 7.2 percent in February 2019, the highest since September 2016, and up from 6 percent in February 2018.
The steps taken by the government are satisfactory but not sufficient in providing jobs. Now there is also a demand for permanent employment and job security. But poverty limits discourage India to move forward in the struggle. Literacy levels must be improved and more jobs are needed in the corporate sector. For those with the required skills, the challenge is overpopulation.
