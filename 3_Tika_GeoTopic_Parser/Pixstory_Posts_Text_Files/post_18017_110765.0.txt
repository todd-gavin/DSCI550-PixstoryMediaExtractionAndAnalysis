I’m a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world, life in plastic, it’s fantastic! You know those iconic Aqua lyrics, and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are embodying that spirit. The two stars are currently filming the upcoming Barbie film directed by Greta Gerwig, and today we got a closer glimpse at their iconic characters’ flashy wardrobes. To our delight, they include those blinding neon hues that the stylish dolls infamously know and love. 

Robbie and Gosling were spotted rollerblading around Venice Beach in L.A. wearing caricatures of ’80s-inspired athleisure looks that, naturally, matched (Barbie and Ken always coordinate). The hot-pink ensembles included neon-yellow knee pads, fanny packs, and sweat bands. Don’t forget the printed visors, either! We have costume designer Jacqueline Durran to thank for these head-turning outfits. She’s also outfitted films such as Little Women, Atonement, and Beauty and the Beast, but the photos of Gosling and Robbie prove she’s equally adept at dressing campy dolls as she is working on period pieces.
