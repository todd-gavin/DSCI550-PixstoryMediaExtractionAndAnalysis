Disney is under fire once again, this time for a performance by a high school drill team at the Magic Kingdom amusement park in Orlando. 

USA Today reported that the Texas-based Port Neches-Groves Independent School District's "Indianettes" perform a routine at Walt Disney World, according to a video posted on Twitter. The students, dressed in purple uniforms with white fringe, appear to be performing a tribal dance and chant "scalp 'em" at one point. 

The performance was "not consistent with the audition film the school provided," according to Disney, which claimed it had "immediately put safeguards in place to ensure this does not happen again." 

"We regret that the live performance in our park did not reflect our basic principles," reads a statement.

When Tara Houska, a tribal attorney and co-founder of Not Your Mascots, a grassroots movement battling stereotyped Native portrayals in sports teams, saw the Indianettes' performance online, she said it was "not super shocking." 

Houska, a native of Couchiching First Nation, told USA TODAY, "I've seen versions of lingering racism in the shape of mascots in professional sports and collegiate level teams." "This one is special in that it was really overt - like saying'scalp 'em' â€“ and it took place in Disney parks."

While Disney representatives said that the performance did not match the drill team's audition footage, Houska pointed out that the group's name and clothing are also disrespectful. 

"(Disney) should not be providing overt bigotry a forum," Houska remarked. "If you're a parent with a tiny child there, and your child sees someone being dehumanised right in front of their eyes for fun, that's not a healthy message to teach our children," she says.
