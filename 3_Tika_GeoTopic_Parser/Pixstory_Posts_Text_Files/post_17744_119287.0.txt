Netflix has already begun production on The Gray Man 2, with Ryan Gosling reprising the main role and Joe & Anthony Russo once more directing. The sequel will likely show record viewer engagement in 92 countries when Netflix announces opening-weekend viewing data later today. They'll collaborate on the project alongside Mike Larocca of AGBO and Joe Roth and Jeffrey Kirschenbaum of Roth Kirschenbaum Films. Stephen McFeeley, who co-wrote the original based on Mark Greaney's novel with Avengers co-writer Christopher Markus, is penning this one on his own.
Following the release of The Gray Man this weekend, which opened at No. 1 on the streaming service in 92 countries and received a 91 percent audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix may have found the 007-style spy franchise it was looking for and spent over $200 million to blow up Prague in Gosling's duel with Chris Evans.
Additionally based on the book series, a Gray Man spinoff is being developed by Netflix and AGBO. The screenwriters behind Deadpool and Zombieland, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, are on board; however, they are keeping the specifics under wraps.

The Extraction sequel with Chris Hemsworth is set, and Joe and Anthony Russo discuss their decision to switch gears from directing Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing movie of all time, to a similarly ambitious project for a very different audience.
