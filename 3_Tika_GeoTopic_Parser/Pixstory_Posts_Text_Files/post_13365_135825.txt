 I love food and cooking and eating I was constantly looking for new food in different markets I read strange cooking books and you don t shy away from using methods in cooking that are more suitable for use in a laboratory than a small kitchen at home As any good cook knows there is always something to learn Of course you don t have to bother yourself too much Sometimes you just have to listen to your inner voice this is the best profession My advice to my students is to enter the kitchen with love The center of intimacy and love in the family starts from the smell of food from the kitchen She says cooking is not only a difficult boring and time consuming task but it is a big part of the taste of life She believes that life is too short to peel mushrooms If it brings joy and happiness to your life I think you should do it every day Baking class These associations are established to strengthen and help housewives The financial sponsor of this field office program is JRS Organization
