 In the past three years, maternity laws in India have been legalized to encourage more women to pursue careers in a country where female labour force participation remains low.  Paternity leaves are being offered by businesses to encourage fathers to actively participate in raising their children. As India is seeing a surge in working moms, more and more fathers are coming to support their wives. Indian millennials are teaching gender equality to their children, whether they grew up in a gender-discriminatory atmosphere and want to alter it or had a liberal upbringing and want to pass it on to future generations; they are sharing responsibilities amongst themselves so that their children don't associate themselves with a particular type of work. This shift in men's roles in the family also suggests that finally both the mother and the father share equal responsibility for parenting. Because more women now contribute equally to the family's finances, the idea that fathers are the 'breadwinner' is changing. Of course, one could argue that this is solely a phenomenon of the upper-middle class, but the shift is good nonetheless.
