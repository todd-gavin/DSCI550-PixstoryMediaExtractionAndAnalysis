When we say goodbye after an intense adventure shared together, there is always a glimmer of hope that we will see each other again, sooner or later.

With Paul that is exactly what has happened. In 2016 our paths parted after four incredible years. Years in which a talented young French player went from making his First Team debut when still a teenager to scoring his first goal less than a month after making his bow. Years in which we learned to hold our breath in anticipation every time we saw him take aim from outside the box, because we knew how it could, and often did, end - with a roar of joy. To be precise, Paul scored 14 times from outside the penalty area in his four Serie A seasons, head to head with Miralem Pjanic at the top of that specific scoring chart. Years in which Pogba emerged as a world-class talent, winning trophy after trophy in the black and white stripes, and coming close to Champions League glory in 2015.

He set up 12 goals in his last season in Turin to leave with a tally of 34 goals scored and 32 assists provided, making him a direct participant in 66 goals overall.

Then we said goodbye, and in the meantime his talent and power came to the fore when as an integral part of his national side he contributed to France’s World Cup 2018 triumph.

Although we parted ways, we never really forgot about each other, and there is something ancestral in the call that after a thousand adventures eventually leads you back home.

Paul is back in Turin. He left as a boy and returns as a man and a champion, but there is one thing that has not changed - the desire to write unforgettable pages of club history together once more.

Pogba is back and we couldn’t be happier.
