I often believe that Zlatan Ibrahimovic never gets the sort of credit that he deserves for the type of player that he was (and is), largely because of how he played in an era which already had social media that exposed a global fanbase to other commodified superstars.

He was born into an era in which football positions had specific skillsets associated with them. A striker was supposed to score and anything else that a #9 did was never seen as a neccessary part of his approach. A stereotypical view of tall strikers had emerged which suggested that their off-the-ball work was non-existent and their technical ability was below par. Signing a tall striker meant that teams were looking for a limited forward, who could stick to scoring goals while strikers with a smaller height were seen as players who could do more apart from purely acting as the sole target man.

Ibrahimovic broke this stereotype and perhaps, the Ajax connection helped. It is only today that the stereotypes around tall strikers are starting to shed, with strikers like Gianluca Scamacca, Alexander Isak and even Sebastien Haller being examples of that. And it is barely a surprise that they always get compared to Ibrahimovic, who was perhaps a trend setter in the modern game.

The game has changed over time and tactical revolutions have meant that a lot of top teams (Liverpool and Man City being key examples) have played without pure strikers. Modern-day forwards, hence, have to be much more dynamic - despite their stature. Despite being 40 and above, Ibrahimovic still shows signs of being more than just a goalscorer.
