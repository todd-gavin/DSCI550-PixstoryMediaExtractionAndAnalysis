The notion of an International Day of Yoga was initially proposed by India's current Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on September 27, 2014.
In 2014, the United Nations adopted a draft resolution titled "Day of Yoga" in response to this initial request. India's delegation organized the consultations. The Reserve Bank of India released a 10-rupee commemorative coin to commemorate the International Day of Yoga in 2015. To commemorate the International Day of Yoga, the United Nations Postal Administration (UNPA) released ten stamps on Asanas on a single sheet in April 2017.
