Residents of the Big Apple were given a ray of hope last year. The club finished fourth in the Western Conference with a 41-31 record. Julius Randle was named the league's Most Improved Player, indicating that he is on his way to becoming a superstar. It was a happy time.

This season, all of those improvements were wiped out. The team did not qualify for the play-in tournament. Randle went backwards in time. Going into the offseason, the Knicks have more questions than answers.
