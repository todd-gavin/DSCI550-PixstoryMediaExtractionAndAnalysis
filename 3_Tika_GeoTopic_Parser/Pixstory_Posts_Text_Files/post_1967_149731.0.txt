In an extremely strange move, Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared on stage beside actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas at the NYC Global Citizen music festival to speak to concertgoers about climate legislation. Videos of the event show a significant number of people booing her, to the point where you can hardly hear her speak.Over on Twitter, the official Global Citizen page thanked Pelosi in a tweet saying, “Thank you, @SpeakerPelosi for recognizing Global Citizens all around the world who took action in support of the new, historic climate legislation in the US!” to which they predictably were mocked for failing to recognize the obvious attempt at shoving their political views down the throats of the concertgoers.While Global Citizen appears to be an action-based organization, I can’t help but ask whether it was truly appropriate to send a California representative on stage at a New York City concert while people were attempting to enjoy music and free themselves from the daily politics that they endure.
