With the hashtag mojcreatorsismissing, Moji India has sparked a new trend on Instagram called Moj Creator Missing. My elder sister got panicked when she saw the reel on a well-known Bollywood news website page, because I live in Mumbai. She asked me to come home early from now on since the city is unsafe. But after seeing a few comments and other videos similar to it, I was more disappointed than pissed to see how low social media has fallen. These so-called, creators, innovators and app developers have turned it into a platform for cutthroat commercialization. We were all screaming out the news outlets a few months ago for disseminating fake news and how Instagram is a rescue from all this fake news.
Apps like Moji are preying on people's emotions, particularly those who use Instagram or any other social networking app to pass the time because they have actual jobs to go to. Mojindia should not use something like this to promote their new features because it is a really callous manner of marketing.
I'm curious as to how Instagram has no bearing on this; it's lost its identity and has devolved into a marketing tool.
I believe that those like myself, who use Instagram solely to communicate with friends and share special moments with family and friends, should seek out another platform that does not bombard our heads with these types of marketing practises.
