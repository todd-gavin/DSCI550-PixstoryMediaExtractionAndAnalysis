MIT s new AI model can successfully detect Parkinson s disease A new artificial intelligence model developed by researchers at MIT shows great promise in detecting Parkinson s diesease from breathing patterns The model relies on data collected by a device that detects breathing patterns in a contactless manner using radio waves Neurological disorders are some of the leading sources of disability globally and Parkinson s disease is the fastest growing neurological disease in the world Parkinson s is difficult to diagnose as diagnosis primarily relies on the appearance of symptoms like tremors and slowness but these symptoms usually appear several years after the onset of the disease The researchers also believe that the work and technology could potentially be extended to detect other neurological diseases like Alzheimer s disease But more research and experimentation need to be done before reaching a firm conclusion on whether that is possible commented Katabi Read more on
