Today is the 74th death anniversary of Mohandas Gandhi, who led India to freedom and inspired generations of leaders, from Martin Luther King Jr to Nelson Mandela. After his assassination (by a Hindu fanatic) in 1948, following his wish, his ashes were dispersed over several rivers in India. Apparently, some of his remains reached the US too. A spiritual retreat in California has a little shrine, containing what it says to be Gandhi’s ashes. 

Swami Paramahansa Yogananda, well known spiritual leader and author of best-selling ‘Autobiography of a Yogi’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramahansa_Yogananda) established a ‘Gandhi World Peace Memorial’ in Lake Shrine, on the famed Sunset Boulevard near Hollywood, in 1950. It contains a stone sarcophagus which reportedly holds a brass and silver coffer containing Gandhi’s ashes, reports BBC: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60122629

His ashes, we are told, were divided into 20-odd portions. They were sent out across India in special trains; people gathered at railway stations to pay their last respects to “Mahatma”. Some portions, it seems, went abroad too. 

When one of Gandhi’s great-grandsons, Tushar Gandhi (who has also written a well-researched book Gandhi’s assassination), heard reports about Lake Shrine, he wrote to them but did not receive a response. His point is, “Holding them [ashes] goes against Bapu’s [as Gandhi was known across India] wishes as he had said that once he was no more, his ashes should not be kept, but disposed of.”

The retreat, however, has also got its founder’s wishes to respect. The report quotes one of the monks there as saying, “We will not overturn what our guru established.” The retreat maintains that the urn of ashes was received by Paramahansa Yogananda and it better be respected as such. The monk says the retreat is aware of the efforts by Gandhi’s descendents to have the ashes disposed – but they should instead make peace with the current arrangement. 

Meanwhile, there is no evidence if what the two parties are talking about are indeed Gandhi’s ashes. The monk only recalls watching a video of Paramahansa Yogananda placing it in the sarcophagus before it was encased.
