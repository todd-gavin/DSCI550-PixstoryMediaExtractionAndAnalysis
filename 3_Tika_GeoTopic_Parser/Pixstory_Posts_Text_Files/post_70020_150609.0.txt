Why is period blood sometimes brown?🤎
Towards the end of the periods the period blood is brown in colour, this is because our vagina has an acidic pH this means it's little bit like lemons🍋 
if you squeeze lemon on some blood it will become brown because the acid will digest the blood,🦠
the vagina does the same thing and towards the end our periods we have such little blood that the acidic pH of the vagina converts all of the blood and digests it and gives us Brown discharge of blood.🩸
Brown blood = less flow
The blood is so less that the acidity of the vagina is enough to digest it!
