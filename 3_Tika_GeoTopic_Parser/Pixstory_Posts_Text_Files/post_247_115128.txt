I can t tell you how many times I ve come across pastel themed romanticized Instagram posts with the words Recovery is not linear No matter how many times I ve read and forwarded this to friends over the past few years in different circumstances I ve always been hypocritical at internalizing it My GPA during my undergrad was the highest at a time when my mental distress was at its worst I figured that if my mind can handle repetitive intrusive thoughts that are still hard to process when I reflect then it can handle anything Although the thoughts are part of a past that s been resolved they made me fearful of the state of rest the consistent need for distraction means that rest is exhaustion From attempting to convert the hopelessness of gender dysphoria into something productive to using COVID fever as a high to keep writing I felt like I d mastered the art of dissociating the mind from everything that exhausts it almost as if I m beyond my physical realities But recent events have taught me that there are limits to the immediate translation of a source of distress into something productive that I m not beyond escaping the reality of physical health even if I convince myself as being part of a sci fi narrative There is something really jarring about having some strength for a few hours and being exhausted for no reason in the next But I m trying to understand that my body is and has been in distress too We did what we needed to do to survive with each other and I m trying to stop treating it as a separate part of me that doesn t deserve healing
