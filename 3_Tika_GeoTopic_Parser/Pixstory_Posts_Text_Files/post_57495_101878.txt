This is the cruel truth and I agree that abuse is a gendered issue irrespective of the idea that how men can also be the victims of abuse the statistics and records never defy the fact that women are more likely to be the victims Gender based violence is a global pandemic that affects in women in their lifetime The numbers are staggering and of women worldwide have experienced either physical or sexual intimate partner violence or non partner sexual violence Living with such eye opening statistics one cannot promote or incite any abuse against women that too using social media which sort of gives liberty to speak about reality And of course any case that has gained such public popularity should not foment the ideas that would harm the women who are the victims of abuse in any relationship Instead they would again silently suffer as these online mobs are not just targeting Heard at this point but instead they re inciting the misogynist ideologies Sexism at any point should not be tolerated It is necessary to understand that being a fan of a more loved or famous actor doesn t mean being blinded by the sight where one relentlessly supports such misogynist ideas
