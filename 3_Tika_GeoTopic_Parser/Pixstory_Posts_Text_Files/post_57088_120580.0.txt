Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people learn how to identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that negatively influence behaviour and emotions.

Cognitive behavioural therapy focuses on changing the automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen emotional difficulties, depression, and anxiety. These spontaneous negative thoughts have a detrimental influence on mood.

CBT can be a beneficial tool ― alone or in combination with other therapies ― in treating mental health disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or an eating disorder. But not everyone who benefits from CBT has a mental health condition. Nevertheless, CBT can be an effective tool to help anyone learn how to manage stressful life situations better.
