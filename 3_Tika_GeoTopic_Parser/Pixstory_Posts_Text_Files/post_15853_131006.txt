Abstract Inflammation is implicated in the development and progression of a variety of cardiovascular diseases CVDs We hypothesized that Dietary Inflammatory Index DII is associated with anthropometric indices and metabolic parameters in Iranian Atherosclerosis patients The present cross sectional study was conducted on Iranian Atherosclerosis Patients The DII was estimated using a valid and reliable item food frequency questionnaire FFQ Odds Ratios ORs and Confidence Intervals CIs were evaluated for anthropometric indices and metabolic parameters according to the DII score Linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between DII scores with atherosclerosis related dependent variables According to the continuous score of DII there was no significant association between DII and odds of obesity total cholesterol high density lipoprotein TC HDL c ratio and aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase AST ALT ratio in all models p In linear regression analysis we found a significant association between DII score and fasting blood sugar FBS lipid profile except for HDL c liver enzymes except for Alkaline phosphatase ALP and serum Sodium in adjusted models p lt In this study consuming a pro inflammatory diet in patients with atherosclerosis was positively associated with FBS lipid and liver enzymes measures Future studies with prospective and interventional designs are required to clarify the association between this dietary index and CVD risk factors among patients with atherosclerosis Sources
