Many corporations throughout the world utilise animals to test their products and some governments even prohibit the sale of products that have been tested on animals As Alison Ning writes they believe that items that have undergone animal testing are safer and more reliable Therefore animal testing should not be banned Some animals have DNA that is strikingly similar to that of humans As a result many animal treatments are also suitable for people Taylor Jeremy says that there are kinds of animal have likely DNA with human for instance the DNA similarity between chimpanzees and humans ranges from to also bonobos DNA and human similarity up to Therefore this proves that the accuracy of animal experiments is guaranteed Moreover animal trials rather than artificial organs or computer simulations can provide many benefits to humans because science and technology are not yet matured sufficiently We are equal to animals yet animal studies have the potential to benefit both humans and animals Animal experimentation will eventually be prohibited but given the current state of knowledge and technology this is still impossible
