The detention of Milan midfielder Tiemou Bakayoko mistaken for a Senegalese thug by the police continues to cause discussions In addition to the apologies from the police, compliments also arrived to the footballer defined as a model citizen for his behavior The footballer posted a video on Instagram where he reflects on what happened The Milanese authorities have declared that it was a mistake that they only realized the thing at the moment Human error I have no problem from this point of view but the way and method used were a problem for me I think we have gone further In addition to criticizing the methods Bakayoko asks a question Why they didn&#39;t do a proper check simply by asking me for the vehicle documents In the video posted on social networks we do not see everything This is the calmest part of what happened I had a gun at a meter away from me on the passenger side window They clearly put our lives in danger
