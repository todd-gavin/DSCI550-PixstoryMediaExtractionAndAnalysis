New England is the United States' oldest clearly defined region, having been settled more than 150 years prior to the American Revolution. Plymouth Colony, the first English settlement in New England, was founded in 1620 by Puritan Pilgrims fleeing religious persecution in England; a French colony on Saint Croix Island, Maine, had failed in 1604. After Jamestown, Plymouth was the second English settlement in America. During the Puritan migration to New England (1620â€“1640), a massive inflow of Puritans occupied the wider region, namely in the Boston and Salem areas. Whaling and marine trading thrived, as did farming, fishing, and forestry. 

New England writers and events aided in the start and continuation of the American War of Independence, which began when fighting broke out between British and American forces.

By the 1840s, New England had become the epicentre of the anti-slavery campaign in the United States, as well as the dominant force in American literature and higher education. By 1830, it had become the epicentre of the American Industrial Revolution, with numerous textile mills and machine shops in operation. For much of the nineteenth century, the region served as the nation's manufacturing core, and it was a zealous intellectual, political, and cultural proponent of abolitionism and civil rights during and after the American Civil War. 

During the twentieth century, manufacturing in the United States began to relocate south and west, and New England endured a long period of economic decline and de-industrialization. However, at the turn of the century, the environment had changed dramatically.
