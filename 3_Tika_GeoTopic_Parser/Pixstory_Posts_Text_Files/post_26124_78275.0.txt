The level of pollution in our cities today has overcasted such kind of a beautiful view which is hard to see these days but it is such an overwhelming view. I remember going to the top of a hill to see such a view when i went to Nepal. I am far from hills but lucky enough that a friend of mine got it clicked for me!
