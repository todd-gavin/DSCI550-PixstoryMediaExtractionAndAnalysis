The Winter Olympics at Beijing are getting more and more exciting day by day. This time, the womenâ€™s hockey team may bring a new laurel with them. On the other hand, Canada has earned its shot at Olympic women's hockey redemption.

CBC reported that the Canadians beat Switzerland 10-3 on Monday in Beijing while the United States defeated Finland 4-1 in the other semifinal to set up a sixth gold-medal showdown on Wednesday at 11 p.m. ET.

The latest victory continued Canada's unbeaten run in this tournament, having outscored opponents 54-8. But none of that overwhelming success will matter much if it is forced to settle for silver.

Coming to the history of this face off, the odds are in the favour of Canadian team. Since women's hockey made its 1998 Olympic debut in Nagano, Japan, the cross-border rivals have played for the championship in every Winter Games tournament but the 2006 Turin Games, when Canada defeated Sweden after the Swedes eliminated the U.S. in the semifinals.

This time, the Americans are attempting to defend their title following a 3-2 shootout win at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, which ended Canada's Olympic run of four championships.

Four-time Olympian Rebecca Johnston has her eyes on the goal. She said that the job isn't done just yet. 

In an interview, she said "We worked all year for this, we worked so hard, so we're going to be ready to go in that final game and really give it our all," she said.
"That gold medal is definitely on our mind."

Canada is considered the favourite in Beijing with a 6-0 record, including a 4-2 win over the U.S. in the preliminary round finale last week.
