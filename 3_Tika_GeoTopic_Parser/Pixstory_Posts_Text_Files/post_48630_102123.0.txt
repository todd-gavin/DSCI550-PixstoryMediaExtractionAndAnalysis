I personally don't enjoy it because country music has that twangy, fingernails scratching over the chalkboard feel. It's a disaster. I might sound like a hater but it's sad songs about a wrecked pickup vehicle, a shattered fence, and your girl leaving you. Country music appears to be about God and Country, which is not wrong in itself, but do country singers need to quit sounding like preachers!

Country music ends up being too irritating for my liking. It has nothing to do with the class of people who sing it, enjoy it or write it. It's just the same themes over and over again. Some of them can be good, I'm not saying all of them are bad but if I have the option to not listen to it, I'll always choose that. I'm more of a metal rock guy.

About the claim that people who hate it are classist, it's just bizarre. It's about choice. Everyone likes or hates some sort of music, it's not that big of a deal.
