Cystic fibrosis is a rare genetic disease caused by numerous mutations in the CFTR gene which codes for a membrane protein with a chloride channel function called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR protein A new entirely Italian study published in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences has revealed a possible alternative therapy for cystic fibrosis involving two drugs already in clinical use for other diseases a protein inhibitor camostat a coenzyme S adenosil methionine and a food substance turmeric extract These substances are capable of inducing biochemical changes and epigenetic heritable changes in gene expression that do not alter the DNA sequence in the epithelial ENaC sodium channel that interacts with the CFTR protein in determining the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis The research resulting from the collaboration of Sapienza with the University of Foggia and the University of Bari was coordinated by Marco Lucarelli of the Department of Experimental Medicine of Sapienza University by Fiorentina Ascenzioni of the Department of Biology and Biotechnology Charles Darwin of Sapienza University and by Massimo Conese of the University of Foggia Although precision therapy for cystic fibrosis acting on the CFTR protein is now possible even if only for some mutations the proposed therapeutic approach which instead acts on the ENaC channel could be performed explains Marco Lucarelli at the same time as the precision therapy in order to enhance its effect or as an alternative to it in cases where it is not possible to act effectively on the main defect of the CFTR Furthermore, the therapeutic substances proposed in this study, two drugs already in clinical use for other pathologies and a food substance are more easily usable in clinics than experimental substances with safety studies not yet carried out Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms involved in cystic fibrosis concludes Marco Lucarelli paves the way for new possibilities of treatment of this pathology in which epigenetics itself could be considered a therapeutic target
