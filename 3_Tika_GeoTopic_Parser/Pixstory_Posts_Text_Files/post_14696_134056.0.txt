👉Take mustard oil in a small bowl. Quantity 20–30 gm.
👉Pour Earbuds into the oil.
👉Apply it in your ear rotating round and round. 
👉Do the same for both the ear. (If you put oil directly, you may end up putting a large quantity which will spill off from the ear and also you can do both the ear on the same day). So it's better to use earbuds.
👉Next morning when you wake up, use clean earbuds to extract softened ear wax which will be painless for you to extract.
