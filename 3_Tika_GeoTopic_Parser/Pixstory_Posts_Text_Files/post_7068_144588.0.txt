Queen Elizabeth II on postal stamps - HMS Glasgow error - a stamp sold for £30,555
The HMS Glasgow error is a 6d postage stamp error produced by the Falkland Islands in 1964. It commemorates the 50th anniversary of the 1914 Battle of the Falkland Islands.
The design error featured the incorrect ship, HMS Glasgow, instead of HMS Kent, which should have been used. Apparently one sheet was sent to a stamp dealer in the United States who did not notice the mistake. It is believed that only the one sheet of 60 stamps was produced; only 17 stamps have been recorded.
A single stamp from the collection of Sir Gawaine Baillie was sold in 2004 for £24,000, and another example was sold in May 2005 for CHF 29,000. More recently, a marginal examplesold in December 2006 for £30,555.
