There’s a lot of controversy today among black women regarding the untimely death of Kevin Samuels. Some would argue that he went out of his way to dehumanize and degrade black women. Others would say that his delivery was lacking, but he “kept it real” 

In either case, a man has died. A mother has lost her son. A family has lost a loved one. 

The hatred being shown on many social media platforms today is very real. An unfortunate occurrence has unveiled a new level of distain for someone many of us have never held a conversation with. A social media figure. Many are not willing to turn the other cheek - even in death. 

The world needs more peace and less hate. Especially in death.
