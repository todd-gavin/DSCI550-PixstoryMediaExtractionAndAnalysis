Important victory with a view to qualifying for the Champions League for Juventus, winners at Cagliari The black and whites sweated the proverbial seven shirts ending up behind just after a goal by Joao Pedro A quarter of an hour later the Var canceled the momentary goal equalizer scored by Pellegrini but just before the interval the equalizer came thanks to a goal by Matthijs De Ligt headed in by Cuadrado&#39;s cross The winning goal was instead scored by Dusan Vlahovic at Juventus thus rises to points quota, temporarily moving to fifth place over Roma Cagliari, on the other hand, nailed to just points above the relegation zone
