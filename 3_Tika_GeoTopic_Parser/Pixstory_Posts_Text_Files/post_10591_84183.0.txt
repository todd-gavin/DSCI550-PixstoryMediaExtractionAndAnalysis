Seema Antil won the women’s Discus Throw with a best effort of 54.93m and Mahipal Singh’s opening throw of 54.80m in the men’s Hammer Throw was good to assure him the gold. 

 Shot putters Abha Khatua, who gave up Heptathlon to focus on one event, and Tajinderpal Singh Toor grabbed the spotlight in the inaugural National Open Throws Competition 2022 at the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports complex here on Sunday. 

The 26-year-old Abha Khatua became only the third Indian woman Shot Putter to breach the 17m mark when she claimed gold with a 17.09m effort. The Bengal-born joined two Manpreet Kaurs, separated by a six-year age gap, in the 17m Club. More significantly, she went past the Asian Games qualifying standard laid down by the Athletics Federation of India. 

Manpreet Kaur, the National record holder who has gone past the 17m mark in 10 competitions between 2015 and 2017, finished second on Sunday with 16.74m. The 31-year-old produced her best effort since return last year. 

Tajinderpal Singh Toor, 27, opened the Asian Games year with a winning effort of 19.94m to expectedly claim gold. Each of his three valid attempts saw would have won him the title on Sunday when Karanveer Singh’s best was 19.17m. Tajinderpal Singh Toor will have reasons to be happy with his early season form.
