Avril Lavigne received her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Aug. 31. Her first visit to the famed boulevard coincided with a major moment in her life. She was 16 years old and working on what would become her debut album, "Let Go" Lavigne: "It's a bit of a full-circle moment for me because this is where I made my album".
Lavigne is all smiles in the photo, lying on the ground with her arm stretched across what appears to be Tom Cruise’s star. Her ambition and wide-eyed excitement, not knowing what lay ahead, shines through even 20 years later — and without her signature smokey eye, Lavigne looks like any other teenager in the early 2000s.
Lavigne's debut album, "Let Go," celebrated its 20th anniversary this year. In March 2002, she released her debut single "Complicated". Less than a year later, the song became the best-selling single by a female Canadian singer. From her clothes (skater-chic) to her persona (unapologetically badass), Lavigne presents herself as an outsider.
With features from Kelly, Blackbear and Blink-182's Mark Hoppus, the 12-track album presents a fully formed, completely confident Lavigne at the top of her game. Lavigne gives her advice for younger women in the industry: "You have to be really strong, because it's hard". Cheryl Lavigne is working on a movie based on her hit "Sk8er Boi" She also wants to revamp her clothing line, Abbey Dawn. But what makes her light up most is the possibility of starting her own cooking show. "I'm good at everything and I can make anything," Lavigne says with a laugh.
