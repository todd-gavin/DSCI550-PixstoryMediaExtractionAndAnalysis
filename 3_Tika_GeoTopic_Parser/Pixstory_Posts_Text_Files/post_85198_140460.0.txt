Real Madrid vs Mallorca Match Prediction
Real Madrid are currently the table toppers of La Liga 2022/23 and they picked up right fromwhere they left the league last season. They have been sensational so far in the first fourmatches they have played and there is no reason to think that they won't be able to repeat itagainst Mallorca as well. The Los Blancos have won every match they have played in this season so far and we expect them continue their streak against Mallorca as well.
Mallorca on the other hand are placed on the 11th position of the league table with 5 points in 4matches and it does not look like they will give Madrid a strict competition. We thus predict that Real Madrid will win the match one sidedly.
