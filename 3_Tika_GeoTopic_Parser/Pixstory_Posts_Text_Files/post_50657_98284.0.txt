According to a draught of a document that appears to demonstrate the Supreme Court has chosen to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision, which legalised abortion across the country, tens of millions of women in America are on the verge of losing access to abortion. 

Such a move would be a complete reversal of decades of precedent, thereby isolating the US from the rest of the industrialised world in terms of reproductive rights. 

However, Australia is also not all innocent! As CNN points out, Australia's laws have been among the most similar to those of the United States among comparable democracies. Access to abortion varies by state and territory in Australia, as it does in the United States, and certain regions had criminalised the operation until recently. 

However, whereas certain states in the United States have increasingly tightened their abortion regulations, Australia has taken the opposite path. Both Queensland and New South Wales have decriminalised the operation since 2018, allowing abortion up to 22 weeks in both states. This year, South Australia became the last state to decriminalise abortion.

Women reproductive rights are human rights and no woman should be forced to carry a baby against her wishes, neither in USA nor in Australia.
