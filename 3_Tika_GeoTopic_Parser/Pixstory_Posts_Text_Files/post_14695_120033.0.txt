When administered in a reputed expert clinic, Panchakarma therapy can be a lifesaving procedure. 
Although most commonly regarded as a detox treatment, offering much greater health benefits as is evident from research.

In fact, Panchakarma therapy is known to offer benefits for patients suffering from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, stress disorders and other lifestyle diseases.

While patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or heart disease need to be particularly cautious and should constantly monitor their health during monsoon, the season can also pose health risks to people who are otherwise healthy. 

Simple solutions include lifestyle change and preparing yourself to combat water borne diseases.

 Following Ayurvedic dietary and lifestyle practices for monsoon can help to strengthen immunity, preserve the optimal balance of Doshas and lower the risk of illness in the long run.
