Following the successful launch of Axiom Trip 1 (Ax-1), the first all-private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, four private astronauts are now in orbit. The Axiom Space astronauts launched from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 11:17 a.m. EDT on Friday, April 8. 

NASA TV reported that the Dragon Endeavour spacecraft, which was carrying Ax-1 crew members Michael López-Alegra, Larry Connor, Mark Pathy, and Eytan Stibbe, was launched into orbit by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. On the space station, the crew will spend more than a week conducting scientific research, outreach, and commercial activities.

“What a historic launch! Thank you to the dedicated teams at NASA who have worked tirelessly to make this mission a reality,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. “NASA’s partnership with industry through the commercial cargo and crew programs has led our nation to this new era in human spaceflight — one with limitless potential. Congratulations to Axiom, SpaceX, and the Axiom-1 crew for making this first private mission to the International Space Station a reality.”

NASA will broadcast live coverage of the Endeavour docking, hatch opening, and welcome ceremony beginning at 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 9. NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency's website will broadcast the events.
