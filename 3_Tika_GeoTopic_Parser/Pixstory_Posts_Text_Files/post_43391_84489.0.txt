"6th September, 2018" - A day, when not only a million lives of LGBTQ+ were changed but also it made a huge impact on the country. In this landmark Judgement the Supreme Court finally struck down this 19th century law criminalising homosexuality in India- The Section 377.

Even if this section was scraped out and declared as unconstitutional, India do not recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions. India doesn't even have unified marriage law. The law basically has heteronormative structure. 

Not acknowledging same-sex marriage doesn't make sense after scraping out Section 377 though it was a big step in normalizing a normal thing in our country. Isn't it?
