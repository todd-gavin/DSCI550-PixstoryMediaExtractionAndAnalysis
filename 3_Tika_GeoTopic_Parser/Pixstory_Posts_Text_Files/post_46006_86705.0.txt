The 2020 census was planned well ahead of time to ensure that Native Americans living on reservations were enumerated more correctly than they were in 2010, when nearly 5% of the population was overlooked. 

It is reported that COVID-19, politics, and an ever-changing deadline that shortened the decennial census were not part of the plan. 

Instead of canvassing neighbourhoods and setting up booths at large events like the Gathering of Nations in New Mexico, advocates resorted to phone banking, dropping off promotional materials at closed-to-the-public tribal lands, and bribing people to fill out census forms with flour and potatoes at roadside stands. 

Despite a well-funded effort, Native Americans anticipate to be undercounted on the approximately 300 reservations across the United States. When the Census Bureau releases two reports assessing the national count based on race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age on Thursday, they'll find out how well the bureau believes it did in counting every U.S. resident during the 2020 census. 

"At the end of the day, when you have your entire religious calendar that has been terminated, when you're looking at How can I support this massive health risk in my community," said Ahtza Chavez, executive director of NAVA Education Project, which headed the New Mexico Native Census Coalition.

According to the 2020 census, there are now 9.7 million persons who identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, either alone or in conjunction with another race, up from 5.2 million in 2010. 

Because the census allows people to self-identify, the statistics don't match up with the tribes' own enrollment counts. Tribes have more stringent enrollment requirements, which may entail determining one's ancestry percentage or tracing genealogy to a list of names.
