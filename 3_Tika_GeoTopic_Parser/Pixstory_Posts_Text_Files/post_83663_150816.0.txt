You : I already did apologize. I said that I'm sorry that you feel that way. 
Her : I'm sorry that you feel that way isn't an actual apology.
You : I don't know what you're speaking about. I'm sorry that you feel that way is an apology. 
Her : I'm sorry that you feel that way is a subtle way to not take ownership and responsibility for your part that has created this conflict. It leaves room for you to just justify what you did without validating my experience and my emotions. 
You : You know what you're right, I do apologize for my behavior and your feelings, your experience is valid, and it matters. And I don't want to fight. I want to feel connected again. So what is it that you need right now for us to feel connected?
This, my friends, is the proper way to apologise.
