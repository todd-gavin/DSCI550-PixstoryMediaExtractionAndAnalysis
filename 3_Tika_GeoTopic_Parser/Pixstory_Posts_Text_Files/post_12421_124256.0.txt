"Diagnosing yourself from the information
in a 60-second Instagram video may
feel easier than speaking to a GP or paying for therapy, but it can be an incredibly slippery slope"

The explosion in mental health content on
social media is great to see - but is the lack of nuance encouraging too many people to self-diagnose? Stylist investigates.

"In the age of peak self-awareness, social media content about mental health and emotional wellbeing is dominating our feeds more than ever before. On Instagram alone, the hashtag #MentalHealth has over 40 million posts, and on TikTok, there are thousands of videos covering everything from ADHD to burnout. And while these kinds of posts
have been around for a while, the last couple of years have seen an explosion in "signs of' posts and explainer videos, thanks largely due to the rise in demand for wellbeing content triggered by the pandemic and subsequent
lockdowns.

In some ways, this is a good thing - talking about our mental health and sharing tips on how to cope is a great way to raise awareness - but it can also have its downsides, too.
