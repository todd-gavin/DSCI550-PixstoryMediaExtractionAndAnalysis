The images show some close ups of characters that resemble Jake Sully and Neytiri as well as what looks like a pregnant Na vi Neytiri with a squad of Na vi looking like they are headed into battle The images look pretty good with cool lighting and shadows though you can get similar ray traced effects in many games these days Of course we still haven t gotten a decent look at how the underwater effects look the one leaked image doesn t count so let s hope to be surprised
