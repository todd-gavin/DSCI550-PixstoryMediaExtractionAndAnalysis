From Willow tossing spaghetti into a bathtub to Lady Camden living her ballerina fairytale – who will prance in a crown and sceptre this season finale?

Let’s take a look at our queens, summarized in their own words:

👑 Angeria Paris VanMichaels: The most glamorous ‘country bumpkin’ that you will ever meet. Loud, country and polished – sparkling like a star everywhere she goes. Grew up in the church and sang in the choir. An old-school pageant queen, Angie will “ballad you to death.” She’s won two maxi challenges, and one mini challenge. She’s been in the bottom twice.

👑 Bosco: Named after her deceased family dog, the Burlesque Bosco brings all of Seattle’s grunge, seasonal-affective-disorder dark humor with her: ""Out of drag I look like a piece of string cheese" Bosco has won 3 maxi challenges, 3 mini challenges, and has been in the bottom twice.

👑 Lady Camden: America’s spice girl ballerina living her 90s pop princess fantasy from Camden town in North London - “[I named myself] Lady Camden because sometimes I like to- you know, be regal, refined, from the ballet world and then sometimes I'm just trash from Camden." Camden has won 3 maxi challenges, 1 mini challenge, and been in the bottom once.

👑 Willow Pill: Willow’s name comes from her Cystinosis, that requires frequent blood draws and medication, and from Buffy the Vampire Slayer character -“I'm an adorably twisted little doll" with a different story behind every look and a sense of humor that comes from darkness. Willow has won one maxi challenge, one mini challenge, and has been in the bottom twice.

👑 Daya Betty: Inspired by the 80’s grunge movement, starting off as a knock-off Crystal Methyd: ‘Daya’s a rockstar and the rockstar’s girlfriend.’ The queen loves filtering her offensive remmarks by starting each sentence with “No Offense”. Daya has won 1 maxi challenge, 1 mini challenge, and has been in the bottom three times.
