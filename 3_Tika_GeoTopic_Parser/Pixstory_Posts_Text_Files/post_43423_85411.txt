The terms sex and sexuality carry a lot of stigmas and taboo and are considered culturally sensitive areas in our society which leads to a practice of long silences among family members whenever such topics come up or when a condom advertisement starts playing out loud on TV in the living room all of us can relate to this one While the compulsory program includes a provision fitness and physical education the focus is on physical activity and health checks rather than sex and sexuality Even if there are certain attempts to initiate discussions they do not cross the line of menstrual hygiene and the girls are separated from the boys to even talk about such biological processes as was the case in my school One of the driving forces behind this is the orthodox belief that Sex Education might corrupt the younger generation We re not saying that providing sex education will solve major issues like rape or sexual harassments but It can still help with a lot of issues that are present in the society It can help prevent unintended pregnancy cases and also sensitize boys towards gender and consent in our patriarchal society paving the way for a safer environment for women
