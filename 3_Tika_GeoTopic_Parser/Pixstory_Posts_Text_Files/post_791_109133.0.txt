I disagree with this. Making women travel free is a great move and gender sensitive transport initiatives are important to improve equity in mobility. 

There is enough evidence today to show how lack of safe, affordable and accessible public transport systems can make women more vulnerable to crime and compromise their options of accessing jobs, education and health care. Sustaining this change with a longer term fiscal strategy is therefore important. 

At the same time the decline in revenue through bus tickets, which is the primary source of income for the DTC, has burnt a hole in the transporter’s pocket.

Data shared by the corporation in the Delhi Assembly on Thursday and Friday showed that DTC has been running into losses of over ₹1,000 crore annually since 2015, even as it has been unable to add even a single new bus to its existing fleet.
Then public transport is not meant for making profit alone and it needs to serve a social cause
