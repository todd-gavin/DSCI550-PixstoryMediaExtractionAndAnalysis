The Indian team finished 9 at the recently concluded Women's Hockey World Cup held in the Netherlands and Spain. India started the tournament with a coupon of draws against England and China before losing to New Zealand in their final league game. 


In the cross over match against Spain, India lost to the hosts, 1-0, as Spain scored in the dying minutes of the match. India then won two games to finish 9th at the WC. 


The WC was a case of missed opportunities for the Indian team. There were a lot of expectations from the team as they had finished 4th at the Olympics and were 3rd in the FIH Pro League. 


They played an attacking brand of hockey throughout the tournament as was evident from the fact that they were able to secure 43 penalty corners in 6 matches. But they converted just 5 of those.


Indian forward Vandana Katariya did convert a couple of brilliant field goals but in the absence of regular skipper Rani Rampal the team struggled to find the right attacking template. 


Challengers Indian Team might face in the Commonwealth Games 


The Indian team would hope to work on these aspects before they play their first game in the upcoming Commonwealth Games as the 2002-gold medalists would be looking for a podium finish. Goalkeeper Savita Punia will lead the Indian Women’s Hockey team, while Deep Grace Ekka will serve as her deputy.
