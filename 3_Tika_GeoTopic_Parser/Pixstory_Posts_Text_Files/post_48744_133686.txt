Men are taught to externalize their issues women are taught to internalize it Patriarchy affects women s mental health in a number of ways the most significant of which is the way it constructs and legitimizes masculine dominance This is done through a number of mechanisms including the way that gender roles are enforced and the way that men and women are socialized to think and behave in certain ways One example of how gender roles can lead to mental health problems is when women are expected to be calm rational and peaceful in order to preserve their reputation and social standing When these expectations are not met it can create feelings of frustration guilt and anxiety In addition when women don t conform to traditional feminine norms they may experience discrimination or even violence from men This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness which can have a negative impact on mental health Patriarchal societies place a heavy burden on women to fulfill traditional roles such as being responsible for raising children and performing household tasks This leaves little time for them to focus on their own mental health Women are often socialized to suppress their emotions and be obedient to men This makes it hard for them to express themselves freely and trust other people which can lead to depression and other mental health problems Patriarchy restricts women s access to education employment social services etc which means that they have less opportunity to develop their full potential mentally and emotionally Patriarchy has a significant impact on the mental health of women worldwide It dictates the way that they think about themselves and their place in society as well as their relationships with other people Like I said above it also limits their access to education and employment opportunities as well as their ability to live freely and without fear If you re someone who cares about feminism or human rights then it s important that you understand how patriarchy affects women s mental health in order to make meaningful change happen
