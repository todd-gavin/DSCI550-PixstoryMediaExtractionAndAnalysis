Metal and finger to wear Diamond/White sapphire for astrological benefits

The metal in which the gemstone is set is an important factor to get good results for the gemstone. This seat is like the throne of the planetary lord whose gemstone is being worn.

Venus is a very versatile planet and Venus gemstones are all about style plus effectiveness. The diamond/white sapphire can be worn in silver, white gold, 22 K gold, 18K gold and even 14K gold. It can be worn in the ring finger or middle finger as per the advice of the astrologer.

The diamond/white sapphire can also be worn in the neck as pendant touching the thymus gland area (just above the first rib bone). The chain of the pendant can be of gold or silver. Adjust the chain according to your height so that the gemstone touches the thymus gland area.
