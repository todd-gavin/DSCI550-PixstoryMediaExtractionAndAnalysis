The 2022 NBA trade deadline is just a couple weeks away on Feb. 10, and between now and then there will be no shortage of rumors circulating as every team in the league surveys their options for the rest of the season. Some squads may be looking to add that difference-maker as the playoffs near, while others may be looking to sell off players in hopes of rebuilding and heightening their draft night odds later this year. 

Already we've seen the Atlanta Hawks potentially gearing up for a bigger move, as they traded young guard Cam Reddish, Solomon Hill and a 2025 second-round pick to the New York Knicks in exchange for Kevin Knox II and a 2022 first-round pick. But all of the action is building to the deadline, so until then here's all the latest rumors circulating around the league.

The trade deadline is a bit more than two weeks away, and Ben Simmons remains with the 76ers. He might also be on Philly's roster after Feb. 10 as well. The 76ers are not satisfied with who's currently available on the trade market and prefer to wait until the offseason to chase a bigger prize, per The Athletic's Shams Charania and Sam Amick, and confirmed by CBS Sports' Bill Reiter.

Although Damian Lillard, Bradley Beal and Jaylen Brown remain on the Sixers' radar, they are reportedly retaining some optimism that it can finally land James Harden, who's currently a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Being able to land Harden, however, would be complicated.
