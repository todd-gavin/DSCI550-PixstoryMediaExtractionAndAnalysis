I used to think that if I put on enough muscle and lost enough fat I would happy content and satisfied but the truth is that I am happy but I am definitely not content and satisfied I am constantly looking to improve and to be better than i was yesterday That s one of the most surprising benefits that came through fitness And one of my favourite benefits because that mindset shift to always look for ways to improve every single day Regardless nbsp if you have already made it to a level that you used to look up to speaks volumes not just with your health and fitness goals but with every area of your life and it s awesome
