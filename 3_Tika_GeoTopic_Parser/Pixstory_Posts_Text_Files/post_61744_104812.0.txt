Religion has different interpretations? I don’t think there should be different interpretations when it comes to sexual assaults. 

While the Old Testament says in Deuteronomy 22:28–29, that if a man violates a virgin & rapes her, he shall pay her father fifty coins & must marry the young woman. Old testament literally objectifies and treats women as second class citizens, while the American Christians hide behind the veil of “Different Interpretations”. 

Passage 31 of the same chapter condone the Isaraelites to take female captives from the nations they have conquered. Not only does the bible promote colonization, and objectification, if passage 31 is to be believed, it also promotes captivity which in simpler terms is known as Slavery. 

Book of Leviticus says that homosexuality is a sin, which is punishable by death, due to the fault of their own. It also bans tattoos, pork and shellfish, and also offers the rules for selling a slave. 

Now how much of the Bible should we chalk upto “Different Interpretations”, as the instances listed above are responsible for one of the worst tragedies in the history of world, in the form of slavery which lasted for about 400 years. 

“Different Interpretations” of Bible has lead to countless deaths of Homosexuals, and they are still denied equal rights, they are still treated as second class citizens. 

All of these atrocities, coz American Christians were following their religion and had “Different Interpretations” to it.
