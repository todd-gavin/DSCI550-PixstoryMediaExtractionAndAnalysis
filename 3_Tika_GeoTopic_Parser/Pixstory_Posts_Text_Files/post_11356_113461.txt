For a very long time people have believed that when walking and a task are combined both suffer This isn t always the case according to study results from the University of Rochester s Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience Some young healthy individuals improve cognitive function while walking by changing the use of neural resources This does not suggest however that you should start a hard task while exercising off the cake from the previous night There was no predictor of who would fall into which category before we tested them we initially thought that everyone would respond similarly said Eleni Patelaki a biomedical engineering Ph D student at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in the Frederick J and Marion A Schindler Cognitive Neurophysiology Laboratory and first author of the study recently published in Cerebral Cortex It was surprising that for some of the subjects it was easier for them to do dual tasking do more than one task compared to single tasking doing each task separately This was interesting and unexpected because most studies in the field show that the more tasks that we have to do concurrently the lower our performance gets Improving means changes in the brain healthy adults between the ages of and were asked to view a series of images while either sitting in a chair or walking on a treadmill Researchers used the Mobile Brain Body Imaging system or MoBI to track the brain activity kinematics and behavior of the participants When a picture changed participants were prompted to press a button Participants were told not to click if the same picture appeared back to back Each participant s performance on this activity while seated was regarded as their unique behavioral baseline Researchers discovered that when walking was added to doing the same task various behaviors occurred with some individuals performing worse than their baseline when sitting as predicted based on prior research but others improved relative to their baseline Sources
