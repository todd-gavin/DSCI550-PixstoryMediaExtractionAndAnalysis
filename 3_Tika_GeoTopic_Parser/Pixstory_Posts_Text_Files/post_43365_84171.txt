Sun sets are the language of the soul The way the sky plays with its colour pallets and brings to life every admirer who is watching it is just mystical From hues of pink to bright red the flirtatious dance of the sun with the moon is a sight to behold So do me a favour today Sit back relax and watch the sun set with a cup of tea in your hand Or coffee if you prefer it
