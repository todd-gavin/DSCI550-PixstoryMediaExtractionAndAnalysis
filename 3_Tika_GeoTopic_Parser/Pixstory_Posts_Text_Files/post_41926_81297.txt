The hated and beloved sitcom How I Met Your Mother has been revived eight years after its last episode in with a new episode sequel titled with a groundbreakingly imaginative name How I Met Your Father Like with all comfort shows cue the stream of overwhelming love from die hard fans the indifference of those who couldn t care enough but still wish to express how much they don t care those who would hope for all traces to bury themselves in the archaicity of stereotypes they believe the show perpetuates Nobody watched How I Met Your Mother for its protagonist Ted Josh Radnor They tuned in for Neil Patrick Harris Barney the quippy playboy or for the way that Jason Segel s Marshall and Alyson Hannigan s Lily doted on one another Ted was a drip A bummer He complained about not being able to find love Worse still he seemed to feel entitled to a partner yet somehow a whiny Ted like character has still snuck his way into this new ensemble Eliana Dockterman writes in Time We can endlessly discuss the repeated tropes of cisgender men being wounded about their masculinity in face of rejection and criticize the distasteful baiting that comes with it But that s far too simple What s with our obsession with characters like Barney His predatory behaviour has been described as bordering on sexual assault He objectifies women in an attempt to boast superiority The list goes on with all characters reproducing toxic masculinity The four minute episodes made available for review sprinkle in the likes of Tinder Uber and the ghosts of viral videos past but it s a mechanical stale simulacrum of friend hangs and dating in a relic of a bygone era that enters the sitcom uncanny valley There s not much reason to continue through unless the beats recalled some past time of curling up with the TV Adrian Horton writes in the Guardian Why do we love curling up to shows centering toxic masculinity
