Emma by Jane Austen
Emma is well known book written by Jane Austen, published in 1816. I'm not a consistent reader, but when my friend borrowed this book from college library, I read it fortuitously and developed an interest. Soon my interest faded, I personally found it a little dry, but I wanna know the story, so I searched andÂ  came to know that a movie had published based on "Emma". Many of you may know about the Netflix movie. As everyone knows a book will never be an equivalent to a movie, a book is always steps higher, and it is similar in the movie Emma too. I liked the movie, it portrayed the story in a decent manner in two hours and got a clear idea from it. I always prefer movies over books. So if anybody is interested in Emma and found it difficult to read, try the movie. As I said it's not equal to the book, so if you need complete satisfaction, it will be better to go with the book. 
NB: I'm one of the reader who failed to succumb Emma's charm despite her superior airs and egotism.
