When it comes to sports CRICKET has different priority in India. It's not just a game but an emotion for Indians. 
Every win of the country is celebrated as a festival here
From 6-60 be it any age group, enthusiasm while watching match will be at same level. 
It may not be a national game, but it is, one of the most watched game in our country
For me this game acts as a stress relief
Be it watching or playing CRICKET IS LOVE‚ù§
