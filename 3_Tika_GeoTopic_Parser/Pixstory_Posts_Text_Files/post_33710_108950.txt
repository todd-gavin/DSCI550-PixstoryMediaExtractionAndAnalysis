After sixteen seasons Marcelo&#39;s official farewell to Real Madrid arrived at the press conference All I achieved was thanks to my grandfather He was the first to bet on me always leaving me free to choose Leaving the club of your hard life but I&#39;m not afraid of the future I did everything I had to do The story has already been written In this season I played little or nothing I often got pissed at Ancelotti but the next day we gave each other hugs and kisses He always made me feel useful I had a weight and a responsibility I didn&#39;t think about the I&#39;m retiring because I know I can continue to play It won&#39;t be a problem for me to face Real I&#39;m a professional but I&#39;ll always be a Madrid fan I told my family that I won the Champions League by playing in it The last one I heard the most I&#39;ve been talking for minutes with Rodrygo on the bench He was scared I did something I had never experienced in other finals Scoring and making an assist are beautiful things but talking to the boys hugging two minutes from the end this is what I want to leave
