There's no shortage of mindfulness and meditation apps these days, promising to help you combat anxiety, sleep better, hone your focus, and more. There are various apps which are available free of charge.

Here's a few of them, to help you on your meditation jouney: -
1.) Insight Timer
Insight Timer has a huge library of content: over 80,000 free guided meditations from over 10,000 teachers on topics like stress, relationships, healing, sleep, creativity, and more. You can even sign up to Circle for Teams, one of their newer offerings, which allows you to create circles (groups) to meditate in real-time with friends or colleagues.

2.) Smiling Mind: -

Smiling Mind hits the sweet spot for a free mindfulness app in so many ways.

The not-for-profit app features hundreds of meditations, enough to keep you engaged without overwhelming you with choice. Most meditations are in the five- to fifteen-minute range, with a few practices up to 45 minutes for advanced meditators.

3. My Life Meditation
If other apps expect you to dive right in, MyLife  wants to create a more deliberate, intentional experience. A section called Learn to Meditate explains what mindfulness is and why it’s beneficial, including some of the neuroscience and physiology behind it.

4.) Healthy Minds Program
The Healthy Minds Program app wants to help you develop the skills for a healthy mind—by strengthening mental focus, decreasing stress, and growing resilience, compassion, and better immune health.

The app offers a collection of 27 meditations outside their four-pillar wellness framework, including one-minute Micro Practices for when you’re in need of a brief respite.
