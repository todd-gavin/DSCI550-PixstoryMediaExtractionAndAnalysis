When the meat industry clears forests for cattle and cropland it doesn t just destroy the trees it takes away habitat for the thousands of species who call forests home As species lose out on their habitats and the resources they need to survive to deforestation their populations slowly die out sometimes to the point of extinction In fact deforestation drives an estimated different species of plants animals and insects to extinction every day Animal agriculture is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest which houses over of the Earth s biodiversity By leaving animals off of our plate and reducing demand for meat we take away the meat industry s incentive to destroy forest habitats for their production not only saving farm animals but protecting wild animals too
