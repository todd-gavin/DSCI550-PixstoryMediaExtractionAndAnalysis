Despite not playing a single game for the New Orleans Pelicans last season, Zion Williamson is being rewarded with a five-year max extension.

Williamson collecting the full $231 million is likely based on being named MVP or making All-NBA teams, as Spotrac lists his non-All-NBA max at $192.9 million over five years. This is the 3rd largest contract in the history of the league. 

While in Cleveland, Rick Rubio is making his return to Cleveland in a 3 year deal. While Rubio is expected to miss the beginning of the season, getting the 31-year-old for just over $6 million a year with an out in the third season is terrific value for Cleveland.

His $6.1 million annual average is well below fellow free-agent point guards like Tyus Jones ($15 million) and Delon Wright ($8 million), and still leaves the Cavs with part of their mid-level exception.

Cleveland has certainly made a steal for themselves!
