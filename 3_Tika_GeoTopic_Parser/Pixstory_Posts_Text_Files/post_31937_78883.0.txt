Roma's director Tiago Pinto has revealed that Chelsea have a buyback clause in Tammy Abraham's contract.

The England international joined Roma in the last summer transfer window in the search for more regular first-team football.

Under Jose Mourinho, he has thrived and has scored 17 goals in all competitions for the Serie A side (transfermarkt).

This makes him the top-scoring Englishman across Europe in the 2021/22 season, and you would have to say that his risk has paid off.

However, it appears as if he might not be in Italy for long as Chelsea can buy the 24-year-old back for 80million Euros, which is around Â£66.62million (Fabrizio Romano).

This is a lot of money and would mean that Roma make a huge profit, but if he keeps up this sort of goalscoring form, then you would think he would be worth it.

I think that Abraham will end up back in the Premier League at some point, and though Chelsea have a buyback clause, I wouldn't necessarily say that he will end up back at Stamford Bridge.

There will be a lot of clubs who will be keen on Abraham if he can keep up this strong goalscoring form, and when the time comes, I am sure that he will want to return to the Premier League.

However, we can probably forget that for a little bit and just admire Abraham from afar.

The former Swansea City and Aston Villa loan man has had to work so hard to get to where he is at, and let us all hope that he can continue to score goals in Italy.
