It takes to years and around US billion to develop one successful drug Despite these significant investments in time and money of drug candidates in clinical trials fail Whether because they don t adequately treat the condition they re meant to target or the side effects are too strong many drug candidates never advance to the approval stage As a pharmaceutical scientist working in drug development I have been frustrated by this high failure rate Over the past years my lab has been investigating ways to improve this process We believe that starting from the very early stages of development and changing how researchers select potential drug candidates could lead to better success rates and ultimately better drugs How does drug development work Over the past few decades drug development has followed what s called a classical process Researchers start by finding a molecular target that causes disease for instance an overproduced protein that if blocked could help stop cancer cells from growing They then screen a library of chemical compounds to find potential drug candidates that act on that target Once they pinpoint a promising compound researchers optimize it in the lab Drug optimization primarily focuses on two aspects of a drug candidate First it has to be able to strongly block its molecular target without affecting irrelevant ones To optimize for potency and specificity researchers focus on its structure activity relationship or how the compound s chemical structure determines its activity in the body Second it has to be druglike meaning able to be absorbed and transported through the blood to act on its intended target in affected organs Once a drug candidate meets the researcher s optimization benchmarks it goes on to efficacy and safety testing first in animals then in clinical trials with people Why does of clinical drug development fail Only out of drug candidates successfully passes clinical trial testing and regulatory approval A analysis identified four possible reasons for this low success rate Read full story at The Conversation Image courtesy
