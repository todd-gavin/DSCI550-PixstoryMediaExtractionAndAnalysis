Is it okay to have sour food on your period? 🍋
Does sour food like pickles, limes, etc. make your period cramps worse?😬
Well, thankfully, no matter what all these rumours and neighbour aunties and relatives says, whatever they've told you....  
Your uterus does not have taste buds.👅
So it doesn't matter what kind of food you're having on your period.✅
Sour food will not make your period cramps worse.❌
Cramps are kinda gonna happen anyway, because just like haters gonna hate; uteruses gonna cramp 🥴 
(sorry but that's what it is😂😂😂) 
Having sour foods does not make your cramps worse. If you craving pickles, if you are craving lemon, if you're craving sour patch kids, HAVE it.🍋💫
Periods are difficult time and do whatever makes you feel comfortable. Your uterus will be alright ❤️✨
