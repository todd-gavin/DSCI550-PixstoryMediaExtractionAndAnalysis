In the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final, Paris Saint-Germain's women team will host the German side at the capital's legendary ground.

Les Parisiennes will face Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Women's Champions League. The first leg will take place in Munich on Tuesday 22nd March at 18:45 CET, while the second leg will be held at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday 30th March at 21:00 CET.

It will be the second match at the Parc des Princes for the club's women's team this season. Last November, Les Rouge et Bleue beat Real Madrid 4-0 in front of 19,000 spectators – a record attendance for a Women's Champions League group game.

Didier Ollé-Nicolle's players made it through to the quarter-finals by finishing top of their group with the best attack (25 goals scored) and the best defence (no goals conceded) in the competition.
