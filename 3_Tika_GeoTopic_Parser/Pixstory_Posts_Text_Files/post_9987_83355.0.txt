The United Nations has removed Ashraf Ghani from the list of world leaders

 The name of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani has recently been removed from the UN website, which lists world leaders.

 Meanwhile, the name of former Afghan Foreign Minister Hanif Atmar has been removed from the list of foreign ministers of the world in the UN list.

 Mr Ghani is fleeing Kabul following a Taliban attack in the United Arab Emirates.

 Earlier, there were reports of Mr. Ghani returning to Afghanistan, and his brother Heshmat Ghani had raised the issue, but Hamdullah Moheb, a former national security adviser to Afghanistan and a close aide to the former president, called the remarks "baseless rumors."
