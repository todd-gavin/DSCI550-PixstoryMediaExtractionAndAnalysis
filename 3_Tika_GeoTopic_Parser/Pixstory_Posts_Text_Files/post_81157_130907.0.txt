There were naysayers when Arsenal decided to spend the big bucks to sign Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City earlier this summer. Arsenal were in the need of a regular goal scorer and Jesus never really showed anything at the Etihad to suggest that he had it in him to be a prolific marksman. The 25-year-old never really did enough to get a regular run of games as a centre-forward under Pep Guardiola and there were suggestions that he preferred operating from the right flank. He scored just eight times in the Premier League last season. But he looks a different beast since joining Arsenal.
Mikel Arteta had talented attackers in his squad but he need a new focal point and Jesus has taken to the role like a duck to water. The Arsenal manager has constructed the team’s attack around Jesus’ considerable talent and he looks like a transformed forward.
He led the line well in his debut against Crystal Palace before eventually getting on the scoresheet against Leicester City. Jesus’ performance against the Foxes underlined all his qualities as an attacker and a creator. He scored a brace and registered two assists to cap off a complete performance.
Arsenal are sitting pretty at the top of the Premier League table and a lot is down to the way Jesus has led the line this season. Of course, the question marks remain over whether Arsenal and the Brazilian can sustain this momentum over the course of the campaign. Jesus is yet to prove that he can be consistent in front of goal and the Gunners also have to show that they have the mentality to get through tough periods of the season unscathed. Way too many times Arsenal have flattered to deceive in the last decade.
However, if things click into gear and Arsenal and Jesus can show consistency and resilience, the Emirates faithful could be in for some long-awaited fun times this season.
But as they say, it’s just August!
