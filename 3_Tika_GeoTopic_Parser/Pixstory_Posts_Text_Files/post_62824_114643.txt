I love me some good literature I don t have any particular genre I read whatever I feel like and thus I do enjoy a good romance So here are some of my favorite romance book quotes He stepped down trying not to look long at her as if she were the sun yet he saw her like the sun even without looking Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy I am nothing special just a common man with common thoughts and I ve led a common life There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten But in one respect I have succeeded as gloriously as anyone who s ever lived I ve loved another with all my heart and soul and to me this has always been enough The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks I ve waited a long time to show these flowers how pretty you are The Wise Man s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell I cannot let you burn me up nor can I resist you No mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed Possession by A S Byatt Soul meets soul on lovers lips Prometheus Unbound by Percy Bysshe Shelley
