Abstract Objective This study aimed to compare cervical joint position sense JPS between individuals with type diabetes T D and healthy individuals and to assess the correlation between glycated hemoglobin HbA c values and cervical JPS in individuals with T D Methods Ninety seven individuals with T D mean age years men women and healthy individuals without T D mean age years men women were recruited into this study Cervical JPS was evaluated using a cervical range of motion device in cervical flexion extension and rotation in left and right directions Participants were required to relocate their heads actively to a predefined target position with eyes closed and their reposition accuracy was measured in degrees as joint reposition error JRE The HbA c test was performed on all participants with T D to determine their average blood sugar level over the previous to months Cervical JREs were compared and correlated with HbA c values Results The participants with T D showed significantly larger cervical JREs in all directions compared with the healthy group flexion d P extension d P left rotation d P right rotation d P Pearson correlation coefficient r showed significant moderate positive association between HbA c and cervical JREs in flexion r P extension r P left rotation r P and right rotation r P in participants with T D Conclusion The magnitude of cervical JPS impairment was significant in individuals with T D In addition HbA c levels showed a significant negative correlation with cervical JPS Sources
