We need increased financing for sustainable and safe infrastructure and investments in cleaner mobility and greener urban planning -- especially in low- and middle-income countries.  And we need to adopt a more holistic approach to road safety.  This means better integrating road safety in national policies -- from education, health and transport to climate mitigation, land-use planning and disaster response.

I encourage all Member States to accede to United Nations road safety conventions and implement whole-of-society action plans, taking a strong prevention approach.  I urge all donors to scale up much-needed financial and technical contributions through the United Nations Road Safety Fund.

Every one of us has a role to play in making roads safer for everyone, everywhere. 

Together, we can save lives, support development and steer our world to safer roads ahead, leaving no one behind.
