Here s my theory I think that in our society we overestimate the power of physical attraction And then we underestimate the necessity of mental attraction What is mental attraction Mental attraction is that you can actually articulate the things that you are thinking It means having the emotional insight and empathy To understand how other people feel and to anticipate their needs instead of just thinking about your own Physical beauty will get you pretty far I don t deny that And yet there s nothing worse than a really attractive person who turns out to be mentally empty So I d say spend a little bit less time cultivating your appearance and focus a little bit more on your mental appearance As someone wise said To act is one thing to think is another to act like you think is the best
