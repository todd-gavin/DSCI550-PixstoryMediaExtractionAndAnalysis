WELCOME HOME BAPPA 🙏❤️

Welcoming Ganpati Bappa today at my home❤️
Just blissfulll🕉🙏❤️

This year, the Vinayaka Chaturthi 2022 wishes will celebrate on 31st August 2022, which marks the born day of Lord Ganesha. ❤️🙏🕉🕉❤️❤️

After two years of restricted celebration, preparations are in full swing for the ten-day long auspicious Ganesha festival. This festival is celebrated with huge pomp and show by the people across India.😍🕉❤️

People welcome Ganpatti Bappa by installing Lord Ganesha idols in their homes on the first day of the festival. Devotees decorate and worship the elephant-headed God and then bid adieu to him by immersing the idols in water after three, five, or ten days. ❤️

The duration of keeping Lord Ganesha idols at home for worshipping completely depends upon the devotees. There are plenty of stories and beliefs behind the celebration of this festival. 🙏🕉🕉🕉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
