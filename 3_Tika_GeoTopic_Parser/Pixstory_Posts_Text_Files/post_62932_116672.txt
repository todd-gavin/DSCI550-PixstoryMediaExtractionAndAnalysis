I see your points I understand them and I even agree with them But that s not so easy Being a cat parent is not that easy as it looks like especially in an urban environment Cats are hunters but also cats have been domesticated They are tiny animals and there are mode dangerous predators out there While a cat can successfully hunt a mouse or a songbird it may not survive a dog attack coyote attack other bigger cats like cougars could attack them if you live in areas like that As a cat parent there are many things you have to keep in mind and protecting your cat is the first one Even without those predators so many cats die in car accidents We have such fast running vehicles everywhere and cats falling victim to them is not unheard of Cats can easily get intimidated when surrounded by honking noises and cars Another thing that we don t understand in cats is that they also can get lost While cats are smart animals it s not hard for them to get lost in similar looking neighborhood Many times cats don t run away from their parents they get lost again with the potential of getting into the above dangers Cats are predator but they re still not wild They are not capable of protecting themselves against bigger threats
