Niall Horan has vowed to finish his third solo album "as soon as I can" and also hinted at plans to embark on a tour. He is set to head across the pond to the U.S. to complete work on his follow-up to 2020's "Heartbreak Weather". As soon as the "Nice To Meet Ya" singer finishes working on the record, he's also planning to hit the road after the record is done.

Quoted by The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column, the singer shared, "I'd love to try to get this album done as soon as I can. After this, I will be back to America for the foreseeable and then once I'm finished I won't be too long about getting back out there because Iâ€™m going to these gigs these days and getting very jealous."
