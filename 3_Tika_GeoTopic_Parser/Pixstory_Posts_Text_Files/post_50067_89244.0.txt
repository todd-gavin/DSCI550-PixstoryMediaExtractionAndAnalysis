I totally disagree; first of all, what is masculinity? And what is femininity? These concepts don't have particular characteristics. Basically, gender is a social construct. Very conditioned propaganda in which humans get trapped! 

Let's look at this from a very wider perspective; if a girl defies the traditional norms attributed to her; she tends to be masculine! Why does being brave, independent, outspoken be classified as masculine? Simply, why is riding a bike or a pixie cut masculine? Similarly, a boy crying or doing household chores or dancing or being polite immediately become feminine! This very concept of masculinity and femininity is a challenge to humans. Schools should not adhere to gender roles but equal participation for all the students. We should not cultivate a feeling of secondary or the other to any children. This will result in children treating their peers equally. Schools should teach the consequences of gender roles and introduce gender studies in the syllabus at a very small age. We teach incomprehensible formulas at a very young age; gender studies is a piece of cake. Children should be taught on issues like body shaming and schools should not encourage slut shaming, body shaming or ragging. Teach children to respect the decision of their peers and firmly agree to disagree.

Gender roles are rules on how to behave and live as an individual. Humans get trapped in this vicious cycle. Let children learn to embrace themselves; their character! Let them learn from mistakes and have the courage to be themselves and choose peace of mind over anything.
