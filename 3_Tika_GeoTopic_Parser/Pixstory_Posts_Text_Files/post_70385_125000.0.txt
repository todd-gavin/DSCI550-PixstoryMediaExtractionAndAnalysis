In an interview Urvashi stated that RP waited for hours in the hotel lobby for her.
Though, she did not named the cricketer but  people assumed it to be Rishabh Pant. With that on the other hand Pant posted a story which he deleted later mentioning that "people lie in interview for popularity" He did not mention Urvashi's name but yet again the internet users assumes this post by Pant is directed to her.
