Family members can be the hardest people to set boundaries with. Some reasons can be:

* Parents find it hard to let go of control because that is what they are used to
* Your parents made several sacrifices for you and you
feel as though you owe them
* Your parents are trying to relive their youth through you either through obtaining validation/joy through you or your accomplishments. Or micromanaging you to make sure you don't "repeat their mistakes"

Today, I am sharing some ways in which boundary
violations in families can show up.
As well as some affirmations for all of those trying to
protect their time, energy, and peace:
* You can be a nice person AND set boundaries
* You can be appreciative AND set boundaries
* Guilt will not have the power to control you
+ Your feelings are JUST as important as your family
members
** You are an adult that is allowed to stand up for your own needs
* If your parents choose to ignore you, withdraw love,
give you the silent treatment, or lash out - it is there
problem - not yours.

May you protect your peace ☮️
