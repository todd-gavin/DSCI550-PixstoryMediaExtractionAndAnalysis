Once again the Monaco Grand Prix for Charles Leclerc bewitched The Ferrari driver started in Pole Position and was very keen to do well not only for the drivers&#39; standings but also because he was racing at his home Instead, he only finished fourth after part of the race spent in head ahead of his rivals but due to an incredible strategy error in the pit wall Ferrari lost ground and in the end the French driver didn&#39;t even get on the podium You can&#39;t make these mistakes commented Leclerc at the end of the race I feel so many sensations in this moment for clearly c bitterness disappointment and anger I was leading by about a lead and we made a number of strategy mistakes which we cannot afford Losing such a success here at my home with championship points going away hurts I love this team but we have to grow and do better because this is not good
