Vice-President Kamala Harris received criticism on social media for her oversimplification of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

During an appearance on a radio program on 'Morning Hustle', Kamal Harris was asked to explain the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict "in layman’s terms".

In reply, Kamala Harris said, “So, Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So, basically, that’s wrong, and it goes against everything that we stand for." 

Several social media users criticised Harris for her oversimplification of the Ukraine war.

While Republican Senator Ted Cruz took a dig at the Vice-President by sharing a gif, journalist Ben Shapiro dubbed Harris "the Michael Scott of politics".

Another Twitter user Ben Domenech quipped, "Apparently Vice President Kamala Harris believes the average American layperson is aged 4."

Fox News host Tammy Bruce said, "I thought this was a parody. With everything we know about the incompetence & absurdity of Kamala Harris this is remarkable."
