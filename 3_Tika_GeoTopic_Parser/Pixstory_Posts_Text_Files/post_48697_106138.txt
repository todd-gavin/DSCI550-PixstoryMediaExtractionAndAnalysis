You talk about American heritage but which one We re pretty much a diverse country with an old long history So the heritage you re talking about is it that heritage where the indigenous people of this land were mercilessly slaughtered by white people Or the bringing African people against their wish treating them worse than animals and forcing them into slavery heritage Or is it the steal the Indians ideas and innovative and name it ours heritage Or the oppressing Asian Americans Heritage Or perhaps it s the men oppressing women heritage Or is it marginalizing queer folks heritage Which heritage exactly You re against people who subscribe to an ideology that believes that in life and in government justice is fundamental Those who oppose significant disparities in the lives and rights of the wealthy and the rest of the population who are generally pro personal liberty and anti religious or class superiority influences Basically people who are concerned about the well being of others Why must we be patriots to a country that s against our fundamental rights We can t even have bodily autonomy here till today In we are dying from being forced to give birth those same babies are dying due to shortage of baby formula Why should we stand with all of that We stand for the America that stands for us Not this white supremacist homophobic patriarchal establishment you call a heritage Do some serious fact checking to see if what displeases you is propaganda or what you believe in is You re not in a position to point out someone else s propaganda if you re not willing to fact check your own ideas That would only be reinforcing your prejudices Examine your own biases and beliefs You should evaluate what you want to believe and be willing to consider the possibility that maybe you are in the wrong
