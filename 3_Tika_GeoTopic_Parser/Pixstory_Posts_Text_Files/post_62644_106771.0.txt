Environmentally friendly sunscreen has been around for a while, but it's become increasingly popular since Hawaii prohibited the use of oxybenzone and octinoxate in sunscreens in 2018. The terms "reef-safe" and "reef-friendly" usually refer to sunscreen that is free of these two harmful chemicals. Mineral sunscreens, often known as reef-safe sunscreens, are typically manufactured with natural chemicals that are less harmful to marine life.

When visiting these places like Hawaii, it's crucial you buy some reef safe sunscreens. They are good on your body and are ocean friendly as well.
