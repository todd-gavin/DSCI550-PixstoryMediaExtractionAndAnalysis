Rain drops fall from the sky Precious gifts from the clouds up high Nature answers the weeping cries Of the earth below dry Smiles bloom on trees Joy spreads through lush green fields Branches swing and sway to beats As skies bring bring respite from scorching heat Laughter echoes through breeze Boon from above land below drinks Watch the little children play Drenched in rain sailing paper boats along the way Come forth and enjoy this beautiful day Let the winds take your sorrows away Rain drops fall from the sky Precious gifts from the clouds up high
