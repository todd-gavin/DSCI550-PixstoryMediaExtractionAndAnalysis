The horror film Handling the Undead, starring Oscar-nominated Renate Reinsve, has found a new home with Neon, who also purchased the rights to distribute it in the UK and North America. 

Hollywood Reporter said that for her leading role in The Worst Person in the World, Reinsve won the best actress prize at Cannes. In her feature film directorial debut, Handling The Undead, she is accompanied by Anders Danielsen Lie, a cast member of The Worst Person in the World. 

The movie, which is currently in production and stars Bjrn Sundquist, Bente Brsum, and Bahars Pars, is about three families dealing with grief and loss. It is produced by Kristin Emblem & Guri Neby under their Einar Film banner.
