Abusers don’t care about their victims, They just care about themselves. They are narcissists they don’t realise the extend of abuse—-
Look at these examples 
This is how they think
A petal hurt me but you should endure thorns .
Why because you are you and I am the privileged me. 
I will do all the wrongs in the world. How dare u even look at the wrongs in the world. 
Why did u take off the rose tinted glasses. I would mock u for them but I loved it when u saw no wrong. Because being a cow suits u more. 
I did wrong but how dare u told anyone else. It’s betrayal, you can’t discuss family issues. Even if I torture u day and night. I don’t do it . 
My social media statuses should make you look like crap. How dare u complain, have I named you. 
I will slut shame you morning evening, I am not bad I am hurt, so I’ll post hurting songs everyday 
I will hack your phone , abuse you online. But it’s online, I have not done any physical harm. 
I will use dark web to say what I can’t on your face. 

The author says we need to renew our definition of narcissism in the times of social media and internet . 
Narcissists remain the same only they have just adopted other means. 

Some times Facebook gives u pearls . 
So take care of ur mental health.
Get brave , stop the toxicity from flowing towards u.
