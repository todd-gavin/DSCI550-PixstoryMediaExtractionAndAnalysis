The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves and featuring Robert Pattinson in his first role as the Caped Crusader, is off to a poor start in China, as one might expect. 

Hollywood Reporter said that the film had earned $3.6 million as of 10.30 p.m. local time on Friday, including some presales for Saturday and Sunday. The Batman is expected to gross $33 million in its final weekend, according to Maoyan, a Beijing-based ticketing app. However, projections are subject to change throughout the weekend. 

So far, word of mouth for the moody superhero film has been positive, but massive cinema closures in China as a result of COVID outbreaks have slashed the film's profits potential. The film's over three-hour running period doesn't help matters, and there isn't the kind of spectacle that most superpics are known for. 

The Batman gets a 7.7 rating on Douban, a website where China's more discerning cinema lovers congregate. The top ticketing apps Maoyan and Tao Piao Piao have average user ratings of approximately 9. 

According to exhibition industry consultancy Artisan Gateway, China is currently experiencing its greatest COVID flare-up since the start of the pandemic, with about 30% of all Chinese movie theatres temporarily closed during the past week. Metropolitan population centres like Shanghai and Shenzhen, where moviegoers prefer imported Hollywood material, are among the hardest hurt.
