NASA management recently halted a pilot project that permitted staff at the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to use pronouns in their official agency identification, a move that has been highly criticised. More than 100 employees were affected by the decision, and their specified pronouns were removed from communication platforms. 

Scientific Journal reported that the project's demise gained widespread notice after it was revealed in an anonymous Reddit post. Many of the information detailed in the essay have since been confirmed by multiple GSFC employees, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Various astronomers have described NASA's pronoun erasure as "more than a little disheartening," "pointlessly cruel," and an indicator of "queerphobic leadership" in the days following the Reddit article.

During the COVID pandemic, NASA took initiatives to combat racism and enhance diversity and equity within the agency, including providing gender-neutral bathrooms, using dual-anonymous peer review, and reducing deadline dates for some project proposals. However, the agency's decision to end the GSFC pronoun test follows its refusal to rename the James Webb Space Telescope, which sparked a controversy when astronomers pointed out that the flagship's namesake—a former NASA administrator—had allegedly been complicit in federal homophobic policies toward government workers in the 1950s and 1960s. It also comes amid a flurry of legislation and directives aimed at marginalising and restricting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals in a number of states.
