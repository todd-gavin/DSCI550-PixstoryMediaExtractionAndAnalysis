If there is any team in the English Premier League that badly needed the international break before the league would go crazy in the course of the next 30 days, it would be Liverpool. After a glorious transfer window and splashing the money out to strengthen their squad for the 2022/23 season, the season has not progressed as they have planned. Jurgen Klopp’s men have struggled to get going in the league and have succumbed to defeats. It took them over three games to register the first win of the campaign. However, it is not all over yet. The season is long enough for them to stage a comeback. In this article, we shall look at Liverpool’s Strength, Weakness, Opportunities for them and threats that lie ahead for them.
At the start of the break, Liverpool have played six games and had just two wins to their name. They have nine points in the English Premier League whereas three points in the UEFA Champions League after two games. Their horrific loss to Napoli in the curtain raiser of the elite European competition shed light on multiple problems of Liverpool.
Strengths
The core strength of Liverpool over the years have been their relentless sprinting and sending the opposition crazy with the pace. The modern-day fullbacks who venture into the midfield have wreaked havoc in the opposition defense. The core strength of Liverpool lies in Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander Arnold, who can turn the game on their head with attacking ability. The Anfield outfit has become a tremendous success over the last few years because of their attack as well. Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz will look forward to pouncing on the upcoming opportunities after they break as they are yet to join the party this season.
