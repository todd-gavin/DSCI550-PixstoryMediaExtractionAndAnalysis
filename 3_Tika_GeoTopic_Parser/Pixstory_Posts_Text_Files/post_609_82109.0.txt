So what is the treatment?
Sleep apnea is a newly recognised entity, which if diagnosed earlier then it can be easily treated. Because it has far reaching consequences like high blood pressures, cardiac arrests and even strokes.
We have to remember that not all snorers have sleep apnea. To diagnose we have to do a sleep study called polysomnography. Biological parameters, like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation, breathing patterns and even the brainwaves are measured while a person sleeps. This demonstrates that how many times the breathing has  stopped and its effects and based on that we measure a parameter called apnea hypopnea index and that beyond a certain level that we label it as a mild/ moderate or severe.
The treatment is simple use of a device called CPAP or BiPAP. It basically pushes
air into the nose or mouth on the patient with force so that the obstruction caused by the soft palate is avoided and keeps a patient breathing. The oxygenation improves and so does the high blood pressure. The heart arrhythmias also decrease and a patient has sound sleep, wakes up fresh. 
Majority of patients improve with the machine in case BP doesn't get controlled,  the patient can be supplemented with medications.

Are there any lifestyle advice?
 The first thing we advise the patient is to reduce weight by a good diet and exercise. So the fat reduces in the nasopharynx and chances of blockages are further reduced. 
So it's not rocket science; these simple interventions can really make a difference.
