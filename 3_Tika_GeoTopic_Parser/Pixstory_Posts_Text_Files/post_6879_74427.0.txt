There’s a new word game around the block: based in Chicago, Jordan Bouvier used the free web app maker Glitch to give Wordle a nonconformist-like upgrade: a pink-pastel palleted Queerdle that describes itself as a NSFW “Yassification” of its predecessor.

“At first I was just tinkering around adding new features,” Bouvier told PinkNews. “But then I was having fun so I shared it with a few friends and on Twitter and it took off from there!”

On Queerdle, players have six chances to get the word right and the length of characters can range from four to eight, in contrast to the fixed five-length character words on Wordle. 

“Occasionally two words may be put together if I feel like it. Queerness cannot be contained!” instructions read. 

The results grid adorns itself with green snakes for letters placed in their correct place, bananas for letters in the word, and coconuts for letters that aren’t in the word of the day.

When you enter a word that isn’t in the queerdle dictionary yet, you have a chance to recommend it for the game: “Sorry, queen. We don't have that word yet. Consider submitting it!” a message pops up. 

Players can toggle between a ‘light theme’ and an ‘accessible theme’ and can also submit their own words. 

What’s your Queerdle result of the day?
