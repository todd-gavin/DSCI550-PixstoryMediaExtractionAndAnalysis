Mohammad Ag Ayoye, UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan, said 17 children had been killed in Kabul, Balkh and Uruzgan in the past two days as a result of explosions.

The UNICEF representative called for an end to violence against children, stressing that "children should not pay the price for adult conflict."
Mr. Ayoye expressed his condolences to the relatives of the victims and called for the protection of Afghan children.

The UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan did not provide further details on the incidents in which children died.
Meanwhile, the Taliban police chief in Kunduz province said in a news release that a mortar shell had exploded in the village of Baghmiri in the province, killing two children and wounding another.

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) says the war in Afghanistan over the past 40 years has had a devastating effect on the country's children.

Reports released by human rights organizations show that thousands of children have died or lost their limbs during Taliban attacks in various Afghan provinces over the past two decades.
According to the United Nations Children's Fund, between 6,500 children were killed and about 15,000 were injured in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2018 alone.

It seems that even after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, violence against Afghan children has not been eliminated.
In the early days of May 1401, UNICEF Regional Director George Laria Idaji said that in just one week, more than 50 girls and boys had died in violent attacks in Afghanistan.
