Hey
This is krishika. I'm here to introduce myself without giving the basic information about myself. 
I am a reader. I love books. I like to read fiction mostly. I believe it to be an escapeÂ  from the real world when things get stressful and you need a break to bounce back to your everyday life. You sure can make your own fantasy world but sometimes you just don't have the energy so books and reading do help alot.
Thank you
