Prime Minister of Kashmir continues Q Everybody wishes that responsible Government should be given to the people Could you kindly tell us what is your idea regarding this matter Don t you also think that with the grant of responsible Government there will be peace in the State A I feel that the responsibility should be transferred gradually and slowly If you want that full responsible Government should be granted immediately this is not possible Time will come when you will have to shoulder full responsibility but subject to certain safeguards Q In Kashmir there are certain definite grievances about the under representation of Muslims in Government Service A I am not prepared to hear grievances on communal grounds but forevery citizen of Kashmir work and employment has to be provided Q The grievance is specific for zamindars It is with great difficulty that the zamindars get education and when they qualify themselves for service the system of recruitment and issuing notices is so defective that they cannot get employment Will something be done for them A I am a zamindar and I know zamindars very well What is required is that some four or five big industries should be established in the State so that there is no dearth of employment and we should create such a field of service that we should look for men and men should not look for service Q May we take it that you are not against the grant of responsible Government except that you want that it should be gradual A Yes but there should be clear demarcation between the sphere of the king and his people The position of His Highness must be safeguarded and certain essential powers must remain with him Nation building departments should be transferred to the people s representatives Some constitution will have to be worked out in consultation with party leaders so that gradually power is transferred but in doing this we have to see that so much power is transferred that there is no indigestion To be continued
