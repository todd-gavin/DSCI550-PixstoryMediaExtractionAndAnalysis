Callout culture amounts to online bullying and can provoke violence and threats even more bitterly than the original offence being called out.
‌
‌Some people unknowingly tweet or post something on social media and it becomes a very vast issue. What they posted might be offensive-that doesn't make them a very bad person. They might be regretting what they did-still not believe.

Call-out culture can end up reflecting what the prison industrial complex educates us about crime and punishment: to banish and dispose of individuals rather than to commit with them as people with difficult stories and histories. There must always be a second or third chance for an individual to learn from mistakes. Minor mistakes can be forgiven. 

We see a very adverse effect, where the person’s understanding of self is eroded, or a kind of counter-attack, where they double down on their role and don’t want to learn.

We also see online boycotts to create a hate train of mass cyberbullying targeted at one specific individual. Death threats are oftentimes among the list of improper proclamations directed toward cancelled individuals. Some people even behave in a way that is worse than the ones called out did. Now that social media has become a platform for calling out, it is easy to tarnish a person through it and people even use it in such a way to spread hate about an individual. Moreover, how can we ever call someone guilty when they are accused but not proven. Social media establishes this and often takes sides even before the case has begun.
