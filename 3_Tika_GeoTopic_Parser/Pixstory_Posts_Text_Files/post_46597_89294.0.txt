Michelle Obama might succeed President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee in 2024, according to a former Trump administration source, who warned that the former first lady would be a formidable opponent for the GOP. 

“If [Democrats] were to run Michelle Obama, that would put us in a very difficult position,” former Trump aide Monica Crowley said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando.

“They'd reach for a candidate who is completely plausible, very popular, and immune to criticism.”

According to Daily Mail, Crowley, who served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs under Donald Trump, spoke on a panel with former White House physician-turned-House Rep. Ronny Jackson, conservative activist Jack Posobiec, and California lawyer Kurt Schlichter.

Moreover, Elizabeth Elkins writes that Obama's memoir 'Becoming' sold more than two million copies in various forms within 15 days of publication, quickly becoming a bestseller.  

It's a testament to the Harvard-educated lawyer's popularity, particularly among Democrats. 

Furthermore, she has been chosen the most admired woman in the world three years in a row by YouGov's worldwide survey, most recently claiming the top spot in December 2021. 

News portals talk about how while Obama has openly dismissed the possibility of competing for her husband's former position, a recent Hill-HarrisX poll put her towards the top of the list of potential candidates in 2024 if Biden opts out. 

Obama has always been admired by Democrats and even Independents, and she would be well-known if she ran for president in 2024.
Personally, I would love to see her as our President! What do you think?
