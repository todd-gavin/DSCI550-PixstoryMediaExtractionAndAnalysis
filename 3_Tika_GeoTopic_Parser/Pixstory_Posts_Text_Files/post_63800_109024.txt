Looking at the early footage of Call Of Duty Modern Warfare my mind is now almost certain that it is time to put the shutter on Call Of Duty For a while now my expectations are as low as one can imagine but the early gameplay footage has somehow further pressed my expectations down But for all my disappointments somehow hope is kindled that the series will come up with some new innovations and impressive mechanics to surprise players like better physics new weapons customizations aesthetics etc Though in the end my hopes barely ever bear fruit COD is a franchise very close to my heart as it was what turned me into an FPS fanatic These games are still very close to my heart but I guess it is time to say it openly COD is dead and it is unlikely to revive and go back to its old days of glory I wish I could say that I am excited for the new Modern Warfare games but to be honest at this point I wouldn t care if COD had a merger with Crysis or Warhammer k This formulaic approach to what was a fantastic series and turning it into a disposable factory product has not only ruined the current game but it has also ruined the franchise as a whole and killed the hopes of those invested in it The whole FPS genre right now is going through some sort creative bankruptcy right now it seems Yes we have games like Metro Overwatch Apex Legends Crysis Doom and Doom Eternal maybe Titanfall so not everything is ruined But in some ways it seems that the whole FPS genre is really dumbed down Maybe I haven t played enough FPS games recently but the moment I see the footage of the latest COD Battlefield or something like Halo Infinite my interest gets killed and I think to myself Damn This again Plus we have microtransactions and Battle Royale to make things worse Whatever be the reasons I can t play FPS games anymore they have just stopped being interesting
