Piece your workout together You don t need to get all your exercise at one time Ten minutes morning noon and night can give much of the same benefit as minutes all at once Exercise with a friend Finding a workout partner can help keep you on track and motivate you to get out the door Keep it brisk When you walk make it brisk since this may help control weight better than walking at a leisurely pace What is brisk enough Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late Move your feet before you eat Hit the gym walk with coworkers for a minute walk and have lunch afterwards Try a pedometer Step counters pedometers are an easy inexpensive way to motivate yourself to be active Work up to steps per day Turn off the TV computer and smartphone Cutting back on screen time is a great way to curb your sit time Move around instead by visiting the gym or even cleaning the house Turn sit time into fit time Try to combine cardiovascular exercise with a sedentary activity that you already do For example try doing simple exercises while watching TV or set a reminder at work to get up and walk a few minutes every hour
