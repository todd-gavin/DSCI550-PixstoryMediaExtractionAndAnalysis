With nearly 16,900 new cases recorded on July 13 despite the World Health Organization's warning that the virus was "nowhere near ending," the daily count of Covid-19 cases in India has increased by 24 % 24 hours.

The number of active cases in the nation has crossed the one lakh level and accounts for 0.3% of all illnesses. 13,600 instances were reported the previous day.

Covid has also been linked to more than 45 deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities to 5,25,519 overall.

With 400 instances recorded on Wednesday, Mumbai has seen a daily increase in Covid cases of 79%. 2,435 new cases were reported in the state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located.

The World Health Organization (WHO) also issued a warning to all national governments and healthcare systems, noting that the number of new cases worldwide had increased by 30% in the previous two weeks, and urging them to take action to stop the spread of illness.

The Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which frequently exhibit significant transmissibility, are substantially responsible for the current global expansion of Covid-19 infections. India is one of the nations where the subvariant is becoming more widespread.

Hospitalization, death rates, and surveillance—including testing and sequencing—have all dramatically decreased globally as a result of the dissemination of this new subvariant, making it even more challenging to evaluate the subvariant's effects.
