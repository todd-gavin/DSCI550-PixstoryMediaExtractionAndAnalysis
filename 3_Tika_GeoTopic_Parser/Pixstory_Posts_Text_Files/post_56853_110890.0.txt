Intermittent fasting is a dietary pattern that cycles between normal eating and fasting. If you’re seeking more health benefits, or pound-shedding potential, from an eating plan – and you also want to develop inner serenity and a sense of being grounded – you might be attracted to intuitive fasting.

It’s not a diet in the conventional sense but more accurately described as an eating pattern. Standard intermittent fasting methods involve daily 16-hour fasts or fasting for 24 hours, twice weekly. Fasting has been a practice throughout human evolution. Ancient hunter-gatherers didn’t have supermarkets, refrigerators or food available year-round. Sometimes they couldn’t find anything to eat.

As a result, humans evolved to be able to function without food for extended periods. Fasting from time to time is more natural than always eating 3–4 (or more) meals per day. Fasting is also often done for religious or spiritual reasons, including Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism.

These are the most popular methods:

-The 16/8 method: The Leangains protocol involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 1–9 p.m. Then you fast for 16 hours in between.
-Eat-Stop-Eat: This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week, for example, by not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next day.
-The 5:2 diet: With this method, you consume only 500–600 calories on two nonconsecutive days of the week but usually eat the other five days.
