Malaika Arora may have been exploring her romantic relationship with boyfriend Arjun Kapoor but she is also a hands down mother to her teenage son Arhaan Khan. She is co-parenting her son with Arbaaz Khan and recently revealed how her equation with her ex-husband has changed after divorce Malaika and Arbaaz ended their 18 years of marriage. They had tied the knot in 1998 and headed for a divorce in 2017. However, they always make sure to spend quality time with his son on important occasions and family gatherings. Malaika said that she and Arbaaz have become far more matured, calmer and happier as individuals and she was glad that they decided to go separate ways. "I think I made my choice and I put myself first. And I think by doing that, I am a much better person today. I have a better relationship with my son; he sees that I am much happier. I have a much better relationship with my ex-husband. I’m happy I made these decisions and I stood up for myself. So, for women out there, don’t be scared. Don’t be afraid to follow your heart. Yes, you will ruffle feathers but life is not easy. You can’t make everyone happy," Malaika told Masala magazine in an interview.
