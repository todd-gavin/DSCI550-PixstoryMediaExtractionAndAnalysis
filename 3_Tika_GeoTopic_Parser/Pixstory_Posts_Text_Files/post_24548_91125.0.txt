On March 31, the actor's agencies VAST Entertainment MSTeam stated through a statement, "Actors Son Ye Jin and Hyunbin are holding their wedding ceremony today, taking their first step as a married couple. The ceremony will be private in consideration of  situation with Covid-19, so we ask for your generous understanding. We are sharing the news with their wedding photos instead".
