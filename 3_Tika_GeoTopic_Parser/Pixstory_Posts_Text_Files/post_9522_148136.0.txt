The Challenges to Nation-Building
in Afghanistancontinues....
But Afghanistan remains physically devastated and politically 
unstable leaving many of those who returned vulnerable and inhibiting many more from returning . Although there were signs of recovery after years of civil war, returnees faced grinding poverty and pending humanitarian disaster back in Afghanistan. Housing remained a major 
problem with little or no economic opportunities for the refugees. With 
more and more returnees centering on the capital and its environs 
pressures on Kabul remain out of proportion. Reports indicate that large 
areas in and around Kabul remain little more than expanses of crumbling 
mud and brick, mostly blown apart during the street-to–street battles that 
killed tens of thousands in 1992-1996 period. The government wants the 
returnees to head towards the rural areas since the population in the capital has sworn to about 3 million, more than double of what it was before the Taleban’s fall. Infact the Deputy Mayor of Kabul Habibullah Aghari estimated that about 500,000 refugees are in the capital living in schools, ruined buildings, relatives’ homes and tents.
Another problem faced by the returnees in Kabul is the rising property and food prices partly due to arrival of international aid workers and peacekeepers. There has been a growing resentment towards the 
Karzai government because of this situation at home. Many view his 
government as serving the rich and doing little for the poor. Most Afghans 
are reluctant to move towards the countryside because they are still under 
the sway of warlords with private armies. Anti-personnel landmines also 
remain a major constraint to the movement towards the country-side 
where cultivable land is still heavily mined. Although repatriation statistics are satisfying, the conditions back home are hardly satisfactory.
