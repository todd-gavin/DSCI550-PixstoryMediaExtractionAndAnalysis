The Hazratbal Shrine popularly called Dargah Sharif is a Muslim shrine located in Hazratbal locality of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, India. It contains a relic, Moi-e-Muqqadas, which is widely believed to be the hair of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It is situated on the northern bank of the Dal Lake in Srinagar, and is considered to be Kashmir's holiest Muslim shrine.
Inayat Begum, the holy relic's keeper and Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai's daughter, founded Hazratbal. Sadiq Khan, a Mughal subedar, built the shrine's original structure in the 17th century, during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan. Ishrat Jahan was the initial name given to this. Shah Jahan gave the order for the structure's transformation into a prayer hall in 1634. The current building was started in 1968 and finished in 1979 after an 11-year period.
