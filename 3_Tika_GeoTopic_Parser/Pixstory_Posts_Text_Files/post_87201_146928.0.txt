2 Robin van Persie 
Van Persie was an Arsenal stalwart, but he left when the club struggled to win trophies. At the time, United lacked a natural striker to complement Rooney ahead. His impact at the club was immediate, as he scored 30 goals in 48 games in his first season, and his performance was flawless, as he was named Premier League player of the month twice in 2012 and 2013. He finally won the Premier League in the 2012-13 season, and he left the club with a 58-goal record in just 105 games.
1 Wayne Rooney
Manchester Unitedâ€™s most iconic player had world at his feet, his goal-scoring prowess was unparalleled when Rooney was at his peak. Players came and go but the player stayed and delivered in every match to establish himself as one of the greats. Rooney illustrated his potential in his early days when he signed from Everton and that gave him a high status at club.
Rooney possessed every characteristic that was unrivalled, and this was the icing on the cake for the player. He appeared in 559 games for United, scoring 253 goals. During his time at United, he won a Champions League, five Premier League titles, and the Premier League title in 2009-10.
