Globally, safe waste management services for healthcare waste are lacking, especially in least developed countries. 


The latest available data (from 2019) indicate that 1 in 3 healthcare facilities globally do not safely manage healthcare waste. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to large increases in healthcare waste, straining under resourced healthcare facilities and exacerbating environmental impacts from solid waste. 

Now, what is the solution ??

The recommendations included in the report build on actions in the WHO manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19: "prescriptions and actionables for a healthy and green recovery". They target the global, national and facility levels to promote a “win–win” scenario for COVID-19 PPE use, testing and vaccinations that are safe and support environmental sustainability.

WHO suggests some of the ways to deal with such situation:

These solutions include:

• *reduction* in the amount of unnecessary PPE through safe and rational use, including the application of other infection prevention measures such as hand hygiene;
• use of *smaller* quantities of, and more sustainable, packaging;
• development and use of *safely* reusable and *easily* *disinfected* PPE (gloves, aprons and masks);
• use of PPE made with a greater proportion of renewable, *biobased* or recy- clable materials;
• investment in recycling systems for general healthcare waste;
• implementation of reverse logistics and centralized treatment of waste us- ing non-burn technologies; and
• investment in local and regional PPE production, and just-in-time shipments.

In addition, strengthening healthcare waste systems, through improved and more sustainable standards and regulation, regular monitoring and reporting, and increased investments in safe waste management, alongside other funda- mental water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and energy infrastructure, and a well-trained, empowered workforce able to safely manage waste and appropri- ately use PPE are needed. These are further discussed in the global, national and facility recommendations in section 4.
