There is still confusion about what one should eat first thing in the morning ! Some prefer to straightaway opt for a cup of tea or coffee to kick-start their day .
But what is considered as the best food to be had in the morning ?
Instead of going for a heavy meal directly , one should start their day with any of these :
1.Water
2.Nuts
3.Infused or detox water
4.Fruit
5.Tea noooo
6.Coconut water with chia seeds
If you feel acidic , you must avoid tea / coffee on empty stomach !
Try to have any of the above on empty stomach to break the fasting and acidity .
Tell me in notes what do you have first thing in the morning ?
