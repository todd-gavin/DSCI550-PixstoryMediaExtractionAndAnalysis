Coal

BY Audre Lorde

I
Is the total black, being spoken
From the earth's inside.
There are many kinds of open.
How a diamond comes into a knot of flame   
How a sound comes into a word, coloured   
By who pays what for speaking.

Some words are open
Like a diamond on glass windows
Singing out within the crash of passing sun
Then there are words like stapled wagers
In a perforated book—buy and sign and tear apart—

And come whatever wills all chances
The stub remains
An ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge.
Some words live in my throat
Breeding like adders. Others know sun
Seeking like gipsies over my tongue
To explode through my lips
Like young sparrows bursting from shells.
Some words
Bedevil me.

Love is a word another kind of open—
As a diamond comes into a knot of flame
I am black because I come from the earth's inside   
Take my word for jewel in your open light.

Lorde's poetry in Coal explored topics related to the several layers of her identity as a "Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet." While Audre Lorde presents poems that convey each part of her identity, race plays a significant role in Coal. A major theme within the volume is Lorde's angry response to racism. For Lorde, expressing anger was not fatal. Instead, Lorde transforms "rage at racism into triumphant self-assertion.

The volume's namesake comes from a poem in the first section titled "Coal". It is written in free-verse and first-person. The idea of an identity comprising of several layers is exemplified in this poem. One's true identity is often hidden behind several muddled layers. Lorde attributes this concept to her recurrent use of the dual imagery of a piece of coal and a diamond. As the speaker of the poem, Lorde begins by equating herself with a piece of coal.
