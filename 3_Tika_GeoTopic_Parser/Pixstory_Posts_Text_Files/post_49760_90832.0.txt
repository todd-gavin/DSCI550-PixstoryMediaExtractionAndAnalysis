‌The former President of Republic of Hondura is wanted in US, on drug trafficking and firearms charges. Even though he denied all the charges against him; the top court of Hondura rejected his appeal agreeing on the extradition to US. He is foreseen a life sentence if convicted. 
‌
‌According to Aljazeera, Hernandez facilitated the smuggling of some 500 tonnes of drugs – mainly from Colombia and Venezuela – to the US via Honduras since 2004. The prosecutors of the nation have also alleged that he received a large bounty from the traffickers for protection.
‌
‌He has three charges including using or carrying firearms including machine guns and conspiracy to use or carry firearms and conspiracy to import a controlled substance into the United States. 
‌
‌Meanwhile, Hernandez puts out his statement that he is innocent and victim of a revenge and conspiracy. His family also said: “We’re ready and confident that we’ll be able to show the US justice system that these accusations are a revenge plot from Honduran narcos whose empire of crime and violence Juan Orlando destroyed.”
