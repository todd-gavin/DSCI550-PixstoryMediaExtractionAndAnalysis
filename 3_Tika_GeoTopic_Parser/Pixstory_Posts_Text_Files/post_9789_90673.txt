Brave Afghans took to the streets of Kabul yesterday morning demanding girls right to an education Sadly the turnout was small but the message was loud We will continue to protest for as long as the doors to education for girls remain closed While the Taliban did not stop the demonstration fighters verbally and physically assaulted Afghan journos who were there reporting on the event Starting this weekend the Taliban have also instructed airlines not to allow female travellers to board flights if they are without male guardians known as mahrams The new leadership stipulated the need for a mahram for distances beyond miles in December but until now women travelling by air had not been affected In further fantastic developments note the irony the Taliban today announced the use of parks must be gender segregated Men can use them four days of the week and women the remaining three This means an end to the very popular family picnics on a Friday the only weekend day in Afghanistan
