First things first. I believe that all of us will agree that Trump was atrocious for this country. Nearly everyone I know was rooting for Biden to be in power. We naively believed that he would change our days. We would get jobs, wages would rise and gas prices will decrease. He was supposed to be our “saviour”. But what really happened? 

Despite Biden’s “best” efforts, our economy is in shambles. Nothing has really changed and like everytime, each finger is pointing to our President. The President who was supposed to make our lives better has only disappointed us. And this is not just my opinion but opinion of my fellow Americans too. 

US News reported that polls show that the economy is Americans' top concern, and despite partisan imbalances baked into such surveys it’s pretty clear that overall they aren't happy with how the president is handling the issue. 

An AP/NORC survey in late March, for example, found that 31% of those polled think the economy is good, while 64% believe it's in bad shape. That same poll showed that 34% of Americans approve of Biden's handling of the economy and 65% disapprove.

How are we supposed to thrive in this environment. Yes, times have been tough with coronavirus and war in Ukraine but isn’t it a President’s job to help us sail through these times? All Biden does is issue report on job creation, decreasing inflation and a better economy. 

Alas, if I could only see some real change on ground and not just on paper.
