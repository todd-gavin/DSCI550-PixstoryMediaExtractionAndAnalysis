Devon Cole posted the teaser of her song W.I.T.C.H and I have to say, I'm obsessed! Both with the lyrics and the beat! Oh and the word play 🧙🏼‍♀️

Honestly, I love feminist songs, but what I love more are feminist songs that are taking a dig at the stupid patriarchal notions of the society. 

The lyrics goes:

Rumor on the street
is that her apples are delicious
The jury said she's charming
But her exes say
she's wicked
I swear to God
I saw her howling at the sky
She ain't out to get you but
She's better on your side
She doesn't wanna be anybody else
She's a
Woman In Total Control of Herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a
Woman In Total Control of Herself
