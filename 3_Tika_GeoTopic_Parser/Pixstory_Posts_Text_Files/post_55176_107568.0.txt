From the tips, Erin Hills -- the site of this year's U.S. Open -- spans over 7,800 yards. By tour standards, that's a long piece of nectar. But compared to Nullabor Links, which checks in at 850 miles, it's a pitch-n-putt.

As per Golf Digest, Oliver Horovitz, author of An American Caddie in  St. Andrews , chronicled his Nullarbor travels for our friends at Cond√© Nast Traveler. 

Located in Australia, the 18-hole par-72 golf course spans 1,365 kilometers (848.1717 miles) with one hole in each participating town or roadhouse along the Eyre Highway, from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia to Ceduna in South Australia. The course was built to give Aussie truckers something to do on this remote stretch of the road. And this is far from a goat -- or in this case, kangaroo -- track.
