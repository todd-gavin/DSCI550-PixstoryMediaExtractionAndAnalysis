Anna Davis has no recollections of the Masters or Augusta National Golf Club. Her most distinct memory is of seeing Tiger Woods win in 2019, and she didn't know about the Augusta National Women's Amateur until a friend was competing last year.

On Saturday the 16-year-old created her own memories among the Georgia Pines by claiming the 2022 Augusta National Women’s Amateur with a 3-under 69 to finish as the lone player under par at 1 under. Davis, a high school sophomore, is the event’s youngest champion in its three-year history.

Anna Davis, who was competing for the first time in the ANWA, became the second teen winner after Tsubasa Kajitani in 2021. Davis, who is now rated second in the AJGA Rolex Rankings, won the Girls Junior PGA Championship last July and was named to the United States Junior Solheim Cup team for 2021.

In Augusta National, Davis made four birdies in the final round, including two at Amen Corner on Nos. 12 and 13. The par-4 third hole was her lone bogey.

Ingrid Lindblad, Stone's colleague who placed T-3 at the ANWA last year, had the low round of the day, a 4-under 68, assisted by eagles on the par-5 8th and 15th holes. At even par, the LSU junior tied for second place with Stone.
