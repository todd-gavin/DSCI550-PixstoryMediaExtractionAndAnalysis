1.Most avocados come from Mexico.
While avocados are grown in California and Florida, the majority sold in grocery stores come from south-central Mexico. The main reason for the abundance of “south of the border” avocados is that Mexico is blessed with a year-round growing climate. The avocado is believed to have originated in the state of Puebla, Mexico, as far back as 10,000 B.C.
2. The conquistadors were huge fans.
Spanish explorers arriving in Mexico during the 16th century survived on avocados and were the first Europeans to consume them. As a result of the Spanish Conquest, avocados spread to South America and Central America. Sadly, they had yet to learn how to make avocado toast.
3. “Avocado” wasn’t its original name.
Irishman Sir Hans Sloane called it an avocado in 1696 in a Jamaican plants catalogue. He also dubbed the avocado tree the “alligator pear tree.”
4. It’s relatively new to the United States.
It wasn’t until the 1950s that Americans turned to avocados. This makes it a relatively new food in our country. As with most imported trends, avocados were popular in the coastal states- Florida, California, and Hawaii- before evolving into the mainstream culinary culture.
