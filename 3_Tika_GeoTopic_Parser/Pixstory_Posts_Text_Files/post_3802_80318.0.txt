Also, Nobel Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai expressed her concern over the “horrifying” situation in Karnataka. 

She tweeted in support of the Muslim girls who were denied entry into the educational institutions because of their hijab. 

Malala is a well known women’s rights activist and a champion of the cause of women’s education. She was shot in the head when she was just 15 years old by Taliban in Pakistan for speaking up for educational rights of girls.

She wrote “Refusing to let girls go to school in their hijabs is horrifying. Objectification of women persists — for wearing less or more. Indian leaders must stop the marginalisation of Muslim women.”
