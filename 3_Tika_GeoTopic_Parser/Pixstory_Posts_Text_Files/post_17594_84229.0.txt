The Los Angeles Lakers came up short against the L.A. Clippers, failing to capitalize on their second-half surge to snatch a win.

The Lakers fell 16 points behind the Clippers in the second quarter but rallied back after halftime, hurting their opponents in transition. However, the Purple and Gold lost momentum during the chaotic end of the game that included a controversial, long review of an out-of-bounds call on LeBron James.

Carmelo Anthony then missed a 3-point attempt that would have tied the game in the final seconds, leading to the Lakers falling five games below the .500 mark again. It’s not the first time the Purple and Gold had a win snatched away from their hands this season, but Anthony doesn’t think the team’s performance in crunch time poses a problem.

“If you look back at a couple games last week, the Utah game we were down, came back and we pulled that one out,” he said. “Tonight, we were down, came back, had the lead and [Amir] Coffey made a free throw to put them up one and we wound up losing this game. It happens. It’s not something that I can pinpoint as far as why we lose the close games. On the other hand, sometimes we win the close games.

“I don’t think it comes down to the last 30 seconds or the last minute. The shot I even took, if I make the shot we win the game and we’re sitting here talking about something different. We dug ourselves a hole. We had to fight back after a long break. Fight your way back out of the hole down 15, down 16.

“That takes a lot out, especially early. But we crawled our way back. We had a chance to win the game. We had the game in our hands with a minute and some change to go. This is a game we’re supposed to win.”

The Lakers have played 35 games during which they were within five points from their opponents in the last four minutes of the game, the most in the NBA. They have won 17 of those matchups.
