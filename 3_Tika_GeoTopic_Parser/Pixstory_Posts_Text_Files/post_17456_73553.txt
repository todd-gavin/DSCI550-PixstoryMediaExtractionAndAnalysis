Real Madrid face off against PSG in the round of of the UEFA Champions League in February It s going to be a really interesting game that could go both ways I think Real Madrid might have a slight edge over PSG considering the fact that they re a better team whereas PSG have individuals that on paper are arguably better than some of Madrid s players What makes it fun or interesting for PSG is knowing that every single one of the players in their frontline has the talent and skill to turn the game in PSG s favor Whether that actually works out for them is a different discussion However there should be alarming signs in and around the PSG head offices Kylian Mbappe who has easily been their best player this season has suffered an injury that could keep him out for a few weeks at the very least We don t know whether it s just a strain or something much more serious but adductor injuries generally take a few weeks to completely heal Since Real Madrid play PSG on February it looks like Mbappe may miss the first leg of the tie That would be a real blow to PSG s chances of going through to the quarter finals of the Champions League Neymar Jr and Lionel Messi have struggled with injury problems and form Mbappe has dragged the team towards the finish line so many times already this season and he has become their main man even with Neymar Jr and Messi around him It s astonishing how he s taken this much responsibility at that age and PSG will sorely miss that if he doesn t feature against Real As for Los Blancos it s obviously good news They can try to make the best out of this situation and win by as many goals as possible in the first leg It ll give them a much needed cushion before the second leg at home
