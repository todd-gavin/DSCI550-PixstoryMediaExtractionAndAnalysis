South Korea’s Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against its military’s decades-long ban that criminalizes sex in nonmilitary settings according to parameters that target queer and transgender people.

South Korea’s Military Criminal Act has previously been used to imprison soldiers with up to two years in prison, for having sex that was consensual and off military grounds.

“The specific ideas of what constitutes as indecency has changed accordingly with the changes in time and society. The view that sexual activity between people of the same sex is a source of sexual humiliation and disgust for objective regular people and goes against decent moral sense can hardly be accepted as a universal and proper moral standard for our times,” Chief Justice Kim Myeong-su said in the decision. 

A first lieutenant and a master sergeant, who were sentenced to jail for having sex off-military grounds and off-duty hours, now have their verdicts struck down.

The Supreme Court ruling referred to these anti-LGBTQI+ punishments as an infringement upon the “right to equality, the dignity and value as human and the right to pursue happiness as guaranteed by the Constitution."

South Korea’s military has been infamous for its discrimination and targetting of queer and trans soldiers: Byun Hui-su, a trans soldier was discharged from service in 2020 for accessing lifesaving gender-affirming healthcare, and later died by suicide.
