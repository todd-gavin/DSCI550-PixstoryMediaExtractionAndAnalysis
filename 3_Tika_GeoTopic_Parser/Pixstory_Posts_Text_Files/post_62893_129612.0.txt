(Fair warning, I haven't tried to climb it. ðŸ˜‚)

Everest is one of the most famous mountains in the world, and as we all know, the highest on Earth, and it's been climbed by thousands of people. However, only a handful of people have ever reached the top, it's estimated that only around 10% of people who attempt to climb it successfully make it to the top â€“ and those are usually professional mountaineers who have years of training and experience.

Even for these mountaineers, Everest is still a very difficult climb. It takes months or even years to train for it, and most people don't make it past the Base Camp (the first camp at an altitude of 5,000 to 8,000 meters above sea level). Only about 10% of people who attempt Everest actually make it to the summit (69 out of around 200 who have attempted it so far).

Though Everest may be incredibly difficult to climb, there are other mountains out there that are just as challenging. For example, Mount Kilimanjaro is Africa's highest mountain and it's considered one of the most difficult climbs in the world. It can take between four and six months to complete, and even then, only around 50% of climbers reach the summit!

So if you're looking to climb Everest, or even some other mountain, someday, you'll need to be prepared for a long and difficult journey. And remember â€“ always use your head while climbing mountains!
