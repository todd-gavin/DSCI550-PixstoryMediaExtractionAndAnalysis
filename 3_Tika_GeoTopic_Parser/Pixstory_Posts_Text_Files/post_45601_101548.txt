Rebecca and Jack Kevin Randall and Kate Over four chaotic decades of love war and a fatefully broken slow cooker six seasons and a total of actors played the Pearson mom dad and children Add in the many tears shed by This Is Us fans as well as the typical accessory of a box of tissues As NBC s time traveling family drama airs its final episode at p m EDT Tuesday it all comes down to one last good cry Various news portals have reported that Dan Fogelman the show s creator feels confident in his decision to leave fans wanting more which is unusual for television which has no qualms about milking a popular series for all it s worth and then some If we had done anything different it would have happened because of the wrong reasons Fogelman said A lot of them are lovely reasons because I enjoy these people so much that I work with because the show is lucrative because it s so successful But creatively I feel we ve done the right thing The story was always complete in his imagination to the point that he knew what the final five minutes would look like We knew enough that I d say about half if not more of the final episode was shot three or four years ago Let s hope that the end satisfies the fans
