Abstract 

Background/Objective 

Emphysematous cystitis (EC) is a rare urinary tract infection typically associated with severe diabetes in older women. We present a unique case of this gas forming infection in a man with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with empagliflozin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of EC associated with the use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). 

Case Report 

A 62-year-old man with T2DM treated with an SGLT2i, developed EC. His moderately controlled T2DM was treated for over 20 years with metformin, saxagliptin/metformin, and pioglitazone to which empagliflozin was added due to his consistently elevated HbA1c, slightly reduced GFR, and proteinuria. Four months after initiation of the SGLT2i, he reported lower urinary tract symptoms and was found to have EC radiographically. His urine cultures were positive for Klebsiella pneumonia and was found to have asymptomatic urinary retention. He was treated conservatively, and his outcome was favorable. 

Discussion 

EC is commonly seen in patients with diabetes mellitus, and symptoms range from asymptomatic to severe sepsis. Most urine cultures grow Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia. The association of increased UTIs in susceptible T2DM patients with use of SGLT2i is still being determined. Most cases of EC are diagnosed radiographically and; treated conservatively, although some cases require surgical intervention. 

Conclusion 

Initially, our patient was considered a good candidate for treatment with an SGLT2i. The subsequent development of EC precluded its further use. The role of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM susceptible to UTI is controversial.
