Giacomo Raspadori sinks England in Milan and relegates them from Group A3 to League B of the Nations League with one game still to play; England's wait for open play goal stretches to five matches; Gareth Southgate booed after full-time
England were relegated to League B of the Nations League which ramps up concerns about the prospects of Southgate's side two months out from the World Cup.
The England boss will be left in no doubt about the feelings of the fans as he was again booed after the game when going to clap the 4,000 away fans inside the San Siro. His side are now without a win in five - their worst run in eight years - and have major problems to address before they go to Qatar.
When asked about the full-time boos, he said: "I understand the reaction at the end because that's the results we've had in this competition. It's an understandable emotional reaction."
After an uninspiring first half in Milan, where England's 3-4-3 system and Bukayo Saka's role at left wing-back didn't look right, they were undone on 68 minutes when Napoli's Giacomo Raspadori was allowed to bring down a long ball in the box and bend into the far corner after Kyle Walker stepped off.
England failed to create a serious chance from their 14 efforts of goal whilst Gianluca Scamacca and Giovanni Di Lorenzo both hit the woodwork for the Italians.
Despite the clear problems with their ability to create clear cut chances, Southgate believed his side took "a step in the right direction" ahead of the World Cup.
He said: "It's difficult for me to be too critical of the performance. We had more possession, more shots, more shots on target. For large parts of the game we played very well. We didn't deal with the decisive moment defensively and we had moments where we could have been more decisive in thier final third.
