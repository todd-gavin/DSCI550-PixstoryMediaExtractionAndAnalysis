America is burning in debates on Abortion Many people are addressing and talking about the issue taking a stand on the issue I say who are you to have an opinion on someone else s body If it s her body it s her right to decide whether she needs a child or not I say it s a choice to bear children not a mandatory rule Many parents force their children to get married settle down and have children This pressure is so huge Many women bear children when they are not ready to have one Some women and men don t want to have children It could be for many reasons maybe they don t want to have a responsibility just because everyone else has They might not have an affinity towards children or whatever End of the day reasons doesn t matter as it s their choice whether or not they want to have a child especially a woman They are no such thing as a child making women complete Some people are complete without children and some don t feel that way All I am saying as it is the choice of a woman to have a child she can also choose not to have one Count in Asexual people Nobody has anything to do with one s choice especially on things like this We all know the traumas of bad parenting and it is always good to have no children rather than be a bad parent I believe this thought rests in many of the people who choose not to have children When we become parents an ocean of insecurities comes with it and we drown in it and most of the time we drown our children true If people could choose let them choose in this new world and make decisions good for themselves
