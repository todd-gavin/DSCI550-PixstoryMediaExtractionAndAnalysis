On June 24, 1987, in Rosari, Argentina, Luis Lionel Andres Messi was given the name Lionel Messi. One of the world's best football players hails from a modest upbringing. In reality, his parents were unable to pay for his $900 per month medication after he was diagnosed with a growth hormone shortage at the age of 11.
