It takes around two hours from the district headquarters at Sasaram to reach the foot of the hill over which is the Rohtas Fort. The fort is situated at about 1500 feet above sea level. There are about 2000 odd limestone steps at Medha Ghat meant for the most common mode of ascent to the fort on foot at present. For the visitor they are an exhausting climb of an hour and a half. At the end of the climb, one reaches the boundary wall of the fort. A lovely waterfall is seen during the rains, which falls over the fortifications, and is mesmerizing to watch and hear from a distance. A dilapidated gate with a cupola can be seen, which is first of several provided for well-guarded entrances to the fort. From here one has to walk another mile or so before the ruins of Rohtas can be seen.


Early Period :- 


In the Harivamsa Purana it is stated that Rohita, the son of Harishchandra, had Rohitpura constructed with a view of consummation of his dominion (Buchanan, Appendix C). Even though the Fort is ascribed to have been constructed by the legendary Rohitaswa, son of the great King Harish Chandra, there are no historical remains to corroborate the existence of early kings on the fort. The oldest historical record found on the fort is an inscription which is ascribed to the 7th century, thereby implying the existence of the rule of Sasanka in the 7th century over Rohtas.
