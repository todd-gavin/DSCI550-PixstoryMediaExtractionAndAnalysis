Normal blood sugar levels are necessary for a properly functioning body. Sugar (glucose) is found in your blood and is your body's main source of energy.1 During digestion, carbohydrates (e.g., sugars, starches, and fiber) are turned into glucose. Your body can use glucose for energy, or store whatever it doesn't use in your cells for later.
 
Your blood sugar level is influenced by the food you eat, your age, stress, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. Your blood sugar can also be affected by heart conditions and diabetes.
What Are Normal Blood Sugar Levels After Eating ? 
If you want to get an idea of what your normal blood sugar levels are, you'll need to check them. Your provider might want you to check at different times of the day, but you can start by checking your blood glucose levels one to two hours after eating.
Seeing what your blood sugar is after a meal or snack can help you better understand how your levels are affected by the food you eat as well as when you eat.
If you have diabetes, checking your blood sugar regularly helps you figure out if you're taking the right dose of insulin (and if not, you can talk to your provider about your dose).
However, your target blood sugar range will depend on:
1 Your age
2 Whether you have diabetes and how long you've had it
3 Whether you have complications from diabetes
4 Whether you have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
5 Any other health conditions you have (such as heart disease)
Target Blood Glucose Levels After Meals by Age
Your target blood sugar level after eating will depend on how old you are, whether or not you have diabetes and how you are treating it (e.g., with insulin), and whether or not you are pregnant.
