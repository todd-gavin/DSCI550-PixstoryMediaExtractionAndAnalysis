We have a reliability problem after the last few races, it seems obvious to me the words of a disconsolate Charles Leclerc after yet another retirement due to problems with the Ferrari Quest today the failure affected the power unit and on lap 20 he had to give up despite being firmly in the lead of the race I can&#39;t find the right words to describe what I feel and I don&#39;t want to add much. even earlier in the last Gp he had done it directly on the track in connection with the pits There are three races where the competitiveness is there but for one reason or another the result does not arrive We have to do a reset and start again with the usual motivation but we cannot ignore these points lost The drivers&#39; standings see the RedBull duo in the lead and Leclerc far behind in third place Same thing for the RedBull teams&#39; standings with more points than Ferrari There are more points gone Leclerc said again They are many and they hurt There is little else to add Looking at the glass half full No now I can&#39;t find any positive points from this race
