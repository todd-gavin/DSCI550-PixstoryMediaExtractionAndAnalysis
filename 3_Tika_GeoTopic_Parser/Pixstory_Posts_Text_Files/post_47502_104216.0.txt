Crestfallen, way past the glory days and mounted with an insurmountable weight of future
turmoil. Leicester City isn't a club one would ideally want to be at, at the moment.

This
season serves as a stark reminder of the unwavering fact that the Foxes are and have been
for sometime now â€” in decline. Brendan Rodgers' team could only manage an eighth place
Premier League finish, and a relegation from the Europa league, later crashing out of the
Conference League semi-final to eventual champions AS Roma.

They finished well below seventh place West Ham United in the league, leaving them with little to fight for as the final gameweeks approached. Rodgers will hope the club trusts him
with another season at the helm, as a summer of big changes awaits. Following two
consecutive 5th placed finishes, this season was a very unconvincing drop in their much
coveted progress under Brendan Rodgers.

Season Overview:

For the most part, It's been a season of massive inconsistencies for Leicester. It started that
way with two losses against West Ham United and Man City and it sure did end that way,
with the period between October 2021 and March 2022 being the worst of them all.

Across
16 games during the same time, Leicester failed to win two games in a row. This, thanks to
the fact that the team was mostly overburdened with expectations over a short course of
time where they competed in a string of high intensity matches.

Brendan Rodgers was forced to change his set up time and again, playing a variety of
players across three different systems. With the likes of Ayoze Perez, James Maddison and
Youri Tielemans having occupied multiple positions across the campaign. The 3-0 loss to
Chelsea in October last year followed a period of major inconsistency and doubt. Injuries to
the likes of Ryan Bertrand, Wesley Fofana, Ricardo Pereira, Jonny Evans, Jamie Vardy and
Wilfred Ndidi constantly kept the side in rotation.
