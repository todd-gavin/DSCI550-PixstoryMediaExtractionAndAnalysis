You can stop swimming now, Lily. We finally reached the shore"
This is truly a masterpiece. I physically couldn't put it down because it had me hooked from chapter one. Please check the TW before reading this one. The story was so heartfelt and perfect. Every aspect, each character, the whole plot - it all came together so well. It had me crying and laughing through the tears. All CoHo books are superior but this one has a vice grip on me.
SPOILERS:
I feel in love with Ryle along with Lily. I wished so much that he wasn't abusive and could learn to love Lily the right way. I wished for more Atlas content because love that guy to the bones. I'm glad and proud Lily didn't end up being like her mother and was brave enough to take the risk knowing that there was a possibility that she could fail. I enjoyed every second of their story and wish I had picked up this one earlier.
