NDTV reported that after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military campaign in eastern Ukraine, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made a last-minute appeal to Putin to end the conflict 'in the name of humanity.' 
"President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia," Guterres urged after a Security Council emergency meeting on Ukraine.

A war between Ukraine and Russia would be terrible for Ukraine and far-reaching for the global economy, according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
