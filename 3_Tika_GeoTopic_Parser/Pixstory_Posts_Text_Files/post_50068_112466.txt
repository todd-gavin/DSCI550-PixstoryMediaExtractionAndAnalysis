 Are you the new person drawn toward me BY WALT WHITMAN Are you the new person drawn toward me To begin with take warning I am surely far different from what you suppose Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy d satisfaction Do you think I am trusty and faithful Do you see no further than this fa ade this smooth and tolerant manner of me Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya illusion The poet speaks to a new admirer telling him I am surely far different from what you suppose His faithfulness and tolerance are but a facade Is the person advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man or is this mere maya or illusion Whitman knew the complexness of love and the relationship between master and disciple He warns his disciples that he is very distinct from their image of him This warning is the only favorable statement in this poem the rest is made up of rhetorical questions dealing with the poet s facade Source Cliffnotes
