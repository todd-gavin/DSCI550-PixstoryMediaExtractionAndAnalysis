While Netflix seems to be spending its money primarily on mainstream shows like “Emily In Paris” and “Stranger Things”, it is shows like “After Life” that really define it’s ability to show the highest, most effective form of content. 

The show depicts the life of Tony, a middle aged man who has lost his wife due to cancer and is now trying to make sense of the world without his wife, while the past two seasons were both hilarious and heart wrenchingly beautiful, the third season had it’s moments, and capitalised on those moments in the best way possible, in my opinion, the finale episode of the series has to go down as one of the greatest ever tv episodes and one of the greatest ever ending provided to a TV show.

One of the elements that make this show so brilliant and binge worthy is its fusion of a very devastating story in a setting which isn’t filled with sorrow, but life. Ricky Gervais fuses the incredibly sad life of Tony after the death of his wife with different characters, characters who might not have become a part of his life if not for the tragedy, showing that in life, the unexpected always happens. 

For me, this show has to go down as one of the greatest things Ricky has ever created, with dialogues so crisp that they hit your heart and make you think about both, Life and “After Life”. With most Hollywood and Netflix content seemingly hell bent on providing a bleak ending, After Life steer clears of that and creates a rather poetic and symbolic ending which won’t be revealed in this review as you have to see it with your own eyes. 

At the end, I will just say that After Life is more than a show, it  is an experience, an experience of loving their office environment, an experience of the love all the characters share, an experience of their grief, an experience of calling Brandy the good girl that she is but most importantly, an experience to see Tony being Tony.
