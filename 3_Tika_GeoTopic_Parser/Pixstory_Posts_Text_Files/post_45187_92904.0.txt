This year's World Cup is bound to be one of the most unique international tournaments football has seen in a long long time. Not only is it the first time a middle-eastern country is hosting a tournament of such prominence, Qatar 2022 also brings with it a whole host of other "never seen before" features at a World Cup.


What's being talked about here though, is the fact that the World cup takes place in a tiny country.

 This one being almost a miniature model as compared to the previous two hosted by Brazil and Russia respectively. With travel time to and from stadiums close to negligible, fans can now attend multiple games on a single day.

 This has never been the case before in the World Cup's 90 year history, since the days of the Jules Rimet Cup.


Ex-Chelsea and Man City winger believes this is an added benefit not just for the spectators but also for the footballers taking part in many many high intensity games of football across 28 days.


"When you travel long distances, especially when the games are coming thick and fast, it does tire you out.

 So it will benefit the players as they will be well rested," Wright-Phillips toldÂ Goal.


Having eliminated travel time between game venues and hotels, this does a considerable amount of good for the athletes.


"They are not going to have back problems or strained thighs due to long journeys. So I think it will benefit everybody," he added.


The question over whether or not players endure physical and mental fatigue as a result of many long hours of travelling is a no brainer. 

Furthermore, there's multiple studies conducted across various sample sizes to prove the same. Wright-Phillips believes this is by far the best addition to this year's World Cup. More so for the players than the fans.
