President Joe Biden mourned 1 million American deaths from Covid-19 and used the occasion to urge Congress to pass more funding to control the pandemic.

During the White House's latest virtual Global Covid-19 Summit, Biden reflected on the pandemic's havoc on the nation after more than two years.

According to CNN Biden said"This pandemic isn't over. Today, we mark a tragic milestone here in the United States -- 1 million Covid deaths. One million empty chairs around the family dinner table. Each irreplaceable, irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, forever changed because of this pandemic. Our hearts go out to all those who are struggling," 

"

In a proclamation published ordering flags to be flown at half-staff to mark the milestone, Biden wrote that the nation "must not grow numb to such sorrow."

The pandemic has harmed the aged Americans and the minority population more. About three-quarters of all Covid-19 deaths have been among seniors, and while racial and ethnic disparities have reduced throughout the pandemic, the risk of dying from Covid-19 has been about two times higher for Black, Hispanic and American Indian people compared with White people in the US.

Vaccinations surely have saved millions of lives, but about half of all Covid-19 deaths in the US have happened over the past year -- a time in which vaccines have been widely accessible for everyone age 5 and older.

The pandemic is here and continuing, it is our responsibility to take care and stay away from the risk of infection.
