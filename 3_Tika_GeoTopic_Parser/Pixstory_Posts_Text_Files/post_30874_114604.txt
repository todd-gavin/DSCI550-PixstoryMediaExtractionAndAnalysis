Novak Djokovic conquered his eighth final in the Wimbledon tournament the fourth in a row and on Sunday challenged Nick Kyrgios for the title The Serbian defeated the home idol Cameron Norrie with the score in hours and minutes of the game As in the previous match played with Jannik Sinner Djokovic got off to a bad start conceding the first set to Norrie who exalted the British public The reigning champion then straightened out the match by winning the second set with a break in the eighth game and extended in the third set by exploiting the mistakes of a Norrie who seemed to accuse the hit The fourth set opens with another break for Djokovic then the English raises the quality of the game but fails to break the Serbian&#39;s serve so that on Sunday he will be able to pursue his seventh success on the London grass
