Five decades ago, on this day, Neil Armstrong became the first man to step on the Moon. 
On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11, also known as Eagle, landed on the Moon with astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin inside. About six-and-a-half hours later, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon.

At 10:56 p.m., Armstrong stepped onto the Moon and uttered his now-famous statement: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

Twenty minutes later, Aldrin joined him, and two astronauts spent the night on the Moon before heading back for Earth the next day.

They left behind an American flag to honour the mission and a plaque that said," "here, men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind."
