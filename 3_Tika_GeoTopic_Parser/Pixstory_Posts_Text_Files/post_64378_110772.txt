Awkward moments are some of the worst to be honest They just make you feel that indescribable weird feeling from inside out And there s too many to recount a single one But let s see There was this time when i was a kid maybe I was in the supermarket with my mother I wanted her to buy me a burger And i was quite persistent as a kid maybe even now I remember determinedly going off to find some place selling burgers And when i found it for someone reason i had decided that my mother was right behind me I grabbed hold of the nearest person to me dragged them to the place i found and turned around to tell them to do just what i wanted Annnnnd it was some random guy He looked hella amused And at that age i was too self absorbed to even care so i literally turned around and walked off like i didn t give a damn However looking back now I m glad i was a kid who didn t care about being in such an embarassing situation Because the person i am today would have wanted the earth to just split open and swallow me whole And that ladies and gentlemen was one of my MANY awkward embarassing moments
