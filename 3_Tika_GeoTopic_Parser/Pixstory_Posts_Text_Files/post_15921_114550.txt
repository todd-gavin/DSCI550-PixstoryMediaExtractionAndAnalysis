Abstract Type diabetes mellitus is seen in approximately of children under age of globally One of the complications of uncontrolled diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis which is seen in about of children with type diabetes mellitus by years of age We describe a case of intestinal ischemia due to diabetic ketoacidosis in a year old patient with a history of poorly controlled type diabetes mellitus who ultimately survived and now thriving due to early surgical intervention Introduction An otherwise healthy year old female with known history of type diabetes mellitus presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis and hypovolemic shock After her admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit she became progressively more distended and obtunded Computed tomography of the abdomen showed pneumatosis of the small intestine and portal venous gas with lactate of mmol L Decision was made to take the patient urgently to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy At laparotomy approximately cm of gangrenous jejunum was found resected and left in discontinuity On second look hours later an additional cm of proximal ileum was resected Patient returned to the operating room for a third look and distal ileum with patchy necrosis was resected With the remaining small bowel measuring approximately cm with intact ileocecal valve the child was re anastomosed The child survived this complicated course of operations and recovery and is now thriving on diabetic controlled diet Conclusion Intestinal ischemia due to uncontrolled diabetes and DKA is rare To our knowledge this case is one of few cases that showed favorable outcome of DKA induced intestinal ischemia as a result of early surgical intervention We highlight the importance of early surgical intervention in these patient population as its associated morbidity and mortality is high if the disease progresses and surgical intervention is delayed Read more
