Francesca Esposito Social sector manager of Marenostrum underwater section of Archeoclub D Italia The sea is a resource a heritage to be protected but also and above all a right a right that everyone must be able to enjoy In the Sorrento Peninsula together with the surmountable beach committee we have managed to grow over the years the number of lidos which, in compliance with existing regulations, have decided to break down architectural barriers and allow everyone to enjoy the sea. Now the goal is to export this model to other Italian regions as well. The project that we are going to present in Naples is of considerable importance, declared Rosario Santanastasio National President of Archeoclub D Italia as regards the promotion of the environmental heritage which must be accessible to all Unfortunately we still have part of our Italian coast which is not accessible to people with disabilities Instead we must arrive at an accessibility that is of and in particular its own in places where naturalistic and archaeological environmental riches meet
