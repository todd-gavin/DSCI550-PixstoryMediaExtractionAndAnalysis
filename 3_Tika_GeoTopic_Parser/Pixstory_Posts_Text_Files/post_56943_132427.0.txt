Interestingly, different types of impostor syndrome can occur in other individuals. Like the perfectionist who believes that his perfect personality traits are not good as it is deceiving people by making him look perfect, which he is not.
Then there's the expert, who is not satisfied with the knowledge or abilities they have in their field and thinks there is more for them to learn. They haven't reached the zenith of it, considering this is not necessarily negative, but the persistent thought that harms the individual can aggravate the syndrome.
Another one here is a natural genius. In this type, "you may feel like a fraud simply because you don't believe you are naturally intelligent or competent. You feel like an imposter if you don't get something right the first time or it takes you longer to master a skill."
There's also a solicist, who feels like an impostor because of asking someone for help to reach a certain level or status.
And because the individual can't get there on his own, he questions his competence and abilities.
Lastly, there is a superperson who thinks he should achieve the highest degree of his work; if he doesn't, he is a fraud.
The nagging and occurring of these thoughts make it difficult for the person to achieve their goals, and they're constantly trapped in this circle.
