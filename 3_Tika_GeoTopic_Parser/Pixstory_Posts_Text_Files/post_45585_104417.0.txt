Season 4 of All American has arrived on Netflix, and if you're scared about finishing the series in case it doesn't return, don't be! A fifth season is in the works, and it will premiere on Netflix in 2023 according to an existing arrangement. 

To refresh your memory, All American is The CW's blockbuster sports drama series that premiered in 2018. Since 2018, four seasons have been released, the most current of which premiered in October 2021 and will conclude in May 2022. On May 31st, Netflix released all 20 episodes of the season in the United States. 

WON said that, at The CW, the show's future is assured. 

The CW officially renewed All American in late March 2022, along with a number of other shows like The Flash, Nancy Drew, and Walker.

Production listings suggest that season 5 will begin filming in Los Angeles throughout Summer of 2022.

Given the show doesn’t seem to be impacted by COVID delays anymore, we’re currently expecting the show to return to its regular October airdate slot and if we assume 20 episodes again, it’ll run until May 2023. If it follows in the footsteps of seasons 1 and 2 with 16 episodes, it’ll likely finish up in March 2023.
