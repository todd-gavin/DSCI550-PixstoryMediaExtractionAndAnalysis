What actually could be the way of understanding that you have certain ingrained fears that have grown over time, and now you have developed agoraphobia?
It could be a little perplexing as most anxiety disorders have the same sets of reactions and notions, albeit some are precisely different.
Like here, people with agoraphobia could be scared of things like leaving their home for extended periods, being alone in a social situation, losing control in a public place, and being afraid of being in places where it would be difficult to escape, such as a car or elevator. Also, they feel anxious or agitated when detached or estranged from others.
As it often falls back to panic attacks, people should be aware of how these attacks can occur.
It can include chest pain, racing heart
shortness of breath, dizziness, trembling, choking, sweating, hot flashes, chills, nausea, diarrhoea, numbness, and tingling sensations.
