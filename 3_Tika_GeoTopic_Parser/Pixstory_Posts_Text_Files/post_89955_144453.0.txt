3. Vs Tommy Haas, French Open 2009 Round of 16
After Rafael Nadal’s early exit in the 2009 French Open, all hopes were on Roger to finally complete his Career Slam. But that didn’t come too easy, as in the Fourth Round he faced Germany Tommy Haas. Federer was down 2 sets to love and facing a breakpoint to go down 5-3in the third. He hit a perfect forehand winner to save that virtual match point and then broke in the next game. The momentum completely changed and Federer was all over Haas after that. Against his usually not-so-good pressure play, he raised his level and proved that he is a true champion.

One of the matches that would be etched in the minds of not just Roger fans but Nadal fans too. The 2017 final was a showdown between the two greats as both of them were coming back from injuries. The match was the ninth Grand Slam final between the two. It was full of quality with both players trying to limit each other’s forehands with strong baseline plays.

straight games in a row to script a historic victory against his usual nemesis.

The Swiss legend completed his fifteenth major honor and answered many GOAT questions in the process.
