Aladdin had a magical lamp 
Due to someone’s deceitful trap
The lamp delivered his needs in his lap 

Except one fine day 
Overpowered by greed 
Aladdin demanded to be poverty freed with all the riches 
And in no time explored all the niches
With countless wealth at such young age
Sooner he felt that there was no purpose left to further  engage 

Thus he went to a sage
Only to learn , 
“It’s completely fine to yearn 
But at this stage without the lamp 
You would still have been working and undone
Earning with purpose and fun 
Life’s the best when you get things at the right orbit of the sun ( age)
When you are at the right phase you will smile tonne even with none”
