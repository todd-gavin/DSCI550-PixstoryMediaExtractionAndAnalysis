Growing up watching Animal Planet and Nat Geo Wild I grew a dislike and fear towards spiders since they were portrayed as poisonous and scary creatures ready to attack pounce and bite any being around them But once I got into photography I noticed how these insects are calm and have such intricate web designs In addition I love how they have such little beady eyes tiny furry legs and a cute round bottom All features that previously frightened me now look adorable It s all in perspective
