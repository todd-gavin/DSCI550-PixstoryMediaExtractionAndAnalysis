The start of ISL in India is an eye opener for everyone as kids today might not know many Indian National Football team players but they know almost every player that is there in the ISL clubs. The ISL has marketed the league very well and it feels like a grand festival. I witnessed it for the first time in Kerala during the first season when kids used to come in the colours of their own city club and everyone was cheering. I also got the opportunity to see it in Mumbai. We used to travel one and a half hours to watch the game, even helpers in the house used to ask for tickets for the game. Football touched every level of society in India with the advent of ISL.

Even parents who were hesitant to send their children to football training due to the contact nature of the sport started to send their kids with more passion. Kids started to develop their dreams around the ISL. Many of the kids I trained tell me that they want to play in the ISL. This has also helped to develop football at a grassroot level as small clubs also want to run themselves in a similar fashion to the ISL clubs.
