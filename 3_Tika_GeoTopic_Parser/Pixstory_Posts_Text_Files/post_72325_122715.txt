Ladies and gentlemen Lionel Messi is officially back in business Ever since completing his forced move to Paris Saint Germain last season due to the economic condition of FC Barcelona we had seen a changed version of himself He never looked happy and that reflected on his game But the underlying tone or reason of that happening was simply because he had probably not fit in with the style in which PSG play But now after having played with the team for over a year and having spent the pre season with the squad we could predict that Messi will make a return as far as his form is concerned and it couldn t be any truer The King is back with a bang Just a few days ago he scored a fabulous goal and provided an assist in the French Cup final against Nantes and now he has kicked off the Ligue season for PSG with a brilliant brace against Clermont Foot in an away match The first goal came from a between Messi and Neymar and the second goal is what s being talked about the most from this match Lionel Messi performed a bicycle kick to score his second goal of the night and it was his first ever bicycle kick goal Neymar fed him the ball inside the penalty box Messi received that with his chest and bicycle kicked it from over his head Apart from that he also assisted Neymar s goal PSG ended up winning the match by a pretty big margin of and thus they kicked off their Ligue campaign on a positive note
