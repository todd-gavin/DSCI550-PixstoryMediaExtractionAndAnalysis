Adoption is not always better than buying And we should not judge people who buy animals because having a pet is a very personal experience Let us take the example of dogs While saving a dog from euthanasia is the most compassionate course of action let s not be too critical of those who may prefer purebred dogs As TOI points out bringing a old dog home might seem simple but it s not Many times dogs have a particular behaviour problem that may not be acceptable for a home with young children senior citizens or single persons where the dog may be left alone during the day Having the chance to watch a puppy grow up is a huge benefit of getting one You might be able to consult the breeder for assistance if you purchase your puppy from them Moreover by learning about the breed and its pedigree you may make plans and anticipate the behaviour and medical needs of that breed This is effective if there is a youngster living there because there won t be much time left over to take care of the dog between all of the child s obligations Unrealistic expectations are a major factor in individuals abandoning their dogs The cruelty is present right there So let people choose a pure breed if they believe their home is better suited for one
