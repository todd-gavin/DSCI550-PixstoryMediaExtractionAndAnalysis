This day provides the best opportunity for cheese lovers to consume as much as they desire. 
It's National Cheese Day, and it's time to celebrate!

As Daysofyear says, National Cheese Day has been celebrated for a long time, and it has a long history of fun and, well, cheese. The day was originally observed in 1914, and its roots may be traced back to Monroe, Wisconsin in the United States. 

This day has been honoured biennially (every other year) in Monroe, WI for more than 100 years, and there are many various celebrations that take place during this occasion. A two-hour procession, traditional Swiss-Germanic music (waltzes and polkas), club stands, crafts, carnival rides, restaurants, and local food have all been known to take place. The celebration lasts not just for National Cheese Day, but for the entire weekend, with over 100,000 people attending each time it is conducted.

So what is your favourite kind of cheese?
