No matter your industry, problem solving skills are useful to tackle any obstacles you face while working. If employers know youâ€™re a good problem solver and capable of handling issues on your own (whether small or large), then thatâ€™s less for them to worry about.
It also means you can work through the core steps of solving a problem:
1. IDENTIFY the problem
Â Â Â Â  it is the ability to identify the nature of a problem, deconstruct it (break it down) and develop an effective set of actions to address the challenges related to it.
2. DEFINE the main elements of the problem
Â Â Â Â Â Â  It is an ability to break down the problem into small pieces, or smaller and more manageable parts by defining the main elements of the problem.
3. EXAMINE possible solutions
Â Â Â Â Â  Finding possible solutions is a very tricky step in the problem-solving process, as on the surface it looks like most of the work is already done and the ultimate goal is close. In reality, students should not just look for simplistic ways to address the elements of the problem. They should find the most effective ways and turn them into an opportunity to make a strong success story.
4. ACT on resolving the problem
Â Â Â Â  Developing a step-by-step execution plan and acting effectively and decisively is the final touch in the problem-solving process. 
5. LOOK for lessons to learn
Â Â Â Â  This is the moment to look back and see if there is a need to tune up the work that has been completed. Especially valuable is taking the time to evaluate the entire process and formulating the lessons to be learned so the next problem-solving project will be more effective and produce even more elegant solutions. 
While there are many types of problem solving skills, many are considered soft skills that you develop over time. 
Thank you ðŸ’– Have a great day.
