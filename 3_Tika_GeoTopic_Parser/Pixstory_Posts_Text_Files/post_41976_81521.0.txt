CUTTING DOWN ON CARBON
Carbon footprint, over the years has come out as a ‘trendy’ term acquired by corporates, economists and politicians alike. But there’s more than meets the eye in the menace it can leave on the already scarred earth. 
Inch by inch makes a cinch. If we think in terms of the ways we can reduce our carbon impression, then the aggregate consequences would be no less than a dream breathing alive. Giving a shot to public transport, buying local veggies, and similar deeds can propel us miles ahead in our race backwards; a race towards a bright future with splash of green.
