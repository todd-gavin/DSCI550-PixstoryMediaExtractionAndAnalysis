Has anyone ever gotten a sandwich made in one city and having it flown down to another Well I have And the story started years before the actual day My husband and I when we were yet to get married we were a couple with a modest income and couldn t afford five stars or expensive diners very often Our go to place was either barista cafe or subway for a sandwich The sandwich was a chicken which varied in flavours and a tuna sandwich grilled with cheese lots of jalape os olives some tomatoes and cucumbers lettuce no onions a dash of mint and Mayo sauce sometimes mustard We would split the sub into two and eat Unusual but our favourite date food Fast forward to many years later we are married and my pregnancy is difficult so I take a transfer to Kashmir to be around family All is well except I have very very strange craving for the subway tuna sandwich and there is no subway in Kashmir I get desperate and ask my colleague friend brother who had to go to Delhi to bring me a sandwich when back I give my list of sauces and veggies that need to go in and the ones that need to be left out Unable to remember he gets me to text it to him After days of waiting for his return and barely able to keep my craving at bay It seemed like an eternity till he comes back with the packet Almost squished with sauces drooling out of it bread somewhat soggy but still the sandwich I was dying to have The first bite felt like heaven the first blue light at sunrise Absolute bliss Yes my mouth is still watering as I write Tell me about ur favourite sandwich story
