Neera Arya was an unforgettable champion, soldier of the Rani Jhansi Regiment in the Azad Hind Fauj, who was designated as being secretive by the British governments.

Her father (Seth Chhajoomal) married her to an Investigation officer Shrikant Jairanjan Das, working as a spy (CID) for the British government.

Her husband doubted Neera then he started Neera Arya’s spying. In this time her husband quickly found the whereabouts of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Srikant fired on Netaji with his bullets which hit Subhash Chandra Bose driver and Netaji ran away and saved. She was a true nationalist, she saved Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s life by killing her husband. She was sentenced to black water for the murder of her husband.

Neera Arya was tortured every single day during her life imprisonment in Andaman (Kala Pani). 

The jailor one day asked her about the wherabouts of Netaji. She replied that he had died in a plane crash. The jailor insisted, stating that she was lying. Neera passionately answered that if Netaji lived in her heart, could he rip him out of there?

Immediately after, Neera's right breast was chopped off her body by a blacksmith.

Just a miniscule part of all the pain and torture that assembled for hundreds of years to bring India her freedom. 75 years since then, we are celebrating the day, the cause, the achievement. 

If we truly realize the means to this dear dear freedom, we will be the worthy successors. We will then deserve this freedom.

Jai Hind!
