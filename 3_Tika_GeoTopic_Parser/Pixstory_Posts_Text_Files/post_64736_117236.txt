The motif of windows suggests an ability to move between various states of mind Kevin s personalities learn to create their own window through which they can access control of Kevin s body and impressively diverse wardrobe Specifically Split examines the condition of suffering While the title most obviously reflects Kevin s goofed up noggin it also alludes to the idea of post traumatic growth The film posits that those who have experienced trauma are stronger and perhaps even further evolved than the dirty neanderthals who have not Have these individuals through their suffering unlocked the potential of the brain This hypothesis reflects Friedrich Nietzsche s axiom Out of life s school of war what does not destroy me makes me stronger a sentiment later echoed by philosopher Kelly Clarkson This idea is embodied literally in Kevin whose traumatic childhood first triggered his multiple personality disorder and ultimately leads him to become bulletproof Casey manifests this concept more subtly you know the way losers do At the end of the film The Beast spares Casey because he can tell she has suffered But from the beginning Casey s trauma translates into experience That helps her endure the horror of her forced sabbatical While Claire and Marcia are terrified and act basic as hell Casey is level headed and better able to communicate with Kevin s personalities And communication is important in all relationships even psychotic ones Indeed while The Beast is physically stronger than Casey the film makes the point that Casey s emotional resilience is the real MVP The Beast may be able to climb walls and shoot webbing from his wrists but he s an amoral creature who devours young girls without even cooking them no better than Casey s monstrous uncle or other animals The ending implies that rather than breaking her down further Casey s recent trauma has allowed her to find an elevated emotional state In contrast to her failure to defend herself as a child she is able to shoot The Beast when he attacks her a nice victory that ultimately accomplishes nothing And once she is rescued the film suggests she can finally break free from the abusive patterns of her past
