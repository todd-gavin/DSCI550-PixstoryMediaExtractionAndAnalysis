Coming from a non-Hindu background,  I never knew the significance of celebrating Raksha Bandhan. 
Around this time of every year ,  I hear a lot of my friends and family reminding me about this day , but I never made an effort to understand the reasons for commemorating this event .
But when I was in my 4th grade one day we had a small Raksha Bandhan celebration at school where we were asked to bring a  Rakhi and tie it on someone's wrist with whom we have a brother - like relation . 
And that day after that  event , teachers came to class as usual to teach . But one of my teachers took a moment to explain the historical background of this event . And that's when I came to know about this wonderful tale explaining the beautiful sibling bond between Draupadi and Krishna👫💜 (which is an excerpt from the epic Mahabharata). 
And from that day on , whenever I find any  of my friends confused about the purpose behind celebrating Raksha Bandhan ,  I straight away explain the whole tale to them with much eagerness.☺💫
And years later , I read another incident from the past related to Raksha Bandhan. It's an incident about Roxana(wife of Alexander the Great) and King Porus(the King of Pauravas). 
When Alexander invaded India , Roxana was much worried about his safety . And out of concern she sent a Rakhi to King Porus  and asked him to take care of Alexander and not to hurt him . And during the battle Porus noticed this Rakhi on his wrist and he chose to withdraw from the war inorder to not cause any harm to Alexander . And Porus lost that battle . Gratified by the act of Porus , Alexander offers Porus an authoritative post in the administration of his kingdom. 🤍🤍

🥰So , on this auspicious day let us celebrate and cherish our bond with our dear siblings and be eternally grateful for having such beautiful souls in our journey .🥰 

💜Happy Raksha Bandhan💜
