While skipping can be an easy way to lose weight, it also helps to build your heart health. Moderate intensity jumping helps to build cardiovascular endurance that can help you in any other sport you might choose. Research has shown that skipping also helps in improving bone density. Higher bone mineral density makes you less likely to develop osteoporosis later in life.. It is actually less strenuous on the knees and ankles than many other exercises. However, to get the desired results, you need to have correct form. 
It is a great cardio workout which can get your heart rate high. While the amount of calories burnt depends on the intensity of the exercise (slow skips vs fast double unders for example), duration and the person’s weight, skipping can burn over 350 calories in only 20 minutes for a man weighing 90kg.
