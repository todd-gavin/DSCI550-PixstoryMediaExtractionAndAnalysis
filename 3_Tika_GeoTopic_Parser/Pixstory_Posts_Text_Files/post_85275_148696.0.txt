3 Alessandro Nesta
The AC Milan legend who shone in every game and established himself as the club's greatest defender. Nesta was as well-known as Maldini at AC Milan, despite playing fewer games. He was a member of Milan's two Champions League and Serie A titles.
In high-pressing games, he is a completely dominant defender who can break down any attack and build up play from the back with his passing abilities. Nesta had every defensive feature a defender should have. He was strong in the air and an elegant defender who could win possession tactically. Nesta appeared in 326 games and won numerous club trophies.
2 Alessandro Costacurta
Costacurta patrolled AC Milan's defense and in his sight, no attacker could go beyond him. He was a paramount defender and gave his heart and soul to the club in his trophy-laden career at Milan.
Many pundits praise him for his defensive knowledge and ability to play well under pressure. He was a hardworking player with excellent distribution skills and the ability to read the game. He was tenacious, with exceptional tactical intelligence, as well as strong, precise tackling, and timing. Costacurta played 663 games for AC Milan, winning five Champions Leagues.
1 Paolo Maldini
No player in Milan's history will ever be able to match what Maldini has accomplished with the club, including being one of the few loyal players in club history to have his jersey number retired. Maldini was not an ordinary defender and was only a one-season wonder; he never received a red car during his playing career, which is surreal for a defender.
After 25 years at the club, he won every possible trophy and was inducted into the AC Milan Hall of Fame, appearing in 902 games and scoring 33 goals, with seven titles to his name.
