Machines and devices for a variety of industrial and everyday functions were invented by this prolific American inventor. 

Knight was believed to have invented a safety mechanism for controlling shuttles in powered textile looms when she was 12 years old, demonstrating her aptitude for tools and creativity from an early age. Britannica tells us that she devised an attachment for paper bag folding machinery that permitted the creation of square-bottomed bags in 1868, while living in Springfield, Massachusetts. She patented her idea in 1870 after labouring to enhance it in Boston. She went on to secure patents for a dress and skirt shield (1883), a robe clasp (1884), and a spit shield (1885). (1885). She went on to secure six patents for machinery used in shoe manufacture over the course of a few years.

A numbering machine and a window frame and sash, both patented in 1894, were among Knight's other innovations, as were other rotary engine-related items patented between 1902 and 1915. Despite the fact that she was not the first woman to acquire a patent, she was one of the most prolific female innovators, holding 27 patents. However, she did not make a lot of money from her efforts. Knight was referred to as a "woman Edison" in a local obituary when she died.
