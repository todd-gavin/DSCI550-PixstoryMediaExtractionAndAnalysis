Republican candidate for Congress J R Majewski made headlines recently when a controversy emerged following his military record coming into question According to him he served in Afghanistan following the attacks However official searches for his records have shown something different His military records show that he was stationed at Kadena Air Base in Japan and then spent months in Qatar loading and unloading aircraft at an airbase This revelation caused the National Republican Congressional Committee to divest million in ad spending that was skated for his tight race It s a shame that someone running for Congress would mislead the public about their military service We need less deceivers in power and more honest people
