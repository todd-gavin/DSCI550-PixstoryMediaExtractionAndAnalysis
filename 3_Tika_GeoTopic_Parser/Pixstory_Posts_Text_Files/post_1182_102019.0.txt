Monkeypox outbreaks detected in North America, Europe has made a comeback after 40 years- Do we need to worry. 

Dr ANOOP MISRA’S reply 
Monkeypox is like smallpox, but is less infectious and needs close and prolonged contact for spread. Some cases have been detected in North America and Europe. 

What we need to know 
Virus transmission is through respiratory droplets. Affected patients have fever, headache, body aches, enlarged lymph nodes. Rash starts with the face and then spreads to other parts of the body. 

Important Clinical Pointers (apart from fever, body aches, exhaustion), Monkeypox

Rash starts from the face and then evolves to arms and legs and then hands and feet. There are four stages of rash progression: macular (flat rash, 1-2 days), popular (raised rash, 1-2 days), vesicular (raised, filled with clear fluid, 1-2 days), to pustular(pus filled, 5-7 days)—before scabbing over and resolving (2-4 weeks).

A differentiating point from smallpox is development of swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Swelling of the lymph nodes may be generalized (involving many different locations on the body) or localized to several areas (e.g., neck and armpit).
