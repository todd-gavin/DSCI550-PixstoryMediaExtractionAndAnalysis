Since its inception in 1960, the Walk of Fame has been a constant draw for tourists eager to see the stars. The 18-block stretch attracts an estimated 10 million visitors per year.

The Walk of Fame was conceived in the 1950s by Hollywood business leaders as a means of beautifying the area's historic core.

On February 8, 1960, actresses Linda Darnell and Gigi Perreau, as well as veteran actors Francis X. Bushman and Charles Coburn, scooped up dirt with shovels.

Furthermore, approximately 500 stars on the walk are currently blank, serving as placeholders for future honorees.

Although the area near the famous intersection of Hollywood and Vine had been a focal point for the fledgling film industry prior to World War II, the area's glitz had long since faded by the time producer Stanley Kramer's star became the first to be set into the sidewalk on March 28, 1960.

The original plans called for 1,529 of Hollywood's biggest stars from film, stage, radio, television, and music to be immortalised in concrete using brass set in salmon-colored terrazzo stars surrounded by black backgrounds.

The Times discovered over 2,400 stars on the walk as of July 2013, representing 2,200 individuals or organisations.
