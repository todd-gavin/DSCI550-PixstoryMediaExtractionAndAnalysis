Prime Minister Narendra Modi will use video conferencing to inaugurate the 'Lifestyle for the Environment (LiFE) Movement,' a global endeavour. 
The launch, according to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), will kick off a "LiFE global call for papers," which will solicit ideas and suggestions from academics, universities, and research institutions around the world in order to influence and persuade individuals, communities, and organisations to adopt an environmentally conscious lifestyle.
