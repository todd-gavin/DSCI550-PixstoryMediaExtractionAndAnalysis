Andrea Belotti is still a player without a team and for days has been proposing himself as a possible new signing for Roma. Today on the eve of the match between the Giallorossi and Cremonese, journalists asked Mourinho about the former Torino captain. The Portuguese coach replied without giving any indication, saying it&#39;s just that his team lacks an attacking player and that at the moment all the forwards he has available are not at the same level in the squad When you don&#39;t have a player on the bench of the same level as the starting forwards it is obvious that no one can think that Felix is Shomurodov are at the level of Dybala and Abraham When you don&#39;t have this you try to do with what you have on the bench and at that moment I had experience of Matic and Wijnaldum who controlled the game It would be much nicer to end the game by scoring goals but we did it in another way If you ask me if I would like to have another striker I won&#39;t answer continued Pinto knows I just have to wait and if it can&#39;t be done let&#39;s go on with what we have If Bellotti is a player from Turin or another team I won&#39;t answer If it&#39;s true that he wants to come to Rome, I really like his attitude. Whether he comes or not, I can&#39;t tell you because I don&#39;t know
