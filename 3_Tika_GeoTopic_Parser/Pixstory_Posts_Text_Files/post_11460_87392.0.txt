Summer is here and cantaloupe can be your way to cool down. 

Cantaloupe mostly known as Musk Melon which has most of the Vitamin A and C with least calories. They are usually a part of juices and salads. 

Try this recipe of cantaloupe thick creamy and cool pudding to refresh your summer. 

Here is how it is made. 

Ingredients 

• ¼ cup rice 

• 1 tablespoon almonds blanched 

• 3 cup milk 

• ¼ cup thick puréed cantaloupe 

• ~¼ sugar 

• ⅛ teaspoon cinnamon powder 

• 1 tablespoon chopped cashew nuts, pistachios & pecans 

Instructions 

• Cook rice with twice the amount water until its well cooked and mushy. Meanwhile blanch the almonds and grind it in a mixer into a smooth paste. 

• Heat a pan and add the puréed almonds. Sauté it in a medium flame until the raw taste goes off.   

• Bring milk to a boil in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Simmer it and keep stirring constantly. Once the milk reduces and thickens, add the cooked rice and the puréed cantaloupe, almonds and sugar. 

• Keep stirring until it reaches a pudding consistency; thick and creamy. Roast the cashews in a tablespoon of ghee and add it. 

• Let it cool. Keep it in the refrigerator for an hour or so and serve it chilled. 

Some tips to follow 

You can also cook rice with half the amount water and half milk. This gives it a nice creamy taste. The cinnamon powder can also be substituted with cardamom powder. This will yield a slightly different taste. According to the cantaloupe's sweetness, reduce or increase the amount of sugar mentioned. Keep in mind that adding too much of cantaloupe can overpower the taste of pudding. Minimum quantity will be enough to get its flavour and essence. Always you can add a bit extra if you want. Since the amount of almond is little, you can skip this step and add the almond paste directly in the milk along with cantaloupe purée. I did it separately, just in case if it needed more time to cook.
