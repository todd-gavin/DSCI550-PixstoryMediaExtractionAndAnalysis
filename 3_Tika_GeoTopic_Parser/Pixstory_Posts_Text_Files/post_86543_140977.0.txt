The Panini Fifa World Cup sticker book for Qatar 2022 is out, but how many stickers do you need and how much will it cost to complete it in full? Let HITC Sport offer you a rundown…
For many fans – young and old – completing the sticker book is part of the tradition of the quadannual Fifa event. But long gone are the days when a pack of four stickers would cost supporters just 5p, with the current sets of five stickers setting fans back a whopping 90p.
Sticker books have been associated with World Cups for more than 50 years now, with the first launched with Mexico 1970. That year’s album made ‘got, got, need’ one of the most-said phrases whenever a tournament rolls around, as fans traded their way to a full squad.
That is according to Paul Harper, a mathematician at Cardiff University, who found that the 2018 World Cup sticker book for the Russia tournament required almost 5,000 stickers, or 967 packets. That worked out at almost £774 at the time, as packets rose from 50p to 80p.
Without ever getting any duplicates, which is near enough impossible, it would have taken 137 packets of five stickers to complete the 2018 book. That would have worked out at a cost of £110, when the album had 682 stickers – including coaches, stadiums and legends.
Despite Panini reducing the number of stickers needed to complete the 2022 World Cup book, inflation has meant the price of packets for the latest album has risen again to 90p. Now, football finance expert Kieran Maguire estimates it would cost £884 to complete it.
