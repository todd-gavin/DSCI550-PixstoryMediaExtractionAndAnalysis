The midfielder last represented Arsenal in October 2020. Following this, Matteo Guendouzi was loaned out to Bundesliga club Hertha BSC for the 2020/21 season and Ligue 1 club Marseille for the 2021/22 season. 

As per Mirror UK, Matteo Guendouzi had completed a permanent move to Marseille. The French club will reportedly pay £9 million to secure the services of the former Arsenal midfielder. 

Guendouzi's time at Arsenal was marred by controversy in his last few months. Hence it is no surprise that the Frenchman took a parting shot at Arsenal once his transfer was finalized.

The French midfielder said "There were very good discussions with the Marseille president, the coach, and people in my family. We made the best decision altogether. For me, it's the best choice I've made in many years."

Matteo Guendouzi is reportedly set to sign a 3-year contract with the French outfit. This deal would keep the Frenchman employed with Marseille until June 2026. 

Since arriving at Marseille, the Frenchman has become a vital part of the team's setup. Guendouzi has made 38 appearances for Ligue 1 side, scoring 4 goals. 



Why did Guendouzi fall out with Arteta? 

Matteo Guendouzi reportedly had an altercation with one of his teammates in a training session in February 2020. Arsenal's sporting director Edu also told off the youngster following the incident. 

After this, the Frenchman grabbed the neck of Brighton & Hove Albion's Neal Maupay in a league game in April 2020. He also reportedly mocked the Brighton players for their low wages. 

All of this finally forced Mikel Arteta's hand and the Spaniard let Matteo Guendouzi know. Since then, the Frenchman was not allowed to play for Arsenal again.
