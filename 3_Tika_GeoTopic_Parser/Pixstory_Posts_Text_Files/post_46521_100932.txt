Food For me is more than survival With it i make friends and count my blessings The sharing of food has always been part of the human story If i ask you Have you ever wondered what the food you eat everyday can tell you about where you come from Have you ever wondered why people from different parts of the world eat different types of food Do you ever ask yourself why certain foods or culinary traditions are so important to your culture There is more of a connection between food and culture than you may think I grew up eating the food of different cultures Many of us associate food from our childhood with warm feelings and good memories and it ties us to our families Almond All of Us Are from Delhi and By saying this We all know That how lovely and Tasty the food of Delhi is But As the world becomes more globalized it is easier to access cuisines from different countries It s important to remember that each dish has a special place in the culture to which it belongs and is special to those who prepare it Food is a portal into culture and it should be treated as such Today I will tell you Food From different countries which are must try Buttered popcorn United States Potato chips United Kingdom Seafood paella Spain Som tam Thailand Chicken rice Singapore Poutine Canada Tacos Mexico Buttered toast with Marmite UK Stinky tofu Southeast Asia Chicken parm Australia Kebab Turkey Piri piri chicken Mozambique Hamburger Germany Sushi Japan Chocolate Mexico Neapolitan pizza Italy Momo Nepal chicken rice Tacos potato Chips Pizza Kebaab and many more These Dishes have my whole heart Tell me in notes About your fav food and fav country
