“Bewajaah koi bhi sadak par ikattha bilkul na ho jisse poori millat ko nuksaan uthaana pade, jumma padhein aur apne ghar jaakar dua kariye aman aur shanti mohobbat kaayam rahe”. Do not gather on the road together without reason, the entire community will have to bear the brunt. Read your Friday prayers, go home and pray that harmony, peace and love will prevail.


This was what Javed Mohammed, 54, wrote on Facebook on 11:12 am on 10 June 2022, among other appeals he made for peace on Facebook and Whatsapp (here, here and here) to address resentment felt by Muslims, 14 days after a spokesperson of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made abusive comments about the Prophet Mohammed.


It was on 26 May 2022 that Nupur Sharma, later removed as BJP spokesperson, made those remarks during prime-time national television debates on News24, Republic TV and Times Now, sparking outrage, both nationally and globally, and spurring protests across the country.


The Facebook timeline of Mohammed, a leader of the little but locally known 11-year-old Welfare Party of India, revealed that one of his posts calling for peace was made hours prior to the protests turning violent in Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad, in Uttar Pradesh (UP), on 10 June. 


On 11 June, the local police arrested Mohammed. Later, his wife and daughter were allegedly picked up during the night by the police, who now accuse Mohammed of being the “mastermind” behind the protests.
