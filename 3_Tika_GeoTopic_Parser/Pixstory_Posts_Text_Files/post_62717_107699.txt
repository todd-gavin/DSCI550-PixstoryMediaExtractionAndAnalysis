Exams only require students to write and deliver whatever they have studied about subjects during the class onlyExam cannot justify how a student will implement their knowledge about the subject in real lifeAlso exam is structured with limited time and students are required to write as per the questions asked in the test paper and within the time limit Thus exams only need students to write whatever they have memorised about the subject as quickly as possible This does not measure their knowledge All questions asked in the test paper are only based on concepts in the book and it has no direct relationship with the real life situations which students face in everyday life Students only remember things that will be asked in the exams for short period of time and once the exam is over they start learning new things for next exams hence they are not able to learn from what they have studied
