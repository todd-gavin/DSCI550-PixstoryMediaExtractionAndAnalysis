Bill McKibben, the Environmentalist, and author grew up in the idyllic town of Lexington, Mass., the home of the American Revolution. He always believed that America had an unlimited amount of potential.

 “When I was in high school I even had a summer job giving tours on the Battle Green in Lexington, dressed in my tricorn hat and telling the story of the brave minutemen who fought the first big battle against imperialism, and here we are some 50 years later and our nation is embroiled by racial and financial inequality and our planet’s future is in peril,” he said.

He remembers the struggles of the nation while he was growing up and is proud of the country that fought for itself.

In his latest book, “The Flag, the Cross, and the Station Wagon: A Graying American Looks Back at his Suburban Boyhood and Wonders What the Hell Happened” (Henry Holt Co.), McKibben analyzes the history of our country and his own life to try and discern where we went wrong. 

The book is divided into three sections: A look at American history and patriotism; a discussion of the church and how it is no longer such a crucial part of American life; and a deep look into suburbia and how America became a nation built on the importance of the automobile.
