Red Bull Salzburg have been credited for honing up players like Sadio Mane, Dayot Upamecano, Naby Keita, and Erling Haaland. Now they have developed another set of upcoming superstars in the form of Patson Daka, and Sekou Koita, but the most exciting player of the bunch was Dominik Szoboszlai. He played at RB Salzburg for 3 years winning accolades, before joining its sister club RB Leipzig in 2021, for a reported sum of 20 million. It made him the most expensive Hungarian of all time. 


Leipzig bought the Hungarian on a four-and-a-half-year contract, keeping him till 2025. However, he could not play in 2021 due to a long-term injury. However, he started in the new season.

From the heatmap, we can see that he was deployed mostly on the left. Szobozlai is a modern playmaker, which means with creating attacking opportunities, he is involved in the defensive side of the game. He combined his raw physical prowess, amazing technical ability, and dynamic mentality. Even though he is just 21 years old, it'll take him some time to be a world-class attacking midfielder.


What Makes him a Playmaker?


We have taken players in the age bracket of 16-22 and we can see why Szobozlai is one of the hottest prospects in the world. We have compared him with players in the top 5 League, and we can see that he ranks in the first quadrant concerning xA and xG. He ranks 0.30 in xA per 90 which he created and 4.8 in xG per 90 made. He boasts a higher technical acumen that is beyond a 21-year-old.

Sharp-Witted Passing


One thing which the Hungarian excels in is his sharp penetrating passes, as he made 1745 total passes out of which he completed 760 them, making 43.87 passes per 90, putting him in the 93 percentile. With the ball at his feet, he usually scans the whole pitch before sending a penetrating firm pass. He ranks in the first quadrant amongst playmakers in the 16-22 age bracket.
