Iran's claim almost seems exaggerated. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, after he visited Russia, claimed that he had presented Russia with a strategic plan that would result in two-decade collaboration between the two countries.

That may happen or not. That is for the future. But for now, Russia, China and Iran had something to show for the U.S. and the world. A joint naval drill between three countries took place in the Indian Ocean coincided with the visit of Raisi. A puffed-up Raisi told his country after returning from Russia, "Improving bilateral relations between Tehran and Moscow will enhance security for the region and the international arena."

According to Iran, it had the largest number of ships, with Russia and Iran having three and two ships. The much-feared Iran's Revolutionary Guard was at the forefront of the exercises that involved night fighting, rescue operations and others.

Ever since the hardline President Ebrahim Raisi took over in June, iRan has bee following a conscious policy of strengthening relations with Russia and China. It is in that direction that Iran joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation last year which has Beijing and Moscow. 

The naval drills are being held for the first time. But their timing have been interesting twice before. For instance in 2019, drills in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean were held when the tensions between Iran and the Arab countries backed by the U.S. were causing tensions.

Chinese media has been giving a different spin. The drills are being held to ensure the "safety of international shipping" while also blaming the U.S. and the Western powers to raise tensions in the South China Sea. The media also says that the drills convey a "goodwill gesture" that also "exhibits China's ability to maintain world peace and maritime security." All three countries see it as a win-win.
