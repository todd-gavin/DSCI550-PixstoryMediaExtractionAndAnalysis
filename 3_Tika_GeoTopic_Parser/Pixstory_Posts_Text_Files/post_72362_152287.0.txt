Dussehra or Vijayadashmi is the tenth day of the Navratri festival. It basically signifies the victory of good over evil. On the same day, lord Ram had killed Raavana. Following the tradition, on the day of Dusshera, people burn effigies of Ravana as a symbol of victory over all things evil. Bollywood, too, takes part in the revelries by using the occasion. So here are some bollywood tracks which are connected to this occasion.üôèüèªRam ji ki chali sawaarihttps://youtu.be/sIooFGRBZJYRaghulati raaghav raja ramhttps://gaana.com/song/raghupati-raghav-raja-ram-originalMangal bhavan amangal haari https://gaana.com/song/mangal-bhavan-amangal-haari-sitaram-charit-1Nagade sang dholhttps://youtu.be/vK5E_aeBGYAHua Shankhnaadhttps://youtu.be/yjvl5Zog3oQOm jai jagdish hare - 1970https://www.saregama.com/song/om-jai-jagdish-hare-1970_27787 Pal pal hai bhaarihttps://youtu.be/dRWr8OsVyjA
