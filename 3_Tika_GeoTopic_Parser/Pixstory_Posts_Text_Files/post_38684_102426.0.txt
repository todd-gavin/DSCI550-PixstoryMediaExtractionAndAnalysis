Vs Salah

The Egyptian has been the main man for Liverpool. His contribution to the FA Cup and Carabao cup saw them lifting both the titles. But they couldn’t win the treble as they fall short on the final day. Despite Salah scoring at the end, he couldn’t help his team win the 20th title as they were pipped by Manchester City courtesy of 2 goals from İlkay Gündoğan. However, they are in the Champions League and the Egyptians have been in a rich vein of form scoring 8 goals, and they face Real Madrid on 29th May in Paris. He and Son shared the golden boot as both finished with 23 goals apiece. Next season Schick will be competing with Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz who both are of Liverpool.



Vs Lukaku


Romelu Lukaku was the 100 million signings who was a flop. Last season in Inter he hit a rich vein of form scoring goals for fun and Inter won the Serie A. This season however he has been an utter flop. He had only 8 goals to his name plus he did not help his case by linking him back to Inter. Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea's manager has shown belief in him and decided to keep him rather than sell him. Next season will tell how the 100 million transfer fares, and will he be capable to go head to head with the 6ft 1 inch Czech International.



Final Verdict


With this season finally done and dusted, teams can focus on the new season and on rebuilding their teams, and formations, buying new players and all the things which happen in a team. One team which has fallen behind is Manchester United. Last season, the Red Devils finished second and were in the Europa final, they finished 6th this season. 


They couldn’t even beat Crystal Palace and had to rely on Brighton to beat West Ham to secure Europa League places. With Cavani and Martial expected to depart this season, he has turned on strikers to help the team.
