Minimalism is the antithesis of the modern consumerist narrative and for good reason In a global marketplace that wants you to consume more and more minimalism says Hey Have you ever thought about intentionally having less Less debt less clutter less stress less stuff The upshot less debt and stress for you and less valuable resources being extracted for stuff you don t really need How do I get involved you ask Start with your clothes If you haven t heard of slow fashion it is the fashion industry s niche minimalist subculture Instead of shopping vigorously to keep up with weekly trends and disposing of clothes after one wear on a Saturday night aka financially exhausting and extraordinarily wasteful the ethos is buy less choose well make it last My entry point to minimalism and slow fashion was through my wardrobe Back when I first started my minimalist journey some years ago I went through each and every item of clothing I had and either donated threw away or kept them I offloaded about of what I owned and it felt liberating and that was just the first time This process literally re wired the way I think about buying things and the stress associated with consumerism I now seek quality sustainable items or thrifted items over sheer quantity If I don t see the shops for months on end who cares How to start your minimalist wardrobe Keep these five tips in mind There is no magic number of clothing items or any items for that matter to achieve a minimalist wardrobe Minimalism is about fine tuning your own personal style and the only rule is to rid yourself of excess Minimalism doesn t have to be monotone Keep it colourful and versatile Don t just send your unwanted stuff to landfill Thoughtfully donate sell or gift it first Bask in the empty space and gratitude that flows into your mind and spirit seriously
