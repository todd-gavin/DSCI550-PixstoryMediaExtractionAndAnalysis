92 DAYS, that's how much time we have left of this year, and the way things have gone the last 2 years? I'm not feeling optimistic about it. Year after year, we get new idiots, racist, sexist, and political B.S., and now it seems a new WORLD WAR will be doing us inÂ  the coming years.....I don't know anything, believe anything, or trust anything.....92 DAYS, should just be 92 years.
