Kylie Jenner looks amazing on her dinner date!
The 25-year-old reality actress and beauty mogul stepped out with boyfriend Travis Scott on Thursday night (October 13) at Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood, California.
Kylie and Travis held hands as they entered and exited the celebrity-favored restaurant.
One night earlier, Kylie was looking a whole lot different when she stepped out on the town with her skin painted green for an early Halloween celebration with her friend Hailey Bieber.
