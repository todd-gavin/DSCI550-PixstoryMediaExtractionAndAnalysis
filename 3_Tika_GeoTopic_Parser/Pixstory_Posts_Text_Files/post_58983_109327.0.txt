According to a senior government official on Thursday, India's imports of crude oil from Russia have increased more than 50 times since April and now account for 10% of all petroleum purchased internationally. Prior to the Ukraine War, only 0.2% of India's total oil imports came from Russia.

In April, 10% of India's total oil imports came from Russia. It is currently one of the top ten providers.

Private refiners Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy have purchased up to 40% of the Russian oil market.

After Iraq, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as India's second-largest oil supplier last month as refiners snatched up Russian crude that had become significantly cheaper due to the conflict in Ukraine.

About 25 million barrels of Russian oil were purchased by Indian refiners in May.

For the first time in April, crude of Russian provenance made up 10% of all seaborne imports into India, up from 0.2% in 2021 and Q1 2022.

India, the third-largest oil consumer and importer in the world, has long defended its decision to buy crude oil from Russia after President Vladimir Putin authorised the invasion of Ukraine.

"Energy purchases from Russia remain small in compared to India's total consumption," the Oil Ministry had remarked last month.

In May, Iraq continued to be India's top supplier, and Saudi Arabia is now its third-largest provider.

India increased its oil imports from Russia during a period of rising energy prices by taking advantage of cheap prices.
