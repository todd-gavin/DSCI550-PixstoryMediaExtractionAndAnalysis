Books have always brought me happiness and if I have to name one book that is always on my mind then I will not hesitate in saying It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover I read this book more than years ago for the very first time but a part of my heart is still stuck within the pages of this book It Ends With Us is a heart wrenching five star read that will make you fall in love with both the writing and the characters This story follows Lily Bloom a year old college graduate who is in the midst of starting a new simple life in Boston where she meets Ryle Kincaid and they eventually fall in love Bloom s relationship with Kincaid gets complicated however when Bloom runs into her first love Atlas Corrigan with whom she had lost contact years before Hoover has done amazing work with big plot twists in the book and you will be hooked till the end I originally thought It Ends With Us was a romance novel but it is so much more than a book with a fairytale ending or sad troubled characters As a note of caution I would recommend looking up the trigger warnings for this book before buying it Even with such sensitive topics and writings this is a book I will recommend to almost everyone Also with the upcoming sequel It Starts With Us which is slated to be released in October I m sure more people will be picking this up The book with its ending is beautiful and necessary I could not recommend this book more And if you ve already read this book let me know your thoughts too love love
