A couple weeks ago i ordered this black solid one should fitted top from Myntra. Since a very long time i wanted to order one shoulder top. Then i decided to buy it from Myntra and I ordered this top and of course it was black in colour and I love black so i had to ordered it.
Every time I visit the site, they are having a sale for 55-60% off everything which brings the already affordable pieces to a shockingly low price at checkout. 
Price- The actual price of this top was Rs1470 and i got it from sale after discount it cost me Rs 588.
Quality- The top quality of this top is good , itâ€™s super comfortable . 
Size- I ordered M size and it turned out to be perfect it fitted me well . 

Overall my experience was amazing because of affordable prices, impressive quality.
