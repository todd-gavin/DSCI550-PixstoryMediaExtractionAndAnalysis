Is music legend and ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney a creative genius?

Not according to Edward P. Clapp, a principal investigator at the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Project Zero. The project aims to understand and nurture “learning, thinking, ethics, intelligence and creativity.”

In a recent video interview with me, Clapp said he instead sees McCartney, or any other artistic figure who could be seen as a creative genius, as playing the role of a creative producer — one who synthesizes influences and information.

“I dispute the idea of genius, wholeheartedly … I don’t believe in it,” he said. “I think people, all people, have the capacity to participate in creativity.”

Clapp’s theory of “participatory creativity” replaces the notion that creative output emerges solely because of a creative individual working alone in a studio or high up in a candle-lit garret.

While the individual participates in their own unique and important way, what also matters is the matrix of people, objects and events within which ideas develop.

Creative process in action
I called Clapp after teaching his book Participatory Creativity: Introducing Access and Equity to the Creative Classroom. I wanted his take on Get Back, director Peter Jackson’s three-part, eight-hour Beatles documentary based on 56 hours of meticulously restored film and 150 hours of audio from the making of the 1970 album Let It Be.

In particular, I wanted to talk about a scene in which McCartney creates the song “Get Back,” one of the Beatles’ most enduring hits, in around two minutes flat, as if from thin air. It’s a remarkable, fly-on-the-wall view of the creative process in action.
