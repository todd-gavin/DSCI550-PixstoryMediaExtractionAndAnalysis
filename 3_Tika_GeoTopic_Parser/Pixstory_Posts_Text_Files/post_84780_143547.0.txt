In this fast-paced world, full of luxurious things and places, nothing works better as a medicine than nature. Lush green trees, rivers, light rainfall and the smell of first rain-HEAVEN!🌲🏞️
And this is your reminder to have at least one plant in your home. It can never replace any modern luxury.✨
PS: It rained at my college today 🫶
