Despite her belief that Australia would eventually become a republic Julia Gillard has agreed with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that the time is not now right for a discussion The Guardian reported that in her first interview since the Queen s passing the former Australian prime minister told the ABC that Albanese was correct to postpone discussion of a republic to a later term of administration Albanese claimed before taking off for London on Thursday that the passing of the Queen had made Australians more aware of our system of government but he has remained mum regarding the timing of a vote other than to say that his government s top priority is to include First Nations people in the constitution Despite the fact that each person s relationship with the monarchy is unique Gillard noted that the Queen served as a symbol of continuity for many Australians in a chaotic and fractured world Asked if she was still of the view the Queen s death would be an appropriate time to move away from a British head of state Gillard said Yes I always thought that when the Queen did leave us that it would cause a period of reflection I always thought in Australia too it would unleash a new set of reflections about our own constitutional arrangements But there s no rush and I certainly endorse what the prime minister has said There s time for measured discussion It s certainly too soon for that now Let s see what happens next
