Former English international Owen Hargreaves has given his predictions for the fourth spot in 
the Premier League table. Owen Hargreaves believes that it will be Tottenham that bag the 
open fourth spot ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United.

At one point in time, Arsenal did look clear favorites but Mikel Arteta's side have bottled it up and have now faced defeats in three back-to-back fixtures. 

Arsenal were favorites to win each of the three clashes against Crystal Palace, Brighton & Hove Albion and Southampton but ended up losers in each, making them less favorites to bag the fourth spot given some challenging upcoming fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester United, West Ham United, Leeds United and Tottenham.

Owen Hargreaves speaking to ‘The Mirror’ said “Fixture-wise, it’s tough for Arsenal. They 
struggled against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. They’ve got Chelsea, Man United, West Ham, Leeds and Tottenham coming up. 

Looking at Arsenal’s fixtures I’m saying no. I know they’re close but if you’re losing and not scoring against Palace, Brighton and Southampton, you’re going to struggle. It’s made it really difficult for them.”

He went on to add that Manchester United have been too inconsistent and it is to note that they 
too have some challenging fixtures with Chelsea and Liverpool and go head to head with Arsenal and this gives Tottenham the edge going into the business end of the season.

“Tottenham are still in the driving seat because they’re ahead. Arsenal have that game in hand 
but I think Arsenal will fall short with the fixtures they’ve got. "Manchester United are just too inconsistent. Tottenham should be able to get the job done.”
