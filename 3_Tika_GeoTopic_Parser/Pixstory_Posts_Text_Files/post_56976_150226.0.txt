Social media is one of the essential parts of today's world. It has proliferated to the extent that people can't imagine their life without it.
But besides other social media platforms, why is Instagram so different?
It is because of the utopia it has created for people, a perfect world that barely even exists, but it does for everyone who uses Instagram.
This photo-based platform has a lot to offer, but it still lags in setting attainable standards instead of making it a dreamlike world for everyone who is a part of it.
The unrealistic standards and notions of achieving something can get someone into distress and pain.
Then what is at stake?
Or should I say if there's something not at stake!!
What it offers is less but what it takes away from us is far more significant than we imagine.
It affects the sleep quality, get you into the thought where you have wrong notions about the perfect body, and bullying, of course, is part of it.
Then we have FOMO, seeing everyone and everything so ideal and perfect, and since you can't be a part of it, you feel like missing out.
In particular, Instagram users who engage in digital status-seeking (looking for popularity online) and social comparison (evaluating oneself about others) tend to experience adverse psychological outcomes. 
The "keep scrolling" habit takes a lot from everyone, and they don't realise it on time and eventually fall into the trap.
