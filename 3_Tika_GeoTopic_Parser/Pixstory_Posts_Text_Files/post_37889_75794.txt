Dune is of the greatest SciFi novels ever written It s ambitious magnificent in scale and one of the greatest worlds ever created There was a reason no one attempted to recreate this masterpiece on Screen However thanks to better technology and the huge magnitude of movies of late Dune The movie finally has been made a reality and made the impossible possible I never imagined Frank Herbert s Dune could look any better on screen than Denis Villeneuve s spectacular vision It looks fabulously grand in scope with spawning visuals of the Desert and it s Spice which is a character in itself You just marvel at the creation and how tiny the human characters seem in the background of nature And special mention to the BGM by Hans Zimmer which matches every frame of the movie with a haunting score The performances of the actors the drama and ever mounting threat on the protagonists while predictable is still heavy enough to keep you engaged Dune is simply one of the most visually pleasing movie ever created for the screen
