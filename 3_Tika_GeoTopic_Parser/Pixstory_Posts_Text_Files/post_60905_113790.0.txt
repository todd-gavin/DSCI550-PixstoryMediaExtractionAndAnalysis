This series raises some serious issues but will not disappoint if you are looking for humor & comedy. Character of Jo has my heart and definitely is unforgettable. Being from girls school I can relate to this series a lot. Brilliant performances by Srishti Shrivastava, Parul Gulati, Simran Natekar, Ahsaas Channa, & Shreya Mehta all delivered again above the expectation.
