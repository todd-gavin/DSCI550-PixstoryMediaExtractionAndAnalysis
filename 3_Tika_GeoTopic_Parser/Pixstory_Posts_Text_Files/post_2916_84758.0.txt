India is in a dilemma. As Putin invaded Ukraine and threatens to use nuclear force, many world players denounced Russia, but China, the UAE and India stood away. For many, it’s inexplicable why India is trying to remain neutral, though some see New Delhi’s well-known non-alignment policy at work.

At the special session of the UN General Assembly on Sunday, New Delhi formally called for immediate cessation of hostilities but did not name Russia. In a procedural vote, India abstained: https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/india-skips-resolution-to-call-for-un-general-assembly-session-on-ukraine-122022800072_1.html

Under pressure from all stakeholders; the US, Ukraine and Russia, India is obviously doing a tightrope walk to find what works best for its national interest. 

Russia is the largest defence supplier for India and has vetoed UNSC resolutions on Kashmir in the past: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-60552273 

But India’s defence ties with the US, France and others European powers are on the rise. Also, remaining neutral would not help India’s strategic objectives when China too had adopted the same stance – it is, indeed, less ambiguous in its support to Russia. India has to choose between two difficult options: https://www.news9live.com/world/in-national-interest-india-retains-neutral-stance-on-ukraine-in-un-for-now-156224#debate-in-article

After an Indian student was killed in Ukraine on Tuesday: https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/russia-ukraine-war-indian-student-killed-in-shelling-in-ukraines-kharkiv-2796598, the Russian action is even hitting home, and yet New Delhi is loath to criticize Moscow: https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-students-death-challenges-indian-evacuation-diplomacy-on-world-stage-7796670/

But another way to look at India’s stance is that it has been consistent with its traditional position of non-alignment. It is one of the few nations having good ties with all the three major stakeholders and thus in a rare position to broker peace. Taking sides may hurt that prospect: https://www.voanews.com/a/counting-both-us-and-russia-as-partners-india-faces-diplomatic-test-in-ukraine-crisis-/6462650.html

Meanwhile, the ruling party’s ideological allies in the Hindu right-wing have come out in full support of Putin. An outfit called Hindu Sena on Tuesday put up posters (on the statue of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, in New Delhi) in support of the Russian action in Ukraine. They hailed “Akhand [undivided] Russia”: https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/hindu-sena-posters-russian-poet-statue-akhand-russia-7796346/

They probably see similarities between prime minister Narendra Modi and Putin, as well as between the two nations: https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/blood-brothers-why-is-the-bhakt-excited-by-vladimir-putin/cid/1854069 Putin’s actions resonate well with the image of Modi as a no-nonsense leader without idealistic baggage who would go to any length to secure national interest.
