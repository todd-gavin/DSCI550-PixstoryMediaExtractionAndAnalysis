On Saturday evening, an empty Molineux will host a UEFA Nations League match between England and Italy, which will be a rematch of the Euro 2020 final.


England will be looking for their first win of the UEFA Nations League season, while Italy will be looking to build on their 2-1 triumph over Hungary.



England vs Italy: Probable Playing XI



England : Jordan Pickford, Reece James, John Stones, Harry Maguire, Kieran Trippier, Conor Gallagher, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Jarrod Bowen, Harry Kane, Jack Grealish


Italy : Gianluigi Donnarumma, Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Francesco Acerbi, Alessandro Bastoni, Leonardo Spinazzola, Nicolo Barella, Sandro Tonali, Lorenzo Pellegrini, Matteo Politano, Wilfried Gnonto, Giacomo Raspadori




England vs Italy: Prediction



Southgate is facing ever-increasing scrutiny after a pair of dissatisfactory showings in the Nations League, with England's attacking stars simply not clicking into gear, but the Azzurri are not the force they once were either.


The young and inexperienced forward line at Mancini's disposal could struggle to break down the Three Lions' stingy defense, and we can envisage the Three Lions finally posting a first win on the board in what may not be the most entertaining affair.


Prediction : England 1-0 Italy
