A night of new captains, Shreyas Iyer captaining KKR and Ravindra Jadeja was captaining CSK. KKR won the toss and bowled first. It was an amazing opening spell by Umesh Yadav, he picked up two wickets in his opening spell of three overs. The others bowlers also kept the economy tight and CSK at one moment were 66 - 5. A Dhoni and Jadeja partnership helped the team reach a total of 131 - 5. Dhoni rolled back the years, scoring a well deserved 50. 

When KKR came out to chase, Rahane took a calm approach scoring regular boundaries effortlessly and giving the team a solid start, he ended his innings with 44, falling prey to Santner. Shreyas Iyer took the team home and KKR won by 6 wickets with 9 balls left to play.

In the end, the target set by CSK was too low and it was a pretty easy chase for KKR.
