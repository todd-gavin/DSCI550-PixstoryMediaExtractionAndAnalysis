Virtual reality assisted in the successful separation of Brazilian twins that were conjoined at the head Under the supervision of Great Ormond Street Hospital in London operations were performed on three year olds Bernardo and Arthur Lima in Rio de Janeiro The teams tested several methods for months utilising virtual reality twin projections that were based on CT and MRI images According to Gemini Untwined a charity founded by Mr Jilani in it is one of the most complex separation surgery ever undertaken According to him for the first time surgeons from different countries used headphones and worked together in a virtual reality room The twins underwent seven operations with the last operation alone requiring more than hours of operating time and nearly doctors As for the VR part of the job Jilani told the PA news agency It s a good idea to look at the anatomy and do the surgery before you put your children at risk I can only imagine how reassuring this is for the surgeons In some ways these tasks are considered some of the most difficult tasks of our time and performing them in virtual reality was like putting real person on Mars She said previous failed attempts to isolate the boys meant their anatomy was complicated by scar tissue and said the risky procedure was really terrifying After hours of surgery Zilani said I was completely estatic He said he had four food and water breaks within minutes of this operation but it was amazing to see his family over the moon afterwards Like all twins after separation she said the boy s blood pressure and heart rate were the best until they were reunited and delivered four days later The two are currently doing well in hospital and undergoing a six month rehabilitation process
