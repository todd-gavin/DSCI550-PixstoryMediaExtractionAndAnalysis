Australian legend Shane Warne, widely regarded as the greatest leg-spinner of all time, has died aged 52, according to a statement issued by his management company on Friday. The statement said he died in Koh Samui, Thailand, of a suspected heart attack. It comes just hours after the death was announced of fellow Australian great Rod Marsh.

Warne also posted a heartfelt tweet for former Australian player Rod Marsh who passed away yesterday. 
His tweet read, "Sad to hear the news that Rod Marsh has passed. He was a legend of our great game & an inspiration to so many young boys &  girls. Rod cared deeply about cricket & gave so much-especially to Australia & England players. Sending lots & lots of love to Ros & the family. RIP mate❤️"

Warne, one of the finest leg-spin bowlers of all time, took 708 Test wickets in a career which spanned from 1992 to 2007. In the all-time highest Test wicket-takers list, Warne is just behind Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan's record 800 wickets. In 2007, Cricket Australia and Sri Lanka Cricket named the Test series between the two sides the Warne–Muralitharan Trophy in the duo's honour.

Warne, since making his debut in 1992, played 145 Tests for Australia. In his 194 ODI appearances, Warne managed 293 wickets.

Warne, who made his Test debut against India at the iconic Sydney Cricket Ground, was named as one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Century for his unparalleled achievements in a 15-year career between 1992 and 2007. In 2013, the year he retired from the game, he was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.
