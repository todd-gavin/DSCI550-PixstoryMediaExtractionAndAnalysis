The Centenary Test of 1980. Australia Vs England. 
It was unfortunately ruined by the weather with only a draw really possible after losing10 hours in the match. 
It will be remembered for the innings of Kim Hughes who batted on all five days for his 117. England were set 370 to win in 350 minutes but ended on 244 for 3. Boycott 128 Not out. The Test will also be remembered for the last commentary of John Arlott whoÂ  finished a 35 year career who really was the voice of Test cricket to millions of us listeners.
