If you put your mind to something and work hard for it, you will succeed. Masrat Farooq, a 29-year-old from Srinagar, has demonstrated it. 
Masrat, who is originally from the EidGah neighbourhood of the old city, is the first education entrepreneur in Kashmir and currently instructs 300 pupils with the help of her own staff of more than 80 teachers. 
Masrat's path to success, though, hasn't been straightforward. 
Masrat attended York Public School until the 10th grade before completing her 10+2 at Government Higher Secondary School Nawakadal. Ever since childhood, she had always been interested in teaching, and when she was in her twelfth grade, she began giving lessons to young children. Masrat spent two months teaching English in a school in Bemina in addition to her work at Libra English Academy.
She now holds the honour of being called the first education entrepreneur and runs the Smart Classes home tuition centre in Karan Nagar.
