Cristiano Ronaldo could be on his way out of Manchester United this summer. The Portuguese superstar has asked his club to let him leave if a "suitable offer" comes for the player. Hence there is a chance could see Ronaldo linking up with Messi after all! 

Ronaldo reportedly feels that Manchester United are "ambitionless" and cannot challenge for the Premier League title this season. To add to this, the Red Devils will also be playing in the Europa League and these factors could force the Portuguese superstar to leave.

Paris Saint Germain and Cristiano Ronaldo's agent are yet to make contact for a possible transfer. However, things could change completely depending on Neymar's situation!

Neymar could reportedly be heading out of Paris this summer. The Brazilian star is not happy at the club and the PSG chiefs have reportedly given him a green light to leave. If Neymar actually decides to move on, this could open Cristiano Ronaldo's chances to join Paris Saint Germain. 

PSG are looking to make a team worthy of winning the UEFA Champions League! To add to this, playing Messi and Ronaldo in one team would surely get the eyes of the world to focus on the Parisian club! These two factors could play a big role in PSG eventually making a bid for Ronaldo in the summer. 

It has to be seen if this actually comes true before the transfer window ends in August this year!
