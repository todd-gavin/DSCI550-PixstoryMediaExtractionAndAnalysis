War orphans were provided with cash aid by a charity committee in the central province of Wardak province.  

The aid was provided by Darulyatim Saeed Khosty, a charity committee.

Meanwhile, families of the orphans of the former security forces complained about their poor living conditions and said the aid would not meet their needs.  

“My father was martyred. We have 10 people in our family. When we receive this aid, we will purchase flour, oil and other commodities,” said Nasratullah, 10, an orphan.  

“These orphans remain by the mercy of God. We have luckily received some aid from the committee," said Abdul Rahim, a relative of an Islamic Emirate force member.  

The aid was provided to 200 orphan families of the Islamic Emirate and 100 orphan families of the former security forces.  

“We are living in a rented house. My father was martyred in Narkh (district). I was born after his death and I haven’t seen my father. I am an orphan and I hope to receive aid,” said Bibi Mariam, 9, an orphan.  

The charity committee pledged to extend the process of providing aid to orphans across the country.   

“There were 300 people. 200 of them were orphans of the Mujahedeen of the Islamic Emirate. 100 of them were orphans of the former Kabul administration, ” said Qari Javid, a member of the charity committee.  

The 20-year war has left hundreds of thousands of Afghans dead and maimed.  

As Afghanistan’s economy is facing a complete collapse, citizens are struggling with economic and social challenges.
