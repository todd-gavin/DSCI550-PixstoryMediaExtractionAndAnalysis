Co-starring Deborah Mailman and Rachel Griffiths, Total Control is at once a quietly powerful portrait of one Indigenous Aboriginal woman’s fight to represent both her individual soul and her people’s country and a wild political thrill ride pitting Mailman’s virtuous David against Griffiths’s corrupt Goliath. 

As per vulture, given that this series shares much of its creative DNA with Mystery Road, it’s unsurprising that it ends up being so well balanced. But where Mystery Road thrives on the desolate beauty of Australia’s forgotten corners, Total Control finds its energy in the friction that naturally exists between the Indigenous communities that Mailman, as first-term Senator Alex Irving, sets out to fight for, and the faceless Canberra political machine that Griffiths, as the scheming Prime Minister Rachel Anderson, does her best to paint a convincing shade of neo-feminist. 

In its short first-season run, the series succeeds in weaving a remarkable number of ideas together, the bad guys most deserving of comeuppance getting at least something in the ballpark of justice, but potential fans will still be gratified to know that a second season is officially on its way
