ğŸ‘‰Cool leftovers as quickly as possible (within 2 hours), store in the fridge and eat within 3â€“4 days.
ğŸ‘‰Alternatively, freeze leftovers for 3â€“4 months. After this point, they are still considered safe to eat â€” but texture and flavor may be compromised.
ğŸ‘‰Frozen leftovers should be properly defrosted before heating by transferring them to your fridge or using the defrost setting on your microwave. 
ğŸ‘‰Once defrosted, refrigerate and eat within 3â€“4 days.
It is safe to reheat partially defrosted leftovers using a saucepan, microwave or oven. However, reheating will take longer if the food is not completely thawed.
ğŸ‘‰Reheat leftovers until steaming hot throughout â€” they should reach and maintain 165Â°F (70Â°C) for two minutes. 
ğŸ‘‰Stir food while reheating to ensure even heating, especially when using a microwave.
ğŸ‘‰Do not reheat leftovers more than once.
ğŸ‘‰Do not refreeze leftovers that have already been defrosted.
ğŸ‘‰Serve reheated leftovers immediately.
