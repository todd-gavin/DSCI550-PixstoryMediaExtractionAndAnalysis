Even though they are unsure of what caused the leak, NASA officials say they are prepared to test a new strategy for fueling the Space Launch System to avoid the recurrence of the breaches that grounded an earlier launch attempt. Space News reported that at Launch Complex 39B, preparations are under way for the SLS tanking test scheduled for September 21. The core stage will start to be loaded with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants at around 7 a.m. Eastern. Controllers will test a "kickstart bleed" of hydrogen into the core stage engines and a pre-pressurization test after filling the tanks of the core stage and upper stage before finishing up at around 3 p.m. Eastern.The main goal of the test is to verify that modifications to procedures and repairs to seals in liquid hydrogen lines into the core stage eliminate a major leak that was observed during the rocket's second launch attempt on the Artemis 1 mission on September 3. The enclosure around the connection had hydrogen quantities that were at least two times the 4% limit, as observed by the controllers.Letâ€™s hope everything goes well this time!
