True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life. 🧘‍♀️
Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived.🌼
Yoga doesn’t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming.🕉️
Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied.🕊️✨
