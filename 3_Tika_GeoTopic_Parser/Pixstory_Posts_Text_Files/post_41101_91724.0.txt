I firmly believe that racism is taught. Every racist person we come across is a product of their environment. It’s a learned behaviour and this process of learning begins when they are a child. 

Reports and surveys tell us that most people who are racist have racist parents. And eventually racism becomes a generational ideology. This is because, for a child, whatever their parents say or believe is gospel. Knowingly or unknowingly they imitate the actions of their parents and make their beliefs their own. 

How can this problem be encountered? Through education. Education is the only way of unlearning the racist behaviour and learning that there should be no discrimination on the basis of skin colour. Kids should be actively involved in the BLM Movement to impart education and schools play a key role in this.

When I say that kids should be involved in the BLM Movement, I don’t mean that we should bring our kids to protests or make them march on roads. That is not what the movement is about. 

Kids should be taught that life is not the same for their fellow black classmates. Their struggles in life are different and are far more gruesome that the white people. Schools should have history lessons that should tell kids about the prejudice against black people and slavery. Nothing should be whitewashed. Black activists, inventors and other notable people should be talked and taught about so that the kids learn from an early age about the importance of racial equality. 

They should be sensitised towards the issue of racism and what exactly does racial equality entails. Only when this is done, we will be able to ensure that the future generation is kind and empathetic towards others and an incident like George Floyd is not repeated.
