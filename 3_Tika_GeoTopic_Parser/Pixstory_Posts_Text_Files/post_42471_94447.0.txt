On another day, another comeback did by Real Madrid and this time Sevilla became their victims. The match between both the team ended with a scoreline of 2-3 and Real Madrid wins the match. As a viewer, this match was different in both halves. The first half of the match was dominated by Sevilla and the second half was dominated by Real Madrid and now Real Madrid become used to do a comeback.

In the first half, as a Real Madrid fan, I felt rattled because the performance of Real Madrid was so bad that they were unable to complete a successful pass. They were finding it difficult to keep possession against Sevilla and in the first half, Sevilla scored two goals against Real Madrid.

But when the second half started, Real Madrid looked different and they started playing as a team, they were passing the ball successfully and substitutes done by Carlo Ancelotti were top-notch because Rodrygo scored one goal and gave an assist and Nacho, who was a second substitute scored a banger and equalize the game.

And in a comeback like this, one player who always scored for Real Madrid this season, scored again and the name of the player is Karim Benzema. He scored the clutch goal in 90+2 minutes and wins the match for his team and the fans of Real Madrid.

I think the La Liga is almost over and Real Madrid will win the trophy because one tough team they have to face in the remaining six matches and that team is Atletico Madrid. I hope Real Madrid will win that match also.
