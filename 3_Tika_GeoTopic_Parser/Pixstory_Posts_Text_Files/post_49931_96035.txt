CNN s pompous launching of a million streaming service that represented the future of digital news got nullified in less than a month by new parent company Warner Bros Discovery as it has decided to shut down It s not a new corporate ruling the journalist field but isn t scary Journalism and media are the investigators in Democracy and it rests within politicians and capitalists CNN had employed hundreds of employees to work on the streaming service Some employees may be able to get other jobs at the company while those departing the company will receive a six month severance CNN Plus employees began declaring their departures on social media Is this because they lost trust in the channel We know the future of journalism rests in the speed of the dissemination of information and yes internet and live streaming are the future But what if it is curbed by the corporates and their new agendas and strategies I usually think partnerships do no good but jeopardise a particular organisation and its growth Or is people demanding less influx of streaming apps Streaming culture should be slowly introduced as their are so many apps introduced and putting up shows to withstand the competition Audience are in a tough place to choose This should also be addressed
