South Africa s power utility Eskom has not been able to provide a steady electricity supply for several years now At the start of the winter the utility warned the public to expect up to days with rolling power outages At the end of June there was at times a MW shortfall in electricity supply which corresponds to about of the evening peak demand While there is consensus that new electricity generating plants are urgently needed to minimise power outages there are radically differing views on how this is best achieved The official electricity plan approved three years ago is already out of date Its implementation is furthermore two years behind schedule One widely promoted view is that increasing electricity generating capacity requires grand scale new renewable energy developments In the electricity generated from renewables amounted to a mere of the South African national total This will have grown to about as more plants have been completed The country s power generation is still dominated by coal And it s lagging far behind the global trend towards clean energy Most people associate renewable energy exclusively with wind and solar energy but it includes all technologies that don t process non replaceable fossil fuels Fossils include coal oil gas and minerals for example the uranium used in nuclear energy Hydropower stations which extract electricity from the downhill flow of water are a renewable energy source This is the major source of electricity in water rich countries like Norway but only a limited option in drier climates When water needs to be retained in dams during times of drought then no electricity production is possible As South Africa is drought prone a major increase in local hydropower generation currently at of the total is not feasible Other renewable energy technologies like geothermal and tidal power generation work in select localities that are not common in South Africa This leaves wind and solar These sources currently make up about of South Africa s energy mix Read more
