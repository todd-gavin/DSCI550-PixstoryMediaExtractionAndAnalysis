I

Flip out my existence,
On the basis of chance,
I knew for a little while,
What a wonderful life,
It had been with you,
For mere moments I knew love,
Then I felt a knife,
Right in my chest,
Tearing my soul apart,
Its been years,
The heart still wonders,
How much loneliness is enough?

II

Flip out my heart,
For I wander alone,
Imagining you by my side,
Its a chaotic haven,
I suffer to feel,
There's no end to misery,
To love there is.
Tell me should I forget,
All that happened in mere seconds?
Won't it be a sin?
To abandon my nostalgic serenity?

III

So, I toss a coin,
To clear this dilemma,
The answer already lies in my heart,
This book needs to be burned,
The ashes will be swept by tears,
On to the journey of my next life,
An end so dull,
Like how our superficial world was,
Everything a false alarm,
There were no emotions,
Just persuasions,
Now, I toss a coin for my sanity.
