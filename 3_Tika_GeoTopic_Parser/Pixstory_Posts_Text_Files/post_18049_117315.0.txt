Nick Jonas is crowning his wife, Priyanka Chopra, as the jewel of July in honor of her 40th birthday. Jonas showered his wife with birthday love in a post shared to Instagram Monday. The Dancing With Myself co-host shared several pics from their recent beachside getaway as the pair celebrated Chopra turning 40.

Among the snaps was a pic of Jonas holding up a custom towel which read, "Priyanka! The Jewel of July, est. 1982," as well as shots of the pair on the beach where Chopra stunned in a yellow Montce look, Chopra enjoying a birthday dinner as an "80's baby," and a seaside fireworks show.
