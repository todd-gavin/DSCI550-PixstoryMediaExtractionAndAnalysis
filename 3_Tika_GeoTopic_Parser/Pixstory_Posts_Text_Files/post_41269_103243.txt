Calling all smart cookies National Biscuit Day offers the perfect chance to go crackers about one of the world s most popular snacks But did you realize just how many types of biscuits there are Many of you will be surprised to find out that biscuits aren t a modern invention Instead they were born of necessity in the ancient world Merchants and military personnel in the Roman Greek and Egyptian empires would often spend many weeks at sea ferrying cargo and making their way to foreign shores Hence they needed a snack that would provide them with a source of calories for the entirety of the journey Fresh food was out of the question It just wouldn t keep So captains turned to stocking their larders with dried foods that wouldn t go off Preservation techniques were already fairly advanced in ancient times People knew that if you dried something out it would last longer and wouldn t go off Millers therefore began grinding up flours and then baking cooked bread on a low heat for an extended period This technique helps to retain the nutrition but removes the water content preventing any microbes from thriving From that point dried biscuit like breads became a staple at sea What s your favourite biscuit Source daysofyear
