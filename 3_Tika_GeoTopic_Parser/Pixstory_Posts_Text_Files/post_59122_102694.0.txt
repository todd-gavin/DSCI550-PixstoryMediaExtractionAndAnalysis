One of us is lying is based on Karen M. McManus's New York Times bestselling novel of the same name. 
Mystery encloses Bayview High when five students walk into detention and only four walks out alive. This is one of my favorite books I have ever read. The story has a perfect combination of drama, suspense, mystery, and romance, and I haven't read anything quite like it. 
I loved One Of Us Is Lying in its original book form, every character was a mystery in itself as the story unfolded. The story is muddy and all over the place. All the character's secrets are almost immediately spilled and most of the tension is gone. I did enjoy the middle part where it seemed to pick up in quality, but its ending made me feel hollow.
