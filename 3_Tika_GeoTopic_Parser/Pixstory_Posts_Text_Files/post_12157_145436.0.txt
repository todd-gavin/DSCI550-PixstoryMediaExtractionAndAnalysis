The all chat platter
It's delicious world of Indian cuisine, chaat is a great place to start. 
Let's understand, why it's called a chat ?
Chatpati Chaat platter is a platter where a combination of different lip-smacking chaats has been put together. Chaat, comes from the word chaatna, which literally means to lick. Chaats are normally eaten with hands and then we just lick our fingers!
The chat platter, I had was a combination of 5 dishes I.e the pani puri, dahi puri, bhel puri, dahi papdi chat, and bhel ....
Ahhh my mouth is watering.... while even typing these names 😂 
Let's understand the taste  .... all the puri's was perfect, absolutely a bliss to put it in the mouth  ... bhel was okay, not so good ....  but dahi papdi was the hero on the plate. 
The range was reasonable....
