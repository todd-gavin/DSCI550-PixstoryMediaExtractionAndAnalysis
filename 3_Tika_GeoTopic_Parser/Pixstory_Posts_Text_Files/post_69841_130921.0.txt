Demi Lovato's new boyfriend, Jordan Lutes, just confirmed their relationship with a romantic tribute to the singer on her 30th birthday.

This Sunday, the musician posted an Instagram carousel featuring photos and videos of the two taken over the course of their romance. In the first photo, they are seen smiling at each other while on a hike. And in an adorable clip, Lutes, aka Jute$, is seen continuously kissing Lovato as they drive.


"Happy birthday baby. ur a 30 year old minx and i’m the luckiest schmuck in the world cuz i get to call u mine. making u laugh has become my new obsession cuz ur smile literally cures my depression (there’s a song lyric in there somewhere). i’m so proud of u for not only surviving everything you’ve been through but coming out on top and becoming ur healthiest happiest sweetest self. and that’s all u baby… i’m just here to support u and tell stupid dad jokes when needed," Lutes wrote in the post caption.

Lovato turned 30 on Saturday, August 20.

Also in the carousel are photos of the duo on a beach vacation, a rollercoaster ride, and on a plane. And the musician even shared sweet photos of them at home during low-key date nights and doin day-to-day activities, like brushing their teeth.

"Ur more than ur music, more than ur voice, more than a beautiful face. ur everything. i love u 😘🫠🐞🥳😍 ps the last slide is the new#1 cutest video on the internet. literally bursting w joy 😭 how are u real lol ddlovato," he added.
Lutes first publicly gushed about Lovato in an Instagram post last week, sharing a video of them performing their song "Substance" on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Lutes, who helped write the hit, wrote, "Sheeeesh best voice in the game, by a lot. u killed it rockstar ddlovato . substance on jimmyfallon last night. grateful to be a part of this one ✍️🖤 ps ur fucking hot."

"YOU ARE 😍😍 thank you so much baby!! 🥰🥰" Lovato responded.
