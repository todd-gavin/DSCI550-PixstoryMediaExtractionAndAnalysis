Medications used to treat conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and depression may also improve cognition and decrease apathy in people with Alzheimer s disease The idea that this class of medications called noradrenergic drugs may be useful for treating Alzheimer s dates to the s At the time autopsies of people who had died with Alzheimer s revealed deterioration in a part of the brainstem called the locus coeruleus The region produces noradrenaline a neurotransmitter important for attention learning memory and other cognitive functions The hope was that because noradrenergic drugs increase noradrenaline levels they could combat deficits in these functions in people with Alzheimer s But after a few small trials failed to produce convincing results interest faded says Michael David at Imperial College London Since then advances in imaging have allowed researchers to measure the deterioration of the locus coeruleus in living people with Alzheimer s and see how it may contribute to their symptoms This advancement along with the development of new noradrenergic drugs spurred David and his colleagues to take a fresh look at these treatments The researchers collected data from clinical trials of this class of drugs that included people with either Alzheimer s disease or the related condition mild cognitive impairment They looked at of the studies including people to evaluate the drugs impact on general cognitive ability as measured by commonly used assessments The drugs led to modest improvements compared with placebos the standardised mean difference a measure that enables researchers to compare outcomes across different types of studies was In comparison trials of cholinesterase inhibitors which are routinely prescribed to improve cognition have a bigger impact with a standardised mean difference of in people with Alzheimer s For apathy the researchers looked at eight trials with a total of people The studies measured changes in motivation using common scoring systems Here noradrenergic drugs led to significant improvement the standardised mean difference was No effects were found for other symptoms including attention or agitation sources
