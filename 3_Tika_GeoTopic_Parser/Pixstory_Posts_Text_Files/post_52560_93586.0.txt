Bagh Massacre: What happened 103 years ago? Why this day is called darkest day in Indian history

Jallianwala Bagh Massacre Today marks 103 years of the horrific Jallianwala Bagh Massacre also known as the darkest Day in Indian History.
The day is remembered as the atrocious day of Indian history on which the brutal massacre happened in Jallianwala Bagh of the holy land of Guru Nanak, Amritsar. Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 13, 1919 was the most inhuman act of the British rulers in India.

The massacre took place on Baisakhi which is considered New Year day of Sikhs and also a harvest festival. The people of Punjab gathered on the auspicious day of Baisakhi at Jalianwala Bagh, near Golden Temple at Amritsar, to lodge their protest peacefully against harassment by the British Indian Government.

General Dyer suddenly appeared with an army of 90 British Indian Army soldiers and ordered to fire on all the people including women and children.

There was hustle and bustle all around. Hundreds of people were killed not only by firing but a huge number of deaths happened by stampedes at the gates and felling into the well in the compound in an attempt to rescue and look for shelter from the firing.

Thousands were injured. General Dyer later admitted that he had gone to the Bagh with the premeditated intention of opening fire if he found a horde assembled there in front of Hunter commission.
