Scoreboard Atalanta Musso his horrible match On the occasion of the first goal he misses the exit on Laimer instead of covering the near post and waiting for the opponent&#39;s winger to play In the second half he risks the omelette with the wrong exit that could have given Laimer the ball from Ma in the final that is overcome by landing Nkunku in the area and causing the penalty Hateboer fails to push on the right as usual and often ends up bogging down the game leaning on the player behind him Demiral good at canceling Andr Silva even if he is behind the defense Nerazzurri not exactly hermetic St Scalvini plays a good part of the game Palomino Dani Olmo and Andr Silva make life difficult On the occasion of the lead he misses the exit in midfield leaving the rear uncovered Zappacosta has plenty of space on the left and tries to make the most of it with some nice buck Unfortunately Boga can&#39;t help him De Roon little or nothing beyond the normal phrasing with his Freuler mates it can be seen that in mid-service He misses a few too many exits and thus fails to filter action st Pasalic sv Malinovskyi tries some good embroidery on the edge of the area but often not very supported by his teammates st Muriel moves a lot there in front looking for a hole but without success Koopmeiners does well in the halfback phase but his technical contribution must have a greater impact on the attack Boga the cosmic void He fails to affect and his plays are often all smoke and nothing roasted We really need a player like this Atalanta st Miranchuk doesn&#39;t find the right space to make himself dangerous Zapata not at his best Surrounded by the opponents&#39; red and white shirts too isolated from his teammates he can&#39;t put his hand in the match
