Louis Tomlinson is probably the most overlooked member of One Direction Louis was the oldest in the band and he was quite the mischief maker The boy from Doncaster didn t have a filter on his mouth and despite being the oldest in the group he was the one who caused the most chaos Often referred to as the trouble maker by his bandmates Louis did not try to shy away from the reputation or play it down he owned up to it Louis Tomlinson as many directioners would be aware is also responsible for one of the best albums from the group Midnight Memories Liam Payne in particular talked about how influential Louis was in convincing the management to allow them to bring a change in their music and that change certainly helped them differentiate from all the other pop bands in the history After the split of the band Harry became a pop sensation Zayn became a music sensation Niall became the perfect lover boy and Liam became an expert in airing One Direction s dirty laundry Louis Tomlinson failed to occupy a natural footing as he did not release an album for the next years after the split On st january Louis released Walls and believe me it is magic It can mend all of your heart sorrows While Louis has just started to make a name for himself as a Solo artist he s got no shortage of fans as his World Tour is sold out And his team are being forced by fans to constantly move to bigger venues or book more shows The dark horse of D is surely getting his name out there
