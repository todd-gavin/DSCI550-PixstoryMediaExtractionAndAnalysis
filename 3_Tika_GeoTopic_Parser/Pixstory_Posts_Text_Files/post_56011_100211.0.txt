‌The feud between Trump and Sadiq Khan goes on. Sadiq Khan blames Trump for the rise in social media abuse he receives. Addressing Stanford University students in California, Mr Khan partially blamed a 1,892% rise in abuse on Donald Trump's election as US president.

A feud started when Mr Trump criticised the mayor over his reaction to the London Bridge terror attacks in 2017. "He's not my biggest fan," Mr Khan told the audience in Silicon Valley. Mr Khan was elected mayor of London in May 2016, six months before Mr Trump won the White House. He said that all 4 years when Trump was the president he has police protection and faced online racial abuse. At the time Trump was banned from Twitter he said he received the least. 

The mayor is America as part of his efforts to "bang the drum for London" and motivate investment and tourism. The California leg of the tour has seen him meeting with technology and business leaders at Google and LinkedIn. He also said that everyone should be given a second chance and hoped Trump learned from his mistakes while asking about the reversal of Trump's ban on Twitter.

He said: "If he breaks the rules, there need to be consequences and we can't afford a situation where people think social media is where people behave irresponsibly, where you see an increase in not just racism, sexism and misogyny but also division."

The United Kingdom has an attitude to saying things straightforward and I am glad Sadiq Khan addressed our concerns on Trump.
