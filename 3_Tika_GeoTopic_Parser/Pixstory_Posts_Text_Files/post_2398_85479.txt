I feel every woman each one represents women power I really think that this whole thing about women empowerment is an oxymoron How can some one who is so unique resilient powerful need to be empowered What we need is recognition respect And that is within the purview of a woman You don t need men to give you that space You have to give yourself that space Women don t have to become men and men don t have to become women Each one has there own place What we don t need is gender discrimination There is no need to strive for equality we are superior in many ways need to have our OWN place identity Like the Yin Yang one without the other is not possible both forces are needed for perfect harmony So I believe No empowerment No equality Only respect recognition self realisation In other words Mutual coexistence And finally to realise one s full potential good health is critical to be in harmony with your mind body spirit And the pandemic has only reinforced the importance of being fit strong Remember You are what you eat you are what you digest as they say in our Upanishads jaisa Ann waisa Mann remember All diseases begin in the Gut And my best wishes to all the women out there who s dreams are waiting to be fulfilled
