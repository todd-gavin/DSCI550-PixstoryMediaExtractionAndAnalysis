Things are heating up in the state of Karnataka after several hijab clad girls were refused entry into the college premises. Even after repeated persuasion, they were granted entry but seated in an isolation area.

Now, as the High Court is hearing petitions, the protesting students on both sides are asked to maintain peace. 

Justice Dixit blamed a “mischievous section” which he said was keeping the controversy “burning”.
“But making agitation, going on the street, shouting slogans, attacking students, students attacking others, these are not good things,” Dixit said. (As reported by India Today)

While the anti hijab protesters maintain that their motive is to maintain a uniform code and remove any signs of distinction among the students based on caste, religion or class in the education institutions, some are wondering is this is merely an islamophobic move hiding behind the facade of “uniform code”. 

Some students have taken to twitter to express how this move is against the essence of secularism of the country. Some are pointing out how this is just another incident in a long string of incidents wherein the Muslims have been denied the freedom to practice their religion without looking over their shoulders with a persistent fear of being judged.

However, this debate is not limited to India. In April 2011, France became the first European country to impose a ban on full-face veils in public areas.

While the discussion in India is centered around “uniform code”, the concerns of French public were over secularism, sexuality, security of common folks, nationalism and basic rights.

This begs the question of what exactly is the demarcation of the religion and the State and how does the idea of secularism fits into it.
