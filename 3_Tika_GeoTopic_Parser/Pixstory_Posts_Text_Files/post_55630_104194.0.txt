Why Are You Like This, like many really modern shows, tackles hot button themes like cancel culture and identity politics in a satirical and dry humorous style. 

Like Collider says, the show follows a group of Gen Z roommates, Mia (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Naomi Higgins), and Austin (Wil King), as they navigate their way through a rapidly changing modern world, with all the changing cultural and social values that entails, as well as their own paths toward adulthood, with all the drudge work and social politics that entails. 

It's a sophisticated, original take on modern living for young twenty-somethings, and it deals with huge subjects like gender, ethnicity, and religion in a subtle way. However, it also pokes fun at itself for taking itself so seriously as to think it could “deal with big issues”. 

Classic Zoomer energy!
