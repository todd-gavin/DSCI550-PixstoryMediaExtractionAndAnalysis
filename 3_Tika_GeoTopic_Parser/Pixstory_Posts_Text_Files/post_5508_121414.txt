Guy Wesley Reffitt a participant in the January th riots got the longest sentence of any convicted rioter seven years for his activities during the January th riots Reffitt was among the rioters that day and was armed with a caliber pistol although he is not alleged to have entered the Capitol Despite not entering the Capitol and not directly assaulting anybody like another capital rioter who got a five year sentence his case was unique because he threatened to murder his family if they talked about his participation in the riot and while awaiting trial he utilized his status as a Department of Justice target to solicit donations and distribute a manifesto Prosecutors initially requested years in prison and treatment as a domestic terrorist As he was believed to have been radicalized in the months preceding up to the incident the court dismissed these allegations and sentenced the defendant to seven years in jail plus in restitution and mental health education Those who invaded the Capitol with the purpose to riot or cause violence should be incarcerated In the future however I hope that the Department of Justice and local law enforcement will practice what they preach and punish rioters who do criminal acts in the same manner as the capital Capitol rioters
