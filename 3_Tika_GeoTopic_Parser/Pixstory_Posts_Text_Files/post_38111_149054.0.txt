Paris Saint Germain are certainly a force to be reckoned with in Europe once again. The Parisians enjoy a fierce attack that consists of Messi, Neymar, and Mbappe. But who among the three would stand out at the end of the 2022/23 season? 
Kylian Mbappe easily managed to stand out over his South American teammates last season. Owing to his great form, the PSG board offered the Frenchman a "record-breaking" deal in order to keep him at the club. But even though Mbappe enjoyed a great season on a personal level, the club failed to live up to their expectations under Pochettino, leading to the manager being sacked. 
In the first few games of the 22/23 season, Neymar has arguably been the pick of the PSG forwards. The Brazilian has scored 8 goals and provided 7 assists in just 8 Ligue 1 games this season. Lionel Messi has also joined the party, scoring 4 goals and providing 7 assists in the league. This has helped PSG maintain an unbeaten run, collecting 7 wins in their first 8 Ligue 1 games. 
Kylian Mbappe has also matched his teammates with 7 goals in 7 Ligue 1 games. The Frenchman has also scored 3 goals in the Champions League this season, hence becoming the current highest scorer of the club. However, I feel that Neymar would be the pick of the forwards this season.
The Brazilian has overcome his niggles and I certainly hope that he maintains it going into the World Cup. As a bonus to Neymar, If the Brazilian national team and Paris Saint Germain manage to have a good year, the winger could even see himself picking a Ballon d'Or in 2023. Only time will tell how and where Neymar finishes the 22/23 season in late May.
