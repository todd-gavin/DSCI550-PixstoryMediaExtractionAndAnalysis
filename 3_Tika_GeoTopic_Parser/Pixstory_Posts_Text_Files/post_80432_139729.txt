Bukayo Saka has turned out to be one of the most important players in Mikel Arteta s starting XI Over the years the Arsenal academy graduate has evolved as a player and has gone to become Arsenal s no In this season Saka has been one of the vital players for the Gunners as they have made a start to their campaign They had won five straight matches but their winning streak jolted by Manchester United this Sunday The Red Devils at home handed Arsenal their first loss of the Premier League campaign Much has already been talked about the game especially questions being raised at Arsenalplayers consistency Saka was one of the players who came under the radar a bit for his Although looking at the score sheet at the end of the match Saka was the onlyplayer who could register himself there for the Gunners Saka took the most shots in the match with four attempts but only one was on target with that being his solitary goal It was an easy finish for the Englishman who put it home as the ball came to him after a save by United Goal keeper David De Gea This was the equaliser around hour mark Apart from his attacking efforts Saka completed passes but his pass accuracy percentage of was comparatively lower than his previous games in the Premier League He pressed the United defence at least times which was the average for all of Arsenal s attackers On the contrary Saka attempted tackles but it was one too many as he was booked in the thminute for his mistimed tackle on Malacia Personally I feel Saka had an average game for his standards even though he got one goal forhis team He was better than most other Arsenal players as he was allowed to take shots atgoal But as the season progresses I am sure he will have better matches for the North London side and will surely look to convert his shots into goals
