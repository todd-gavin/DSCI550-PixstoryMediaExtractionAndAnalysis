A two-time World Cup winner's brief spell with Arsenal has come to an end due to injury.

 Arsenal
has announced that Tobin Heath, a US international, has been given early release from her
contract after suffering an unfortunate injury.

The two-time World Cup winner's one-year contract with Arsenal was set to expire in the
summer, but a hamstring injury has forced her to end her 2021-22 campaign early. With that in
mind, the club and the player have mutually agreed to part ways, allowing the 33-year-old
forward to finish her recuperation on American soil.

"Although I'm disappointed that my time at Arsenal has come to an early end, I have cherished
every minute of my time here," she told the club's official website.

“I would like to thank everyone at the club who has made me feel so welcome.

“Arsenal is a special club and this is a special group of players. I have no doubt that they are
bound for success in the near future and I’ll be supporting the team with the rest of the Arsenal
family from now on.”

Heath joined Arsenal after fitness issues limited her performances for Manchester United in the
2020-21 season to just 11 games.

She did marginally better in the English capital, but she only made 18 appearances for Arsenal
and scored three goals, including a 90th minute equaliser in a match against fellow Women's
Super League title contenders Manchester City.

All parties involved would have anticipated more, with Heath particularly unhappy at her inability
to make a bigger influence at the team she grew up supporting. Heath's NWSL rights were
acquired by Louisville during her time in Manchester, so it's unclear where she'll go next.
