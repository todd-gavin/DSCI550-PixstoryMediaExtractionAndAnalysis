Congress provisional president Sonia Gandhi arrived at the ED office in New Delhi today for the second round of questioning in the National Herald money laundering case. She was accompanied by Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi.

The ED questioned Sonia for two hours long on July 21 and halted the session for the day on her request as she is recovering from Covid, officials said. 

The agencyâ€™s case is based on a trial court order that allowed the Income Tax Department to probe the affairs of the National Herald newspaper and conduct a tax assessment of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. The order was the result of a 2013 petition filed by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, who claimed cheating and misappropriation of funds on the part of the Gandhis in acquiring the newspaper.
