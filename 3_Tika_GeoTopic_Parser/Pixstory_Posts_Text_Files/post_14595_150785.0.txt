Unfortunately, most fatalities related to a food allergy occur when eating outside the home, which indicates that some food businesses:
👉Do not have an effective process for preparing foods for customers with food allergies.
👉The staff are not trained about food allergens so they understand what information they need to provide to customers.
👉Staff are not trained to ask customers about food allergies.
👉Staff are not trained on food safety best practices to prevent cross-contamination
are not effectively communicating allergy requests.
👉Staffs are not adequately prepared to handle emergency situations.
