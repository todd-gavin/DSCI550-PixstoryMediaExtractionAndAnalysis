While shooting for a movie or while clicking a photograph, there is one important rule which helps the photographer or videographer to make the content stunning and aesthetically good, and that one important rule is “Rule of Thirds.”

What is the Rule Of Thirds?

The rule of thirds is guidelines that will break an image into thirds (horizontally and vertically) and the camera person will have to see nine boxes and four gridlines. You can have this option on your camera as well as on the phone. By positioning the subject and objects along the gridlines, the cameraman will end up with better compositions. 

Now, I will explain different types of “Rule of thirds” which are as follows:-

1. Headroom Space - While shooting, the cameraman should leave the headroom space, so that when the subject or object does not get cut during editing or at the time telecast. It is also advisable to work in a safe working zone to get better results.

2. Looking Space - While shooting, the cameraperson should leave two-thirds of space, in the direction where the subject and object are looking and cover the subject or object in the remaining one-third frame.

3. Leading Space/Walking Space - In the direction of movement, the cameraperson should leave two-thirds of space and cover the subject in the remaining one-third of the frame. Directors, do this to create curiosity in the mind of the people that ‘What will happen next?

4. Horizon Space - When the director told the cinematographer to shoot the landscape scene the cameraperson have to leave one-third space for the landscape and the remaining two-thirds part will be covered by the horizon.

I think after explaining “What is the Rule of thirds,” and how to use it, you will consider little details and make your photos and videos better than before.
