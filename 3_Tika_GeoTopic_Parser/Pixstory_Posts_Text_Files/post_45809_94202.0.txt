As a space enthusiast, I have always wondered how astronauts adjust to life in space and then life on earth after returning from space. To say that the change is drastic would be an understatement, in my opinion. 

There are so many factors at play here: how do they adjust to change in gravity? They are now used to floating around in zero gravity but now they have their feet on solid ground. The daily ablutions also go under a change and getting back to “normal” is not an easy feat. One moment you are used to the dark of the space and next you are looking at bright blue sky. In all honesty, our astronauts deserve so much more. They go through all this for the progression of mankind and to learn as much as possible about outer space. 

For instance, on Saturday, three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth after spending six months aboard their country's newest orbiting station, the longest crewed trip in China's ambitious space programme to date. 

ABC News reported that the Shenzhou 13 space ship landed in the Gobi desert in Inner Mongolia's northern area, which was broadcast live on state television. 

During the trip, astronaut Wang Yaping performed the first Chinese woman's spacewalk. Wang and his coworkers Zhai Zhigang and Ye Guangfu broadcasted physics lessons to high school students. 

In 2003, China flew its first person into space, and in 2013 and last year, it landed robot rovers on the moon and on Mars. Now, that is what you call progression. Let’s hope that the transition from space to earth is easy for these guys.
