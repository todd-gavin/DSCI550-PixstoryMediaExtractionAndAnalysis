We’re about a month away from the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and so far even just the trailers have made me weep because of the tender and dignified way they show a nation grieving after the death of King T’Challa, the Black Panther. The first trailer, set to a mashup of Tems’ version of “No Woman No Cry” and Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright,” has its emotional climax in Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda, T’Challa’s mother, proclaiming, “Have I not given everything?”
Ramonda’s grief — shattering and shrill — mirrors our grief over the loss of Chadwick Boseman, whose work onscreen and off uplifted and celebrated Black life before he died of cancer at just 43 years of age. In the wake of Black Panther, Boseman took it upon himself to become an avatar of “Black male dignity” and welcomed being a symbol for Black people who needed someone to look up to. In the first trailer for Wakanda Forever, the death of T’Challa looms large over Wakanda in the same way Boseman’s death looms over the premiere of the sequel. Who can step up with the gravitas required to fill T’Challa’s shoes?
Letitia Wright, who plays Shuri, is T'Challa's sister and the genius behind many of Wakanda's scientific and technological innovations. Some fans think the film confirms that it's Shuri (they are wrong). It's possible that the Black Panther title might immediately go to her after the death of T'Challa — but even if it does, the first Black Panther has already established the process through which the tribes of Wakanda may challenge for the Black Panther title, so making Shuri the Black Panther by default would be too obvious a play. 
Second, there's a lot of mystery surrounding Michaela Coel's casting.  Coel is too big to be added to an already star-studded cast as a distant, insignificant character. She's also on the cover of November's issue of Vogue magazine. She's only billed as "Aneka, a Wakandan warrior."
