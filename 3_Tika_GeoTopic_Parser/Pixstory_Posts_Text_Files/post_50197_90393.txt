Spinosaurus the largest known carnivorous dinosaur and its closest relatives long have confounded scientists trying to understand how these unusual water loving beasts lived their lives and hunted prey Did they wade into rivers and lakes like a heron Or did they swim underwater like a hippo or croc It turns out that the answer was in their bones their bone density to be precise Scientists said on Wednesday that Spinosaurus and its cousin Baryonyx possessed extremely compact bones that would have helped them stay submerged for underwater swimming as semiaquatic predators targeting large prey Both were members of a Cretaceous Period dinosaur group called spinosaurids that boasted anatomical adaptations such as elongated crocodile like snouts and conical teeth for hunting aquatic prey But the researchers found that another spinosaurid called Suchomimus lacked dense bones and likely was a wading predator showing an unexpected degree of ecological diversity within this group Spinosaurus about feet meters long and weighing seven tons lived million years ago in Africa Its anatomy was unlike any other dinosaur with a relatively small pelvis short hind legs paddle like tail and feet for propulsion in the water and a curious sail like structure of bony spines feet meters tall on its back Workers adjust a Spinosaurus skeleton replica during a preparation and media preview for the Dinosaur EXPO at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo I think this animal is simply weird we have nothing alive today that could be considered remotely similar said Matteo Fabbri a postdoctoral researcher in paleontology at the Field Museum in Chicago and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature I really like the idea of this giant animal weighing many tons submerging under water to catch prey It is striking to me that it has a giant sail crest on its back That would have made it hard for it to hide under water but much more ominous a bit like a shark fin poking above the water line said University of Oxford paleontologist and study co author Roger Benson
