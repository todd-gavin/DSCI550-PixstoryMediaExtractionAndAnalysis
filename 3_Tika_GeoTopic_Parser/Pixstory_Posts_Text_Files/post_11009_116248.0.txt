In a piece published recently by the Guardian, Julie Posetti and Kalina Bontcheva wrote that the 8.5m tweets directed at journalist Rana Ayyub in 27 months marked her out as one of the most brutally targeted journalists in the world and exposed Twitter’s failure to address online violence. 


Ayyub, an independent journalist, Washington Post columnist, and a critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, has used her social media heft and the global attention she receives to highlight the plight of Indian Muslims and the arrests of journalists in India. She is accused of money laundering and tax fraud related to her crowdfunding campaign to help those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  Ayyub has denied any wrongdoing, calling the allegations “baseless.”


The tweets were examined as part of an international research project aimed at developing an early warning system for gender-based online violence against women journalists, in light of the mounting concerns of online abuse and harassment leading to offline attacks, wrote Posetti, deputy vice president and the global director of research at the Washington DC-based International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), and Bontcheva, a professor at the University of Sheffield in the UK.


In an interview with Article 14, Posetti delved into why they picked Ayyub for the study, the nature of coordinated attacks, how online violence enables political repression, and why the tech companies needed to fight the abuse levelled at women journalists in many countries, as well as the state-issued orders of censorship on its platform. 


On 26 June 2022, complying with an Indian government order, Twitter withheld Ayyub’s tweet from 9 April 2021 on the Gyanvapi mosque after a local judge allowed an Archeological Survey of India (ASI) survey of the religious site in Varanasi.
