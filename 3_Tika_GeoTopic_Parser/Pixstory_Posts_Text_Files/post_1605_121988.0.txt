South Point School, Kolkata in West Bengal is developing its own nano satellite and a space laboratory for students at its campus .

The nano satellite will be built with the assistance of the Indian Technology Congress Association (ITCA) which is the nodal agency for students’ satellite mission of the Centre and under the supervision of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

The South Point School satellite named 'PriyamvadaSat' is expected to be launched after nine months from ISRO’s Sriharikota centre.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed at the premises between South Point School and ITCA on Tuesday. The ITCA has been entrusted with the responsibility to execute the launch of 75 student satellites into low Earth orbits. The project to launch 75 tiny satellites built by students has been conceived by the Centre to celebrate the nation’s 75th Independence Day. 

The students of South Point School will be able to monitor the PriyamvadaSat from the ground station cum space lab to be established at the school premises. They will also be able to collect data at the centre sent by the satellite.

“The Space Lab at the school will play the unique role of giving future generations of students a first-hand experience into space sciences as well as sensitise them into the immense possibilities that the Space holds for mankind’s future,” according to the school.

This will remain a milestone in the history of South Point School. The launching of the 75 student satellites is a part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav of the Government of India to commemorate the 75 years of India’s freedom.

South Point School, Kolkata is the second private school in the country and first in Eastern India  to sign this MoU. Forty nine institutions across the country have signed this MoU.
