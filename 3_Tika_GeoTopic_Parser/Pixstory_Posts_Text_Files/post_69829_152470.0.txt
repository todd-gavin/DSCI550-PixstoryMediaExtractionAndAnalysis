Deepika recalled the racial stereotypes in Hollywood and her upsetting interaction with a Hollywood actor. 
Deepika Padukone Talks about the racial stereotypes in Hollywood and how the West perceives outsiders, Deepika told Business of Fashion, "You are the scientist. You are the computer geek. You are the taxi driver. You are the therapist. You are the owner of a convenience store. I’ve had my fans ask me why I’ve not done more [global] movies. But that’s not what I’m settling for, because I am — and we are — so much more than that. It would upset me every time I went to the US. Some of the things that are said and some of the things that are done just [make it] so obvious that people don’t know the world outside of the world that they live in.”
Deepika also recalled an upsetting interaction with a Hollywood actor, without naming the person. She said, “I know this actor… I met him at this Vanity Fair party, and he said ‘Hey by the way, you speak English really well.’ I didn’t even realise what that meant. And when I came back I said, ‘What do you mean you speak English really well?’ Did he have this notion that we don’t speak English?’”
