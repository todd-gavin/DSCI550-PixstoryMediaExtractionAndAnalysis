Nick Kyrgios is experiencing the most intense hours of his entire tennis career to date. He will play the Wimbledon final on Sunday but will do so without taking the field in the semifinal. they got him through and into the final act of tennis&#39; oldest tournament for the first time A fortune he wished he hadn&#39;t however Not the way I wanted to get to the final As someone who loves competition I really wanted to play the game The my first feeling was something like a disappointment All my energies were already on how to approach the match what kind of feeling I would have and stuff like that he said in today&#39;s press conference This year Nadal hadn&#39;t lost a single match yet For Kyrgios would have been a very tough challenge Instead he could have to face the very tough challenge in the final when he could be the former world number one Djokovic jn tennis player with whom he never got along at least until what happened at the last Australian Open Everyone knows that for a long time not that we really liked each other let&#39;s say what he said about his relationship with djokovic what happened i think i was the only player to stand up for him clearly what happened in australia and i think that&#39;s where we earned respect more than on the field just a question of when you have a moment of crisis in your life and someone comes to your aid Now we exchange DMs on Instagram and stuff like that It&#39;s strange Guy at the beginning of the week he told me I hope to see you on Sunday in the final
