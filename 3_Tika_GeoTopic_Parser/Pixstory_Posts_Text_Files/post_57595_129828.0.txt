There are many who say that it is necessary to have empathy, but no one actually talks about the moral dilemmas associated with empathy.
To think of someone in every situation and every time can entangle you in some of the doubts that wouldn't be easy to resolve.
It can lead to empathy fatigue, the exhaustion you might feel both emotionally and physically after repeatedly being exposed to stressful or traumatic events. You might also feel numb or powerless, isolate yourself, and lack energy.

It is a concern in certain situations, such as when acting as a caregiver. Studies also show that if healthcare workers can't balance their feelings of empathy (affective empathy, in particular), it can also result in compassion fatigue.

Misplaced empathy can be bad for you and others, leading to exhaustion and apathy and preventing you from helping the people you need. Worse, people's empathetic tendencies can even be harnessed to manipulate them into aggression and cruelty.
