Aaron Ramsey's exclusion from Juventus' squad for the Serie A team's pre-season tour of the
United States on Thursday added to the uncertainty surrounding his future.

The 31-year-old Wales midfielder has been left out of Massimiliano Allegri's travelling squad
along with Federico Chiesa, Mattia De Sciglio, Kaio Jorge, Arthur Melo, Marko Pjaca, and
Adrien Rabiot. The player played the second half of the 2021–22 season on loan to English
Premiership Rangers.

Ramsey has been linked with a return to his old team Cardiff while still in the final year of his
lucrative deal at Juventus, where he made only five appearances last season.

Injury has ruined the former Arsenal player's career, but he is still an important member of the
national squad as they get ready for their first World Cup since 1958 later this year.

Although his
situation is complicated by a reputed £400,000 weekly salary, it looks that his future lies outside
of Turin.

Ramsey played for Rangers in 13 games, and in the shootout against Eintracht Frankfurt that
decided the Europa League final, he missed a penalty that would have given Rangers victory.

Although in an ideal world, both he and his national team manager would want him to be playing
regular football before the trip to Qatar, his importance to Wales means that Robert Page's plans
are unlikely to be challenged by his club situation.

Gareth Bale, a member of the same international team, left Real Madrid after nine unhappy
years and last month signed a 12-month contract with Major League Soccer team Los Angeles
FC.
