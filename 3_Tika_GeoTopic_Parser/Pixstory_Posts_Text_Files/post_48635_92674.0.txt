There are two games left in this season: Friday's duel for 11th place in Washington and Sunday's Garden finale against Toronto.

The Knicks (35-45) are 10 games under.500 and fighting for a lottery spot, much like in the old days. However, Knicks president Leon Rose must make the most of the final 96 minutes this weekend by calling the shots on rotations.

The Knicks need Immanuel Quickley to start at point guard for the final two games and integrate with Evan Fournier and RJ Barrett's starting unit. If the Knicks are unable to secure a real starting point guard for next season, Quickley could be a fallback option. Despite a sloppy performance against the Nets, Quickley has been probably their greatest player since the All-Star break (1-for-8). Allow him to run the show for 35 minutes every night.

No one wants to see Alec Burks, the current starter. Burks should be placed in a cab bound crosstown by Knicks adviser William Wesley, Quickley's biggest admirer, so he can see the Mets play the Washington Nationals. Burks, 30, scored 24 points and added one assist in 37 minutes against the Nets. The Knicks have seen what he can accomplish when he's not in the starting lineup, and it's not good enough.
