As per Football Fancast, Tottenham Hotspur are considering signing Lautaro Martinez in the summer.

Inter Milan had earlier stated that Lautaro Martinez will not be sold at any cost. But the Serie A giants have now tracked back and could sell the Argentine for the right price.

According to the report, Inter Milan would be ready to sell the forward for a transfer fee between €60 million and €70 million. Hence this gives Tottenham Hotspur a chance to get their man in the summer transfer window.





Why do the Spurs need Lautaro Martinez? 

The Spurs already have Harry Kane in their ranks. The Englishman is their focal point in attack. Hence the question arises as to why the North London club needs another center-forward. 

The answer to this is very simple, Lautaro Martinez and Antonio Conte formed a deadly combination at Inter Milan for the past two seasons. The center-forward also helped the club win the Serie A title in the 2020/21 season. 

Lautaro Martinez scored 31 goals and provided 9 assists under Antonio Conte in two Serie A seasons. The 24-year-old has stayed in touch even after the Italian's departure and has scored 15 Serie A goals this season. 

Harry Kane was looking to leave Tottenham Hotspur for Manchester City last season. But Daniel Levy, the Spurs owner, did not sanction the move. Nevertheless, this could be the case once again at the end of the 2021/22 season. 

Even if Harry Kane decides to stay, Conte could play Martinez and Kane together. The Italian adopted a 3-5-2 formation at Inter Milan to fit both Lukaku and Martinez. Hence, the Spurs could only profit if they manage to sign Lautaro Martinez in the summer
