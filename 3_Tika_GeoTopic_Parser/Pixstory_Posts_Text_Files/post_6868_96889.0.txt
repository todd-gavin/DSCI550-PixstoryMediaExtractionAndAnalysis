When Harry Potter author JK Rowling misused Lesbian Visbility Week as an oppurtunity to unleash the ongoing transphobia from her Twitter wand, the spell bounced back.

“Lesbian Visibility Week starts today in the UK. A good moment to salute the resilience and courage of my inspirational friend,” Rowling tweeted alongside a photo of Barrister Allison Bailey is the founder of LGB Alliance, an anti-trans hate organization.

“Bailey, a lawyer, is currently suing LGBT+ rights charity Stonewall and her former employer Garden Court Chambers for discrimination, after she was subject to an internal investigation over anti-trans social media posts and her involvement with LGB Alliance,” PinkNews reports.

Rowling is infamous for misusing queer and lesbian identities to validate her transmisogyny by showing herself as a ‘protector of lesbian rights’ to validate her attack on trans folks.

However, this time her performative show of supporting lesbians backfired: the founder of Lesbian Visibility Week, Linda Riley responded to the writer’s attempts to divide queer and trans folking by tweeting: “Wow! I certainly did not create #LesbianVisibilityWeek so that people like jk_rowling could use it as a vehicle to stir up more hate within our community. This is a perfect example of #HowNotToBeAnAlly”

Rowling then went on to specifically target psychotherapist and photographer Alex Drummond, a trans woman and lesbian who has called out the medicalization and scrutiny that is violently imposed by an unscientific gender binary.

While all this might come across a back and forth of tweets, Rowling is leading her own movement of normalizing transmisogyny, which holds the continuous danger of translating into violence against women who are trans.
