CHERNOBYL Chernobyl has had a pretty dark history from unprecedented nuclear event that shaped not only the history of the country but also the history of the world Recently Russia s invasion reached Chernobyl and Chernobyl has been officially occupied by the Russian forces we look back at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and how it is portrayed in the HBO tv series The five episode series is chilling in its depiction of the devastating story of Chernobyl all the events that lead to it Since it is a mini series this review is treading at a very thin line as I have to and want to avoid every single spoiler The whole series has an outstanding narrative that gets you hooked to the screen from the minute go and then lets you immerse yourself in the story feel the insanity that involved the process and feel the sadness and pain of the aftermath of the events The story follows the day of the nuclear disaster telling the events that lead to the catastrophy to the point where it affected the people around and then the realisation of the impact the events would have As a conversation from the series describe the impact where the head doctor asks one of the experts about putting out the fire and the head doctor replies that they are with something that has never occurred on this planet before That was the frequency of the event it will have its reprecussions for a long time in history and something that works a warning sign for all nuclear factories how devastating one tiny slip up could be Highly highly recommended
