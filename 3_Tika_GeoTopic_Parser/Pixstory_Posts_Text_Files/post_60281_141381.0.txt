Maneka Gambhir, the sister-in-law of TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, was given a summons to cooperate in an inquiry into a case of money laundering on September 10 evening at the Kolkata airport by the ED, according to official sources.
Ms. Gambhir arrived at the airport to board a flight to Bangkok at around nine o'clock in the evening.
According to sources, Ms. Gambhir's immigration clearance was denied on September 11 as a result of a federal investigation agency's Look Out Circular (LOC) that was issued against her.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) was notified after the immigration authorities stopped her, so they drove to the airport, spoke with her, and told her she was not permitted to go, they claimed.
According to the sources, the ED officials then gave her a summons asking her to appear before the agency on September 12 at 11 a.m. at its office in Kolkata's Salt Lake neighbourhood for questioning in a money laundering case connected to an alleged West Bengali coal theft case.
In August, the Calcutta High Court ordered the ED to examine Ms. Gambhir at its regional office in Kolkata rather than in Delhi and to hold off on using coercion until the next hearing date.
In connection with the alleged coal scam case, the ED had issued a summons to Ms. Gambhir, asking her to appear in person in Delhi on September 5. Ms. Gambhir had objected to the summons and requested the court to order the ED to allow her to appear in person in Kolkata, where she claimed to reside.
