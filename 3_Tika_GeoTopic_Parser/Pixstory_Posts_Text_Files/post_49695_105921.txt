Wisconsin Gov Tony Evers has called a special session for the Republican controlled Legislature to invalidate the state s dormant year old law banning abortion This decision broadens his chances to win political points with his democratic base Republican legislators support banning abortion and are not obligated to take any action during the session They even ignored the other special session that Evers called imploring them to take action on problems such as gun control increasing school funding and sending rebate checks to taxpayers This isn t about politics it s about empathy compassion and doing the right thing Evers said in a statement It s about making sure the people we care about get the healthcare they need when they need it All of the Republicans running in the Aug primary challenge Evers to support a total abortion ban with no exceptions for situations such as rape or incest Republicans are anticipated to maintain their strong legislative majority following the November election Evers called on the Legislature to meet on June to repeal the dormant law that makes abortion a criminal offence except to save the recipient s life If the Supreme Court repeals Roe as was reported in a leaked draft opinion the state law would go back into effect Wisconsin s abortion ban law is foreseen to be challenged in court should Roe be overturned One major question is how that ban would interact with a relevant state law passed in that prohibits abortions after the fetus has reached viability but has an exemption for women whose health could be jeopardized by continuing the pregnancy Abortion rights groups have asserted a broad interpretation of that exemption to include a woman s emotional and mental health Source US News
