Australians have been mostly kept in the dark about the kilojoules hidden in their liquor, but that could change soon if a proposal to include energy labelling on alcoholic drinks is approved. 

On Monday, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) said that it was working on a proposal to include the labelling. 

Melissa Iaria has written that packaged alcoholic beverages, unlike most other packaged foods and beverages, are free from giving nutrition information on the label. 

It means that consumers have been unable to recognise the energy contribution of alcohol to their diet (measured in kilojoules or calories). 

According to the National Health and Medical Research Council, alcohol has a significant energy content, producing 29.3 kilojoules per gramme.

The Brewers Association of Australia, which represents Australian beer producers and customers, has backed FSANZ's efforts to identify energy. 

Improved labelling that shows how many kilojoules are in a product is also supported by the Obesity Policy Coalition. 

It contended, however, that the labels should only reflect energy amount because included carbohydrate or sugar levels on the labels could encourage people to believe that low sugar or low carb goods were healthier – regardless of alcohol content – potentially leading to their drinking more.
