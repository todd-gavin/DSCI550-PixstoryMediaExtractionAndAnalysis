Did you know that your breakouts can actually tell you a lot about what’s happening inside your body? Start solving your skin problems with a little something called face mapping: exactly where, when, and what kind of blemishes pop up can tell you what the root problem is and help you fix it!

FOREHEAD:

Pimples here are usually linked to the digestive system, and may indicate that you’re having a hard time breaking down certain foods. It may also indicate liver problems, stress, or an irregular sleep schedule. Try using digestive enzymes like bromelain and papaya before each meal to help break down foods, and make sure you’re getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night. If you suspect liver/toxin issues, try some dandelion tea or some extra garlic and onions. Drinking hot water with lemon in the morning may also help.

BETWEEN THE BROWS:

Did you have to break down and get fast food yesterday? Greasy, fatty foods may be connected to acne here. Stick with healthy choices as much as you can! Another possible cause—too much alcohol. If you find pimples here after a night out where you consumed a few drinks, that may be your issue.

CHEEKS:

Allergies that affect the respiratory system may also be to blame, or if you pressed your cell phone against your skin while talking, germs may have been transferred to your face. Always wash skin thoroughly before bed to try to get rid of trace contaminants, and shield your skin with natural antioxidants 

CHIN:

Chin pimples often come around because of changes in your hormones. In the days before your period, try to pay extra attention to your skin care. Also be sure you’re not resting your chin in your hands when bored or tired, as this can transfer oils from your fingers onto your chin, which can cause pimples.
