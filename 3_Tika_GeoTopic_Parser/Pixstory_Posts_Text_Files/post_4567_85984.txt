READER QUESTION If humans don t die out in a climate apocalypse or asteroid impact in the next years are we likely to evolve further into a more advanced species than what we are at the moment Harry Bonas Nigeria Humanity is the unlikely result of billion years of evolution From self replicating molecules in Archean seas to eyeless fish in the Cambrian deep to mammals scurrying from dinosaurs in the dark and then finally improbably ourselves evolution shaped us Organisms reproduced imperfectly Mistakes made when copying genes sometimes made them better fit to their environments so those genes tended to get passed on More reproduction followed and more mistakes the process repeating over billions of generations Finally Homo sapiens appeared But we aren t the end of that story Evolution won t stop with us and we might even be evolving faster than ever It s hard to predict the future The world will probably change in ways we can t imagine But we can make educated guesses Paradoxically the best way to predict the future is probably looking back at the past and assuming past trends will continue going forward This suggests some surprising things about our future We will likely live longer and become taller as well as more lightly built We ll probably be less aggressive and more agreeable but have smaller brains A bit like a golden retriever we ll be friendly and jolly but maybe not that interesting At least that s one possible future But to understand why I think that s likely we need to look at biology The end of natural selection Some scientists have argued that civilisation s rise ended natural selection It s true that selective pressures that dominated in the past predators famine plague warfare have mostly disappeared Starvation and famine were largely ended by high yield crops fertilisers and family planning The lions wolves and sabertoothed cats that hunted us in the dark are endangered or extinct Plagues that killed millions smallpox Black Death cholera were tamed by vaccines antibiotics clean water Full story at The Conversation Imagery
