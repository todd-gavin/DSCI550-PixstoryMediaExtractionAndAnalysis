Not a regular burger, but a MOMO burger  ..... 
Yess, today I tried a combination of MOMOS + Burger = MoBurger 🍔 
Guess what, it was as delicious as momos or a burger ..  had a great flavor of ginger garlic .... and was tossed with schezwan sauce  .... absolutely a treat to eat ..... 
The bread was no good, but who cares ... MOMOS was the winner .... 
Recommended do give it a try ...
