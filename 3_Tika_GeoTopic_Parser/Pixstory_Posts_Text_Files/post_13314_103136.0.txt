Jasica told me that humans are in fact bad-tempered selfish beings, that is why they even can not tolerate their loved ones. They are liers too, when they express interest in each other, in fact they want each other for show-off, by the time the show is over, they reveal their true feelings towards one another, that is hatred. Maybe she is right. By the way, if you don't know Jasica, she is my cute pet, like you have animal pets, I have a cute pets. Pets are good, they don't have opinion and they never judge.
