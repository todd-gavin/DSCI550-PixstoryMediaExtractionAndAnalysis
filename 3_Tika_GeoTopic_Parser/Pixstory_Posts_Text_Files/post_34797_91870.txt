From that day on, his life changed and after taking some time to recharge, he returned to winning, even if for now only in the indoor meters Waiting to get back to competing in meters he was interviewed by Corriere della Sera on the sidelines of his triumph at the Indoor World Championships in Belgrade in which he talked about everything starting with his victory at the World Championship which was anything but obvious it was the most difficult victory I came from a vintage super in which everything went well for me Many had raised a thousand doubts I will be deconcentrated I will no longer be hungry Many do not know athletics they think that you can win the Olympics like this with a kick of your ass I had to make it clear that Tokyo was not the result of a coincidence work of a team of a lifetime Immediately after the Olympics there was talk of his moving to America rumors denied A lot of things have been invented Why should I go and live in America I am Italian I already left Desenzano for Rome Rumors that have followed one another also on the alleged doping in particular by the English who in the Japanese final had seen their athlete disqualified for a false start Those rumors did not touch me at all They were spread by people who do not know athletics and do not know me People who know nothing of the dark years of the suffering of all the things I told her For them an Italian could not win gold in But I know how long it took me
