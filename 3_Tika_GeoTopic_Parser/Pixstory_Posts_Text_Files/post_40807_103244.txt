Ah happy happy boughs that cannot shed Your leaves nor ever bid the Spring adieu And happy melodist unwearied For ever piping songs for ever new More happy love more happy happy love For ever warm and still to be enjoy d For ever panting and for ever young All breathing human passion far above That leaves a heart high sorrowful and cloy d A burning forehead and a parching tongue Who are these coming to the sacrifice To what green altar O mysterious priest Lead st thou that heifer lowing at the skies And all her silken flanks with garlands drest What little town by river or sea shore Or mountain built with peaceful citadel Is emptied of this folk this pious morn John Keats
