Masturbation is one activity that can play a huge role in an individual's sexual and mental well-being, right into old age. The cocktail of neurochemicals that are released during ejaculation/orgasm can act as a natural stress buster and make you fall asleep faster. Yet many people experience a great deal of shame and guilt, engaging in it especially within the context of a marriage/relationship. My guest for today's VVOX podcast is Dr Lawrence I Sank, a Harvard trained sex-therapist and one of the most citied living researchers on the science of masturbation. Dr Sank has been practicing as a couple's therapist in the Washington Metropolitan area, US, since 1973. He is also a co-founder of VVOX. Some of the questions that are answered during the discussion are:

Is it normal to masturbate within marriage/ relationship? 
Why do married men/women masturbate?
How much is too much, when it comes to masturbation?
When can masturbation become a problem?
