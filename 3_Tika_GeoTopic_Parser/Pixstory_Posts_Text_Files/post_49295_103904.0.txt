What is the biggest ever selling single of all time in the history of music, you ever wonder? It's actually a fan favourite till date and happens to be a Christmas song. Ah, of course it's a Christmas song. 

Bing Crosby's 1947 rendition of "White Christmas" is not only the best-selling Christmas single of all time, but it is also the best-selling song of all time. Most people are unaware that Crosby recorded the song with the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter's Orchestra five years prior, in 1942. Only Crosby was featured in the latter recording, which became the most popular version of the song.

Crosby's "White Christmas" single has been credited with selling 50 million copies, the most by any release.
