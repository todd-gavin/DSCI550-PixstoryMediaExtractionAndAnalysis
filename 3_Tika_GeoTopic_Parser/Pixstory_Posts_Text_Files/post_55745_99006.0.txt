Surfing, good weather, kangaroos, and the grill come to mind when you think about Australia. Even though Australians call them prawns, not shrimps, the phrase "throw another shrimp on the barbie" is frequently used. In fact, many Australians despise this statement, claiming it to be yet another cliché. 

As nomadsworld tells us, a traditional Australian barbecue includes sausages, burgers, steak, fresh seafood, bread, and tomato or barbecue sauce; salad is occasionally served, but the meat and fish take centre stage (and of course a few stubbies – that’s beer to the non-Australians). Barbeques may be found almost anyplace in Australia, not just at home. Local governments host public barbeques at popular tourist destinations such as beaches. If you stay at a hostel or meet some locals, you'll almost certainly have at least one BBQ a week!
