I love playing badminton with my friends I love the feeling of getting better and better at the game Badminton requires practice and precision My arms feel heavy after a long session but I love how strong I feel afterwards Badmintion is a sport we can play both indoor and outdoor but me and my friends used to play it outdoor in a Badmintion court sometimes when it is windy or raining we used to go indoor court as well But most important is the time we used to spend together and enjoy ourselves laugh out loud
