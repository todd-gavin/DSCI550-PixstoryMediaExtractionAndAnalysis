We know you're exhausted And an early morning awaits, Yet you still stay up late.
We get it.
Because this quiet uninterrupted time to yourself, Is too precious to pass up, Because all day long you give your time. Your space, Your energy, To those who need you.
Because the mental load of motherhood is a lot to bear
And maybe a little privacy, peace and quiet is just what you need 
Yes sleep is great for your mind, body and soul, But you know what else is?
A little me time 
So if you need to stay up late tonight, To take care of yourself.
Just to feel like human-adult-you
As opposed to mom-wife-you
You do you, MAMA
YOU'VE GOT THIS ‚ù§
