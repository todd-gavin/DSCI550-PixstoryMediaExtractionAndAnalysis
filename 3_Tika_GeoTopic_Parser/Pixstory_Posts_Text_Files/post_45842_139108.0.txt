Recent images from NASA's Juno probe show the intricate patterns and colours of Jupiter's surface. As per NDTV, Stunning swirls of turquoise, milky white, deep ochre, and dark blue could be seen covering the planet's surface in the photograph. 

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration stated in a press statement that the image was taken by the Juno spacecraft on July 5 during its 43rd close flyby of Jupiter. When the photo was shot, the spacecraft was 5,300 kilometres away from the gas giant's cloud tops. 

"Citizen scientist Bjorn Jonsson created these two images using raw data from the JunoCam instrument aboard the spacecraft," NASA said. 

It went on to say that the left-hand image depicted the scene as a person standing in Juno's place would see it. In order to highlight the complex structure of the planet's atmosphere, Mr. Jonsson artificially increased colour saturation and contrast in the image on the right.
