Sitting under sparkling light amidst several people and unwanted chaos of my mind I want to write narrate stories listen to people around me heal those broken hearts but I am unable to I m still and frozen between the battles of my thoughts I m stuck right there watching everyone doing their things laughing over talks playing around and hanging out with their mates Here I am pondering over the mess I can never re solve I try to hold pen I write some words and my hand shivers while my fingers just go lifeless A tint of suffocation runs within me and my heart wants to get rid of that pen and tear the blank sheet of paper lying in front of me It wants to scream I m running after the time that doesn t belong to me I m running after the people who aren t mine I m running after my useless thoughts which are just ruining my life I am blinded and bounded I am bounded by everyone around me I can t hear myself anymore My unvoiced feelings are going to rip my heart someday soon But still I wake up everyday with a new hope Nature inspires me in every way It s just a phase and it s will pass I can t stop trying I will never I will keep working struggling dreaming until I achieve whatever I want to Just a reminder Don t lose hope Hold on You will get there
