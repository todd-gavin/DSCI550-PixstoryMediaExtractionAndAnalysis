The Air Quality Index is based on measurement of particulate matter PM and PM Ozone O Nitrogen Dioxide NO Sulfur Dioxide SO and Carbon Monoxide CO emissions Most of the stations on the map are monitoring both PM and PM data but there are few exceptions where only PM is available All measurements are based on hourly readings For instance an AQI reported at AM means that the measurement was done from AM to AM
