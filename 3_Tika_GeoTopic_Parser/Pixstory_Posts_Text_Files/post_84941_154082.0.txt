The Euro 2024 Qualifying draw took place on Sunday afternoon with all associations across Europe being drawn into different groups to book their spots for the showcase continental tournament. 
There will be a repeat of the 2020 Euro final between champions Italy and runners up England as both teams have been drawn in the same group. Italy would look to have a strong qualifying campaign as defending champions to salvage some pride after their shock exclusion from the forthcoming World Cup in Qatar. Much to Italy’s dismay they will also be facing North Macedonia, the team that knocked them out of the qualifying run for this year’s World Cup. 
After the draw in Frankfurt, Italy coach Roberto Mancini said: “I knew we’d get either England or France, but that’s okay. It’s a decent five-team group, no easy matches, all ones we can have a go at.” Reacting to England's qualifying group, manager Gareth Southgate said: "It's clearly a tough draw, given the quality of the opposition, and we've had draws in qualification that have probably been a little bit more comfortable than that.”
Other groups’ round up
Spain are also expected to have a tough draw with them having to face Scotland and Erling Haaland’s Norway.
France and Netherlands will clash in another big fixture alongside the Republic of Ireland in Group B. France and Ireland have qualifying history after a 2010 game much remembered for Thierry Henry’s last minute handball goal.
Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal are drawn in a group that includes Bosnia and Herzegovina whereas Germany, as automatic qualifiers for their home tournament, will be playing friendly matches on the qualifying matchdays.
Euro 2024 will be played back again in a single country after the multi nation tournament in 2021. It is supposed to take place from the 14th of June to the 14th of July in 10 German cities.
