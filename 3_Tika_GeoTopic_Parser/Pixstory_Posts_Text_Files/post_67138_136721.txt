Nothing in the world it seems Shatters like a broken dream It is the ache behind the mean Of shadows silent and unseen And in this fortress dream of sorrow Exist no dawn and no tomorrow Just hours that cut you as they pass Like little shards of broken glass And yet another and another Sometimes the night is meant to suffer But look up now and see how far They light your way like little stars Oh if I had a star to shine For every broken dream of mine The whole night sky would turn to day And all my troubles melt away
