The United States women's basketball team has a long history of World Cup success. The names alter over time, but the outcomes remain the same. US News reported that Tuesday's 121-59 rout of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the United States broke the team record for consecutive World Cup victories. Kelsey Plum scored 20 points, Chelsea Gray added 16, and the Americans broke their own record. The Americans have won 27 straight games in World Cup competition and haven't lost since the 2006 semifinal loss to Russia. From 1994 through 2006, the U.S. won 26 straight games prior to the contest. From 1959 until 1986, the Soviet Union won the World Cup 56 times in a row, setting a record.“It’s kind of amazing,” said Breanna Stewart, who has been part of the last three World Cup teams. “Obviously, been here for some of it, but you understand the legends before that who really kind of started the streak. It goes to show that no matter who is playing on USA Basketball, we’re always trying to chase excellence."This streak doesn’t mean much right now because we’re going into the quarterfinals and focusing on winning a gold medal, but it’s something to kind of hang your hat on later.”
