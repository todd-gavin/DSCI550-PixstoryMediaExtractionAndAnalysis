British PM Boris Johnson will be fined for violating COVID-19 regulations. This comes after revelations that Johnson held lockdown parties at government offices. Rishi Sunak, Treasury Secretary, will also be fined.

The scandal, dubbed ‘Partygate’, has caused anger among many in Britain and led to politicians and officials – in dozens – investigated over allegations that the British government flouted its own pandemic restrictions, while the rest of the country was placed under strict lockdown to combat the pandemic.

As part of the investigation, police in the UK had sent questionnaires to over 100 people, including PM Johnson. Police also interviewed witnesses during the course of the investigation.

Although Johnson has denied any wrongdoing on his part, it is alleged that he was present at several of the dozen events held at his 10, Downing Street office and at other government buildings. The police are still investigating these allegations.
