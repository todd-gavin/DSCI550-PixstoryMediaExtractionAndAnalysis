Matt Ryan will join the long list of quarterbacks who will change teams in 2022.

According to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, Ian Rapoport, and Mike Garafolo, the longtime Atlanta quarterback is leaving Georgia for Indianapolis after the Colts agreed to trade a third-round pick (No. 82 overall) in April's draft to the Falcons.

Ryan's status inside the Falcons organization had stayed unaltered since he was drafted third overall in 2008. He was drafted to be Atlanta's franchise quarterback, and he delivered, garnering four Pro Bowl selections, a first-team All-Pro selection, and the NFL Most Valuable Player award in 2016, the year he led the Falcons to the Super Bowl. Ryan has remained the same for almost ten years, despite the changing looks.

Ryan takes over for the since-traded Carson Wentz in Indianapolis, where the Colts have been forced to locate backup quarterbacks in each of the last two seasons. Ryan is the latest veteran to join coach Frank Reich in the hopes of helping the Colts win their first Super Bowl since losing to the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV.

Ryan has managed to produce even as playmakers have left Atlanta, passing for at least 4,000 yards in 10 of his previous 11 seasons. In 2021, he had his first season under 4,000 yards since 2010, finishing just 32 yards short of the mark while compiling a 20-12 touchdown-to-interception ratio in an offense that lacked pass-catching threats.
