 If you lost your goal in life you can set up a new goal W two worlds If you can see the future in a dream What will happen then That future that time that fate can it be changed while you were sleeping Love me to the point that you want to destroy the world for me doom at your service If you re a doctor you must not have a boyfriend since you re so busy If you re a soldier you must not have a girlfriend since it s so hard Descendants Of The Sun your body is honest when you re in physical pain you cry but the heart is a liar it stays quiet even if it s hurting it s okay not to be okay Do you know why you are unhappy Because of the gap between what you want and the reality Try to be less greedy weightlifting fairy kim bok joo You are a cosmos floweR and it is still spring wait until fall and you ll bloom beautifully start up You are not the problem the problem is the one who doesn t know how to be loved my roommate is a gumiho the rain isn t a big deal Even if you re the only one without an umbrella it s fine just get wet get wet and run doom at your service Regret is the most painful thing you can experience in life Vincenzo Cassano There are times when lying to a friend is better than telling them the truth I m not a robot Some of you don t know what it is that you really want And some of you do know but you re hesitant But opportunities come without a warning and you must be prepared to take advantage of it true beauty It s okay to be alone from the start You d be used to it But being alone after being with someone isn t something I want to experience again my beloved summer
