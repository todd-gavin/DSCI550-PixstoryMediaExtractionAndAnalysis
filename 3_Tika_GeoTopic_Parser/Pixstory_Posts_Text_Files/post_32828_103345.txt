Ferrari throws up a golden opportunity to win in Monte Carlo by falling into the strategic trap of Red Bull, good at putting Max Verstappen on the podium as well as the winner Sergio Perez, third behind Carlos Sainz. The race started late by over an hour due to a regular downpour with Leclerc Sainz Perez and Verstappen lined up Everything changed when Red Bull anticipated Perez&#39;s stop and Ferrari responded badly and late by making Leclerc stop before Sainz and making Leclerc stop for a second time The result of this omelette was the final podium and the defeat on a track where a one-two could have arrived The angriest of all Charles Leclerc who for the umpteenth time comes out very disappointed in his home race Last year he did not race after damaging his car in qualifying over the years previous times he had retired twice In the world championship Verstappen extends his points by going against Leclerc&#39;s and Perez Sainz remains fifth with points behind Russell too today once again in the top the only driver to have always succeeded this year and with points share in classification
