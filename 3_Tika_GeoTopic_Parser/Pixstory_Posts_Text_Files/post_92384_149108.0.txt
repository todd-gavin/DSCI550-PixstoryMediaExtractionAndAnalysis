Rules were made to be broken. ❤️‍🔥💫
Proving this point to be true, the supermodel broke more than one fashion rule at once with her latest outfit, and we're so glad she did. 🤩On Thursday night, Jenner wore white after Labor Day and stepped out in an LWD for a late-night dinner at Little Sister Lounge in New York. 🗽💗In addition to the dress's stark white color, it's strapless silhouette was more evocative of summer than fall, 🍂as were her controversial heeled flip flops that are certainly an absolute no-no during cooler weather. 
Kendall kept her accessories to a minimum, opting for just a pair of diamond studs that were visible beneath her glossy brown hair, which was styled down and straight with a middle part.👑❤️
