The four horsemen of the apocalypse are four figures found in the book of Revelation, which is a letter written by an early Christian named John, who had been exiled to the Greek island of Patmos. John of Patmos wrote the letter to seven early Christian churches in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey), where he claimed to have been visited by an angel who gave him specific messages for each of the seven churches, followed by a vivid vision of the Last Judgement by God at the end of days. In all versions of the Christian Bible, John of Patmos' book of Revelation, which is sometimes referred to as the "Apocalypse of John, "Â  is the final book of the New Testament. The figures of the Four Horsemen are specifically found in chapter 6, verses 1-8, where they serve as harbingers of the Last judgement. Though theologians and popular culture differ on the name of the first horseman, but the four riders are often seen as symbolizing:
1. Conquest or Pestilence (on a White horse) 
2. War (on a Red horse) 
3. Famine (on a Black horse) 
4. Death (on a Pale horse)
