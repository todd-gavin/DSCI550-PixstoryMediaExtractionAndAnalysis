Matteo Brunori will play in the Palermo shirt again next year, this time in Serie B and as a Rosanero player outright.

Matteo joins Palermo on a permanent deal after his 29 goals in 47 appearances played in all competitions contributed to the Sicilian club's promotion to the second division.

A return to Serie B for Palermo, and for Brunori, who has already played 41 matches and scored three goals in the second tier with Pescara.

Good luck, Matteo!
