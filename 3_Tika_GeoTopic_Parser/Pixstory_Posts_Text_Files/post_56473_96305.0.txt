A third-quarter flurry has helped St Kilda make it five straight wins, in the process heaping plenty more pressure on embattled GWS coach Leon Cameron in Canberra.

The Giants brought the heat early, particularly in a four-goals-to-one second term, but couldn't go with the Saints when they hit their straps and booted four unanswered goals in the third quarter, eventually securing a 10.17 (77) to 8.12 (60) win.

It leaves the Giants reeling at 1-5 and long odds to play finals as out-of-contract coach Cameron looks to save his job.

Beaten in the contest early, the Saints finally got running in the third quarter with a slicing counter-attack allowing Jack Higgins to goal from inside the centre square, while the small forward made it two in two minutes after roving another surge forward.

It was three goals in seven minutes soon after as Higgins slotted another to tie his career-high mark of four goals, before Max King, who'd struggled with goalkicking to that point, finally jagged one to build a 13-point advantage.

With their season potentially on the line, GWS' Harry Himmelberg found the final term's first goal from close range and his team raised their intensity, but missed set shots including one from close range by Matthew Flynn to hurt any chance of a late fightback.

Earlier, the Giants hunted the footy in a manner nothing like they'd done so far this season and won contested possession (+18) and clearances (+8) in a classy first half that saw them wrestle an 11-point advantage by the main break.

A long-bomb goal from Jack Hayes and another from an impossible angle via Jade Gresham helped the Saints kick away early, although a huge roost from Giant Callan Ward kept his side within seven points at quarter-time.

GWS ruck Matt Flynn showed his value up forward with two goals to start the second, but a stunning finish from Saint Brad Crouch kept them within touch as the Giants threatened to breakaway.
