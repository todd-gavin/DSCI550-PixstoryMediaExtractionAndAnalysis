It is an age long dream of literally every Indian football fan to witness their national team playing in the FIFA World Cup at least once in their lifetime. Looking at the current scenario of Indian football, it is highly likely that the dream would be realised anytime soon, especially after FIFA's current ban on AIFF. But did you know that India got the chance to play in the FIFA World Cup many decades ago but did not play? 

Yes, it is indeed true that India qualified for the 1950 World Cup. Back in the days, FIFA World Cup was not as popular as it is today. They did not have a continental qualifiers and they did not even have a ranking system. India was placed with Burma and Philippines in the qualifiers. Fortunately for India, both those countries withdrew and thus India got an automatic qualification. 

However, that is where the complications started to roll in. India had just got independence a few years ago during that time and they had limited funds. Carrying a squad around the globe for a not-so-famous tournament was being seen as a luxury by the board members. Moreover, AIFF was focusing on the 1951 Asian Games and the Olympics and if they had to spend some money, they would prefer to do it in those tournaments. 

The 1950 FIFA World Cup was set to be hosted by Brazil. The Brazil Football Confederation had also offered to pay a major portion of India's expenses for the World Cup as they wanted 'Gandhi and Nehru's nation' to play in their country for more 'representation'. However, AIFF had decided against playing in the tournament by then and thus India did not capitalise on their only opportunity to play in the FIFA World Cup.
