Enter the Dragon Chinese Invasion of Tibet continues Concerning the end of the Khampas this is the sole instance where the Chinese were without any immediate guilt The Dalai Lama encouraged them to give up without foreseeing the consequences which frees him as well But all the others were guilty and as you say the chief responsibility was that of Nixon Kissinger and their government The Khampas were trained by Americans and supported by Taiwan from under the period of Eisenhower and their heroic war against China was an unrivalled epic all the way down to the American betrayal Nothing could defeat the Khampas except betrayal Concerning the Khampas their last fight was their bravest When they were forced to give up in Mustang in northern Nepal by the earnest command of Dalai Lama and Nepalese troops with Chinese troops on the other side part of them decided to give up while those who refused to give up decided to head for Dharamshala some miles away Those who followed Dalai Lama s command and gave themselves up were sent to Nepalese prison dungeons for seven years all their property being confiscated Their three highest officers committed suicide by cutting their own throats when they discovered the treachery they had been promised no retaliations Those who made a run for it almost got to the frontier of India miles away but not quite Chased all the way by the Nepalese and the Chinese they were finally killed to the last man in an ambush miles from the Lipulek La in India towards the end of August Their story is an epic comparable to that of Masada Of those no one survived but they will live forever as the foremost Khampas of all and there are still Khampas everywhere from Ladakh to Kham who might still want to become like them To be continued
