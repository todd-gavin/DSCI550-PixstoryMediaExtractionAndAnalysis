Several ‘White Rabbit’ teases have been airing on WWE shows as of late, with Fightful Select reporting that the reveal is expected for the Premium Live Event on Saturday.
While nothing has been officially stated about Wyatt coming back on WWE TV, all sings point towards him being revealed as the subject of the cryptic teases this weekend.
Speaking of the chatter about Wyatt, a baffling rumour emerged yesterday that claimed that the 35-year-old wasn’t actually released by WWE in July of last year.
As you can see below, the rumour started by Twitter user @NewsXero hinted WWE actually hadn’t released him last year, but instead cut ties with the ‘Bray Wyatt’ character.
This was based on the statement that was released when the former WWE Champion’s departure was announced, which stated that Bray Wyatt had been cut, rather than The Fiend or Windham Rotunda.
Safe to say that wrestling journalists quickly jumped onto the platform to debunk the rumour, with Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful noting that Rotunda, and all of which various characters, were legitimately released by WWE last year.
Sapp explained that the release was 100% legitimate and not part of a storyline, so if Bray does come back this weekend, it will be under a new contract.
