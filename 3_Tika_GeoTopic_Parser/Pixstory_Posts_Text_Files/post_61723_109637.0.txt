In what may come as a shocker to the world, but not to any woman living in America, SCOTUS has just overturned Roe vs Wade. 

The landmark judgement that carried with it, 50 years of precedents was overturned all because the system wanted to appease to the Far right lunatics who still think that abortion is murder. 

This crime committed by the apex court of America will impact millions of women in the country, and if the other countries follow suit f
Of this, it would impact billions of women around the globe. 

Roe vs Wade protected the fundamental right of women over their bodies and enabled them to abort or terminate the pregnancies as per their will. And despite compelling evidences that abortion is not murder, SCOTUS still thought that it was logical to take away safeguards that women have towards their bodies. 

How long will this country stand and watch as the rights of minorities are harmed day after day, week after week. 

This isn't the end, Justice Clarence Thomas, stated that, after Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court needs to revisit the judgements of same sex relationships and same sex marriages. 

This country is beyond repair, and there is literally nothing stopping anyone from killing someone in the streets and getting away with it by claiming it as right to bear arms!!! 

Oh wait, that's already happening all over America
