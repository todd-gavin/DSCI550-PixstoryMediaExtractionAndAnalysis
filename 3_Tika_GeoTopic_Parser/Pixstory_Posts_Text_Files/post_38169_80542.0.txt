What did Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang say after joining Barcelona?

Following his release from Arsenal, the Gabon-based striker Joined Barcelona on a free transfer. Aubameyang also took a pay cut to complete his deal for the Spanish giants. 

At his Barcelona unveiling, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was asked about the whole situation at Arsenal. To this, the former Arsenal captain responded in a negative way towards Mikel Arteta. 

Aubameyang said that only Mikel Arteta had a problem with him. And this eventually led to his exit from the club. The striker also added that he tried to stay calm throughout the situation but was eventually not happy with everything. 


What was Mikel Arteta's response? 


The Arsenal manager has since hit back at the allegations made by his former captain. Mikel Arteta has said that he was the solution rather than the problem at the club.

Mikel Arteta said "What I am saying is that I have been the solution, 100 percent! I can look in the eye of anybody. I do a lot of things wrong, for sure. My intention all the time is the best, not for me, but the club and for the team."

The Spaniard recognised Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's contribution and was thankful for what the striker has done for the club. The Gabon-based striker had scored 92 goals in 163 games for the Gunners before leaving in January. 

Arteta added that what has happened in the past few days was the best for both the club and the player. He concluded by saying that the decision about the contract termination was taken mutually between both the parties. 

Following the departure of Aubameyang, Mikel Arteta has a problem with the attack. The Spaniard is left with only Lacazette and Nketiah as his attacking options. Hence it has to be seen how Arsenal cope in the fight to secure a top-4 spot in the Premier League.
