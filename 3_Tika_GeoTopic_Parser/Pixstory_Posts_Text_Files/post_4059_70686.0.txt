‌Telangana Minister K T Rama Rao invites Elon Musk to the state after Musk's comment that the electric vehicle (EV) company was facing a "lot of challenges" in launching its cars in India.

‌K T Rama Rao responded that "Will be happy to partner Tesla in  working through the challenges to set shop in India/Telangana. Our state is a champion in sustainability initiatives & a top notch business destination in India (sic)."

‌As of now, India charges a 100% tax on the imported cars of price more than $40,000 (Rs 30 lakh) inclusive of insurance and shipping fees, and cars less than $40,000 are subject to 60% import tax. Tesla had reportedly sought 40% import duty on fully assembled electric cars instead of 60%.

‌Some reports suggests that the Indian government was ready to lessen the import duty if Tesla ensured to start manufacturing within India.
