My bond with my father is very different from the usual father-daughter relationship in our society. Of course, being my father, he loves me, provides for me and even supports me, however, we have never been very close. Maybe because I am the first child or maybe because I am the replica of my father, since the start, there has been this constant need to prove myself in front of him and to excel in all his unsaid expectations from me. Well, I do not blame him because I know what he has gone through and that's something that stimulates me to give my best in whatever I do. There's a difference between both of my parents. I am close to my mother, and I share everything with her but when it comes to my father, I resist talking about my feelings and thoughts only because his words have a significant impact on me and anything he says affects me more than anyone else could ever say to me. Now, this is something that bugs me; seeking my father's approval in most of the things that I do and if I failed to do so I feel as if I didn't do great, I could have done better. Albeit, this unsettles me sometimes yet I feel if it wouldn't be for my father, I wouldn't have turned out the way I am today. I consider myself a driven person and in the past years, I have seen myself grow, evolve and do things that I never thought were possible for me to achieve. 
My father might not be the "ideal" father but with the way he has conditioned me and taught me about this world, I believe no father could do that because he has given me a perspective and that alone makes a lot of difference. He has taught me how to stand for myself and made me believe, think and accept. And thus, I respect him for what he is and what he has imbibed in me.
