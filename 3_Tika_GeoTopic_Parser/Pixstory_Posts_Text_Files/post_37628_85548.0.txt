India women’s team thrashed the Pakistani team by 107 runs in their tournament opener of the ICC Women’s World Cup 2022 at the Bay Oval in Mount Manganui on March 6, 2022. This was India’s 11th consecutive win over Pakistan in ODI matches.

The match saw Mithali Raj winning the toss and choosing to bat first. However, the Bismah Maroof-led Pakistani team almost pull off an upset when they reduced the opposition side to 114-6 in the 34th over. This despite a 52 from Smriti Mandhana and 20 odd from Richa Ghosh.

Then Pooja Vastrakar (67) and Sneh Rana (53*) added 122 runs for the seventh wicket for the Indian team, taking them to a defendable total of 244/7 in 50 overs. Nida Dar and Nashra Sandhu picked two wickets each, while the remainder of the bowling unit got one wicket each as well.

Indian seamers kept it tight upfront and spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad (4-31) wrecked the middle order as Pakistan was bundled out for 137 with seven overs remaining in their innings. Only Sidra Ameen (30) and Diana Baig (24) managed to go past the 20-run mark as Indian bowlers troubled the Pakistani batters badly.

Jhulan Goswami (2/26) and Sneh Rana (2/27) were also major contributors as the Indian women’s team opened their Women’s World Cup account with a 107-run win over arch-rivals Pakistan.

However, after the match ICC shared a heartwarming moment when the Indian players were seen posing and playing with Pakistani skipper Bismah Maroof’s baby, six-month-old Fatima. The Indian players not only played with her but also posed for a picture with her as she rested in the arms of her mother.

Maroof, who had earlier became a mother, had planned on retiring from international cricket. However, as fate would have it, she’s leading Pakistan at the World Cup, and it was a great gesture from the Indian players to have a nice playing time with Maroof’s little baby.
