As Roma earned Europa League qualifying with a 3-0 win against Torino, Tammy Abraham
scores twice to set a new scoring record for an English player in a single Serie A season; Betis
hold Real Madrid to a goalless draw in La Liga final; Auxerre advance to French play-off game.

Abraham's first-half double gave him 17 league goals, surpassing Gerry Hitchens' 16 goals for
Inter Milan in 1961-62. On Wednesday, Roma will face Feyenoord in the Europa Conference
League final. With a top-six finish on the line, Jose Mourinho's team couldn't afford to rest.

In what may have been the Italy striker's farewell outing for the club, Andrea Belotti came close
to giving Torino the lead. Torino were punished after 33 minutes as Abraham turned past
Tommaso Pobega to score comfortably from eight yards after Belotti shot wide.

Three minutes before halftime, Abraham broke Hitchens' record by converting from the penalty
spot after Etrit Berisha had pulled him down. After Alessandro Buongiorno wrestled Nicolo
Zaniolo to the ground, Lorenzo Pellegrini scored a second Roma penalty 12 minutes from time.

After Roma's triumph, Fiorentina and Atalanta will fight for seventh place for Conference League
qualification in Italy's final weekend.

Auxerre won a penalty shootout against Sochaux to advance to the Ligue 1
relegation/promotion play-off game. Auxerre won the shoot-out 5-4 after neither team could
score in 120 minutes of play.

Auxerre will now play the team that finishes 18th in Ligue 1 in a two-legged tie to determine who
will play top-flight football next season, which is expected to be either Metz or St Etienne.
