The community policing activities in the region were further continued along with regular intensive operations by my worthy successor SP as well after I was transferred from the district in February, 2011, which led to continued and further alienation of the Maoists from the community. The change set in since the inception of the Sone Mahotsava in 2008, was now ready for affirmation. Around the Middle of 2011, the circumstances on the Hills were changed enough with the emboldened tribals almost ready for an open revolt as they got organised and were ready to take on the Maoists who had disturbed the peace of the region. Seeing the Maoists as a source of the conflict that hampered growth of their region which had an illustrious history, some of the tribals took it upon themselves and killed the main Zonal Commander named Birendra Yadav  Rana in cold blood along with an accomplice. With this incident, the Hills had changed forever for the Maoists. What earlier had been a stronghold and a source of permanent shelter was no longer so. The tribals had become friendly with the police and supplied information about every movement of the rebels. 

The circumstances had changed totally. The Maoists initially responded by killing family members of some prominent tribals who had led the Revolt. There were some phases of major disturbance on the hills which led to a migration of the tribal population downhill for some time, but the transition with continued police effort gradually led to peace in the region. The Maoists gradually realised that it was not possible for them to survive on the hills in wake of the public and tribal hostility. Many of them surrendered before the Police creating an atmosphere of lasting peace in the region.
