Aromatherapy works in two ways; one is through the sense of smell, while the other is skin absorption. 

The products used for the therapy could be a diffuser, aromatic spritzers, inhalers, bathing salts, body oils, creams, or lotions for massage or topical application, facial steamers, hot and cold compresses, or clay masks.

These products can be used in combination or alone; numerous essential oils can be used in therapy.

Essential oils are available online, in health food stores, and in some supermarkets. It’s necessary to buy from a reputable producer since the FDA doesn’t regulate the oils. This ensures you’re buying a quality product that is 100 per cent natural. It shouldn’t contain any additives or synthetic ingredients. Check out these essential oils available on Amazon.

Each essential oil has unique healing properties, uses, and effects. Combining essential oils to create a synergistic blend creates even more benefits.
