It is an absolutely incredible experience Every state is like its own unique nation You would find the most incredible backwaters and greenery in Kerala the most beautiful snow in Ladakh and an incredibly magnificent architecture and palaces in Rajasthan I ve traveled many countries and India surely is in one of my best experiences Now it s not the same as traveling Europe but then again India is not a developed nation It is still in its journey of advancement but this experience would be one of a kind People are hospitable and don t worry too much about being stared at You re a foreigner they might only be fascinated I realized people there are willing to help you at any time Of course you need to take some basic precautions just like any other place Now coming back to the beauty of this country India has all forms of landscapes Green wet hills the white snow of the Himalayas hot desert oceans and beaches lakes and caves nature and and man made architecture you name it So surely it s not something you can cover on a weekend trip The cuisine is just as vast as the country Something I learnt through my trip is the Indian food we eat here in the states is nothing compared to what you get in India Another fascinating thing about the country where civilization started you can t learn a few words from a language and use it everywhere Every few miles you ll have a new language I will be sure to come up with a story listing the places you could visit here even though I m not sure I will ever be able to write down everything
