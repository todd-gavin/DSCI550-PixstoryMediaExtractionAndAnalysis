I want to laugh in the faces of all those who think gun control will stop criminals from owning a gun or hurting someone. Neither will they prevent a criminal from owning a gun nor give them a clean conscience. They can always find other ways to commit that crime. They don't give a damn about legal or illegal. 🤷🏻‍♂️
