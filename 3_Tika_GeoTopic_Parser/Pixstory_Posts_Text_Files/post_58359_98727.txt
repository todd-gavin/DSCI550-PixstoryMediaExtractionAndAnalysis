In the parent story the aspect of physical pain is covered in a conpact way I would like to explain a little about mental issues a girl or a women face during menstruation These includes Mood swings Headache PMS Pre menstrual syndrome But why these problems occur Due to hormonal change Hormonal change in this period of time are actually pretty high Increasing the chances of mood swings Irritating is also at its peak which make it difficult to deal with anyone There s one thing more there s low level of estrogen which leads to low level of Serotonin the happy hormone which brings the sorrow And talking about cramps they are not of same level for everyone it can be less painful to some that doesn t signify it s same for other and generalising the same level for everyone Thank you for reading Pic credit Menstrual cycle and your health
