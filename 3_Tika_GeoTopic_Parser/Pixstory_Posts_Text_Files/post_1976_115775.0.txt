Secure leaders recognize the importance of surrounding oneself with the best. They should have enough confidence in their own abilities to acknowledge and accept that they cannot achieve everything on their own, but that their ability to lead effectively will produce the desired result.


Insecure leaders are easily intimidated by their subordinates. This is due to the fact that insecure leaders are threatened by the power that their subordinates hold over their work. Because insecure leaders feel that they lack control, they are in a constant struggle to regain power. They micromanage to feel as if they are in control when in reality they were always in control.

When an insecure leader attempts to manage everything, it creates internal tensions. This is due to the subordinates perception that they cannot perform anything well, which fosters an atmosphere of fear and intimidation.

When a secure leader places his trust in trustworthy individuals, he need not be concerned with whether his subordinates will achieve the desired outcome because he has already secured that outcome from the outset.
