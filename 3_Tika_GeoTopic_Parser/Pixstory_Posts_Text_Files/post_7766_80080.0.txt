Alan Ritchson has just done what many didn't think he'd do, he has made the Jack Reacher role his own now. The fans of the novel series always said the Tom Cruise was not tall or physically the right size to play the role. Jack Reacher in the novels is 6 foot 5 inches tall, even the author has said that Ritchson is a better fit for thr role. Tom Cruise's two movies were really entertaining but the Reacher series has allowed the character to be established with more ease. 
Reacher is a loner and in these eight episodes we see him try to solve a multilayered conspiracies thst are taking place in Georgia. We get to see how along with having great physical strength, Reacher has an equally strong mind, he deduces things quickly and has amazing intuition. The storytelling evolves into a thriller quite quickly and it keeps on getting more intense. The action choreography is really well done, Reacher isn't just a brawler because of his size but he has a certain finesse to him, that gives a upper edge in every fight.
The Reacher Universe is pretty vast in this series, Willa Fitzgerald player the role of Rosce, a cop and she bevomes the love interest of Jack, she plays the role very well. One thing we do know that after this amazing first season another is definitely on its way as Amazon has renewed the Reacher series. This series is definitely a must watch for the action genre lovers.
