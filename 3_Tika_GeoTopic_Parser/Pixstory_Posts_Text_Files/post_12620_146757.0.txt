Emotions and breathing are closely connected. If you slow your breath and learn to breathe evenly and fully, your emotions will calm down as well.
Breathing practices have been shown to reduce cortisol, the stress hormone. They also activate the "rest and digest" part of the nervous system, known as the parasympathetic nervous system. 
Here are steps you can take
👉Find a comfortable place to sit.
👉Put one hand on your belly and one on your chest.
👉Breathe in deeply from your belly, so that your stomach extends out but your chest stays in place.
👉Hold this breath for a couple seconds and then breathe out.
👉Repeat this sequence until you find a steady rhythm. Try to do this practice for 10 minutes every day.
