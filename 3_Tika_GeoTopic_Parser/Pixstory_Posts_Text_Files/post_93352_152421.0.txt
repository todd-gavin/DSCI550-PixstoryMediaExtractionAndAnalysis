Currently the country of Iran is facing one of the worst turmoil ever witnessed by it after a  22-year-old Iranian woman, Mahsa Amini, was killed brutally on the grounds of violating Iran's conservative laws.
Despite the repression and violence of the securitmid protests, y forces, the protests could not be suppressed.
Many LGBTQ+ people are those among Iran's protesters.
Although this community never showed up in public until now, the members have now gathered and took active participation in protests. Many demonstrators have been seen holding rainbow flags and placards and showing the people of Iran and the world that they are also a large part of the oppressed and marginalized Iranian society.
In early September, a shocking tragedy was reported that 31-year-old Z Sedighi-Hamedani and 24-year-old Elham Chubdar, LGBTQ activists , were sentenced to death for “human trafficking” and “corruption on earth” and currently on death row. However there has been no evidence to support the claim. It is believed that their persecution stems from their LGBTQ+ activism and identities.
