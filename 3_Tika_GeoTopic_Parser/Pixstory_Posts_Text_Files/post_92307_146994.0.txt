Finding in my dreams, ofcourse not in my reality.
The peace i want is somehow far from my mentality.
My own struggles to find it everywhere.
Now surrounded by glum and ashamed to find it nowhere
You posed to be same for every mass.
However breaked for the unique mass.
They want you to act discrete for them.
However they make efforts to find you for them.
All i need is you to be well built enough.
But for me all time you behaved as snuff.
Peace is something people are lacking.
You need to dress up so that they start following.
