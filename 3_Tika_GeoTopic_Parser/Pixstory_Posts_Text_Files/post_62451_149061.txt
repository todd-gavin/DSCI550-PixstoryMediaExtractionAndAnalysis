First and foremost be aware that a stray cat is generally acting in self defense They may be scared or aggrieved and so may lash out in an attempt to defend themselves So if you see a stray cat attacking someone or something don t get involved Just stay away from it and call the authorities if necessary If you do get attacked by a stray cat your best bet is to fight back as hard as you can This doesn t mean hit or punch the animal simply use whatever force is necessary to scare it off If all else fails try spraying it with water or throwing objects at it in order to deter it from coming near you again If you ve been bitten by one the first thing that you need to do is get to a hospital as quickly as possible Usually these attacks do not leave big injuries but you may need stitches Not to mention strays are wild animals and can carry various diseases which is why it s so important to get them medical attention as soon as possible Once you reach the hospital you ll likely be in pain and might even have difficulty breathing due to the attack panic and the wearing off adrenaline so it d be good that someone stays with you until the doctor arrives If there are any other injuries sustained in the attack like scratches or cuts then those will need to be treated as well After being treated at the hospital it s important to make sure that your wound heals properly This means keeping it clean and protected from infection You should also avoid stressful situations and refrain from going outside until the wound has healed completely Cats are not offensive they will hide from you if they can They usually only attack in self defense so try not to trigger one
