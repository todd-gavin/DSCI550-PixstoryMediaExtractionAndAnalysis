Constitutional Adviser to Bikaner continues........

Different units or provinces could be administered by Governors with the help of advisory bodies, The advantages of such a constitution would be that it would keep the whole country united and free from linguistic fanaticism and it would prevent provincial and parochial thinking. The services would then become allIndia and public servants from one part of India could be transferred to the other part. I happened to meet Sir B. N. Rao in Simla after I left Bikaner and he was annoyed at my calling his draft a slavish copy of the Act of 1935. He declared that there was no harm in copying out those parts of the Government of India Act 1935 that were acceptable to the Constituent Assembly. 

In a friendly way he suggested, that instead of rushing to print and giving publicity to my views, I could have written to him privately about this matter and made my suggestions to him. Flaming of a Constitution on the lines I was thinking of was not, in the view of Sir B. N. Rao, a practical proposition. For over 100 years Indian lawyers and Indian jurists had studied the constitutions of western countries and they had been brought up in the ideas underlying those constitutions. 

The Government of India Act 1935 had been in force and had been worked for over 15 years. It was difficult to get away from this historical background and to evolve a completely original Constitution on a model designed according to ancient forms of government or on a model of ancient pre-historic republics that at one time existed in India, My feeling, however, was that our Constitution should be fairly homespun without a skein of British yarn or 
dye. It should be as shudh as khadi is .
