As per The Mirror, Liverpool have reportedly made contact with Salzburg's forward Karim Adeyemi. The Reds are looking to add the player to their ranks in the summer transfer window. 

Karim Adeyemi has emerged as an exciting prospect in the last year at RB Salzburg. The 20-year-old has scored 16 goals and provided 3 assists in the Austrian Bundesliga this season. Overall, the forward has 33 goals in 80 appearances for Salzburg.

Having joined the club in January 2020, Adeyemi has already helped his side win two Austrian Bundesliga titles. Salzburg are once again leading the race and are the favourites to secure the 2021/22 league title as well.

Apart from being a goalscorer, Karim Adeyemi is versatile. The 20-year-old German can play as a striker, right-winger, and as a centre forward. Hence his addition could be crucial to Liverpool's ranks. 

Borussia Dortmund have also shown their interest in the Salzburg striker. The Bundesliga club is set to lose out on Erling Haaland in the summer. Hence they are looking to bolster their forward like with Adeyemi in the summer. 

Salzburg have reportedly set a price tag of £35 million on Karim Adeyemi. Hence it has to be seen if Liverpool can secure the services of what many are considering Mohamed Salah's potential successor in the long run. 




Do the Reds need Karim Adeyemi? 

Liverpool are set to lose out on Divock Origi in the summer as per reports. To add to this, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Roberto Firmino have their contracts ending in June 2023. 

Owing to this, Karim Adeyemi would be a considerable option in the long run. Hence it has to be seen if the Reds can complete the signing of the Salzburg forward in the summer transfer window.
