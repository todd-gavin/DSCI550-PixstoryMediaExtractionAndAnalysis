For me it is being grateful having gratitude in life Grateful is being appreciative of things of people and everything that we have in the present moment and not having any resentment for the things that we don t have Sometimes we undermine and unappreciated a lot of things which are so valuable for us that instead of enjoying the things in life we start taking stress for immaterial things and forget the beauty of the surroundings For example these days people are so much engrossed with social media that sharing the pictures of food they are eating on social media has become a routine and in order to do so they have forgotten to enjoy the food its aroma its colourful ingredients and the savoury mouth watering taste This has really affected the mental health as people are becoming more and more socially deprived and ungrateful for the things they have What to do Reading books is a good suggestion The Ultimate Gift Jim Stovall is a wonderful book which teaches you to find joys in everything
