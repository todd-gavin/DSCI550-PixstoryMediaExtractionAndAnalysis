Slight bewilderment and sighing have become a constant expression of women in the US.
Amidst the ongoing chaos of protecting their reproductive rights and the never-ending debates on lingering disparities in the professional world they have to face, it would not harm if women do a thing to protect themselves in a relationship.

Most divorced women say that they entered their marriage assuming their partner would have their back. For this very reason, they decided to sacrifice their financial career to take care of the family. The "financial protection" from their partners is just a term of aberration for these women who don't think of a contract to be signed before or after the marriage.
They are incognizant of the consequences that would fall upon them after splitting up with their husbands.

Financial dependency takes it hard on women, and if there is nothing to protect it later, it could not be reversed.
In these cases, a legal contract could come to the rescue to ensure financial protection for all those women who renounced their careers just to build a family.

Divorce comes with many emotional upheavals, but an agreement could alleviate some of the pain one has to deal with.
Hence a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement could only be a fair deal in a marriage, giving an equal share to the respective partners and ensuring financial security for women left alone.
