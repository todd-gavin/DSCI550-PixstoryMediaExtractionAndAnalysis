From the Airbus’ managing director of South Asian region, Rémi Maillard, to Gurgaon based Everester Ankur Bahl to over 70 triathletes swam in Chandigarh’s iconic Sukhna Lake on Sunday.   

It’s for the first time that the man-made lake witnessed the swimming leg of a standard distance triathlon event – Tuffman Tri 113km Chandigarh.

The 1.9km swimming circuit in the lake was followed by 90km of cycling on the Kurali-Chandigarh road and 21.1km of running in the vicinity of Oberoi Sukhvilas, making it a 113km triathlon event.

“It was a great experience swimming in the Sukhana Lake. Tuffman was my second triathlon event. I did the first one in France – it was a half Ironman, but the exposure that I got while swimming in open water in Chandigarh is better than swimming in a lake in France,” says Nikita Seth, who got the first position in the 113km triathlon in the women’s section.    

Over 80 triathletes registered in the three categories of triathlon. Apart from the 113km event, there was an Olympic triathlon – 1.5km of swimming, 40km of cycling and 10kms of running – and sprint triathlon – 0.75km swimming, 20km cycling and 5km of running.

Apart from that there were 45 participants in the duathlon – a combination of cycling and running.

Maillard, who was the only foreign triathlete, finished the top honours in the Olympic triathlon event.   

“It’s a good exposure swimming in the open water here. The benefit was that once you were in, it kept you going. But visibility was an issue, because of the sunlight falling on you, you couldn’t see at a long distance and that was creating an obstacle in swimming,” said Yezdi Dapotawala, 50, from Surat. “I was able to complete my swimming and cycling parts, but I couldn’t complete running. So, it was a DNF (didn’t finish) for me. I trained hard for this event and I was in a good shape, but somehow it was not my day. I am happy that I got a wonderful exposure at the event.”
