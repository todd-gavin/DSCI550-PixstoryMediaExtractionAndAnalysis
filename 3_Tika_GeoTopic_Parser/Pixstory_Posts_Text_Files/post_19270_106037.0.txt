The most exciting part of football post the season end is upon us. The transfer window and as we are about to enter it, there are many a deals which have been completed.
We are here to talk about two football giants in Barcelona and Manchester United who are trying to find a deal for Dutchman Frenkie de Jong. Joined the Spanish club in the summer of 2019, de Jong had set his dream on a move to FC Barcelona but things aren't the way they were back in 2019 for the club. Barcelona are in a huge financial debt and for which they have to let go players of high calibre to register new signings or to even make move for their targets. The player though has put forward his disappointment and seems doesn't want to leave the club but as things progress a solution would be found is the prediction.
Manchester United on the other hand, with Erik ten Hag as the new man incharge who wants de Jong to be the centre of his team, the main man who worked together during the Ajax days is doing everything to convince him and to push forward a deal to bring Frenkie at Old Trafford.
Been financially troubled the Spanish club demands in excess of â‚¬60m and reports are they both have found an agreement over the fee, only for the player to be convinced which again is believed that he might be on the move since FdJ is Barcelona's talisman and who can fetch them enough cash as they progress into the market.
Just the beginning, but it would be a statement signing wrt the English club who are trying to get out of the phase they are stuck in and bring glory back to the club with it's new boss.
