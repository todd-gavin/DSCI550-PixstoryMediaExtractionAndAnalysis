The Los Angeles Lakers were unable to make any trades during the NBA trade deadline and instead had to turn to the buyout market to make any additions that could potentially raise the floor of the team One of the team s reported buyout targets was Goran Dragic who was traded to the San Antonio Spurs at the deadline before being subsequently bought out We thought Dragic signing with the Lakers was unlikely and that ended up being true as Dragic signed with the team who pulled off a massive trade at the deadline the Brooklyn Nets The Nets traded James Harden and Paul Milsap for Ben Simmons Seth Curry and draft picks and while that seemingly improves the team s depth there was still more work to be done Dragic really helps shore up the backcourt depth in Brooklyn and will help keep the team afloat while its stars sit out This is not the first time that the Nets came away with someone who could have fit on the Los Angeles Lakers The biggest buyout player on the market last season was Blake Griffin who was bought out by the Detroit Pistons Griffin ultimately signed with the Nets and played pretty well in Brooklyn last season While he has not been as good this year if he would have produced at the same level in LA then who knows perhaps they overcome the Anthony Davis injury and don t blow a lead against the Phoenix Suns LaMarcus Aldridge was another veteran big man who was bought out last season and could have added nice depth to the Lakers Despite also signing Griffin the Nets landed Aldridge as well to keep him away from LA Aldridge had to retire before the playoffs began but was able to get medical clearance to return this season He would have made a lot more sense than DeAndre Jordan who the Lakers signed after the Nets bought him out but he decided to return to the Nets At this point the Lakers better hope that the Houston Rockets actually buy out Dennis Schroder and that the team can reunite with him
