AFC Bournemouth enjoyed a brilliant campaign last season in the Championship last season and finished second which earnt them direct promotion to the Premier League alongside Fulham They have undergone a steady start to life in the Premier League so far and currently sit in th position in the league Scott Parker was relieved of his duties after theside suffered a thrashing to Liverpool but the sacking did come as a surprise as Bournemouth were doing okay up until that result Gary O Neil is currently interim boss and rumours suggest he may be given the role until the end of the season as the side have produced positive results under him We will look at the SWOT of this Bournemouth squad Strengths Bournemouth s attacking impotence seems to be their biggest strength as their defence is not solid They enjoyed a thrilling win against Nottingham Forest away from home and won That was a perfect example to gauge the qualities of the squad as they were playing aside that possesses similar qualities to them in Forest Fans will be encouraged to see the side have the potential to score goals and they can cause problems for other sides on the counter The likes of Dominic Solanke will benefit from this the most as he is the side s front man Weaknesses The biggest weakness in this side is the vulnerable defence Conceding goals away from home is unacceptable and that result led to the sacking of their manager therefore they must also take responsibility for Parker s sacking This is an area which O Neil will no doubt have to look and attempt to sure it up as if Bournemouth can begin to defend with more solidity and produce clean sheets then their chances of avoiding relegation and staying up increase significantly
