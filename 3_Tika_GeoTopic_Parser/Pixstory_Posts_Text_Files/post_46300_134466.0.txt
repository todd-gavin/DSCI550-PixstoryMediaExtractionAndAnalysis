Grabbing a fruit for healthy evening snacking ?? Great choice there ! 👍
I like to think about what spices and flavors might pair well with  fruit . Oftentimes , the best pairings can be a bit unexpected , that's what makes me excited ! And when I'm experimenting in the kitchen , I love to try and find these unique flavor pairings . 😋✨
So what's even better than a snack comprised of fruits with nuts and butter ? Answer : a snack comprised of fruits AND nuts , of course ! 🍎😍
Let me tell you my favourite pairs ; 
1 Apple & almond - Rich in fibre . We all know that saying 'An apple a day', but there really are just so many reasons to love apples ! Good for bones and lungs , packed full of fibre , low in calories - and just plain delicious . But did you know that just like apples , almonds are also rich in fibre ? They're also good for  body , nice and filling ! Best combination ! 
2 Banana & walnut -  Bananas are always a winner for every occasion ! High in potassium , banana is great for your organs and cells . They are good when you're low on energy and feeling run down ! For the same reason , i also eat walnuts - because they are packed with vitamins . So the cherry on top is that this delicious nut is also good for your skin as well . Perfect combination ! 
This is my way to combine fruits with nuts ,  and sometimes butter ( Good fats or protein ) . This will result in increased energy density and keep you full for longer ! 👍✅
