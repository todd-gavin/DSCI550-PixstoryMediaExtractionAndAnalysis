During the second half of the th century the United States and the Soviet Union prepared for and anticipated a major war with one another That major war never happened Instead the two superpowers faced off in a decades long Cold War of espionage intimidation and conflict over and within proxy states During most of the th and the early th century a similar state of affairs existed between the British and Russian Empires a tense superpower confrontation over the control of Central and South Asia the Great Game a term popularized by the novelist Rudyard Kipling in British leadership found the Russian conquest and annexation of Central Asia during the th century alarming The Russians rolled relentless across the central Asian steppes defeating and absorbing the people there adding to their empire a vast area that is now Kazakhstan Uzbekistan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan and Turkmenistan In the th century India was the crown jewel of the British Empire its most prosperous and strategically valuable colony Convinced that Russian expansion would eventually lead to an invasion of India Great Britain acted aggressively to block and deter it principally by working to keep the Ottoman and Persian empires out of the Russian orbit and by attempting to create buffer states in Afghanistan and Tibet Likewise while the British feared and protected against Russian expansion into India the Russians likewise worried that the British would invade and expand into Central Asia using their formidable British Indian army The competition over Afghanistan would result in two costly and bloody Anglo Afghan wars and the fear of Russian expansion into Tibet would result in a British Indian invasion of the region in Modern historians have concluded that Russia never had the intention or ability to invade India and that the British never had the capacity or intention to invade central Asia The Great Game ended with the Anglo Russian Convention of the British and the Russians agreeing to recognize the borders and their respective spheres of influence across central and south Asia enabling them to end their rivalry and turn their attentions to the growing threat from the increasingly powerful and expanding German Empire
