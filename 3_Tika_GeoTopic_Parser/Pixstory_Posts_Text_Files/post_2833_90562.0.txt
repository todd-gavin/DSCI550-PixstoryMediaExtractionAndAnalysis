“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” President Biden said in Warsaw, referring to Putin. Strong words? Yes. Tough stance? Yes. Many may even find it tame. But can one head of state say anything like that about the head of another state? It goes against a basic principle of diplomacy that calls for respecting the sovereignty of another state. It can mean the US is threatening to regime change in Russia. That’s why the White House was busy walking back those nine words. Fellow western leaders like Macron have also admitted it was crossing the line.

For those opposed to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin is understandably a villainous figure. But Biden is making it personal, which is unusual. He earlier called him a “war criminal” too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvyrn6x6Kas

Biden was right in framing the western response as “battle between democracy and autocracy.” But the very last remark before the formal signing off was not in the script, according to officials, and Biden ad-libbed them:

The White House immediately offered a (far-fetched) interpretation to overcome the diplomatic faux pas. It said Biden’s point was only that “Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region” and he was specifically “not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change”: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-says-putin-cannot-remain-power-white-house-says-otherwise-rcna21702

French President Emmanuel Macron too said that he wouldn’t “use this kind of words.” He said the situation must not be escalated “neither with words nor with actions”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHxN9u3JWI8

But, on the other hand, should diplomatic “niceties” be the top priority when children’s hospitals are being bombed? 

Saying that Putin “cannot remain in power” would imply judging over or interfering with Russians’ right to decide who should be in power in Russia, till when. But this nicety is rarely respected in practice. The US itself has interfered in a large number of countries over the decades – though Russia is in a different league. More importantly, Russia too stands accused of interfering in the US’s sovereign matters, with the allegations of its role in the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/us/politics/election-interference-russia-2020-assessment.html
