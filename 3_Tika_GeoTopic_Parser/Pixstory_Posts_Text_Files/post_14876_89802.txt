In COVID patients, one of the main causes of mortality is the high risk of thrombosis which can occur both in the venous district in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and in the arterial district in the form of myocardial infarction or stroke. The research group coordinated by Francesco Violi of the Department of Internal Medicine and medical specialties of the Sapienza University of Rome in collaboration with Lorenzo Loffredo Pasquale Pignatelli and Annarita Vestri of the same University has carried out two studies in which the patients with the greatest risk of thrombosis are identified and which are the ideal doses of therapy anticoagulant for the prevention of thrombotic events One of the two papers published in the journal Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the other in Haematologica The first paper consisted of a multicentre study which made it possible to identify patients with the greatest risk of thrombosis It was seen that those who had a combination of high age plus years low albumin ng ml had a higher probability of thrombosis than patients of younger age and with normal values of albumin and D dimer The second work published in Haematologica official journal of the European Society of Hematology responds to a issue still debated two years after the start of the pandemic, i.e. whether the prevention of these thrombotic events should be done with standard anticoagulant therapy or with prophylactic doses, i.e. low doses of anticoagulants This aspect is relevant since the low doses of anticoagulant which are still the current more used may be insufficient to reduce the risk of thrombosis The team of researchers carried out a meta-analysis of studies that compared the two types of treatment demonstrating that standard doses of anticoagulants are superior to prophylactic doses in reducing thrombotic events without increasing the risk of serious bleeding The meta-analysis that included about COVID patients concludes Violi demonstrates how this therapy would represent a useful support not only to reduce thrombotic events but also to reduce mortality which unfortunately still remains high among these subjects
