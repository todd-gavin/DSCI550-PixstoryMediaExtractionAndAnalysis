Sometimes I finish with my college before time and don't wanna go home too early.☹️
This is the Dayal Singh public library, where I usually go to make advantage of my downtime⏳
It is a public library. This is not very far from my home, so I feel comfortable and don't worry about having to go far to get home.🏠
I don't have a membership to this library, but the good news is that you don't have to because there are two reading areas here. The first is a readers area where people with memberships can come and borrow and read books from the library, and the second is a study area for people like me who don't.🤭😂
I typically came here with my own study materials; I worked on my projects and diagrams here; I learned and took notes; I read my books;📚 and occasionally, I just came and dozed off.😛
Since this is a public library, a lot of people come here, including students pursuing a variety of degrees and some aspirants.👩‍🎓👨‍🎓📖 Everyone is occupied here, working quietly and diligently without obstructing or distracting anyone else.🤫🤫
Overall, it's a very lovely and comfortable spot to spend my spare time.🕊️😌✨
If you also have a place like this where you like to spend your free time, please let me know in the notes.🤗❣️
