When new owners took over PSG, they were determined to turn the club into a football powerhouse. The primary way to achieve that was by signing big names. Their wish has more or less come true with star players like Messi, Mbappe, Sergio Ramos donning the Paris jersey. But the one that started this juggernaut of signings was that of Brazilian forward, Neymar Jr in 2017.
Neymar joined the French champions from FC Barcelona in the summer of 2017. He was at the Catalan club for 4 years having moved from his boyhood club, Santos in 2013. He quickly became a fan favourite at Barca but his brilliance was overshadowed by Messi's presence. The then-26 year-old decided to leave and sign for PSG for a world record transfer fee of £222 million.
Neymar's initial contract ran till 2021, after which he signed a contract extension that will keep him at the club till 2026. A 5 year deal sees Neymar earn £37.47 million per year. His annual wage also includes add ons and other bonuses. Although the 30-year-old will receive a sizeable bonus if he is able to win the Champions League for PSG.
Neymar's salary in comparison
When compared to other great players of his generation, Neymar is definitely earning a lot. He is the highest earner for PSG and is way ahead of their No.7, Kylian Mbappe. His salary cap can only be matched by Lionel Messi in the near future if the Argentine chooses to have a contract extension in 2023.
The £700,000 per week salary dwarfs the weekly wage he last received at Barca. Although it is noteworthy that the Brazilian is yet to transform his hefty sum into fruitful results as PSG bosses are desperate for continental glory. They came within a whisker of the trophy as they reached the Final of the 2020 edition, but lost to Bayern Munich by a solitary goal.
