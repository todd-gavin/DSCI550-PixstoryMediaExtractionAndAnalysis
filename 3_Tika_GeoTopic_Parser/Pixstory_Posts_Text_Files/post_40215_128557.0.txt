In order to get it ready for its first launch, the American space agency Nasa has rolled out its enormous new Moon rocket. 

BBC reported that the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which is scheduled to launch on August 29th, was shifted to Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 
Future missions will send astronauts back to the lunar surface for the first time in more than 50 years. The initial launch is a test with no crew aboard. 

The over 100m (328ft) tall SLS was transported to the pad by a massive tractor.

It started moving from its assembly building at Kennedy just before 22:00 on Tuesday, local time, and had completed the 6.7km (4.2 miles) journey by just after sunrise on Wednesday morning.

This is a crucial time for NASA, which will commemorate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 17, the very last mission to land a person on the moon, in December. 

The organisation has promised to come back with its new Artemis programme and current technology (Artemis was the Greek moon goddess and twin sister of Apollo).
