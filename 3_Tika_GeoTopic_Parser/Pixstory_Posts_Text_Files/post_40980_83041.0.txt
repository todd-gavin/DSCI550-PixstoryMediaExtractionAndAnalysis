According to Wall Street Journal reporter Erich Schwartzel, today's Hollywood blockbusters are explicitly constructed to appeal to Chinese moviegoers â€” and pass muster with the Chinese government. 

He cites the following examples of product placement: Mark Wahlberg's character in the 2014 film Transformers: Age of Extinction withdraws money from a China Construction Bank ATM while in Texas. A character buys Chinese protein powder at a Chicago convenience store in another scene from the same film. 

NPR reports Age of Extinction became the highest-grossing picture in China just ten days after its debut. Although the film has since been overshadowed at the box office by a slew of new blockbusters, Schwartzel believes its legacy lives on.

You'll start to notice it everywhere, adds Schwartzel, who has trained his eye to find Chinese aspects in films. Now when I go to the movies, I can see the Chinese cellphone, even though it's blurry in the frame.

Schwartzel discusses China's growing impact on Hollywood in his latest book, Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy. He claims that China has observed how Hollywood films have helped sell America to the rest of the world, and that it now wants to do the same.
