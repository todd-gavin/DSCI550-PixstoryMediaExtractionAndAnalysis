In the second gameweek of the English Premier League, Liverpool are all set to host Crystal
Palace in the final game of the GW2 at Anfield. Liverpool salvaged a point in their previous
game whereas Crystal Palace went down fighting against Arsenal.

In their previous game, Liverpool were a goal down twice but were able to make up against
Fulham. Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah were able to find the back of the net for the team
when it was needed. The team will look to strike a comeback in their backyard.

On the other hand, at Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace were not able to win the game against
Arsenal despite fighting tooth and nail. Gabriel Martinelli scored the goal in the 20th minute
whereas Marc Guehiâ€™s own goal compounded the misery. Patrick Viera will look to salvage a
point at Anfield.
