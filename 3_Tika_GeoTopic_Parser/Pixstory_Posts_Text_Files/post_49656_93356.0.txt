Trump: "far-left gender theories" is "truly child abuse." Rejects transsexual athletes! 
‌
‌Trump made a contrary statement that he will end the woke war on women and children by his republican led congress while disregarding gender theories. 
‌
‌He fully supported parental control on gender studies at schools. He said far-left gender studies are child abuse.
‌
‌He also raged on the Budget proposal Biden l announced that includes $10 million to go towards improving transgender visibility in Census Bureau surveys. 
‌
‌Trump said: "Last week, the Biden administration sent Congress a budget crammed with billions and billions of dollars of transgenderism and so-called equity provisions that are nothing more than government-sponsored racism. The Republican Congress will end the woke war on women and children, we will stop illegal government discrimination, we will restore the sacred American principle of equality under the law."
‌
‌Moreover, he made this statement disregarding transexual people: "We will not, by the way, have men participating in women's sports," Trump said, saying that allowing trans athletes like the record-breaking University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas to compete would ruin women's sports. He disrespects the sexuality of an individual and a whole community through his statements. These statements from a former president and a republican should be enough for the people to analyse what kind of America they wish to make. Making this clear transexual woman are women! 
‌
‌This intolerance towards the LGBTQ community should not be encouraged. America makes a wise decision.
