Chelsea have terminated Marcos Alonso’s contract by mutual consent, ending his six-year spell at the club during which he gave a lot of moments to cherish for the fans.
Confirming the termination, the English club released an official statement which read:
“Marcos Alonso has left Chelsea by mutual consent, ending a six-year association with the club in which he lifted plenty of trophies and supplied Blues fans with many memorable goals. Everyone at Chelsea Football Club would like to thank Marcos for his service to the Blues and wish him all the very best for the rest of his career.”
Alonso joined the Blues in the 2016 transfer window from Fiorentina for a deal worth £24 million. He took no time to adapt at his new home and has featured in 212 appearances, netting a total of 29 goals.
The left-back defender was also popular for scoring goals on big occasions. No Chelsea fan can forget his iconic late winners against both Tottenham and Arsenal. He also scored two at Old Trafford and a stoppage-time winner against Manchester City while playing away from home.
He was a vital cog in Chelsea’s Premier League title win back in 2016-17. He also won the FA Cup, Europa League, Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup at Stamford Bridge.
The Spanish defender is all set to fly to Barcelona for his medical test before signing a three-year contract he agreed to in April. The announcement is expected to be made official by the Spanish team in the coming hours.
With the emergence of young Alejandro Balde and after veteran Jordi Alba decided against Inter Milan move to stay at Camp Nou, it would be interesting to see who gets the nod from manager Xavi Hernandez for the first choice left-back position for the season.
