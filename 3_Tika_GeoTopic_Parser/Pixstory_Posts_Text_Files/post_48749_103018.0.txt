I was just thinking about Texas abortion ban. They can arrest women seeking abortion – and they have – and anyone involved in that, because apparently abortion is murder and you can't possibly 'murder babies'..

The cops here were directly responsible for the murder of 19 children and two adults. They not only did not intervene when they should have but also engaged with the shooter before the massacre took place, and let him go to carry the act out. Knowing fully well what he was going to do.

What will the cops face? Arrest like those poor women? Let me guess, NOTHING! Because Texas, or America for that matter, do not care about the lives of innocent children. Its abortion ban is rooted in misogyny and the desire to control women and their bodies.

Can you imagine how crazy it sounds that we live in the time where the police will arrest you for taking out a clump of cells from your body in the name of protecting children but will allow a man armed with weapons to walk in a school full of children RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES.

This country is full of bigotry, brutality and cowardice. It is sad and infuriating. It angers me and I'm sure everyone else too. This needs to stop. Put a ban on those freaking guns and defund the police because enough is enough!
