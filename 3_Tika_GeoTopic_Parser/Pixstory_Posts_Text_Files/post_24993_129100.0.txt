In gameweek three of the English Premier League, two unbeaten sides are set to go head to head at Craven Cottage. Fulham and Brentford are set to lock their horns in the Premier League fixture at Craven Cottage. 

Fulham are the recently promoted side to the English Premier League but have shown more mettle in the top-flight. Fulham drew the first game against Liverpool after Aleksandr Mitrovic scored two goals. On the other hand, they stopped Wolverhampton Wanderers from taking three points in gameweek two. 

On the other hand, Brentford drew level in the first game but showed no mercy to Manchester United in the second game. They thrashed 4-0 with multiple goalscorers on the score sheet for the Bees. It was a win to remember for ages for Brentford against Manchester United who had never won the game against the giants.
