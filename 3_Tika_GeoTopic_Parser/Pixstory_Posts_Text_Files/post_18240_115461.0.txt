In case you missed it, Jennifer Lopez recently will turn 53. And yet her skin looks like this—not a day over 35.

Just don’t tell her that she looks good for her age. “You never want to hear you look great for 50. You want people to just go, wow, you look amazing. ‘Oh my God, she’s 50.’ It’s like, does it matter? You’re just your best self, no matter what.”
Even still, she admits that her impossibly youthful-looking complexion is a frequent topic of conversation. “Wherever I go, the number one question people ask is, ‘What do you do for your skin?’ Even my closest friends are like, ‘Come on, bitch, what are you doing with your skin?’”

That’s why she recently launched JLo Beauty, a product range inspired by her five skin essentials: sleep, sunscreen, serums, supplements and vivir sano (Spanish for “living a healthy lifestyle”).

Of those, she credits sunscreen the most. “A dermatologist told me at a very young age to use sunscreen. That was a big part of why I was able to stay youthful-looking, because I used it as my moisturizer every single day.”

Since then, her basic routine hasn’t changed—and it doesn’t include any high-tech anti-aging ingredients, let alone cosmetic interventions. “I have to say, I have good genes. My mom and my grandma had beautiful skin, so I was blessed in that way. I haven’t had any plastic surgery... or injectables or fillers or anything like that.”

Here’s how Jennifer takes care of her skin, inside and out.
