You might have noticed that youngsters are more inclined to Hollywood movies Do you know the reason Perhaps you may not have thought in that way Most of the people think it s become a fashion to watch international movies that s why the youngsters are also going with the trend But let me correct this People are not watching this because of the trend or to look cool in the society The main reason is that the Bollywood movies that are released in these days are not up to the mark Although they spend a lot of finance in producing their movies but their storyline always revolves around the same topic No one wants to watch something that is monotonous People wants stories with suspense dynamic nature horror mafias superheroes which Bollywood is not providing them effectively We can t argue that Bollywood has never tried making something out of their circle but have you ever compared the storyline of these movies with that of international cinema The movies that you see in Bollywood has already been made by the international cinema and appreciated by the audience Even some people appreciate watching Bollywood movies as this doesn t require any effort to understand and they can also spend their leisure time effectively You might have even noticed that you already know the ending of Bollywood movies The reason behind this is every movie has almost the same ending But are these movies capable of bringing Oscar to the country The answer would be NO Bollywood movies can definitely do better if they start making movies that are somewhat different from the storyline that Bollywood has been producing for almost three decades or that inspires people
