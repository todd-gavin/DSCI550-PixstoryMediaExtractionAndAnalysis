During her recent interview, Shaheen Bhatt 🌼was asked about her reaction to netizens claim of Alia Bhatt being pregnant before marriage. Shaheen said that it is her journey whatever she’s dealt with.🌝
 Shaheen Bhatt said, “I will not speak for her because that is her own journey. Anything that she has dealt with internally is completely her journey. Having said that, you can never really please everybody. There is always going to be a negative comment or two out there. And I think living in the public eye, we are all very practiced at knowing what to pay heed to and what not to focus on.”👏👏
Meanwhile, Shaheen Bhatt is all excited to welcome her first nephew/niece. 🐣👶❤️
Speaking about the same, she added, “Alia is the first among us, siblings, who will be welcoming a baby. There is a vibe of extreme nervousness and excited anticipation (at home). We are waiting to meet the new member of our family…It has been a wonderful year for our family in that sense. It has grown tremendously this past year. There is only more joy and happiness to come our way and I am looking forward to that.”🌼❤️💕
