Milan coach Stefano Pioli analyzes the victory for Empoli on DAZN microphones We are happy with the victory and with our momentum but the ranking is not real We travel from game to game with great conviction but also great balance Defensive solidity is the best thing we are doing with a great spirit of sacrifice The merit is not of the centre-backs but of the whole team that applies In the first half we could have scored the second goal in the second most difficult state but we fought to bring home the result as a great team must do At the end of the first half I reminded the team that in the other situations we were in we then dropped down I asked to play with the same intensity we tried to dribble but we lost a few balls It is also true that we risked little but worked very well It is an important victory Communication is important and Maignan has always been involved asking a hundred questions a day And inside the game it must continue like this All the players away from the ball must organize the position He has this thing inside and the personality to propose himself
