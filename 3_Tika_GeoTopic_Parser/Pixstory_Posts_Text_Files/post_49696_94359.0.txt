Easter is a festival of gathering, peace and love. Holidays give some time with family and most of us give importance to cooking and the food we eat on these special occasions. It's all about our happiness and what we want that day. 

More than a religious aspect we focus on the love and fun we have on that day. So we might eat lamb, chicken, turkey anything we wish for. The whole festive mood is what it stands for. What would be Thanksgiving without a turkey similarly we can't ignore lambs or any food matters? What if I force a vegan to eat meat? Wouldn't that be offensive? Why? Because I am questioning their choice. Similarly, if I choose to eat meat I can and I should be feeling bad about it. 

See the whole environment depends on the systemic flow of the ecosystem. If a lion hunts for dear it's because it needs to cure its hunger we can't force the lion to eat grass! This flow of ecosystem is essential for the balance of biodiversity. So it isn't a big deal if we eat lamb for a day or two. Moreover, God only wants good for us, I believe God loves us the way we are! So what you eat on Easter doesn't define whether you are good or bad but your character does!
