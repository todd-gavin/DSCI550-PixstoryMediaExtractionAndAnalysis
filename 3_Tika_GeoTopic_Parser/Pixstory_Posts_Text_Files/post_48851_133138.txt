Upholding culture is important but most traditions need to be rejected in order to create an equal world And unfortunately for you that is slowly happening Many traditions are discriminatory in nature and promote the unequal distribution of resources and power They are meant to silence the apparently inferior communities In fact they forbid them from participating in society or even give them fundamental basic rights Tradition would be more acceptable had they seem humans like humans and not superior or inferior beings People use tradition to be racist homophobic or misogynist You for example so conveniently put in the example of genders in it Gender roles suck they need to end There are more than two genders and it s a fact Your tradition is completely ignoring these things Why must women and non binary genders respect such traditions Maybe you need to make your traditions more inclusive Otherwise we need to move away from these harmful traditions We need to create institutions that are based on human rights and equality instead of privileging certain groups over others We have to make sure that our laws reflect these values by ensuring that everyone has access to education and healthcare regardless of their social or economic status In this way we can create a society where everyone is able to reach their full potential
