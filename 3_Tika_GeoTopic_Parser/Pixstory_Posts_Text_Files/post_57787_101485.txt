It just happens at times one moment you re reading something diligently with the utmost focus and suddenly in the next your mind wanders off to another place There s no such specific thing you re thinking or dreaming about but you re just off kilter enough that your brain just doesn t register whatever you were trying to read and have been since trying to reread and understand for the past tries it s crazy You keep your eyes peeled open fixated on the lines but nothing sets in
