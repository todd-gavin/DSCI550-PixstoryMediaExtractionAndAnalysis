After two years back in Milan Gucci is back to show live in the via Mecenati hub with an almost exclusively male show I&#39;ve always liked doing things the other way around said Alessandro Michele at the press conference I find it more interesting Women also really like men&#39;s clothes as well as women&#39;s clothes for men The men&#39;s dress is a multifaceted object much desired by both, it crosses very well in there The collection parades in a room lined with mirrors distorting mirrors in which the Gucci stripes meet those of Adidas
