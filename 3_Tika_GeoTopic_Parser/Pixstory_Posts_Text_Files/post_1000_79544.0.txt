Among all the other familiar disruptions in our daily lives, the COVID crisis of the last two years has accelerated the structural shift to an economy in which intelligent machines are on track to displace gainful employment even as productivity growth generates ever greater wealth for those who “own the robots.” In short, the pandemic has exposed a dynamic of inequality endemic to the digital age. This glimpse into the future before it fully arrives also suggests ways to avert it before we get there.

Several recent studies show the clear markers of the trajectory ahead.

A recent study by MIT’s Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo reports that each new robot employed in industrial production between 1993 and 2007 eliminated 3.3 jobs on average and that 50-70% of the decline in wages of workers performing routine tasks was due to automation.

In her remarks at the (virtual) Davos conclave in late January, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen noted that the gains from “pandemic-induced telework” will “ultimately raise U.S. productivity by 2.7%.” But, she added, “technological advancement that boosts productivity growth may exacerbate, rather than mitigate, inequality.” It has mostly benefitted “upper-income” professionals, not to speak of huge profits flowing to the tech giants who own the platforms, while leaving the less educated and less skilled behind.
