Sport is incredibly important to Australians, and they like to support teams that are close to where they live or grew up. Rugby League, AFL, Tennis, Cricket, and Motor Sport Racing are among of Australia's most popular sports. 

You can attend a live game to get a full sense of the atmosphere, and as cohort tells us, important events such as the Australian Open, a major tennis tournament held in Melbourne every year in the last two weeks of January, or the Grand Prix motor race, which is also hosted yearly. 

Moreover, Australia is recognised for its magnificent beaches, and with 85 percent of the population living within 50 kilometres of the coast, Australians are self-described beach bums. You can partake in the beach lifestyle and head to one of the thousands of beautiful beaches on the weekend for a swim, a sunbake or even a spot of people watching.
