According to recent reports, former AC Milan and Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko is trying to convince his mother and sister to move away from Kyiv. Both of his family members are stuck in war-torn Ukraine and the player is concerned as the Russian forces are closing in on Ukraine’s capital. 

Talking to Sky Sports, Andriy Shevchenko mentioned:

“I try to talk (to my mother and sister) every hour, every 20 minutes, because there's a lot of action going on now

My mum and my sister - like most of the Ukrainian people, refuse to leave - are staying there to fight for our nation, to fight for our freedom, to fight for our soul

"I tried many times (to get them to leave), but the answer is no, (they say) 'we want to stay here'”

The former player and manager of Ukraine, Andriy Shevchenko, also requested the Russian citizens to stand up for Ukrainians and join hands for peace. He said:

Russians need to go into their squares and (take action) to stop the war

Andriy Shevchenko was signed by Roman Abramovich after the Russian had taken over the club in 2003. Andriy Shevchenko was one of the bankroll signings of Roman’s reign in the Premier League. The former Ukraine international had 282 goals and 76 assists to his name in 555 games across all competitions. The player had only one red card throughout his career including both international and domestic club competitions. 

The Russian businessman announced his intentions of selling the club as the United Kingdom decided to seize all the assets of the Russian owner of the club. The Premier League has decided to spread the “Message of Solidarity” as all the 20 club captains will sport an armband in Ukrainian colors.
