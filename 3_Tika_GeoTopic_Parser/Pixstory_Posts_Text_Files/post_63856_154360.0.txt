 Here comes the pain train...choo choo!! The weirdly funny and simultaneously frightening and awesome looking locomotive themed horror survival game ‘Choo- Choo Charles!’ is bringing on its own weird and demented look to Thomas the Tank Engine! Developed by Two Star Games which is a one man team run solo by indie developer Gavin Eisenbeisz the new trailer shows off a closer look at the gameplay.
The objective of Choo-Choo Charles is pretty simple: a group of settlers has asked you for help with killing a monster known only as “Charles”. Charles is an arachnid demonic train that looks like a giant, clown-faced, skittering steam locomotive barrelling at me on eight legs and is on a hunt for blood by prowling for unsuspecting train operators.
Before players tackle Charles they will need to upgrade the power of their engine so that it’ll be fast enough to outpace the monster, as well as equip themselves with enough firepower to take Charles down. In order to do that, the players will need to perform tasks for the settlers to get the much-needed rewards.
In addition to more Charles, the trailer also provides glimpses of just what players can expect when it comes to helping out the settlers. You’ll be having to travel along the tracks to reach specific locations, changing over the tracks as needed. All the while, you’ll be having to maintain your stealth in order to avoid attracting Charles. There are also mini-games you can participate in and unlock chests with your much-needed loot.
Adding further details, Two Star Games dev Gavin Eisenbeisz posted the release date of the game on Twitter and said “A horror game where you navigate an open-world island in an old train, upgrade it over time, and use it to fight an evil spider train named Charles. Wishlist Choo-Choo Charles on Steam to be notified when it releases on December 9, 2022!”
