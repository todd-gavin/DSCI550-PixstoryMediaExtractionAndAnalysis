There are a number of predators that live in the snow, and they all have one thing in common: they're deadly. 
Some of the deadliest predators in the snow include wolves, bears, foxes, coyotes and mountain lions. All of these animals are known to attack humans occasionally, and their attacks are usually fatal. 
The main reason why these predators are so dangerous is that they're well-adapted to cold weather. They have thick fur coats that keep them warm, strong muscles to carry heavy weights, and sharp teeth to eat food. They also have strong claws and jaws that help them survival in the harsh environment. 
If you're hiking or camping in the snow, it's important to be aware of these predators and take precautions to avoid being attacked. Make sure you know how to identify them before you go out into the wilderness, keep your distance when you see them (they will most likely not attack if they don't feel threatened), and don't leave any food or drink around if you don't have to.
