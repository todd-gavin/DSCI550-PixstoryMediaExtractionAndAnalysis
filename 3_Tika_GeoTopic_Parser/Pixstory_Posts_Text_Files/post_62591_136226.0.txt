There are a few things that you can do every day to keep your skin healthy and glowing.
1. Apply sunscreen every day, even if you're only going outside for a short period of time. Sun exposure can seriously damage your skin, so it's important to protect yourself from the sun as much as possible. 
2. Take care of your skin by washing it regularly with warm water and soap. Make sure to scrub all the dirt and makeup off, and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives on your skin. 
3. Use a moisturizer every day to keep your skin soft and hydrated. Go for products that have SPF in them since they will help protect you from the sun as well. 
4. Avoid using harsh cleaners on your skin – choose gentle solutions instead that are made specifically for delicate skin like yours. These cleaners will not harm your skin in any way, but they may not be capable of removing all the dirt, grime, and oil that builds up on your face over time. 
5. Keep track of what's causing breakouts on your face – if you notice anything recurring (like acne), make an effort to eliminate that thing from your life completely before trying out new skincare tactics again. Once you find out what's triggering breakouts, it'll be easier to avoid it in the future!
6. Drink plenty of water – Your skin needs water to function well, and too much dehydration can lead to dry skin. Make sure to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses per day.
