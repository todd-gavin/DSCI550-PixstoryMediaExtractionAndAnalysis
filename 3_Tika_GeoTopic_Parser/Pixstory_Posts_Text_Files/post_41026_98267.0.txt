Dr. Dawn Hughes, Amber Heard's psychologist, testified on her behalf on Tuesday, May 3, describing Heard's claims of past abuse from her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. 

According to The Daily Beast, Hughes testified that Heard said Depp was overtaken with jealous wrath on a 2015 trip from Boston to Los Angeles, ranting at her about her relationship with actor James Franco. 

Hughes noted the claim from Heard that Depp began “talking about James Franco” before eventually saying, “‘Hope you had fun with your escapades,'” then going on to kick the actress “on the back and she went forward.” Hughes also said she was only told the incident by Heard, but never saw the situation happen first-hand. 

Hollywood life reported that the episode, according to Hughes, was an illustration of Heard's claimed maltreatment during her relationship with Depp. In 2018, she claimed herself as a victim of domestic violence, but she never mentioned Depp by name. Depp has since rejected all of his ex-charges, girlfriend's and their case is still pending.
