The wool industry is one of the most cruel industries in the world. Sheep are herded into spaces called sheds, where they are confined and fed a meager diet. They are then forced to lie down on their backs all day long so that they can't move or eat, and they often suffer from lice and other parasitic infections. Workers in the industry use extreme force to shear these sheep, causing them immense pain and suffering.
The wool industry uses a wide variety of methods to get animals to produce as much wool as possible, including confinement in cramped and dirty conditions, deworming medication that is often painful and harmful, starvation diets, and force-feeding.
These practices result in immense suffering for the animals involved. Workers also face harsh conditions and abuses. They are frequently forced to work long hours for little pay, sometimes without proper clothing or safety equipment. The extreme temperatures can cause serious health problems such as heatstroke or frostbite.
Livestock raising systems operated by factory farms generate almost as much greenhouse gases as all forms of transportation combined! This means that not only do these factories have an appalling impact on the environment, but they are also complicit in global climate change.
Fortunately, there is a growing movement against this cruelty, led by animal rights activists who are working hard to raise public awareness about it. Unfortunately, not many understand or support ot. Hopefully, with increased publicity will come pressure from businesses and governments to end this horrific practice once and for all.
