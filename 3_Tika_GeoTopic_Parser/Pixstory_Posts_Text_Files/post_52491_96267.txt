One of my favourite sayings is Think Global Act Local Countries all over Africa are trying to work and stand on their own Dealing with a globally common problem climate change has to be approached regionally in Africa Climate change does not respect boundaries hence it is necessary for African countries to work together to build resilience to its adverse weather effects Countries within the same region share ecosystems that are subject to similar climate change impacts on livelihoods Instead of treating transboundary as a liability it is a big opportunity to deal with the same problems in different regions together Regional collaboration can provide the best strategy in working together to safeguard the common trans boundary ecosystems This approach to development can enhance African countries competitiveness for economic growth Human security means access to life s basic needs such as food shelter clothing education and health care Around the world regional approaches have successfully improved human security Cross border collaboration has helped in combating natural calamities and pandemics across Europe and Asia region respectively This solution can serve as a flexible and cost effective solution for addressing food security problems as it strengthens the ecological foundation of food systems It is becoming clear that what is needed is an integrated approach that incorporates climate science into planning of projects The power of working with nature has the potential to ensure that limited resources are prioritized and targeted towards the most effective solutions and therefore reduce the overall adaptation costs Best practices can be shared and implemented across countries to accelerate capacity building In addition management practices implemented by one country could affect ecosystem services and food security of others Through cross border coordination region specific knowledge and tools can be developed jointly to accelerate adaptation planning to strengthen livelihoods by improving agricultural productivity diverse farm activities providing better access to markets and information and improving infrastructure against vulnerability climate variability and extremes Citations weforum org exploringafrica matrix msu edu un org researchgate net blogs worldbank org Thanks Pixstory and Vega Schools give me a platform and chance to be part of sharing my approach to this global crisis
