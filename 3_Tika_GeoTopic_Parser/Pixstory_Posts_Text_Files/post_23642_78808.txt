The feminist movement and feminist philosophy are not the same things but the word feminism is quite naturally used to refer to both It is important to have a sense of their difference however To appreciate it we can take a look at the different contexts out of which they emerged Both contexts are particular to the th century but the emergence of the feminist movement and feminist philosophy are events of specific natures I propose that we see the feminist movement emerging in the aftermath of modern Western slavery as a dimension of its end feminist philosophy however only emerges in the aftermath of the death of God A reading of th century U S feminist leaders writings shows us that for many the injustice of slavery and the abolitionists struggle against it provided the avenue for the development of feminist consciousness The subordination of women was often compared to slavery for instance by Mary Wollstonecraft Harriet Taylor and John Stuart Mill in England and by Sarah Grimke and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the USA But for some the success of the abolitionist position at the end of the Civil War led to the concern that emancipation of slaves could bring about a Constitutional recognition of the rights of black men without accomplishing anything for women The least inspiring writings of our th century feminist leaders are those in which they argue that the black man must not be granted rights that have not been granted to white women If feminist organizing in the U S seems to begin officially so to speak in the Seneca Falls convention of when a Declaration of the Rights of Women is drafted then it develops an urgency after the Emancipation Proclamation and during Reconstruction as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony presses for the recognition of women s rights and aligns themselves at times with anti black political forces in the process This feminist movement was a pragmatic political movement the organization of support for the public declaration and recognition of rights for women
