After creating a successful cop universe by making films like Singham, Simba, and Sooryavanshi, Rohit Shetty is back with another Police Character who will be played by Sidharth Malhotra.

But this time, Rohit Shetty is trying something new because this time, Rohit Shetty choose the path of OTT platforms and will make a web series instead of a movie.

Rohit Shetty and Sidharth Malhotra also announced the name of the web series and the name is ‘Indian Police Force.’

So, let’s hope the series we will see in the future will be good, filled with a lot of actions, emotions, and entertainment.
