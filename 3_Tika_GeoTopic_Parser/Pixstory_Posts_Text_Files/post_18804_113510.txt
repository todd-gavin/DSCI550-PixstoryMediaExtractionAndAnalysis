From a simple suggestion we are gradually moving to a negotiation that could become incredibly real Under certain conditions Icardi could also become the new striker of the newly promoted Monza club that is trying to make a transfer market as an ambitious team The player is years old but already seems to be in the waning phase career success The three years at PSG didn&#39;t do him any good and he certainly didn&#39;t do what was expected the first year he managed to convince the second very well while the third went so badly that he was almost always relegated to the bench Monza from for his part he could relaunch the Argentine given that he is building a team capable of going beyond simple salvation with the arrivals of Cragno Ranocchia Sensi and above all Pessina who will be the new captain it seems that only a weighty striker is missing to start the games If If Icardi showed interest in the negotiation perhaps with the consent of Wanda Nara who could take advantage of the relationship with Galliani Berlusconi to return to TV, the biggest obstacle would be the signing of millions of euros a year today Too many for Monza who should find complicity of the PSG in such a way as to pay only millions of euros Something that seems to be a fantasy market but which in reality could soon become very real
