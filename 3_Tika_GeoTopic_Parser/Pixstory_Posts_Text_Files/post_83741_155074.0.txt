Treat school as a job if you want to get the best grades possible. Arrive early. Do not leave campus until you have completed your work, whether you have one class or none. Visit the library. Make your way to the student centre. Make your way to the writing centre. Study in an environment where you are surrounded by people who can assist you. Speak with your teacher. Consult with your teaching assistants.
Make it a rule that you will not leave campus until your work is completed.
