Every ardent reader will agree with me when I say that every book we read is an epiphany Every story is an unique adventure we embark on The characters are not just words of pages for us but almost real human beings we fall in love with So when our favourite books are adapted into movies we take it personally I have often observed that most movies do not do justice to the books Either they are not true to the character or too much of the essence of the story is spoiled to essentially make the movie a blockbuster So do movies do justice to books According to me there is no end to this debate and the answer will always be no You see as I said reading is a very personal experience Whenever we read we form a mental image in our head as to how the characters look how the room of the protagonist is how the setting of the place is etc I believe that we customise our experience and that is exactly what makes reading enjoyable Now when these books are adapted into movies it is the director s or the producer s vision When we see our favourite characters not looking or behaving like we thought they would in our head the purity of that experience is somewhat tainted Therefore many people like me will always pick books over movie What is your opinion on this
