Before our Europa League game Martin Odegaard faced the media I played for the under s and the national team but it s been a while since I played here There were a lot of kids outside training on the pitch next to the stadium I saw a lot of Arsenal shirts it s good to see this reception and hopefully we will see them tomorrow and hopefully the atmosphere will be brilliant again I think the fans here are really good they did a good job at the Emirates as well so I m looking forward to the game and the atmosphere Same as always really The same mindset as always we want to affect the game and start strong We always want to do that so we ll try to do that tomorrow again Yes I think so I think I ve developed a lot in the last few years I ve always been good on the ball but I feel like I m developing a different side of my game now as well without the ball How to improve and affect the game in different ways so yeah I feel like I m doing well and of course when the team is doing well it makes things easier for me as well I m really happy to be part of this team and happy with where we are at the moment but we want more of course I haven t thought too much about it to be honest I try to do the same things help the team as much as possible I enjoy the responsibility and just try to do the best for the team always and hopefully that s good
