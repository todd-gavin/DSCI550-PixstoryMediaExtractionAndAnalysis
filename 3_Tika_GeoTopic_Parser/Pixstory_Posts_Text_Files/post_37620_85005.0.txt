F1 had already cancelled 2022 race but now confirm there will be no Russian GP moving forward; Grand Prix was due to move from Sochi to St Petersburg in 2023

Formula 1 has terminated its contract with the Russian Grand Prix and the country will not have a race in the future.

The 2022 race scheduled to take place in Sochi in September had already been cancelled in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but F1 has now confirmed that there will not be Grands Prix in the country moving forward.

It means F1 will no longer shift from Sochi to St Petersburg as planned in 2023. The Russian GP was due to head to Igora Drive from next season, with a contract until 2025.

It is understood that the decision to end the Russian GP deal was made last week following a meeting between F1, the FIA and team bosses.

Sport around the world has been cutting ties with Russia, with the International Paralympic Committee the latest to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes, meaning they will not take part in the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games.

On Thursday, Motorsport UK announced Russian-licenced drivers have been banned from competing in the United Kingdom.

It means Haas driver Nikita Mazepin, the sole Russian driver on the F1 grid, will not be able to take part in July's British Grand Prix.
