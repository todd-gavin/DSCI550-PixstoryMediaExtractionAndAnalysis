Despite the modern kitchen culture based on new materials and technology, pottery is an ancient art and craft that still dominates human civilisation. The excavations at Burzhama, Mohenjodaro, Sindh, and other sites have shown that pottery's origins date back to prehistoric periods. The pots are constructed from clay or earthen mud. Earth is also the source of our food, flora, and biodiversity.

Our cultural legacy is the craft of pottery. This art is loved by many people, and many of them depend on it for their livelihood. Even now, although in less numbers, earthen pots may still be seen in many shops and homes. Due to the perception that this career is less lucrative than others, many people have left it.

 Famous Kashmiri musical instruments built by potters include "Tambaknaare" and "Noote." There is still a high demand for kangris, toys, flower vases, decorative objects, Kashmiri hubble and bubble, incense pots, water pots, milk pots, piggy banks (huge waer), etc. During melas and other joyful events, earthen pots and other clay-based artwork are frequently observed at holy sites. They also attract a lot of curiosity from tourists. Pottery is a significant handicraft and a part of Kashmiri culture. We cannot completely erase this significant Kashmiri art from our social and cultural fabric because machines cannot match handicrafts in quality.
