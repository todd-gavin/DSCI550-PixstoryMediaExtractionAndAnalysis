Australia has a long history of performing well above expectations on the world stage, despite its relatively small population. Cricket is the most popular national sport in Australia, and Australians excel at it. Australians also enjoy water sports and have been a swimming superpower since the late 1950s. Swimmers such as Dawn Fraser, Shane Gould, Kieren Perkins, and Ian Thorpe have all won multiple gold medals since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Australia has hosted the Olympics twice (1956 and 2000). These are Australia's most well-known sports: AFL, Cricket, Rugby League, Rugby Union, Netball, Football and Tennis.
