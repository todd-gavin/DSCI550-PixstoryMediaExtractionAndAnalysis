Syed M R Gillani Baldev M Singh Abstract Introduction Type diabetes is considered a chronic and progressive disease The term diabetes in remission has no consensus definition and the question whether diabetes remission or cure can achieve any long term benefits in people with type diabetes remains unclear The aim of our study was a review of our district wide diabetes population to determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of those who had a diagnosis of diabetes but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes at the point of assessment in and then to review their diabetes outcomes over a year time frame Methods In a whole population based non interventional epidemiological study amongst people with diabetes we identified with diet treated type diabetes who met the baseline criteria for diabetes in remission HbA c mmol mol Over the next years people had a cumulative HbA c attainment of mmol mol and remained free of diabetes medication Results In this erstwhile remission group only were free of any vasculopathy whilst had some form of micro or macrovascular disease of which people had been without micro or macrovascular vascular complications at baseline Only people had a HbA c consistently mmol mol who were free of diabetes vascular complications and of diabetes medication Conclusions The definition of diabetes in remission remains unclear most especially regarding the inclusion of baseline prevalent or incident macro or microvascular disease the durability of potential remission is poor and the likelihood of cure is remote Sources
