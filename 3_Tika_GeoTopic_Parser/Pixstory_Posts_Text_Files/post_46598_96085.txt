Former President Barack Obama argued that an enormous information ecology bolstered by large tech companies is eroding democracy and I agree with him In contrast to his support of Silicon Valley and social media as a force for good as president Obama s comments suggest a shift in his feelings about technology Axios reported that Obama made the remarks during a Stanford University event on disinformation and democracy which was co hosted by the Obama Foundation If we do nothing I m convinced the trends we re seeing will get worse he said People are overwhelmed by the information provided by social media companies which contributes to division and confusion over what can be trusted If we do nothing I m convinced the trends we re seeing will get worse He further rightfully pointed out that Just like every industry with an impact on our society these platforms ought to be subject to some control says the government He cited misinformation about the COVID vaccination and the tragic Capitol insurgency on Jan as examples of how misinformation is killing people These companies need to have a North Star other than profits and market share he said He is not wrong but fighting misinformation is a big task and I am wary if US can achieve it or not especially considering the extreme elements from both left and right wing who are the harbingers of misinformation
