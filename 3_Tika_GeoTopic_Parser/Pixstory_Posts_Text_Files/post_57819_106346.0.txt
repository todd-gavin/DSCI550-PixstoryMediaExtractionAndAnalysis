We've all experienced this specific scenario with a parent!😂
I mean, come on, it's the most valid and logical point we kids can ever make to the parents😂
We really didn't ask to be born😂
The parental units made that decision for us and then they got us😂
It's their responsibility, you can't expect us to uphold all your commands and then say this and not accept this reasoning 😂
