On Prosecco Day, indulge in the bliss of a refreshing beverage. Prosecco is a sparkling white wine that has gained popularity recently as more and more people become aware of its mouthwatering flavour and reasonable pricing. 

As per DOY, although this wine has been around for a while, it was essentially unknown outside of Italy before the turn of the century. 

More people outside of Italy are unaware of the history of prosecco. In fact, the Romans are thought to have given this local white wine the name "Puccino" at least 2000 years ago, in 200 BC. 

This wine, which is made from grapes cultivated in the Prosecco region in northeastern Italy, is comparable to Champagne in in that particular region in order to be labeled with the name Prosecco! 

So how do you plan to celebrate this day?
