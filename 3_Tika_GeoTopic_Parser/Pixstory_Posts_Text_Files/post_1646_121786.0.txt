Looking back at old photographs of the news anchors of the 90s always brings back a sense of nostalgia. In the late 1960s, the group of young women had become synonymous with television news. 

Among them were Salma Sultan, Rini Simon, Gitanjali Aiyar, Meenu, Usha Albuquerque, Manjari Joshi, Sarla Maheshwari and Neelam Sharma.

Every night at 9 pm on Doordarshan, Prasar Bharati, a female anchor would deliver the news of the day in impeccable Hindi and English. Their tone was calm without any aggression. 

Dressed in crisp saris and with their hair and make-up done up elegantly, these female news anchors were an epitome of grace, style, warmth, and composure.

It has been more than two decades but itâ€™s hard to forget those anchors who kept us updated with all the latest events and current affairs. Those were the days when only two channels, DD1 and DD2, were available on the idiot box.
