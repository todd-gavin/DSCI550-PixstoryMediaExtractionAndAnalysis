News broke out on Tuesday stating that Kylian Mbappe wants to leave PSG in January. However Real Madrid are now uninterested in signing the Frenchman, hence this leaves the door open for Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side.
Real Madrid were closely monitoring Kylian Mbappe's situation over the last year and the Spanish giants were very close to signing the forward in the summer. However, Mbappe chose to extend his stay at PSG owing to a higher salary and this is a decision that the French star now regrets as per reports. 
The whole Mbappe saga in the summer means that Real Madrid are now uninterested in doing business with the striker. PSG themselves are not looking to sell Mbappe, however, if they do have to let him go, they don't want the player moving to Madrid.
This makes Liverpool the favourites to land the forward if he actually leaves in January. The Reds have had a tough start to their PL campaign, they are currently 10th in the table and have registered just 2 wins in 8 PL games. 
Jurgen Klopp had expressed his interest in Mbappe before, hence the manager could reignite it considering the club's form. However having signed Darwin Nunez, the club  is already stacked in the attacking department and would have to  sell a few stars in order to land Mbappe. 
PSG however are not looking for a January sale regardless of Mbappe's. Hence it has to be seen what decision the club and the player arrive at following the World Cup in Qatar later this year.
