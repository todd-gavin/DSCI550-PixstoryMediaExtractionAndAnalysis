Six sequels to the cult classic horror movie Tremors from 1990 have been made, however none of them starred the original lead Kevin Bacon. 

In spite of this, Bacon visited the sandworm-infested little hamlet once more for a 2018 Syfy TV pilot that was cancelled and never shown. 

As per Hollywood Reporter, in 2020, a perplexed Bacon told Dread Central, "We made a terrific pilot outside of Albuquerque, rebuilt the town, had a very great cast, director, and writer and to this day I still don't understand why they didn't want to move through with it." It makes me really scratch my head. If I truly believed that the pilot was terrible, I would reply, "We just didn't crack it. (Instead, Syfy selected a competing pilot, Deadly Class, for a one-season run.)

As one Tremors fan ranted on Reddit, “How are there 19 shitty Tremors movie sequels, but this doesn’t get picked up by at least a streaming service?”
