I know and I can feel how this distance haunts at times in the middle of the day when you have an urge to meet your loved one but this distance ugh But somehow this distance never seems to make you grow distant Does it But it somehow isn t in your hands so all you do is stare at their pic smile like an idiot and just wait for the day you are gonna see them again Long distance relationships have a different kind of beauty in themselves the happiness to see your loved one after so long that hug when you meet them or those pretty cute food dates you go on while holding each other s hands I know you miss all of this a lot especially when you are going through a rough phase and you realise that all you need is them So you promise them that you ll always fight for them and won t give up that easily You ll always have faith in them and would never run away It s beautiful how you tend to do everything possible to make them happy by promising them all the love honesty loyalty trust care and so so much more love a lifetime of togetherness I can feel the times when every cell in your body screams for their attention love touch and affection but you couldn t even see them and those are the times where it feels like a piece of you is missing and the piece tends to be that one person who is just enough for us Someone who knows how you feel
