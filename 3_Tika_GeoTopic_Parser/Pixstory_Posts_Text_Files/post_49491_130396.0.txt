A study published in the The Lancet Psychiatry journal has found that people who are infected with COVID-19 (a novel coronavirus) are at increased risk of developing neurological and psychiatric sequelae two years after infection.

“COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae in the weeks and months thereafter,” reads the study, titled “Neurological and psychiatric risk trajectories after SARS-CoV-2 infection: an analysis of 2-year retrospective cohort studies including 1,284,437 patients.”

What were the most common problems? The researchers found that people who were infected with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to develop Sequelae. They were also more likely to develop chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic muscle pain syndrome, and depression. 

'The study examined de-identified data from more than a million patients using an international health records network that drew from the U.S., Australia, the U.K., Spain, Bulgaria, India, Malaysia and Taiwan. Most patients considered by the study were American.'

Clearly, this is a worrying finding as it suggests that COVID-19 is not just a health emergency; it is also a potential cause of long-term disability. People should be aware of these risks and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from this virus.
