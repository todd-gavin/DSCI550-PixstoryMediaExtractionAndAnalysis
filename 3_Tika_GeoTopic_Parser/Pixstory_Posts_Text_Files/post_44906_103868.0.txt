Ryad Boudebouz’s miss meant the hosts dropped to Ligue 2 and sparked ugly scenes at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. 
Saint-Etienne suffered a violent pitch invasion after their Ligue 1 relegation playoffs against Auxerre on Sunday, as the club dropped to the second tier of French Football for the first time in almost two decades. 

Les Verts has been forced to fight back for an equaliser through Mahdi Camara after Hamza Sakhi had netted the opener at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, forcing a penalty shootout. 
Pascal Dupraz’s side could not find a way back after Ryad Boudebouz missed the opener and scenes quickly turned ugly after opposition captain Birama Toure netted the clincher from the spot with fans flooding onto the pitch and lobbing fares. 

What happened at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard?
Following a game which had seen supporters grow increasingly restless in the stands, Toure’s finish sparked a massive invasion from home supporters to the turf. 
Flares were thrown about and players were reportedly forced to be evacuated amid fears and concerns about their safety, reported RMC Sport.

Riot police were subsequently brought in to disperse the crowd, with the fire brigade also called in after fans attempted to set seats alight in the stands.

What have the club said on the matter?
ASSE released a statement that failed to mention the chaotic scenes at full-time and instead delivered an address from the owners that hinted at a potential change of powers behind the scenes. 

“This failure must be accepted,” pair Bernard Caiazzo and Roland Romeyer wrote. 
“As a major shareholder, we take full responsibility for this. In a while, we will announce important news regarding the future of the club and ours.”
