During an interview with The Playlist Dune screenwriter Jon Spaiths shed some more light on the nature of Dune Part Two and revealed its plans to set up a full Dune trilogy Denis Villeneuve has talked seriously about making Dune Messiah as well as a conclusion of the trilogy Dune Messiah is a very interesting book which in some ways deconstructs Dune and plays as a cautionary tale even more than Dune does about the dangers of blending religion and politics the hazards of following charismatic leaders and the dangerous struggle that s always alive between the individual and institutions There are a few tantalizing strands that lead into the future and suggest that we might not be done in this universe despite the fact that the ending of Dune as a novel which will be the ending of the second film is a very satisfying conclusion
