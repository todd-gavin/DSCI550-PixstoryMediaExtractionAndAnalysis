Sadio Mane is a Bayern Munich player. Liverpool sold their forward to the Bavarian giants. The Senegal-born player is of the elite class. Bayern know that they have got themselves a player who’ll provide them goals. The departure of Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona will leave a massive void in the Bayern ranks. But the addition of Mane, though he is not a like-for-like option, will provide relief as he is known as a game changer. He possesses that ‘oomph’ factor in him.


Before speaking more about him we’ll have a look at his career last season which prompted Bayern Munich to buy him.


 Operating as a left-winger we can see his seasonal heatmap where he made most of his action.
