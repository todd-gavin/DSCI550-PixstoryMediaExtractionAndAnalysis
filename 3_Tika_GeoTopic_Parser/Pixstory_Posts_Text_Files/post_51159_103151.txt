Yes it is wrong It shows their weakness It shows their girliness If a man cries he is not a real man And that is pure bullsh t By that logic women are weak right It is OKAY for men to cry Crying isn t making you less of a man you are human Crying isn t gender based and not a sign of weakness In fact it s healthy for your body and mind It s a release of stress tension and pent up emotions Cry if you re happy cry if you re sad Cry when you feel like it And such are the thoughts of so many people who will still teach their sons to not cry and ask them to man up We talk about sexism in women but what about the sexism men face Men are times more likely to commit suicide than women Why Because in this society it s unacceptable for men express feelings Suicide ISN T a joke Please help a suicidal person They re lonely hopeless and they need somebody Boys have been taught from a young age that men CAN T show emotions It shapes their minds As they growing up thinking that it s not manly to cry Unfortunately it is heredity It ll pass to the next generation and the one after that and so on Until people understand the truth C mon men are humans too and we all have feelings So let s change this
