A stage for sprinters was expected and instead four fugitives came to the end and then fought it out at the finish line in Treviso. The winner was the Belgian Dries De Bondt who mocked an unfortunate and very generous Edoardo Affini on the finish line. Third position for the Dane Magnus Cort Nielsen ahead of the other Italian Davide Gabburo The group sprint is then won by Alberto Dainese ahead of Demare Cimolai Cavendish and Gaviria The general classification remains unchanged with the Ecuadorian Carapaz always first with just a second margin over the Australian Hindlay And tomorrow the road will climb again with GPM and uphill finish at the Sanctuary of Castelmonte The first of two stages that will decide the tour
