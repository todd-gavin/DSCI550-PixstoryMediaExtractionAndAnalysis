There are people who are trying to make a difference we see these approaches on social media Once scrolling through Instagram I came across a page Roopkesarvivatika whose one post is follow the page and we ll plant a tree for every follower I followed the page and they actually sent a video of the plantation and also tagged me in the story Since then I was following them on Instagram and has seen various plantation drives organized by them Not only plantation drives namely Each one plant one but also feeding stray animals and freeing birds from cages If you want you can pay them and they will get a tree planted for you They have also collaborated with other such pages and following those pages will also mean the same These are the small steps that matter we can be part of such organisation or form one and can give our contribution to earth
