Ultimately, if the situation continues in such a way that the atmosphere created and the laws in question create relative freedoms for women, and on the other hand, the anti-feminist and patriarchal tradition is strongly ingrained in our thinking, we will see killing, beheading and beheading every day. And we will be the nose of women and the field trials. In the continuation of such an illusory and horrible situation, even free, educated and civil women will be on the same step of killing and healing. Unless there is a plan to enforce the law with the passage of the law. Custom gives way to law. Women's rights and freedoms should occur not only in behavior but also in the minds of men and women in this society. Women should consciously enjoy their freedoms, and men close to them should consciously give them rights, consider women as independent legal entities, and the identity of women should not be further defined by men.
