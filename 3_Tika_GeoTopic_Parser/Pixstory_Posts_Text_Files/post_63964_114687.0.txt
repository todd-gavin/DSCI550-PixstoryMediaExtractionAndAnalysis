While we can never truly say what is the greatest guitar riff of all time, given just how many there are, we can certainly sort them out on the basis of certain characteristics, such as the time of their release, legacy, recognition, influence and composition. 

While some certainly are worthy, not every guitar riff identified as ‘genre defining’ and ‘ultra influential’ deserves the title of the best riff ever. There are a couple of underdogs on the bench who have an even greater right to that claim, no matter how much the media may blow certain riffs out of proportion.

Some bands like Black Sabbath have riff gods like Tony Iommi who have made entire albums that can fill such a list on their own. In order to make a comparison with other bands, only one song from one artist was picked on this list, some highly influential and well known, and some underdogs in the race who very well deserve that place. What are your personal favourite riffs? Or how would you arrange this list?
