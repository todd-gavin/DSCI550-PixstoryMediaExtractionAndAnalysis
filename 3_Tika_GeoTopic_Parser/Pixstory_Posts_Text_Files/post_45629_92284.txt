I don t know about you guys but if my local library bans a book I will try my best to get my hands on it be it a digital or a pirated copy Banning books is never the solution The problems of world do not disappear if we close our eyes and hate speech won t disappear if we ban the books The concept of censorship is a very fickle one The most imperative question is who will decide what needs to be censored and what not needs to be censored The State The same state which will always have a political agenda The same state which will not take a minute before banning a book that criticised the government slightly Or do people propose to build a new censoring body for books What is the guarantee that the people in this body will not ban books according to their personal bias Honestly to think that this proposition would be a successful one even in the slightest is simply being na ve It will only take us towards a totalitarian rule Instead on banning books that hurt the sentiments of a community we should be focusing on creating healthy debates that educate people on these issues Yes the books that propagate hate speech need to criticised But people should be aware what exactly is hate speech in order to understand why it is wrong Instead of banning books and suppressing creative freedom we should be focusing on educating people and making them rational humans so that they can identify right from wrong using their own critical faculties
