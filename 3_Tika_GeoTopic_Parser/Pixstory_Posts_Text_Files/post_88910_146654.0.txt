Chinese authorities are arbitrarily collecting DNA from residents of the Tibet Autonomous region (TAR), in 14 district localities across 7 prefectural level areas, to create a Biological database of people for mass surveillance, Human rights watch said.Â  
This step is taken in the name of biosecurity to control the population specifically in the occupied regions of Tibet, Eastern Turkistan and Southern Mongolia. 
Chinese Police have chosen men, women, children and even Buddhist monks for DNA collection outside of any ongoing criminal investigation.
It is estimated that from June 2016 to July 2022, police may have collected fairly 919,282 to 1,206,962 DNA samples, that is between one quarter (25.1%) and one third (2.9%) of Tibet's total population (3.66 million). 
The police have rationalised mass DNA collection as a tool to fight crime, find missing people, and ensure social stability. But, they will be free to use the mass DNA database for whatever purpose they think fit. 
Earlier, China sterilized thousands of Uyghur Muslims, which later showed horrendous results. And the recent mass DNA collection drive happening in Tibet shows how wide this project is under the current regime. 
Chinese president Xi Jinping will be Re elected as the Chinese Communist party's leader in october. Therefore, it is plain enough that the mass DNA collection drive, is to keep the tibetans occupied so that they together with other Chinese citizens, who still resent the communist government in its handling of covid-19 pendemic would not come together to protest against the regime. 
China has frequently announced its new laws and regulations to control the mass of Tibet, East Turkistan and South Mongolia. 
However, Such overt actions of DNA collection in the name of biosecurity measures completely disregards the basis of humanity and call for integrated actions against Chinese regime.
