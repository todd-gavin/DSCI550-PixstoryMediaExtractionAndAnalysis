Fiorentina is very disappointed with the choice of their new Serbian striker and looking for a new replacement.
Luka Jovic came to Real Madrid with a huge transfer fee on his head. But the striker was horrible in front of the goal. The Serbian was one of the best young talents in the world while he was playing in the Bundesliga.
La Fiore brought him to replace Dusan Vlahovic, but he has just brought misery to the club.
Jovic’s spectacular debut against Cremonese gave Italy good feelings about the striker. But all the good feelings soon faded away with his goals in just the next 5 matches.
Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Italiano has told that the player needs some time to recover his match fitness which may help him to rediscover his form.
The manager has given the player enough game time, and the Serbian has played a total of 558 minutes in his eight appearances.
But his performance is miserable in finishing and in the game involvement. The player himself tried to justify his lack of form by saying: “It will take me time to find my form; I haven’t played in a long time.”
Jovic is asking for patience, but the Viola club is desperately looking for a good striker after selling Vlahovic to Juventus this January. Neither Piatek nor Cabral has put the performance or the numbers in front of the goal to please the club and the fans.
The compatriot of Vlahovic has arrived in Italy on a free transfer from Real Madrid this summer on the condition that half of the player’s rights will be kept by Madrid.
Fiorentina has not reached Vincenzo Italiano’s ambition, and their strikers, Jovic and Cabral have just scored one under each name. In the last game against Verona, Jovic has not played a single minute in their 2-0 victory. The Serbian even missed a penalty against Juventus, which ended up in a 1-1 draw.
