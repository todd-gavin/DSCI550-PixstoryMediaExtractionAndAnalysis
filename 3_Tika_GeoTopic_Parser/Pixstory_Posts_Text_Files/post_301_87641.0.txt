The subjectivity of writing terrified me when I was younger. Without calculations that can determine the integrity of a result, how do you validate the meaning of words?

Once I reached the breaking point of derivatives, I realized there was not much left to loose — math caused migraines, physics was synonymous with procrastination, and chemistry was a cryptic code that no longer seemed worthy of my time. 

Overnight, I made the decision to start writing for a living because writing is loving-living, I realized. 

The mathematics of a sentence can bring you closer to deconstructing and redefining equation of yourself. 

At the same time, it was really tough to find comfort in the discomfort of knowing that perfection loses meaning in a poem a few minutes after you write it.

My mentors taught me how to hold onto the survival of your own creation — by knowing that you can continue workshopping a poem to make it itself, and that when you can’t, you will find the same poem waiting to be written in another form. 

While this sets a precedent for perfecting the next piece to compensate for the one before, it taught me how to get over my fear of creating something unworthy of anyone’s time by giving me the hope to that I can do better by confronting what went wrong. 

Making this a way of living, is still a process.
