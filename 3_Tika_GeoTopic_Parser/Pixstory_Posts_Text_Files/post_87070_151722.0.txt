Let my write a review for the Kollywood big blockbuster movie ponniyin selvan.
Very nice movie. Decent adaption of such a complex, intrinsic, energetic novel 🙏🏼. Appreciate the right portrayel(as kalki portrayed)  of true leads - Nandini and Kundavai (smart women who runs the show ) in a patriarchal era and industry. Are there opportunities - 'yes alot' but this novel is impossible to be visualized thru any medium ( except readers own mind 😀) so thanks to captian manirathnam and all others for reviving interest of ponniyin selvan reading in our generation. I would request every one of who watches to read or hear the original novel thru podcast. Awaiting for the second part !!! 
First of all What is the story Ponniyin Selvan about?is a historical fiction novel by Indian author Kalki Krishnamurthy, written in Tamil language.
It was first serialized in the weekly editions of Kalki, a Tamil magazine, from 29 October 1950 to 16 May 1954, and later integrated into five volumes in 1955. In about 2,210 pages, it tells the story of early days of Chola prince Arulmozhivarman. Kalki visited Sri Lanka three times to gather details for inspiration.
The novel is widely regarded as the greatest novel ever written in the history of Tamil literature.
