Am I free? Having been brought up in a liberal and educated family, both my sister and I have always been encouraged to be independent and follow our dreams. We have grown up with a lot of self-belief and I consider myself equal to any man. However, despite being brought up in such a free and open environment, I have encountered contradictions which make me question my beliefs and introspect whether men and women are truly equal.My parents regularly insist that I get back home before it gets dark whereas I find that my male friends have no such restrictions imposed on them. I am usually advised to dress modestly whereas my male friends receive no such advice. My parents are fearful of my safety each time I step out alone or get late. Alcohol is harmful for all but it is mostly frowned upon when women consume it. I know of many women who compromised their career to manage their families but their spouses faced no such pressure. These restrictions and dichotomies, that even emancipated women encounter, made me rethink the meaning of liberty and freedom that I believed I enjoyed.
