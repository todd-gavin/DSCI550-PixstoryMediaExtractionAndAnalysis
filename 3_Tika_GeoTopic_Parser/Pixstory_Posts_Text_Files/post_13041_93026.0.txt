Mawlawi Noorullah Munir, the Taliban's acting minister of education, says the group is under pressure to reopen girls' schools across the country.

It is 205 days since the Taliban closed girls' schools; Despite widespread criticism of the closure of girls' schools during this period, the Taliban have not changed their minds.

The Taliban understand the need for education for both men and women, and schools will soon be open to girls, the head of the Taliban Ministry of Education was quoted as saying by the AFP.

This is not the first time the Taliban have made similar promises to reopen girls' schools.
The Taliban made similar promises in the first period of their rule in the 1970s, but never fulfilled them.

The European Union, human rights groups and the United Nations have repeatedly stated that the Taliban will never be recognized by banning girls' education.

Earlier, Taliban officials had promised the international community that they would open the gates of girls' schools with the start of a new school year in Afghanistan during the New Year, but they did not live up to that promise.

Rina Amiri, the US State Department's representative for Afghan women, had previously said that the issue of girls' education in Afghanistan had created divisions among Taliban officials.

According to him, those within the Taliban understand that reopening schools is the right decision.
