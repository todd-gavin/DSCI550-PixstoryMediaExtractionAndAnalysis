Dražen Petrović's biography reveals an exceptional career rarely seen in the history of Croatian sport since it developed in a steady ascent. He was born on 22 October 1964 in Šibenik and his basketball career started in a small local club, only to move to the strongest basketball league in the world – NBA. As a 15-year-old in the autumn of 1980 he became a member of BC Šibenka's senior team. With this club he played twice in the Radivoj Korać Cup finals, in 1982 and in 1983
In 1984 he signed for BC Cibona with which he won a Yugoslav Championship (1985), three Yugoslav Cups (1985, 1986, 1988), two European Champions Cups (1985, 1986) and one Cup Winners Cup (1987). Dražen moved to Real Madrid in the autumn of 1988 and with the Royal club he captured Spanish Cup and Cup Winners Cup. He is the first Croat who played in the NBA. His first team were Portland Trail Blazers for which he played since the beginning of 1989/90 season. In January of 1991 he was traded to New Jersey Nets.
Throughout his entire career Dražen was a vital part in successes of Yugoslav and later Croatian national team for which he was the first captain. He participated three times at the Olympic Games – in Los Angeles in 1984 (bronze), in Seoul in 1988 (silver) and in Barcelona in 1992 (silver). He played in World Championships twice – in 1986 (bronze) and in 1990 (gold). He achieved successes on European Championships in 1987 (bronze medal) and in 1989 (gold medal) as well as on Universiades in 1983 (silver) and in 1987 (gold).
Motzart of Basketball 
Privately, Dražen was an extremely modest person. That is the reason why he gained respect and love from his fans. On the field, during the game, he was completely different. He always gave his maximum. His only desire was to progress from game to game, and eventually turn into one of the best basketball players in the world.
If he chose any other career path he would undoubtfully be equally successful
Miss and love you always Kaptan ❤️🇭🇷🇭🇷
