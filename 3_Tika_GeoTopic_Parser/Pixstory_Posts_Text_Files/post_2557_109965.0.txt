Lattu or spinning top are used to play games in India.
This has been a traditional game of India which used to be liked and played by every kid, but now it is losing its importance due to the interest taking priorities. This game used to be popular for kids. Lattu is still a part of life for children in Rural India.
1)      The spinning top has been in existence for thousands of years. Like many traditional games, such as marbles, the earliest tops are made from clay, and were discovered in the Middle Eastas early as 3500 BC, it is likely that children would have been spinning small rocks long before.

2)      Later wooden spinning tops emerged in around 2000 BC, and early spinning tops made from bones have been found in Europe.

3)      Those spinning tops were much simpler than many tops found in old fashioned toy shops today, and it did spin with a twist of the fingers.

4)      It is such a surprising thing that a wooden top can balance itself on a point of a nail.  It is because of what is known as the “Gyroscopic Effect”, which combines the universal laws of inertia (& momentum), friction and gravity, and the transference of potential to kinetic energy.
