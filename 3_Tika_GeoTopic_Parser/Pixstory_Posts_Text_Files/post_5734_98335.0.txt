Namaz of Eid-ul-Fitr were offered at sharp 9 am in Zeenat-ul-Masjid in Daryaganj, New Delhi.

Zeenat-ul-Masjid, commonly referred to as ‘Ghata Masjid’, was commissioned by princess Zeenat-un-Nissa Begum, the daughter of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. It held great importance in Mughal times and was considered second to Jama Masjid in its magnificence and design. When it was built, it stood on the western banks of River Yamuna at a height so that it was visible to anybody on the other bank.

People from all over Old Delhi come to Ghata Masjid on Eid to offer prayers. The mosque is filled with worshippers, children can be seen playing in the courtyards with their elders constantly trying to stop them.

Namaz at Eid is a bit different from the ones offered throughout the year. There is a small speech known in Islam as ‘ Qutba ‘ given by the Imam post and before namaz. Following Namaz and Qutba, a mass prayer is done by all the worshippers together for peace and health to everyone around the world.

After prayers are done, people are seen hugging each other and wishing Eid Mubarak!
