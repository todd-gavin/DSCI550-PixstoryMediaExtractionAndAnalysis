Nice will be taking on Troyes on Sunday October 9 in ligue 1 at the Allianz Riviera. Nice are placed 13th in the points table while Troyes are placed 11th though they only have a point difference of three. 
Nice replaced Lucien Favre for Christophe Galtier this summer. The hopes were high on them that the highly rated star could take his team above but they only managed to win just two games under him. Recently they lost against PSG by 2-1 but came back stronger against FC Slovacko winning it by 1-0 in the UEFA conference league this week. 
Troyes though after a poor start in their campaign recovered well as they lost first three games but managed to lose only once since then. In their recent game they drew against Rennes by 2-2 after beating Clermont 3-1 before the international break. 
Nice's biggest problem this season has been their goal scoring ability. They have only scored just 6 goals this season. This form would be helpful for Troyes to carry on their momentum.
