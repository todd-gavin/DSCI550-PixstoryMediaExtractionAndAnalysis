Apparently it is true that a child could not be kept in a bubble they would come out of it sometime in their lives But that doesn t make gender neutral parenting any less essential There could be challenges but then challenges exist everywhere and fighting for any conformity would always put you in danger However that should not stop anyone from believing in what they believe And this can only be achieved by constant commitment committing to a child s authenticity equality and other rights If a child is free to experiment with how they want to express themselves it will turn them into more balanced beings A child would feel unconditionally loved and build a stronger sense of trust with their parents Creating a clear picture for their children is important children should be taught about the gender discriminatory world they live in it would not keep them in delusion and instead make it easier for them when they step out of the bubble And if the parents successfully build that higher degree of emotional intelligence in their children then it would not take a long battle to fight with society and others who disagree with gender non conformities
