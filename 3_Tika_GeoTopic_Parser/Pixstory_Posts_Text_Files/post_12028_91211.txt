Now in many countries the covid restriction of mask is sliding down and it has reached to a stage where we almost don t need the mask apart from maybe using it while we are at a closed space According to the reports from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC almost per cent of the Americans have stopped wearing masks indoors Dr William Schaffner professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville Tennessee told Healthline that It s clear that COVID is receding but it s not gone and it never will be gone Even if we move from pandemic to endemic it will be as though we have a truce with this virus It s natural to feel anxious taking off the mask Those who are still thinking on going maskless and who feel pretty anxious about it don t worry you are not alone in this Schaffner says that this is quite natural that one could feel in such a way He compares it with certain instances that he noticed this during his rounds to the patients that he treated in intensive care unit and he closely monitored them While they shifted to a regular floor of the hospital they became more anxious There can be anxiety if they can t see or hear the beeping of their heartbeat regularly So there is a transition anxiety that is a combination of exhilaration because they re getting better but worry because they re not being monitored as carefully It takes time sometimes for people to make that adjustment to the less secure environment he said Sanam Hafeez PsyD neuropsychologist and director of Comprehend the Mind said that after years of living with some form of mask mandate it became second nature to many people So you see changes are quite difficult and it can make one nervous and anxious but it s okay to be nervous and you are not alone in this Sources
