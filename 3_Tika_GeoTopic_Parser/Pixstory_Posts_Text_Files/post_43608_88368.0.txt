TAN’s agency has confirmed that a fire broke out in the building that houses the “Wild Idol” group’s practice room.

On March 19, Think Entertainment officially stated, “At 4:50 a.m. today, a fire broke out on the first floor of TAN’s practice room building in the Nonhyeon neighborhood of Seoul’s Gangnam District.”

Fortunately, however, TAN had left the practice room about two hours before the fire erupted, and it has been reported that no casualties resulted from the fire.

“The TAN members practiced in the practice room on the first basement floor up until 2:30 a.m. before returning to their dorm, and they were therefore unharmed,” explained the agency. “The members are currently carrying out their scheduled activities without any problems. Although they were unharmed, they are currently very worried about those who suffered damages [because of the fire].” TAN, a seven-member idol group that was formed on MBC’s survival audition show “Wild Idol,” made their debut earlier this month with “DU DU DU.” The group includes former RAINZ member Sunghyuk, former C-CLOWN and TREI member Jaejun, former 24K member Changsun, former WE IN THE ZONE member Jooan, former “CAP-TEEN” contestant Taehoon, former Big Hit and Brand New Music trainee Hyunyeop, and NTX member Jiseong.
