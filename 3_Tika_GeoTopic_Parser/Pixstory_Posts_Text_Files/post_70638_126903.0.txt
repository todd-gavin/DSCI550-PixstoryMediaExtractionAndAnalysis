The two most well-known electric SUVs in the Indian market are the Nexon EV and Nexon EV Max. With the Tigor and the two SUVs, Tata is now without a doubt India's undisputed leader in the EV industry. How much does the Nexon EV (and the EV Max) add to a person's monthly electricity bill is a common topic regarding these vehicles. Here is a response sent by a Nexon EV owner.

The owner of this specific Nexon EV is a vlogger, and he posted an explanation video on YouTube. The vlogger and his companion are asked to predict the amount of the vlogger's current electricity bill, which is shown in the video. In response to the friend's failure, the owner states that since he began using the Nexon EV and charging it at home, his bill has been Rs 2,900 a month.

But hold on, he actually spends less each month on Nexon EV charging fees. The vlogger explains to his friend that the statement includes both the expense of using ordinary power at home as well as the cost of charging the EV. Additionally, all conventional electric appliances are included.

How much did he owe before he purchased the SUV? Sadly, he makes no attempt to clarify. The vlogger estimates that he would spend about Rs. 1 per kilometre for the automobile after subtracting the cost of the Nexon EV from the cost of power.

So that's your response. Electric cars make a lot of sense from a running cost perspective. You save more money if you drive more. Spending the extra few lakhs on an electric car simply does not make sense for consumers with modest monthly operating costs, unless they are willing to pay more for being environmentally responsible. However, the more you drive, the easier it is to make up the difference in price between the hybrid version of the identical vehicle and the ordinary petrol one.
