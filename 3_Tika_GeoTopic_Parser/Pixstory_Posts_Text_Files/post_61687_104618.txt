AEW seems to be in full throttle trying to erase the existence of Maxwell Jacob Friedman MJF at the moment The latest move in the MJF vs AEW saga forced AEW to pull a WWE move as they completely removed traces of him from their roster page as well as the Shop store Adding salt to the wounds of AEW fans AEW did not release any video packages of MJF last night nor was he in any of the publicity photos sent out from AEW s weekly show AEW Dynamite MJF came out for the second segment of the show and delivered a scathing promo where he basted AEW and threw AEW President Tony Khan under the bus by alleging that Khan has a preference for signing former WWE names to big contracts MJF defended himself by claiming that he had to work his way from the ground up in the company while the EVPs were busy taking care of their friends or starting a war with WWE MJF blasted the recent ex WWE signings made by AEW by saying that he is disrespected as he has to financially compete against the released competition when it comes to securing contract dollars He also demanded his release before a profanity laced tirade got his microphone cut followed by a blackout to commercial and plenty of buzz on the internet
