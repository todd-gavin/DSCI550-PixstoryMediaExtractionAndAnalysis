One of my favorite rides to this day is Bumping cars. Whenever we go to an amusement park, I always make it a point to go on this ride with my friends and family. Moreover, this is one of the rides that I go on multiple times. No matter how long the wait or the line is, it is all worth seeing in one of these cars and hitting other cars, especially if it is my friends.
