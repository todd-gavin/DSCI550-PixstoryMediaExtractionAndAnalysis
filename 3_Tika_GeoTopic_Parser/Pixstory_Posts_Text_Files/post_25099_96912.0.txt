We are approaching the end of yet another Premier League season, as two North London clubs remain in the tussle for a Champions League berth. Arsenal are currently in the drivers' seat, two points above Tottenham Hotspur, who have 58 points to their name, with five games still remaining.

Both teams have a couple of tricky fixtures to follow, with Tottenham having as many as three of them. It all starts with a home game against Leicester City in the coming weekend, followed by a trip to the fortress, Anfield. However, the fixture which is probably going to decide as how the top 4 shapes up is the North London Derby, which will be played in the second week of May.

Tottenham Hotspur claimed four back to back wins in the Premier League, before their defeat to Brighton a couple of weeks ago. They dropped further points last weekend, after being held to a 0-0 draw by Brentford. One particular sign of worry for Antonio Conte is that Spurs have lacked creativity in the final third off late. Harry Kane has gone without scoring a single goal in the last five league outings, despite playing a part in the buildup of several goals. 

Given the stage of the season we are in, any more slip ups will cost the North London side dearly, as the margin for error has drastically reduced. As for Arsenal, even they do have a tricky run it fixtures, with away visits to Tottenham and West Ham lined up for them in the final month of the season.

Both teams did not compete in the Champions League this season, and they will be desperate to get back into Europe's most competitive league. Arsenal have claimed two big wins against Chelsea and Manchester United in a span of just four days, which has handed them the advantage over their arch rivals.
