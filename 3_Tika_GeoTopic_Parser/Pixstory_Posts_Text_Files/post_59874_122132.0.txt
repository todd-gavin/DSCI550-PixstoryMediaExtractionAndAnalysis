Rahul Gandhi is currently addressing the media. The Congress leader criticised the BJP-led central government, saying, "Today there is no democracy in India." We are prohibited from speaking and protesting, and we are removed from the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. Our nation is ruled by a dictatorship, and democracy is dead.

Rahul Gandhi, the stated that India now does not have democracy and is governed by a four-person dictatorship in advance of the Congress party's nationwide protest against rising prices and unemployment on Friday. "Democracy is going away in India. In front of your eyes, what India has constructed brick by brick since it began nearly a century ago, is being demolished. Anyone who opposes the idea of the coming of a dictatorship is brutally attacked, imprisoned, incarcerated, and beaten up. This occurs after the Young Indian Limited office in the National Herald building was sealed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) two days prior on Wednesday.

We are currently witnessing the destruction of democracy, continued Rahul Gandhi. In front of your eyes, what India has constructed brick by brick since it began nearly a century ago, is being demolished. Anyone who opposes this theory of the coming of dictatorship is brutally attacked, imprisoned, incarcerated, and beaten up.

The reason the opposition parties aren't allowed to speak is because the administration doesn't want people to bring up issues like rising prices, unemployment, or social violence. "That is the only agenda of the government, and it is run to defend the interests of four to five people, and this dictatorship is operated in the interest of two to three large business people."

Rahul Gandhi also said that the BJP and RSS currently dominate every independent institution in India. "My duty is to fight against the RSS ideology, and I'm going to do it. The more I fight against it, the more I'll be attacked, and the harder I'll be attacked.
