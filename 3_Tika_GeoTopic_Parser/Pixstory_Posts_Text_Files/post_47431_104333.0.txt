A highly promising season ended in a vortex of mediocrity at the London stadium. David Moyes' West Ham team can feel extremely proud of the character they've shown to get to a European semi-final against all odds, and having competed till the very end in all domestic competitions as well. A 7th position finish in the Premier league will prove satisfactory but the Conference League spot isn't as pleasing considering the first half of their season.

Moyes had an incredibly talented squad at hand, and his boys have played some sizzling football too. At the end of the season, a second season in Europe — albeit having been relegated to the third tier of UEFA competitions will have left them in a spot of uncertainty before 2022-23 commences.

Season Overview:
West Ham United's Europa League campaign ended in the semi-final stage. Topping a group including Genk, Dinamo Zagreb and Rapid Vienna the Hammers were placed in a Round of 16 tie against Julen Lopetegui's Sevilla. Moyes mostly fielded a very strong lineup for these games, and they did well to see off the Spanish team 2-1. Olympique Lyon were next and West Ham were playing some of their best football at the time, Lyon stood no chance and lost 4-1 on aggregate.

The game that followed saw the culmination of their European aspirations at the hands of eventual champions Eintrantch Frankfurt. The German team scored in the very first minute of the first leg, and what followed were 180 well-contested minutes where West Ham eventually lost. Aaron Cresswell's red card and many other such injury absences may pose as moments of supposed misfortune but Moyes didn't do himself a favour with his team selection strategy.
