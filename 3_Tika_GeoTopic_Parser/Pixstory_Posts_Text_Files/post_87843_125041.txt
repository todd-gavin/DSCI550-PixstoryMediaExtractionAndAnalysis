Diet culture has created the perception that diet is an all or nothing thing That you are either on a diet or off of a diet This mindset leads to the idea that perfection is required to live a healthy life This idea of perfection makes dieting feel like a rodeo We try to hop on a diet and ride it for as long as we can hold on for For some a strong motivation can allow them to hold on for longer than others Regardless most people end up falling off of their diet feeling like a failure and returning to their previous way of eating Nutrition is not all or nothing and perfection is not required Living a healthy life is about changing your mindset and your behaviors so that healthy eating becomes a normal part of your every day life This doesn t mean you never eat bad food it it just means you get back to proper nutrition after the fact As simple as I make this sound it s not easy The foods that have become a standard part of our lives are delicious and addictive and swapping them out for whole food is not necessarily the easiest But it is worth it
