As a football fan, I often think that why before any transfer of a player, medical plays one of the crucial parts in the process and why sometimes football clubs reject the transfer of a player just because of poor medical results.

So today, I did some research and now I will discuss why medicals are so important before the transfer of a player.

The first step in the medical is to do a bit of warm-up before any player starts doing a Biodex Assessment which is designed to test the strength between muscle groups.

In Biodex Assessment, the player is strapped into a chair and required to extend his/her legs by kicking out before pulling it back to the starting position. This process will be repeated five times, then again but with more resistance.

After that, the player has to go through the V02 max test, which will assess the playerâ€™s aerobic fitness. This process will help the signing club to know about the player is the player ready to play in the first team or whether the player has to work with fitness staff to reach his/her fitness peak.

For V02 max test, players have to run on the treadmill at varying speeds while wearing a mask to determine aerobic capabilities.

After the first two tests, the medical team goes through them in more detail and starts examining each joint of the body and paying particular attention to the ankles, knees, and hips.

After the three steps, the medical team make the report of a report and gave it to the Sporting Director who is looking at all the signings of the club.

If the medical team gives a green light in a medical report which means that the player is all good and the football club can offer him/her a five-year contract but if the medical team gives red light to the football club then management has to tough call on a player transfer or give him a short contract with a guarantee of contract extension if the players remain fit.
