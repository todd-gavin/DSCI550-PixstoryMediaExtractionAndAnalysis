Earlier today, Alia Bhatt announced her pregnancy, and all hell broke loose on the internet where Alia was targeted for announcing her pregnancy two months after her wedding with Ranbir Kapoor. This isn't the first time when the internet was quick to demonize and abuse a woman for making a choice about her own life. Earlier this month, when Sonam Kapoor had shared photos from her pregnancy photoshoot, she was trolled for baring her body and more. That 'celebrities' with such stature and power are shamed for making choices about their own life, it points to a larger culture of how Indian society ostracizes women from all walks of life for breaking out of confines and norms designed for them. And one cannot begin to imagine how hard it comes down upon unmarried women making choices about their own life. How do you think we can counter this everyday imposition of societal 'norms' especially on women?
