" Dilwale dulhania le jayege " One of the most iconic bollywood films , has a bra scene in which SRK awkwardly , nervously picking up a bra that accidentally fell out from kajol's suitcase ! 
There is no difference in real life too ! Embarrassed much ? We always need dupattas , towel or any other fabric to cover up our drying undergarments ! ðŸ¥²
Despite widespread awareness , sadly there are still stigmas associated with women's hygiene !Â  Many even experience embarrassment while drying undergarments ! Yes , I'm serious ! Drying lingerie in open considered as a serious disgrace . In rural areas , women make sure that their underwear is kept hidden , either in the backyard , the bathroom , or hidden under a saree or a skirt . 
But are you aware of the dangers associated with not letting your undergarments dry in sun ? ðŸ¤”
Drying underpants in a closed surrounding can lead to bacterial growth ! The vagina is the most delicate part and requires very much care . Ringworm infection , urinary tract infection , and pubic skin diseases are just a few of the many illnesses that can be brought on by wet underwear . You canÂ  feel burning , redness , swelling , and itching . Drying undergarments in open can decrease chances of bacterial growth .
I refused to follow the cycle of shame women associate with their undergarments ! I mean how can anyone think like this , a woman feels no shame drying a big self - tailored undergarments of their spouses open in the sun , but when it comes to their own , women feel so embarrassed about it .
Why , i really wanna know why can't we dry our undergarments in open under the sun ? Why hide your bra ? What has it done to hide ? I feel bad for undergarments , all the other clothes always dry in sun , but undergarments in separate corner , all neglected !
But I know my undergarments matter . I just wanna say - dry undergarments without shame !âœ¨
