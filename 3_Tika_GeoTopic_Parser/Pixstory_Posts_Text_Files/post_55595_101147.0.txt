Offspring is the film for you if you're seeking for a lighthearted, funny romantic comedy set in Australia (specifically, Melbourne). If 18 seasons of Grey's Anatomy have taught us anything, it's that handsome physicians, a dysfunctional family, and charming people make for an unbeatable mix. 

The seven-season drama follows obstetrician Nina Proudman (Asher Keddie) as she navigates her early 30s. Nina's sister Billie Proudman (Kat Stewart) and Billie's on/off lover Mick are two standouts among the realistic, charming, and imperfect characters (Eddie Perfect). 

The aesthetic and script are as eccentric as the characters, with flashbacks, animations, and fantasy sequences - and fair warning, you'll have Nina's ringtone stuck in your brain after a few episodes.
