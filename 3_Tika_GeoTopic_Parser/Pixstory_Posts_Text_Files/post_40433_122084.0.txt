Leave your lips alone. Do not lick them. Ever. You need to stop having that habit right away. Saliva is not just water; it also has additional characteristics that are irritating to lips. It shouldn't be on your lips; it should be inside your mouth and there alone. Leave your lips alone if they are ragged, scratchy, or flaking! I mean it. I know it's tempting but avoid picking or biting at any loosened skin on your lips. Simply hydrate them with clean water, gently blot them dry, and then use lip balm as necessary (usually every few hours). Given a chance, lips heal quickly. They will naturally smooth out in a few days.

Lips only need care, not a treatment. Unless you have an infection or condition, you do not need to use extra products on it. Just get one lip balm and that's it. Stay hydrated, chapped lips are a sign that you're probably dehydrated. Keep your lips moisturized and that's it. You need nothing else. The scrubs and masks are great but they are not a requirement. You can use shea butter on your lips. In my experience it's the best balm for them!
