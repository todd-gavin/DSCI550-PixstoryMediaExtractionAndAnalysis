A 30-second long video clip of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi being felicitated with a gold chain is widely circulating on social media. It is being shared with the claim that the “sultan of Arab” welcomed Modi with a 170 tola (1982.71 grams) gold chain. This video is being shared in the context of the Prime Minister’s recent visit to the UAE, where he was received by the country’s President, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. This was the first meeting between PM Modi and the UAE President since the Gulf nation condemned now-suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma’s alleged derogatory remark targeting Prophet Muhammed.

Twitter user @chelamodika shared the video with a caption in Hindi saying that PM Modi was given a 170 tola chain.

The description of the video read, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi conferred the highest honour of the UAE #OrderOfZayed #PMModiInUAE #PMModiInAbuDhabi”. Taking this clue we performed a keyword search and came across various media reports about this event. According to reports, on August 24, 2019, the PM was honoured with the Order Of Zayed, by President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which is the UAE’s highest civil honour presented to kings, presidents and leaders.

The photos from this event were also tweeted by PM Modi on the same day.

We also found a document tweeted by NDTV in April 2019, which describes the medal as consisting “of a collar centred by a medallion holding the name of ‘Zayed’, the founding father of the United Arab Emirates.”
