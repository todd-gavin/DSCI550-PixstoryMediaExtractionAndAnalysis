One of the all time icons in the power metal movement and a heavy metal classic Blind Guardian needs few words to describe their music They can best be described as the metal bards of Middle Earth and their music full of fantasy and high ended epicness can attest to that statement It is incredibly hard for a band no matter how good to create an album so late in their career which can rival some of their peak material With that said coming with their th album The God Machine the German power metal veterans have created one of their finest offerings that even rivals their all time greatest albums likes of Somewhere Far Beyond Imaginations From The Other Side Nightfall In Middle Earth A Night At The Opera and Beyond The Red Mirror Blind Guardian s music has always possessed a certain complexity and depth to it which most power metal bands like DragonForce and Sonata Arctica have been unable to capture The same statement is true here A focused and rather streamlined effort in comparison to their earlier more progressive efforts The God Machine is a rather stripped down affair being only an hour in length It is like a combination of Beyond The Red Mirror with Somewhere Far Beyond with the Queen and Iron Maiden influence not shining so much here Deliver Us From Evil is a great and exciting opener and builds up your expectations for the rest of the album Needless to say it does not disappoint for the rest of the album is even more epic and awesome than this sexy opener There is some serious heavy riffing and speed here with songs such as Damnation Secrets Of The American Gods and Violent Shadows while also bringing in some great symphonic touches bringing in that great epic feel with songs such as Destiny In holding back some of their studio theatricality the band have nonetheless managed to maintain their trademark grandiosity Not overstaying its welcome The God Machine is both a thunderous display of power metal and a highly focused matured affair being one of Blind Guardian s best and most coherent efforts Score
