introductionA beautiful nazm by Majaz. It addresses his hopelessness about the inequities and injustices that he encountered in his life.Such is the permanence of his verse, that these sentiments are still as valid today as they were then. Majaz was a tortured and fiery genius, who burnt bright but all too brief - he died alone in a bar, depressed and disappointed with life.Awaara means a vagabond or a drifter; someone who roams aimlessly.Credit - https://omershafee.wordpress.com/2013/12/15/awaara-by-asrar-ul-haq-majaz-1911-1955/YouTube channel link - https://youtu.be/xyGA7e8fDkg
