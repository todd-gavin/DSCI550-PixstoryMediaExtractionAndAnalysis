Constitutional advisor to Bikaner continues....

On or about 19th or 20th March I came to Delhi and went to pay my respects to Sardar Patel who was recuperating after a heart attack. He was not allowed to move out of his bed by his physician. 

His daughter, Miss Manibehn, very kindly permitted me to pay my respects to the Sardar in his bed room with instructions that I should not stay there very long. 

The Sardar, of course, already knew that I intended to join Bikaner. His Highness, the Maharaja of Bikaner, it seems, had already consulted him. I made enquiries about his health and told him that the iron man of India had no business to fall ill or to have heart attacks. He told me that I had his permission to join the service of Bikaner for the time being, but he gave me a warning that I had now to deal with a Rajasthan prince and that I should be very careful and prudent in conducting the affairs of the Bikaner State. 

With his blessings I took leave of him and started on a new experience in my career in the State of Bikaner. I stayed in the Bikaner House at new Delhi during my stay in Delhi and was provided with a special railway saloon from Delhi to Bikaner. 

As soon as I reached Bikaner, a telegram arrived from Mr. Shankar, 

Private Secretary to Sardar Patel, to the following effect: 

“Sardar has an alternative assignment for you. Please do not commit yourself about Bikaner’s appointment finally. Come here immediately. ”
