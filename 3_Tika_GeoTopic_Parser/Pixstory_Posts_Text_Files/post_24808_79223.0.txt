The 2022 edition of the AFC Women's Asian Cup couldn't have provided any better drama that unfolded in the semifinals of the competition. Having already qualified for the 2023 Women's World Cup, the four semifinalists in the form of South Korea, Philippines, China and Japan took their chances to be the continent's best. 



South Korea already did damage when they knocked out hot favorites Australia in the quarterfinal stages but it is their opposition, the Philippines who deserves an entire story of their own in the tournament. Ranked 64th in the FIFA ranking, the 'Feisty ladies' defeated Thailand (38) and Chinese Taipei (39) on the course to be in the last four. Although the fairy tale ended at the semifinals following a 2-0 loss to South Korea, Phillipines have earned the golden ticket to the World Cup where they can renew their surprises. So Yun Cho and Hwa Yeon Son scored in the first half to lift South Korea into the finals giving them a chance to condemn the narrative of a great side that fails to win silverware. 



The game of the round, in no doubt, was the titanic clash between China and Japan and it didn't fail to live up to its expectations. In the end, record-holders China triumphed 4-3 on penalties to eliminate the defending champions and favorites Japan from the tournament. Despite China's early pressure, Japan took the lead through Riko Ueki before the Steel Roses roared back in the second half with Wu Cheng Shu scoring within a minute of the restart to make it 1-1. 


Japan missed some glaring chances then after to keep the scoreline level after normal time but felt to have done all in the extra period, Ueki being decisive again with a stunning header from a free-kick. That was simply not all as China's captain and striker Shanshan Wang converted in the 119th minute of the game before dispatching the winning penalty to take her nation to dreamland. Leading from the front indeed!
