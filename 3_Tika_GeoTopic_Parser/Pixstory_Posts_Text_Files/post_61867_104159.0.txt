On a latest interview on the “Impaulsive” podcast with infamous YouTuber Logan Paul, Liam Payne 
formerly of One Direction did not hold back on his true feelings about his time in the boy band. 
“It was well-known within the band that I don’t like taking shit,” stated Payne, with an obvious glare 
on his face. “There was one moment where there was an argument backstage and one member, in 
particular, threw me up a wall. So I said to him, ‘If you don’t remove those hands there’s a high 
likelihood you’ll never use them again.'” 
He wisely chose not to disclose with whom the scuffle was, however Payne slyly went on to discuss 
Zayn Malik’s past controversies including his Twitter feud with Logan’s brother, Jake Paul, in 2020. 
“She (Gigi Hadid) tweeted something about get yourself a respectful man or something. That one 
didn’t age very well,” said Payne, referring to allegations against Zayn in which he reportedly shoved 
Hadid’s mother during an altercation. 
Payne said there are “many reasons why I dislike Zayn,” but then tried to do damage control by 
adding, “There are many reasons why I’ll always, always be on his side. If I had had to go through 
what he went through — with his growth and whatever else… My parents are overly supportive to 
the point where it’s annoying at times. Zayn had a different upbringing in that sense.” 
He also discussed his solo career in comparison to the other ex-members, claiming his 2017 debut 
solo single, “Strip That Down,” “outsold everybody within the band.” To which One Direction fans 
responded on Twitter, sharing screenshots proving songs such as Harry Styles’ “Watermelon Sugar” 
and Malik’s “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” had surpassed “Strip That Down” with over a billion 
streams each. 
He also details his 2015 feud with Justin Bieber (which he chalked up to having too many drinks on 
an Instagram live), admitted to “still not knowing who I am, I replicate different people on a daily 
basis.”
