16th of April 2014 a date that no one from South Korea can ever forget. The 6825-ton Sewol ferry carrying 476 people on board sank in southwestern island of Jindo coast killed 304 people. Out of all those killed, there were 250 teenagers from Dawon High School in Ansan who were in their school trip to Jeju. The tragedy happened when the Sewol which overloaded with more than 3600 tons of cargo took a sharp turn and capsized. And it gets worse once the tragedy refused to be revealed for many political reasons. The non-Korean citizen who have been following the news on the tragedy was feeling so grateful that  after nearly 3 years waiting, the vessel has finally raised up by the Korea Government in 23rd March 2017. But at the same time we got great chills from the fact it happened after BTS released their “Spring Day” song.
As a fan of BTS, it was actually fun to see the theories and facts the fans came out with when they watch the music video that BTS released. We admit that many BTS MVs contains hidden meaning and stories that fans need to crack the codes given. The first time listening to the song, generally we get to see the message that BTS would like to convey in “Spring Day” is the feeling of longing to someone, a friend that they had lost. Many fans were saying the MV was actually referred to a novel name ‘The One Who Walk Away From Omelas’ also a movie “Snowpiercer”. And some said it related to Sewol story itself. We don’t have any right or great abilities to write a legendary theories to show you as there are many fans already did it. You can refer to the best 2 i have encountered .
