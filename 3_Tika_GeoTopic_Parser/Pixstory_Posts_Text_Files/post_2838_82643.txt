Biden faces a dilemma and White House plans to take the safer option The question is In crafting a policy on environment should racism be stressed explicitly During the campaign and as president Biden has spoken of the disproportionate burden that minorities especially Blacks carry when it comes to environmental problems as shown by research However in fine tuning his environmental policy to racial equity he would face legal challenges So the safe bet is to do what is needed but in a color blind way Within days of entering office Biden had announced a Justice Initiative to deliver of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments to disadvantaged communities which were meant to be identified on the race parameter too Now Brenda Mallory chairwoman of the White House Council of Environmental Quality that is designing the new environmental policy says they are trying to set up a framework that will survive and yet also help people mitigate impacts I feel that we can do that based on race neutral criteria It s tricky but can be done employing non racial demographic criteria income joblessness air pollution levels to identify towns and neighborhoods that need support The new compromise approach on environment can be a trend setter for other sectors too amid a debate on the role of race in public policy Last year when Biden wanted to forgive loan payments for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers as part of a billion initiative to address centuries of racial injustice in farming a lower court blocked the effort following a challenge from a white farmer The Supreme Court is going to hear a case challenging the use of race as a factor in college admissions Given its conservative majority the year old precedent may be reversed Apart from the courts there are political reasons too in this year of mid term elections As Republicans seem to capitalize on the apparent grievances of the majority community Democrats are hesitant in outright backing the other side except in carefully selected gestures like the pledge of nominating the first Black woman to the Supreme Court Also see
