Liverpool continue to remain the busiest team in Europe at the moment, given that they are still fighting for the quadruple. After a victory against Aston Villa, the Reds now face Chelsea in the FA Cup Final on Saturday, in what will be a repeat of the Carabao Cup Final. Liverpool have made several successful signings in the past few seasons, ever since the arrival of Jurgen Klopp.

Now, with the season coming to a conclusion, clubs will be rushing to the market to make some good reinforcements. According to Fabrizio Romano, Liverpool have already confirmed their first summer signing, with an announcement to be made in the coming few days. Fulham midfielder, Fabio Carvalho is expected to join Liverpool for a fee of around £5m plus £2.7m add-ons.
 
Fabio Carvalho claimed the Championship title with Fulham, which saw them being promoted back to the Premier League. The 19-year-old had quite a successful season, as he scored 10 goals, and delivered eight assists in this title winning campaign. His addition will surely come as a major boost for Liverpool, as the likes of Harvey Elliot and Curtis Jones are some next generational talents to go by.

“By the way, the first signing will be Fabio Carvalho: the official announcement is coming in the next few days, Fulham will receive £5m plus £2.7m add-ons,” Romano said to Caught Offside.

Liverpool are expected to have a rather subtle transfer window, with the focus being on the renewal of Salah and Mane’s contracts at Anfield. Even, James Milner is likely to extend his stay at Liverpool for another year. As for now, Jurgen Klopp and Co. will remain focussed on the task at hand, which includes two crucial finals, and two Premier League matches to end a long season.
