Jonny Bairstow has scored England's fastest test century since 1902 to lead England to victory over New Zealand by five wickets, clinching the three-match series with a test to spare.

The Yorkshireman smashed 136 in 92 balls, reaching three figures off 77, one more than Gilbert Jessop required in 1902 against Australia at The Oval.

England had been set 299 to win on Tuesday in a minimum 63 overs. It was a record run chase at Trent Bridge, but roared on by a full house which had been admitted for free, they got there with 13 overs to spare.

The overall boundary count, 250 with 24 sixes, was the highest in test history and the run total, 1,601 was the highest in a Nottingham test.

The match was the perfect example of the positive brand of cricket new skipper Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum want to play.

"It was set up for the way we want to play; run into the danger rather than back away and stand still," Stokes said. 

"We wanted to put as much pressure as possible on the New Zealand attack, and once Jonny gets his eye in there's no stopping him."

New Zealand skipper Tom Latham was standing in for Kane Williamson who was ruled out with COVID-19. 

"I don't think I've seen an onslaught in a test match like it," Latham said.

At 4-93 mid-afternoon, with first innings centurions Ollie Pope (18) and Joe Root (3) both out cheaply, 299 seemed a stiff target.

Bairstow and skipper Ben Stokes then added 46 in 52 balls to take England to 4-139 at tea with 38 overs remaining and the run-rate 4.21.

After tea, New Zealand decided to try and bounce Bairstow out despite the short leg-side boundary. The next 16 balls then went for 42 runs, including 29 to Bairstow.

New Zealand eventually changed tactics, but it was too late. The first nine overs after tea went for 102.

When Bairstow was caught behind off the persevering Trent Boult (3-94) the pair had added 179 in 20.1 overs.
