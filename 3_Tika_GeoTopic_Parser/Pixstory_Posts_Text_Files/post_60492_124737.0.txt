1. Seo Joon confronts Se Ri about her lies in “SKY Castle”
Seo Joon has a heated confrontation with his sister Se Ri the supposed golden child who got into Harvard. Except wait, no, that was a huge lie and she’s been faking it all along. Seo Joon has only ever wanted to make his parents proud. Now his sister has utterly humiliated them, and at first, he can’t understand why. It’s a heartbreaking moment when you realize that your perfect older sibling is actually full of flaws and maybe even be more messed up than you are.

2. Ri Ohn and Ri Jin do a Team Rocket chant in “Kill Me, Heal Me”
Oh Ri Ohn and Oh Ri Jin prioritize their sibling bond above all. Ri Jin went through her fair share of trauma and Ri Ohn became the reason she could survive it. But you would never guess it if you saw them in action. It’s a rare moment when they’re not pulling each other’s hair or tackling each other to the ground.

3. In Ha hits up In Ho for cash in “Cheese in the Trap”
All his life, In Ho has been cleaning up after his sister In Ha . The bolder and brasher of the two, In Ha has no qualms about ferociously pursuing the life of luxury she thinks she deserves, even if it means manipulating In Ho to achieve her aims. She’s not above guilt-tripping him to give her cash by reminding him of the time he ran away from their abusive aunt without her, even though she knows how scared he was back then.
If only In Ha were entirely evil, it would be easy for In Ho (and for us) to hate her. But she’s also the only constant in In Ho’s lonely life, and she loves him more than anyone else in the world. There’s a painful contradiction in this sibling bond that’s just as hurtful as it is healing.
