Cristiano Ronaldo is increasingly separate at home in the Manchester United dressing room The Portuguese would like to leave to play for a team involved in the Champions League and never misses an opportunity to show his discontent on Sunday after making his debut with the Red Devils shirt this pre-season playing the first of the friendly against Rayo Vallecano the Portuguese left Old Trafford prematurely and was not interested in the rest of the match CR was not the only one to leave but obviously his behavior had a greater echo than that of Diogo who also left earlier but without having pitch Coach Erik Ten Hag vented to a Dutch TV microphone I will not let what happened unacceptable for everyone involved We are a team this means you have to stay until the end of the match
