Romelu Lukaku has begun his second adventure at Inter Yesterday began with a dawn landing at Milan airport culminating in the signing of the new contract that binds him to the nerazzurri Speaking to InterTv the Belgian striker promised great commitment to return to be appreciated by the fans Coming back here a very strong emotion I promise hard work, commitment and sacrifice to help Inter win and continue on the path taken last season I will be able to regain everyone&#39;s trust and give new joy to the fans Inter have given me so much and now I hope just to do better than before For me it&#39;s like going home My family has always had a great time in Milan from the very first day Lukaku underlined the role of president Zhang in the return to Inter Much of the credit goes to the president because there he always believed and pushed right to the end for everything to go well But I also have to thank my teammates I&#39;ve already heard from almost all of them They too worked hard to get me back and I will always be grateful to them Finally, a thought also for the role I had from the coach Simone Inzaghi The fans convinced me first of all then also the coach We were always in contact throughout last season and I think he did a great job with the team I can&#39;t wait to be part of the project too I have great desire to work with him because he made the team play at a very high level
