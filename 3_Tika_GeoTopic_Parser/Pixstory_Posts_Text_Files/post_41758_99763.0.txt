The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has dispatched recovery equipment to the English city of Birmingham, including ice baths and specialised compression devices, for use by the country's competitors in this year's Commonwealth Games. 

Insidethegames reported that the apparatus, which weighs more than 350 kilos, is due to arrive in late June, with the Games taking place from July 28 to August 8. 

The AIS intends to establish a base of operations at the University of Birmingham. 

Steph Shell, the AIS's senior adviser for the rest hub, will oversee Australia's recovery team at Birmingham 2022, and she highlighted why the programme is so important.

"We need to pack for all the possible contingencies," Shell said.

"For some sports we might be able to have a one-stop shop with ice baths, compression and nutrition in the one location, but for others they may need to be spread out over five or six possible sites at the competition or accommodation settings.

"In a Games context, where athletes need to back-up performances in a short timeframe, the recovery process is an essential element of planning and preparation.

"Our recovery efforts help reduce soreness, enhance physical and psychological recovery, reduce thermal strain by decreasing core body temperature, which can be particularly important for some of our Para athletes, and enhance readiness to perform."
