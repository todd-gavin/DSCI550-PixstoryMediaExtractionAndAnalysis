Actor Kartik Aaryan threatened to 'walk out of' his upcoming film Shehzada if movie was released in theatres.

"The makers of Shehzda were not keen to release the Hindi version in cinemas. Also, Kartik Aaryan said if the movie was released in theatres, he would walk out of   the film, which would have caused Shehzada producers a loss of $40 crores. It was extremely unprofessional of him." 

"I have known Shehzada producers for 10 years. I cannot have people who are close to me losing $40 crores, so I dropped it. By doing this, I ended up losing $20 crores. I spent *2 crores only on dubbing. I wanted this film to be bigger than Pushpa: The Rise. If I do not release the film I lose money, so now I am releasing it on my channel. I would not have done anything for Kartik Aaryan, I only did this because of Allu Arvind. Why would I do this for a Bollywood hero? I don't know him." said produce Manish Shah.
