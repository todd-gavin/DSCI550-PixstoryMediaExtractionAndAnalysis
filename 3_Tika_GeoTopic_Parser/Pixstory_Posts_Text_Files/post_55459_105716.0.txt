We live in a world today where if you told someone that high cholesterol is good and that foods rich in cholesterol are healthy, they would look at you like you've got three heads! 

However, many people do not understand the purpose of cholesterol.

Ultimately, cholesterol is an antioxidant which aids in reducing inflammation throughout the body. It is normally found at the site of injury and this is why it is blamed for being dangerous. But this is like blaming an ambulance for being at the site of an accident. It doesn't make any sense when you think about it and understand the role of cholesterol in the human body.

3. Cook with Herbs and Spices. 
4. Eat a Variety of Unsaturated Fats. 
5. Avoid Artificial Trans Fats.
