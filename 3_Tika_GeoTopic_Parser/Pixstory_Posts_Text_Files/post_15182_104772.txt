Esophageal cancer is one of the neoplasms with the worst prognosis In Italy in men and women new cases were estimated Over half of the diagnoses are in an advanced stage when the disease is more difficult to treat here the need for new weapons capable of controlling the disease in the long term A possible result thanks to immunotherapy as evidenced by the updated data of the CheckMate study Squamous cancer of the esophagus is a disease for years considered devoid of truly effective options explains Sara Lonardi FF Director of the Oncology at the Istituto Oncologico Veneto IRCCS of Padua The CheckMate study involved people with advanced or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus that had never been treated before The primary analysis had already highlighted the benefit in overall survival which almost doubled thanks to the immunotherapy regimens in first-line versus chemotherapy alone Specifically, one-year survival in the patient population with tumor PDL expression equal to or greater than switched from standard of care to combination immunotherapy and chemotherapy and to dual immunotherapy The new continuous analysis Dr. Lonardi confirm how the immunological molecule nivolumab associated with chemotherapy and the dual immunotherapy consisting of nivolumab plus ipilimumab can change clinical practice in the treatment of advanced stage disease As in many studies of immunotherapy in various neoplasms also in esophageal cancer the study demonstrates a benefit of this prolonged approach throughout the history of the disease with a group of patients that has a long-term survival advantage the so-called tail of the curves Furthermore, the new analysis demonstrates that the risk of progression to lines of therapy following the first PFS was reduced by with the combination nivolumab chemotherapy and with nivolumab and ipilimumab compared to the standard chemotherapy alone arm Furthermore, the excellent tolerability of this approach is confirmed
