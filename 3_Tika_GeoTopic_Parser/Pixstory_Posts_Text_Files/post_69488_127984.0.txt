The Warwan Valley is a hidden gem of unspoiled natural grandeur, with an average elevation of more than 85,000 feet above sea level. About 50 kilometres south of Anantnag is the village that serves as its starting point. Thirteen settlements make up this picturesque valley, with three on the Warwan River's left bank and ten on its right. Warwan Valley is an exquisitely lovely long but narrow valley, with a width of no more than 3 kilometres. This 30-kilometer-long valley is home to magnificent waterfalls, great expanses of lush meadows and pastures, massive cedar trees, enormous sections of densely forested terrain, and a variety of other breathtaking natural settings that captivate tourists. Travelers that traverse it to explore its interior are continuously refreshed by the cool wind.
