El Clasico 2022: Real Madrid vs. Barcelona in the UEFA Women's Champions League Quarter-Final Date and Time
2021/22 UWCL Tickets are no longer available.

 Barcelona and Real Madrid will play the second leg of their UEFA Women's Champions League quarterfinal on March 30 at Camp Nou, according to a statement released by the Catalan club on Monday. The first leg will take place on March 22nd at 8:00 p.m. in Spain and March 23rd.

It will be the women's team's second competitive game at the 100,000-seater stadium, and their first with fans. According to the Catalan club, the el-Clasico tickets have sold out, with over 80,000 tickets sold in only three days.

When and where can you watch Real Madrid versus Barcelona live stream and on TV?

Every game in this season's new-look UEFA Women's Champions League will be broadcast live on streaming platform DAZN as well as YouTube starting in the group stage.

For the first two seasons of the ground-breaking four-year deal (2021/22 and 2022/23) fans around the world will be able to watch all 61-group stage matches on DAZN and for free on DAZN's YouTube channel, with the exception of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) – where rights include clips and highlights – and China and its territories.

Right now, form favours Barcelona: their extraordinary season (23 games, 23 victories, 131 goals scored, and only six goals conceded) implies they may claim the league title this week, either if Atletico and Real Sociedad drop points before Saturday or if they beat Real Madrid this Sunday.

Alex Kirkland (Real Madrid) and Sam Marsden (Barcelona) go down the game from both angles to prepare you ready for these seismic games.
