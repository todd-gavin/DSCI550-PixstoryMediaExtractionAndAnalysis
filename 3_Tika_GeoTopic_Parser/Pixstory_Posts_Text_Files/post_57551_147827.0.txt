His last wish was to see monsters and people showed up in costumes.
This is the story of 5-year-old Alexandros Hirdakis, who was diagnosed with brain cancer when he was not even a year old.
His parents were devastated by the news yet did everything in their power to save their child's life.
But the treatment that kept him alive for four years reached its verge and, unfortunately, couldn't help to save the child.
Recently, the parents learned that he had just a few weeks left with him, so they wanted to make all his wishes come true in every possible way.
Strangely child's last wish was to see the monsters as he loved the haunted house even when he was a toddler.
The wish was fulfilled by a close family friend Paula Tzouanakis Anderson who planned to bring Halloween to him without making the travel.
“Kira mentioned to me that Alex wanted to see monsters. So while driving home, I said, ‘We have to re-create some sort of Halloween for him.’ Tzouanakis Anderson said. 
She posted a heartfelt note on Alexandros's situation on a local Facebook group and requested that neighbours appear in costumes.
Surprisingly the post reached many people, and many got ready to support the child. 
As around 1000 people appeared in the costumes parade, Alexandros's parents were surprised and happy. 
The child watched the whole parade with so much excitement and awe.
This kind deed made up Alexandros and his family's day and filled their hearts with gratitude.
Alex's father, later expressing his happiness, said, “We’re very blessed to live in a community like this."
