 Abstract Background and Aim Although resting heart rate RHR is associated with prevalence and incidence of diabetes whether it is associated with undiagnosed diabetes is still unclear We aimed to investigate whether the RHR is associated with the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in a large Korean national dataset Methods and Results The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from to were used After screening participants were included in this study The odds ratios and confidence intervals CIs for undiagnosed diabetes were calculated using multivariable adjusted logistic regression analyses Analyses showed that participants with a RHR of bpm showed a CI and times CI higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes for men and women respectively than those with a RHR of lt bpm The linear dose response analyses showed that each bpm increment in RHR was associated with a CI and times CI higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes for men and women respectively In the stratified analyses the positive association between RHR and the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was tended to be stronger among those who were younger age lt years and lean BMI lt kg m Conclusions Elevated RHR was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in Korean men and women independent of demographic lifestyle and medical factors Accordingly the value of RHR as a clinical indicator and health marker especially in reducing the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is suggestible
