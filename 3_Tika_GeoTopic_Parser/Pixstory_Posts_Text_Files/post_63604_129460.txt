Ever since its release a lot of new games have drawn heavy inspiration from FromSoftware s action RPG masterpiece Dark Souls Coming from publisher Team developer OverBorder Studio has created Thymesia an action adventure role playing game seeking to create a challenge on the model of Dark Souls Sekiro and Bloodborne The game released its official launch trailer on th August and from the initial gameplay just like Mortal Shell the game is a strong tribute to Dark Souls and Bloodborne keeping their spirit alive The game is brutal fast paced and unforgiving in its challenge giving high levels of reward upon success and even higher levels of frustration With obvious influences from Bloodborne Thymesia is about a lone warrior wandering into a plague stricken world where everyone infected has turned into a maddened bloodthirsty killer With a similar atmosphere to Bloodborne like most Souls games Thymesia drops you into the middle of a weird bleak situation with little explanation leaving it to you to figure out the whole mystery as to what you re facing when you explore the world its people obstacles and enemies Taking place in a kingdom called Hermes the world has been ravaged by a deathly plague that has mercilessly infected people and animals mutating them into atrocious monsters Until now Hermes had managed to deal with the plague through alchemy but something now they are running out of rope as Hermes has succumbed and nobody knows what to do The game s protagonist is Corvus a sort of superpowered fighter with a connection to the alchemists trying to cure the plague whose job in Thymesia is to remember what happened Each level in the game is actually a lengthy recollection of a past event and Corvus has previously ventured through three different locales in the kingdom and killed the monsters found there
