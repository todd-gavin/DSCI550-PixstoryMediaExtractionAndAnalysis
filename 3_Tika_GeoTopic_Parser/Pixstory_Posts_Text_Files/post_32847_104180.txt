The trophy between the winners of the European Championship and the South American Cup goes to Argentina At Wembley, Mancini&#39;s Azzurri resist for minutes on a par with the Albiceleste formation then Messi takes the chair and there is none left for none Lautaro Martinez and Di Maria in the first half and Dybala in the added time of the second they fix the result on the final in a match that was at times tense which almost never saw the Azzurri in the match Perhaps it is no coincidence that the Azzurri did not qualify for the World Cup
