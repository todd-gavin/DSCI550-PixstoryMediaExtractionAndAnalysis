One of the most interesting things about Bollywood is this notion of negative topics or negative characters For example Langda Tyagi in Omkara played by Saif Ali Khan is a negative character He is an antihero Similarly there are negative topics gambling crime infidelity I think it s a bit of an absurd demarcation honestly since these are as much a part of life as the romance and the positivity I watched Gehraiyaan over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised I d read a lot of negative reviews beforehand but I found it to be a somewhat subtle and nuanced look at the subject Deepika Padukone s character SPOILERS falls into a pattern of cheating on her boyfriend because she s deeply unhappy something that is fairly realistic I think The movie is careful not to condemn the cheating itself it merely presents it without commentary It s something that I wish more Bollywood movies would do In the past when I ve seen movies like Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna K Jo s take on rich people having extramarital affairs it s been somewhat cringeworthy The act of physical infidelity is accompanied by a blaring gloomy soundtrack as if the movie is trying to say how unforgivable cheating is But I don t look to movies to shape my value system I just want to see movies with realistic things to say about the human condition Perhaps Bollywood should make more of those
