Local sources in Balkh province confirm that the Taliban have removed the word "university" from the plaque of the province's state university.

The pictures published on social networks show that the old plaque of Balkh University, in which the name of the university was written in both Persian and Pashto, was taken down and a new plaque was installed instead of removing the word "university".

Social media users have reacted widely to the move.
Social media users have called the move "a continuation of systematic discrimination against the Persian language" and "systematic anti-Persianism."

"If my mother tongue shakes the foundations of your government, it means that you have established your government on my soil," Sarah Ahmadi wrote on her Twitter page.

Ali Sajjad Molaei, a Twitter user, said, "If you think that by changing the signboard of Balkh University, you can eliminate the Persian language, you are wrong."

This is not the first time the controversy over the word "university" has become controversial in Afghanistan.

A few years ago, Basir Babi, a state television reporter in Mazar-e-Sharif, was reprimanded by the Afghan Ministry of Information and Culture for using the word university.

The controversy over the use of the word "university" led to widespread protests at Balkh University.
After this conflict, Balkh University did not have a board for a long time, and finally the board of this university was written in three languages, Persian, Pashto and English.

There has been a similar dispute over the use of the word "university" in Herat province in recent years. The controversy caused Herat University to have no billboards until the last days of the fall of the previous Afghan government, but with the arrival of the Taliban regime, a billboard was finally installed on the university's gate that ignored the Persian language.
