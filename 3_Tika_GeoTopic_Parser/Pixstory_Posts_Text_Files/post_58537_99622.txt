For my summer activities I go swimming in my pool I go bicycling with my family I love to go camping and I also go on my trampoline a lot I play with my dogs too I get my friends over for sleepovers and playdates They are always really fun I visit many farms over the summer and when ever I go there I ride the same pony that has white with black spots on it and I really love their horse I Love summer
