Anthony Elanga ranks 0.45 in key passes, and 1.25 in progressive passes. Troy Deeney ranks the highest with 3.4 in defense splitting passes and 3.5 in progressive passes. When compared to players from the top 5 league, he ranks pretty poorly with him ranking only 0.43 in key passes per 90 having percentile of only 1, and 0.99 per 90 in progressive passes, having percentile of only 1%. He needs to work on his creativity if he has any chance of catching other players.

Elanga ranks pretty poor in passing and crossing into the 6 yards box as the passes either get blocked, or intercepted or he gets dispossessed by the opponents. He ranks only 0.2 in passes into the 6 yard box and 0.25 in crosses. Mahrez takes shoulder above him. 

Elanga ranks very high in defensive actions. He usually tracks back and helps out his fellow compatriots out of danger.
