Let s ask ourselves a question What does Independence mean to you On August India will memorialise its th anniversary of independence There are numerous ways to respond to this question but for me the word Independence is loaded with meaning and relates with people in various ways Politically speaking the term implies that a nation or a group of people are gaining freedom from a government or another nation This has happened on several occasions throughout history The second interpretation is more emotionally charged and indicative of an individual s total independence An independent person may be themselves say what they want to say do what they want to do and believe what they want without external pressure or direction However independence means to me that people are free to express themselves and to make use of that freedom to become better learn and engage in daily life Independence shouldn t be used as a justification for taking over For me freedom is being independent Freedom that does not break away us from our ideals but instead satisfies your desire to grow as a person We are empowered to voice our minds and set ourselves free from ignorance by our feeling of individuality Independence to me is about experiencing life to the fullest To have fun and strive to be your best each and every day of your life It involves taking a brave powerful stance Independence to me is living a peaceful life and taking responsibility for our actions Yes becoming independent comes with horrifying responsibility Independence involves feeling responsible for my own decisions and their results It s like if you may choose the colours and draw whatever you want in a painting of your life Finding independence shows maturity and resourcefulness It is a hidden treasure You have the opportunity to build and maintain trust with others as a result of this Being independent means being confident in oneself while still being able to acknowledge one s dependency on others
