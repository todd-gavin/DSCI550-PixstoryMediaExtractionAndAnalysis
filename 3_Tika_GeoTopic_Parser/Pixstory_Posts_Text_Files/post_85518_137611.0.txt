Iodine Deficiecy Disorders Control Program is a public health success story.
According to India Iodine Survey carried out in 2018 - 2019, 76% of population is consuming adequately ( more or equal to 15 parts per million (15 PPM).
While 93 % of population is consuming iodised salt.
In 1984, only 5% of population was consuming iodised salt !!!
As per the NFHS-5 (2019-21), the nutrition indicators for children under 5 years have marginally improved as compared with NFHS-4 (2015-16). Stunting has reduced from 38.4% to 35.5%, Wasting has reduced from 21.0% to 19.3% and underweight prevalence has reduced from 35.8% to 32.1%. 
Poshan Abhiyaan though launched in March 2018 took a year or so for states to initiate actions on several components especially ICT-RTM, ILA, and SBCC. Further guidance for some of the components like performance incentives and innovations was released later in 2019. So, considering this, it would too early to evaluate Poshan Abhiyaan based on NFHS-5 data which was collected during the initial stages of implementation of Poshan Abhiyaan. 
Further impact of nutrition interventions cannot be expected immediately and in a situation which complicated by COVID-19 pandemic, with its direct or indirect effect, it is not fare to evaluate the efforts at this early stage. However, Poshan Abhiyaan has definitely provided the required push to the nutrition agenda in the country, with clear targets and convergent action plans in place. 

We had in India, first case of Covid - 19 reported from Kerala in 1 st week of February, 2020 
Soon we had lockdown.
POSHAN ABHIYAN was not doing optimally. Teething problems.
The journey of thousand miles, begins with the first step !
The National Nutrition Mission was announced by Honourable PM Narendra Modi on 8 th March 2918 , in Rajasthan.
Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi was the Union Minister of Women & Child Development.
To me, it was a historic occasion.
Three pillars of social and economic development are HEN !
