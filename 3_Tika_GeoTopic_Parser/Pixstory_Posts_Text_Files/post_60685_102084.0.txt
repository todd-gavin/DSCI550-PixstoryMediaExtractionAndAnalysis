Hi Everyone! 

I’m Nimisha Bansal , a 20 year old trying to picture YOLO at every stage of life.

I like reading fiction novels.
Colleen Hoover (author) is my favorite, even though I haven’t read a lot of her books yet. Maybe because of her eloquent touch in writing style, or because of her empathy, she’s an easy person to fall for.

I also try singing and can play guitar amateurly.

Most of my free-time is spent binge-watching friends on Netflix, and I sometimes doodle too. My usual days atm begin with contemplations on whether to spend more time on college or Pinterest or a good read. 

Hoping to connect with you all🌻
