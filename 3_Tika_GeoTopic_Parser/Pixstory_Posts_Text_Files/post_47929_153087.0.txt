By Medha Dutta Yadav New Delhi: Recently a 19-year-old student from Patna, Riya Kumari, was publicly shamed by an IAS officer when she raised the issue of lack of access to sanitary napkins for girls. The student asked why the government could not provide sanitary pads worth Rs 20-30 despite having the provisions.Since the incident, the IAS officer has issued an apology and hygiene brands have come forward to help the girl with a year’s supply of sanitary napkins.While Riya Kumari is being deservedly applauded, the larger issue here her question throws up needs to be highlighted and addressed—the lack of menstrual hygiene available to India’s women.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has introduced a scheme for the promotion of menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls in the age group of 10-19 years in rural areas.The scheme was initially implemented in 2011 in 107 selected districts in 17 states wherein a pack of six sanitary napkins called “Freedays” was provided to rural adolescent girls for Rs 6.From 2014 onwards, funds are now being provided for the decentralised procurement of sanitary napkins packs for provision to rural adolescent girls at a subsidised rate of Rs 6 for a pack of six napkins.ASHA workers are responsible for the distribution and dissemination of information regarding the scheme.Despite this, about 50 percent of women aged 15-24 years still use cloth for menstrual protection, according to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report.The lowest percentages of women use a hygienic method of menstrual protection in Bihar (59 percent), Madhya Pradesh (61 percent) and Meghalaya (65 percent).The survey was conducted between 2019-21 in around 6.37 lakh sample households from 707 districts of the country covering 7,24,115 women.The situation is especially ironic if you witness the growth of femtech companies in India, which is home to five percent of the world’s total femtech companies.Read more: https://www.newsdrum.in/analysis/menstrual-hygiene-access-to-menstrual-needs-should-be-prioritised-98982
