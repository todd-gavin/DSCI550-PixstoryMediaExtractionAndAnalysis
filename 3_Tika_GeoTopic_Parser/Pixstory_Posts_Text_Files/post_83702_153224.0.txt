Today was bleh; 
I studied all day and then slept for a while before waking up and repeating the process. I have no idea what I ate today, or even if I ate anything at all.
Let's hope I ace this exam; I've worked hard for the last month. 
I'm going out now, so mind telling your favourite comfort food.
