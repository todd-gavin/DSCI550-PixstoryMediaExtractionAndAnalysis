Women in Taliban Afghanistan are forced to wear the burqa at all times in public because according to one Taliban spokesman and I quote the face of a woman is a source of corruption for men not related to them I wonder what does The Quran say about the practice of Burqa The Quran states women should dress modestly and to cover their bosoms There is nothing about covering the head or hiding the face The veil or scarf was adopted from Jewish Roman Byzantine and Persian practices to show that a lady was high class and did not have to work Face veiling is not a religious requirement by most Islamic scholars past or present However some scholars view it as obligatory for women in the presence of non related males to prevent men from thinking about women So the question is why do women have to compensate for the ill thoughts of men Shouldn t the men wear opaque sunglasses in presence of unrelated females to protect themselves from the sin of lust
