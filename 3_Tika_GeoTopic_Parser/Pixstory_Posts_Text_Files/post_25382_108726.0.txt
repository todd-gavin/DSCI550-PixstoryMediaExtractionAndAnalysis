I feel like yoga is one of the best exercise someone can do. I've been doing yoga since the age of two, yes I know sounds like an exaggeration but its true.
My grandfather is a big time yoga enthusiast and he made me and my brother do yoga from the childhood, as children we are more flexible and with time as we grow, we tend to loose that flexibility but because me and my brother have been doing yoga since ages, we retained that flexibility.
Ever since coming to Delhi I have not been able to workout much, the place I've moved to recently is a little spacious, jt has room for me to do yoga so I brought a yoga mat with me and I do yoga everyday now, even if its 5-10 mins, because I feel its better than nothing, for me it doesn't take efforts because i know the aasans, the proper forms and I've experience in doing them, so that's how easy it is.
Not for everyone tho, I've come across people not being able to do the most basic butterfly or baby pose, so for them it is going to take time to increase that flexibility and to be able to mold their bodies that way, but once you've reached that stage, its a piece of cake and its very easy to incorporate in your daily lives. 
It opens up my body, and especially in periods, my back hurts a lot, so I do yoga, when I tell people about it, they're like don't be ridiculous but its true, yoga just stretches out my whole body to the max it feels like I've been born again, all the tension and aching is out.
I'm so involved into yoga that my insta and bumble bio has yoga as my interests and hobbies, in sports when someone asks me what I like to do, I'm like yoga, basketball and swimming. I feel everyone should try it once and then stick to it, without giving up because it takes time to build flexibility, so people tend to give up easily.
