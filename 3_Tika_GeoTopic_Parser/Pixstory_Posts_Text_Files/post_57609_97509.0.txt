Deforestation is bringing the Amazon closer to the end. Amazon is the most excellent shield against rising temperatures, but continuous loss of tress weakens this shield. 

Scientists say that the exploitation of the forest resources and the demand for products ha brought Amazon to the brink.
Vital environmental services are being lost because of deforestation. For example, in the past two years, Amazon rainforests have been cleared in an area equivalent to the size of the state of New Hampshire at a rate of 4,600 square miles per year.


The determinants of deforestation are multiple, but they are concentrated in extensive cattle ranching and soybean cultivation, both products in high demand in world markets. 
"Environmentalists say the nine countries that share the rainforest must drastically expand their enforcement capacity to overcome the geographic and logistical challenges posed by the forest’s vastness. Then there are economic factors: Most Latin American economies have been stagnant for years — and are now struggling under the coronavirus pandemic. If the regional economy improves, environmentalists believe, people will have less impetus to try their luck in the forest," Terrence McCoy, Washington Post.

It's high time now to protect the decline of these forests as they act as a shield against climatic change and produce many resources that help people survive.
