India s attempts to get their team in shape on the eve of the Asian Cup qualifiers in June didn t produce the required results as they went down to Bahrain in a friendly in Manama Apart from the defeat what more frustrated the Indian fans was the inability of the All India Football Federation AIFF to arrange for live telecast of the match though the tie was scheduled much in advance To add to the woes seven of the Indian squad didn t receive the visa in time while going and finally arrived only a day before the encounter It was certainly a mess it thoroughly hampered coach Igor Stimac s plans India had never beaten Bahrain in an official tie before Only once they could win a friendly that too some years ago So the defeat didn t really come as a surprise Stimac too was perhaps not looking for a positive result but he wanted his boys to be more cohesive on the pitch It didn t really happen that way For most part of the match India were at the receiving end they were busy guarding their own citadel and hardly had time to attack the rival defence In the first half Bahrain had at least four clear chances but they could not convert They also missed a penalty Among the newcomers in the Indian team lot was expected from winger Liston Colaco a speedy and skillful footballer who impressed in the Indian Super League He however failed to deliver the goods But Roshan Singh the other new face did a fine job after coming into the second half His perfect centre from the right off a corner kick found his Bengaluru FC teammate Rahul Bheke in the box who headed in his first international goal The goal put India at level with Bahrain who took the lead in the first half but it wasn t enough to save the day A new minutes before the final whistle the vulnerable defence let India down again as Bahrain scored the match winner Barring Roshan Singh s performance India didn t have much to take home
