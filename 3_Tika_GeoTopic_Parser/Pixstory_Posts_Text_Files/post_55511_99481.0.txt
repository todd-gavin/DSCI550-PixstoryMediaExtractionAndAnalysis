One of the first things you need to do when learning to live a life of no food rules is get RID of the good and bad food mindset. All foods should be on the same playing field.
 Now, I'm not saying that all foods are the
SAME. They're definitely  not. Some are more nourishing for the body nutrient wise, some are more nourishing for the soul. But, that doesn't make one food â€œbetter" than the other.
When we give food moral value, it gives that food power over us. This hinders your ability to listen to your body and eat intuitively. No foods are "better" than another. And no food makes you a "better" person for eating it.
Remember that.
