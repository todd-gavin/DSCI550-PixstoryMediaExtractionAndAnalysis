Abstract

We review the application of artificial intelligence techniques (AI) in the screening, diagnosis, and classification of diabetic macular edema (DME) by searching six databases– PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, IEEE, and ACM– from 1st January 2005 to 4th July 2021. A total of 879 articles were extracted, and by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 articles were selected for more evaluation. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). We provide an overview of the current state of various AI techniques for DME screening, diagnosis, and classification using retinal imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and color fundus photography (CFP). Based on our findings, deep learning models have an extraordinary capacity to provide an accurate and efficient system for DME screening and diagnosis. Using these in the processing of modalities leads to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values. The use of decision support systems and applications based on AI in processing retinal images provided by OCT and CFP increases the sensitivity and specificity in DME screening and detection.
