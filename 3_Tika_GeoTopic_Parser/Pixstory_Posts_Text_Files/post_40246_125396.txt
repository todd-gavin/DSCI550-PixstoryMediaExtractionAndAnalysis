I can t believe there is a day dedicated to celebrate a white wine and not red when red wine is clearly the superior one Red wine has a very high concentration of plant components that have a variety of health advantages since it ferments with grape skins and seeds As per Healthline the alleged solution to the French dilemma is red wine That s the idea that despite a heritage of eating a diet high in saturated fat there isn t much heart disease in France Red wine consumption may be protective for the cardiovascular system according to research In fact it has been associated with a lower chance of passing away from heart disease That may be in part because wine contains substances that have anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties These lessen the risk of heart disease This makes it obvious that red wine should be your first choice
