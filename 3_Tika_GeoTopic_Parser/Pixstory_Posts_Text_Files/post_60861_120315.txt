Christ University organizes many fests and events all around the year Apart from the university level events we also have department level events to cater to students niche interests This week we are organizing the Media Meet Media students look forward to this because many workshops and Guest Lectures are organized as part of the event We also have students presenting papers surrounding areas of their interest and have guest panelists serving as judges for the same These invited guests are usually renowned professors industry professionals and field experts who give students practical industry insights and also help attending students explore different media fields Media Meet also collaborates with abroad universities and industry professionals from around the world to make the event an immersive experience for all students Usually students from outside of our university are also allowed to participate in the workshops and panel discussions My first two Media Meets were online due to the pandemic but I got to interact with several industry experts like journalists social media influencers film makers authors during the online live panel discussions which helped me narrow down on the particular field in media I m interested in This year marks my last Media Meet event as I will be graduating next year before the next meet and I will definitely miss this experience
