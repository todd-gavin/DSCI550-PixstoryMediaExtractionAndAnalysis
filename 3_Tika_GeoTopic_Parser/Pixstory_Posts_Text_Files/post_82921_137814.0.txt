Teacher's day : 
We celebrate this day every year on 5th September. This day is the birthday of our former President Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. This day is celebrated to pay respect to all the teachers who are doing a great job and hardwork for our upcoming generation. . . 
Dr. S Radhakhishnan was a great teacher. He was born on 5th September 1888. He loved teaching so much, so his birthday is celebrated all over India as Teacher's day. 
Teachers are called our 2nd parents. Like our parents, our teachers also teach us so many things. As a student it must be our responsibility to thank them. It is a great occasion for us. 
HAPPY TEACHER'S DAY. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
