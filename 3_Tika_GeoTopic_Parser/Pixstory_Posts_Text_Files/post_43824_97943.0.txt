Football Club Barcelona made it past Mallorca CD in Gameweek 34 of Laliga Santander.

Real Madrid have already secured the title, both mathematically and otherwise but Barça
have a point to prove in the four games that remain. All that started of course last night,
when Memphis Depay and Sergio Busquets scored to give the Blaugrana a first home win in
four games at the Nou Camp. All hope of a proper revival season is lost, but it doesn't stop
the catalans from trying.

19 year-old Ansu Fati made a return to the pitch, instantly being cheered on by the Camp
Nou faithful. The Spaniard has been out for more than a couple of months now, with an
injury that seemed to have ended his season. In the 16 minutes that Fati managed, he was
barely involved. With just 5 touches of the football, he was fouled once but it was his much
awaited return that Barça enthusiasts will have enjoyed.

Speaking of Fati's positional switch to a striker, head coach Xavi Hernandez said the
following:

"I am very happy with him. He’s made an effort to be ready for the final stretch of
the season. He makes a difference, he’s special, but we must take care of him.”

Xavi has seen the best and the worst of Fati,who after returning from his initial injury this
year seemed to be in fine form.

“I’ve tested him out as a No.9, because I think he has to play in the penalty area. He’s a
special player, who scores goals. They hit him accidentally and go in. I see him more as a No.9, than a winger. He doesn’t have the pace or physical ability back yet, but he’s happy.”

Surely the manager's confidence in his goalscoring abilities can only mean good things for
Ansu.
