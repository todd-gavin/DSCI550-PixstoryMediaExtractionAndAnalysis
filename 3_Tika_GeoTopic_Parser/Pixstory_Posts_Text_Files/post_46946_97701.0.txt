Mary Jane McLeod Bethune is a name that history should never forget. She was an American educator who actively participated in African American affairs.  She was also the special advisor of Franklin D Roosevelt. Both her parents were enslaved people, which lead to a socially active life in Bethune. A proponent of racial and gender equality, Bethune founded many organizations and led voter registration drives after women gained the vote in 1920, risking racist attacks. 

Bethune founded the National Council of Negro Women in 1935 and established the organization's flagship journal Aframerican Women's Journal. She also founded a private school for African-American students in Daytona Beach, Florida. She was the only African American woman to officially be a part of the US delegation that created the United Nations charter. 

She was everything to African Americans during their struggling period. For her lifetime of activism, she was deemed "acknowledged First Lady of Negro America" by Ebony magazine in July 1949 and was known by the Black Press as the "Female Booker T. Washington".She was known as "The First Lady of The Struggle" because of her commitment to gaining better lives for African Americans. A statue of Bethune in Jersey City, New Jersey was committed in 2021 in a namesake park across the street from the Mary McLeod Bethune Life Center.
