I m not a big fan of dieting myself I believe everyone should be able to eat whatever they enjoy or want And by that I mean everyone Even the people who want to diet I don t understand why suddenly everything has become problematic Even what food people eat What s wrong in wanting to lose or gain weight People set fitness goals it s okay for them to make changes according to that Today s generation is so fragile they get offended by the littlest of things Dieting has too many health benefits for it to be ended It does not always have to imply deprivation Changing your dietary habits on the other hand can be good especially if you re used to consuming unhealthy meals In fact sticking to a diet pushes you to make healthy decisions which might help you maintain a healthy diet over time It promotes healthy eating which is one of the biggest needs of this generation considering all the diseases surrounding them I think it s time to stop whining about little things and focusing on real issues like in this case scenario obesity and emaciation
