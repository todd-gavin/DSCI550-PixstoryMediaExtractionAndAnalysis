Environment sustainability is to meet today’s needs without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their needs. It is the responsibility to conserve the natural resources and protect the global ecosystem to support the health and wellbeing of the present and the future. 

Economic sustainability is of great importance. Companies must implement environmentally sustainable practices to meet their business goals. This would align their profits with the needs of the planet. We all know that unrestricted consumption takes a significant toll on human welfare. As GDP climbs, so does our energy use, leading to more polluted environments and depleted natural resources. Thus we need to work on more sustainable ways such as renewable energy. 

A new mindset should be developed in people brining in focus that success in the business and GDP growth should go hand in hand with sustainable practices. These practices are not causing hinderance to the growth but instead leading to the development of a better future.
