Opportunities
Erik ten Hag has a great opportunity in front of him in the 2022/23 season. The Premier League giants like Liverpool and Chelsea are struggling in the league and this provides them an opportunity to finish in the top four. The manager also has a chance to bid a challenge for the title if they can sail past Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City in the ongoing season.
The club can also fight for domestic trophies like Carabao Cup and FA Cup if not the EPLtrophy.
Threats
Manchester United has a lighter attack and with players going to the World Cup, it remains interesting to see how the manager sails the 2022/23 season. The usual season has at least45+ games and the lack of depth can be a major cause of concern for the gaffer. The club willhave to add the weapons to their arsenal in the winter transfer window to achieve the best
results.
