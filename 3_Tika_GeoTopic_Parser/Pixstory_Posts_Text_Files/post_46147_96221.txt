Mother Earth gives her gifts for all to share She gives them freely yet she s still aware That things are changing perhaps for the worse How much more can she give if our future is cursed It s way past time to put Mother Earth first To clean up the water before we all thirst To clean up the air before our lungs sicken To renew the soil and feel it quicken How long until the point of no return How much longer until we all finally learn That to this task we all must rise And stop abusing Mother Earth before she dies Let s Take A Pledge To save Our Mother Earth To invest In our planet
