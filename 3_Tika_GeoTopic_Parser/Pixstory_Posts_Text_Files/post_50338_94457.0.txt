As I experimented with new and changing operational strategies for different anti-Maoist operations, which also delivered good results in terms of the number of recoveries and arrests, I also discovered that the solution to the crisis lay not just in military-style operations. 

It needed to be dealt in a different way which could not be successful without properly engaging the community and creating for them a stake in the end of violence.Â As several phases of the Operation Vidhwansa continued, it was clear in my mind that the military tactic and strategy could not bring in lasting peace in the district. The community needed to be involved into the operation and it required a theme which could unite the purpose of the police and the community. 

The theme had to be one which could be easily understood and with which one in the affected community could associate without fearing opposition from the Maoists. Any theme which would invite the ire of the Maoists or one with which the community could not connect was sure to receive a death blow with inception. I brainstormed with some concerned locals about the desire to bring in permanent change in the affected region. As I was looking for such themes my attention turned again to the Historic Rohtasgarh Fort, which stood as a cultural symbol of the past prosperity of the region now most affected by Maoist violence and one for which the tribals residing in the area had great respect. I wanted to make some contribution to the neglected Fort which was also very close to my heart.
