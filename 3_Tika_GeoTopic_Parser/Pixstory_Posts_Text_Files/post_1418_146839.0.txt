More than two decades after 17 year old Adnan Syed was convicted of killing his ex girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, in Baltimore, Maryland, he has been released from prison. It is a day people never thought would come. Here's what you need to know about this case: it became the subject of one of the world's most famous podcasts, Serial. In fact, many thought Serial to be the definitive podcast, since it led to a huge rise in the popularity of the genre. I listened to that first season, which traced the progress of the Adnan case meticulously. The podcast refused to take sides. Instead, it pointed out the loopholes in the court proceedings, and explained the problems with the prosecution's arguments. Despite the renewed interest in the case, Adnan was found guilty and sentenced. Today, if you do a little Internet research, you can find all sorts of lengthy explanations by amateur detectives. They delve into questions like' what time did Hae Min go missing, and what was Adnan's alibi at the time?' 'Did Jay, Adnan's friend, prove to be an unreliable witness on the stand?" However, as a lawyer, I find these theories irrelevant. There is quite simply not enough evidence to prove that Adnan did it beyond a reasonable doubt- and there is no direct evidence at all, his DNA was not found on her body. The reason that Adnan is free today is because police have turned up additional plausible suspects, but he ought to have walked free then, regardless of what the truth is. The law is premised on the fact that we cannot take away a manâ€™s freedom without overpowering evidence, and that standard was not met. These are the principles of a civilised society, and we cannot compromise on them.
