Arsenal fans are absolutely emphatic after this week's 4-2 win versus Chelsea. Ahead of 
tonight's clash against Manchester United, the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and 
Martin Ødegaard are favourites to impress.

One name that has gone under the radar and 
continues to do so however, is Mohammed Elneny. The Egyptian started in defensive 
midfield at the Bridge and his performance granted praise from manager Mikel Arteta.

“I will say that for me, he’s one of the most important players in the squad. For what he does when you give him the chance to play and for the things that he does when he doesn’t play,” Arteta told the club’s official website.

“It’s a phenomenal person and then you have to judge the footballer as well that sometimes doesn’t get probably the credit that he deserves. It was more in January than the summer and I think he understood with the squad we had at that moment, that I could not let another player leave and it’s a tough balance because at the end."

Now 29, Elneny has seen his fair share of ups and downs in his six years at the Emirates.

“They are in a period in their career where they are looking to extend their football lives, but 
at the same time, I thought that he could be important for the team in the last part of the 
season.”

On whether Elneny will sign a new deal at the club, Arteta explained: “It’s another one where 
we’re going to have another conversation at the end of the season and see what we do with 
that one as well. I am really happy with him, that’s what I can say.”

Elneny will probably depart this summer, leaving behind a ton of unfulfilled expectations.

Arteta however, keeps in mind his talent and proficiency even during the final weeks of the 
Egyptian's spell.
