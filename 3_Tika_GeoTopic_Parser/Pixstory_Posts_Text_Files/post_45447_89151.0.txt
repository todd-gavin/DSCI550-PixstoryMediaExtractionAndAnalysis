Most football fans do not look forward to the international break. The international break breaks the momentum of ardent football fans who want to see their clubs play week in and week out.

However, with the 2022 FIFA World Cup just around the way, international teams are scrambling to clinch their spots. This is why international breaks are so crucial. When a World Cup berth is at stake, no game is only a formality.

Argentina vs Brazil (16th November)
Argentina and Brazil, eternal rivals, had lined up and stepped to the field in September for a World Cup Qualifier. The match was called off after 10 minutes after health inspectors invaded the pitch and fined some Argentina players for violating the Covid-19 quarantine restrictions in Brazil.

It was promoted as a replay of the Copa America final from 2021, and that will be the case for this encounter on November 16th. La Albiceleste is a tough team, and neither team has lost in their FIFA World Cup qualifying campaigns for 2021.

Uruguay vs Argentina (12th November)
Uruguay is currently a wounded animal. During the recent international break, they lost back-to-back matches to Argentina and Brazil. Oscar Tabarez's men are concerned about the nature of the losses.

On both occasions, they were soundly defeated. They were defeated 3-0 by Argentina before losing 4-1 to Brazil, and they will be seeking vengeance. They will, however, be without their top striker Edinson Cavani, who is presently out with an unexplained injury.
