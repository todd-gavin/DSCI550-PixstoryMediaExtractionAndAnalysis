Be it a gathering, a meet up after a very long time, a family time, the meet and sharing our stories which which we have been waiting to share with them fills our soul, and definitely the way to our soul is made through the food. 
Any food, light, sumptuous one's, the one that makes us drown in the feast of foods is what has made that meet so special. And our mood definitely lits up with the food we have, maybe a planned food structure like right from the starter to the dessert would be the perfect one in that moment, and our preference of making dessert first and rest later also has a place. 
To sum it up foods also creates moments of different emotions, but to have it in which emotion depends on our choice.
