Unless your have gifted genes for great skin , maintaining good skin is a full time job . 🥲✨
Don’t worry I am here to help . Lemme share with you some habits , if you want glowing skin ; ✅✨
1 Starting your day with 500ml to 1ltr of water ( can be warm or room temperature ) .
2 Good bowel movements ( if you have a good poop day then there are chances that your intestines are working fine and it will show on your face , irritated bowel can lead to increased acne and redness so it’s important to keep gut healthy for clear skin ) .
3 Consuming protein rich breakfast to keep you full for longer times and cutting down your sugar cravings .
4 A cup of green tea / matcha / superfood mix / soaked fennel seed water will surely help .
I know including everything everyday is a task but you can start by taking baby steps like a glass of water and then step up your drinking game ! Then focus on your diet and eventually your gut will also improve and then these extras like tea / fennel seeds can be included . ✅✨
Stay tuned for more skin care content . Thank me later . ✨🤍
