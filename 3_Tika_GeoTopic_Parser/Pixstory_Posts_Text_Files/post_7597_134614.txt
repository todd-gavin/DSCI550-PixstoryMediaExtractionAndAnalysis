House of The Dragon is set almost years before Game of Thrones and HBO hasn t lot a beat They ve gone back and analysed how Game of Thrones was lackluster in the last few season The first two episodes of House of The Dragon spark just like the first six season of GOT did Every actor is just brilliant in their roles and no one is missing the beat The series will revolve around the House Targaryen and their line of succession Viserys I Targaryen is on the Iron Throne currently having named his daughter Rhaenyra his heir This has led to unease among the court as Westeros has never had a female heir yet Daemon Targaryen the rogue prince of Dragonstone brother to Viserys feels cheated out of the throne but won t harm her niece The tension is slowly building as King Viserys is set to remarry but he says the his daughter will remain the heir no matter what the future holds Those who ve read the books know how chaotic everything is about to become and we re all here for it House of The Dragon definitely has the potential to become greater than Game of Thrones only if the creators have learned from the past This prequel might be the next best series
