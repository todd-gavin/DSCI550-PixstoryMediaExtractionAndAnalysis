The World Track and Field Championship of this year has been anticipated for a while. 

As per Sporting News, the competition typically runs in cycles of two years. World Athletics chose to move the competition from 2021 to this year after the coronavirus pandemic caused the Tokyo Olympics to be postponed by a year. 

The world's top athletes converge on Eugene, Oregon's Hayward Field from July 15â€“24 for the inaugural edition of the competition to be held there. There are numerous medals at stake. 

The competition will undoubtedly feature a number of Olympic gold medalists, including American athletes Allyson Felix, Sydney McLaughlin, and Ryan Crouser, Canadian decathlete Damian Warner, and famous Jamaican sprinters Elaine Thompson-Herah and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price.
