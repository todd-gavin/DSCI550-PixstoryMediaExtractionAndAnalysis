How to tell if you have a true friend, like a friend for life. And it's written by Evelyn Waugh, the author of Brideshead Revisited. He claims that we cherish true friends not because they entertain us.
But for the fact that they are entertained by us, what he means is a very simple yet important thing. A friend isn't there to drag you out of your misery or to make your life more interesting; that wouldn't be friendship. Instead, a friend is someone who understands you, someone who enjoys the same things you do, someone who has the same sense of humour as you, and you both laugh when you see something. You exchange a glance, and the other person knows exactly what you're thinking.
A true friend is not someone who is there to spice up your life.Â  A true friend is somebody who shares a delight in the same things that delight you.
