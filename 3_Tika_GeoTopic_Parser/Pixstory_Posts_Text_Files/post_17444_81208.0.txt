Real Madrid are psyched up for their upcoming Champions League collision with Paris Saint-Germain in the Round of 16 stage of the tournament but there’s a lot more at stake than a football match of 90 minutes. Los Blancos do not only travel to Paris for the game but to make arrangements for a bigger purpose and apparently, the club’s higher-ups are very well equipped to make the ends meet.

On one side there is Kylian Mbappe who dreams of playing for Real and has been, in all his power, pushing for a move to the Spanish club since last season and to face him, there is Paris Saint Germain who will do anything and everything to make Mbappe stick with them, contrary to what they promised to the Frenchman the day he signed.

In this fuss, apart from being the main party in question, Real Madrid will also act as a catalyst to stir an outcome as soon as possible – preferably in their favour.

Earlier this month, media outlet Bild made an astronomical claim that Real Madrid and Mbappe have already agreed on the player’s transfer this summer which was, however, eventually countered by Spanish journalists close to the club as a false report conveying that despite the player’s inclination, nothing has been decided yet.
