Team fit plays a key role in a prospect's early development after the NBA draft.

Landing with the right franchise can jump-start a player's career. The wrong fit could derail it.

Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the projected lottery picks in our latest mock draft, plus the rosters of their potential suitors, we picked the most and least desirable destinations for each.

We only named teams that we deemed will have a realistic chance, based on the lottery odds, to select each prospect.

Ochai Agbaji (Kansas, SG, Senior)

Best landing spot: New Orleans Pelicans

The Pelicans would find early minutes for Ochai Agbaji after the Kansas senior buried 103 triples and New Orleans finished 27th in three-point percentage.

The fact that he's interchangeable between the 2 and 3 should help maximize his opportunities, even with Trey Murphy III and Herbert Jones already cracking the rotation.

It will be best for Agbaji to go to a team that already has scorers and playmakers given his limitations as a creator and off-the-dribble shooter. With New Orleans, he could have a valued three-and-D role for a rising team.

Worst landing spot: San Antonio Spurs

Agbaji could get lost in the shuffle of San Antonio's surplus of off-ball scorers and wings. He'd be a backup specialist for a team that seems far away from competing for anything serious.

Paolo Banchero (Duke, PF, Freshman)

Best landing spot: San Antonio Spurs

Few teams could use a frontcourt scorer more than San Antonio. As polished offensively as anyone in this draft, Paolo Banchero could slide right into a high-usage role at the 4 and benefit from an elite playmaker in Dejounte Murray.

Banchero, who averaged 4.1 assists over Duke's last 14 games, could also give the Spurs a second playmaker, something they lost when they traded Derrick White.

And while Banchero's shooting and defense were up-and-down, the Spurs finished in the middle of the pack in three-point percentage and defensive rating.

Worst landing spot: Sacramento Kings

A defensive pairing of Banchero and Domantas Sabonis would limit the Kings' ceiling.
