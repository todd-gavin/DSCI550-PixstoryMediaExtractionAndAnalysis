The 2022 Qatar World Cup is less than 50 days away, with the tournament set to attract more than one million football fans from around the globe.
Football’s biggest tournament kicks off on November 20 - marking the first time the FIFA tournament has been hosted by a Middle East country - and fans from within the region and across the world are gearing up for the month-long sporting action.
COVID-19 rules
Anyone planning to watch a match at FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 will need a negative COVID-19 test to enter the country. The rule applies whether they have been vaccinated or not.
Fans aged six and above must have a negative PCR test result which must have been taken within 48 hours before their departure for Qatar.
It is also possible to enter with proof of a negative rapid antigen test, but that must be taken 24 hours before arriving in the country. People also need to wear face masks when traveling on public transport in Qatar.
Health insurance
Visitors to Qatar will now have to pay about $13 (QR50) for a health insurance premium, according to the Official Gazette in Qatar. The price will cost the same if the visa is extended. The health insurance premium will cover basic services, including emergency and accident treatment services.
Hayya cards
Anyone wishing to enter the country after November 1 will be expected to apply for a Hayya card. It is a personalized document issued and reportedly required by everyone attending the FIFA World Cup matches.
It will also provide free public transport access in Qatar, including the metro and bus.
Social rules
It is legal to consume licensed beverages if you are over the age of 21 in Qatar. Fans can expect to be able to purchase alcohol in “licensed bars or restaurants.”
