So, today I'll be sharing what it felt like having extensions for the first time. 💅🏻✨️
I have this horrible habit of having nails instead of my meals. 🤫
But at the same point I always wanted my hands to look pretty like other girl's hands do.🥺💗
Initially, I was sceptical wether to go for nail extension or not. 💅🏻✨️But I went for it. It took about an hour or so to do nail extension. I chose a pinkish-nude tone so that it goes with most of my outfits.💃😉 At first I thought these nail would fall in any time but after an hour the nail artist said that now you can do anything. Initially, I felt little weight on my hand but after an hour it seemed normal. My hands looked pretty. 🫶🏻🥹I just can't help my eyes to take it off from my hands. They were looking that pretty. 😍❤️  I am not a fan of long nails so I asked the nail artist that make the size of the nails small so that, it would be convenient for me to work with my hands. The nail artist made the shape of square and no doubt it was best shape. I just loved nail extension on my hands. ✨️😉💗
How's your experience? Please tell me below in the notes section. I would really like to give it a read. ✨️💗
