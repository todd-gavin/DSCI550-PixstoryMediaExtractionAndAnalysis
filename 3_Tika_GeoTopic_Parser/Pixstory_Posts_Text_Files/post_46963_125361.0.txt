With the publication of his second book, "Midnight's Children," in 1981, Rushdie gained international recognition and the coveted Booker Prize for its portrayal of post-independence India.

The British-Indian author had spent years in hiding and under police protection after Iranian officials demanded his execution for his book "The Satanic Verses" (1988) which remained banned in Iran due to numerous Muslim accusations of blasphemy or 'unbelief'. In 1989, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie.

A number of killings, attempted murders, and bombings happened as a result of the book. This 'The Satanic Verses Controversy' is also called 'The Rushdie Affair'.

Up until 1998, when the subsequent administration of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami declared that it no longer advocated the assassination of Rushdie, the Iranian government supported the fatwa against the author. Despite Mohammad Khatami declaring against Rushdie's execution, the fatwa remained in place.

Salman Rushdie immigrated to the UK after being born into a Muslim household in India. His book was an intellectual fiction that discussed topics like immigration, identity, and the meaning of religion. After the Fatwa was passed against him, he spent many years in hiding to escape any possible attack on him.
