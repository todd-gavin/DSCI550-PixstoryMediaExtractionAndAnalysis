Sergio Aguero's strike against QPR eight years ago sent Man City supporters into frenzy,
ending the club's 44-year drought for a Premier League title.

Manchester City won their first Premier League title on 13 May [#onthisday] in 2012, in the most
spectacular season finale against Queens Park Rangers (QPR).

 Sergio Aguero scored the
winning goal for Man City, which stole the Premier League championship from Man United's
grasp, as Manchester United had already defeated Sunderland and were on their way to
winning the Premier Leagueâ€¦. Man City and Manchester United were tied on points after
Sergio Aguero's 94th-minute goal against QPR, but the blue side of Manchester won the
Premier League for the first-time courtesy to a better goal difference.

The epithet 'Aguero 93:20' will forever be branded with the Man City fans; it was the moment
when supporters at the Etihad held their breath as Sergio Aguero lashed his right foot into the
goal. 

Man City were on the verge of a devastating breakdown against QPR when the visitors,
playing with ten men, grabbed a 2-1 lead with less than 25 minutes to go. In the opening minute
of injury time, Edin Dzeko leveled the score, providing City a much-needed boost.

The club has announced that on the 10th anniversary of Sergio Aguero's title-clinching goal
against QPR next month, a statue of him [created by the renowned sculptor, Andy Scott], would
be unveiled to honor his Legacy.

The Argentinian, City's all-time leading scorer with a club record of 260 goals and winning five
Premier League titles over 10 years, memorably scored in the fourth minute of extra time of the
2011-12 season's last game at the Etihad Stadium to deny Manchester United the Premier
League title.

The presentation of the statue, which will be joined by statues of teammates Vincent Kompany
and David Silva already on display at the stadium, will be the highlight of a day of
commemoration celebrating a decade since the 3-2 victory on May 13, 2007.
