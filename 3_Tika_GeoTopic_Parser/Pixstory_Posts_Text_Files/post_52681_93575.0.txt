Everyone has dreams to make his/her country big and democratically successful. A country where there is equality in all areas, and for all genders, it witnesses progress. Like others, I also have a dream for my India and the way it should be, so I can be proud to live and the coming generation too. Furthermore, a country where there is no discrimination of caste, color, gender, and economic status, sees development in a true sense. People in such countries also progress well in all senses.
