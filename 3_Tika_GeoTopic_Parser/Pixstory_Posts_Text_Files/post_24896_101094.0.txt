The Albanian government has announced next Wednesday as a public holiday in Tirana, which will host the Europa Conference League final between Roma and Feyenoord.

Even though each side has only been given 4,000 tickets for the inaugural final of the third-tier European club championship, up to 100,000 Italian and Dutch soccer fans are expected in Tirana.

The National Arena has a capacity of around 20,000 people.

The final is a higher-profile encounter than many expected when UEFA decided to introduce the Europa Conference League in 2018. Its goal was to provide additional options for clubs from lower-ranked countries to participate in European competitions after December.

The 2023 final will be held at an even smaller arena, the Eden Arena in Prague.

Roma coach Jose Mourinho expressed excitement about his first visit to Albania.
“It’s one of the few countries in Europe that I’ve never played in,” Mourinho said. “The fact that the stadium is too small for two clubs like Roma and Feyenoord is the only negative point about the game.

“But if it was a 50,000- or 70,000-seat stadium it would still be small,” Mourinho added. “If we played at (Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu Stadium) that would still be small.”
