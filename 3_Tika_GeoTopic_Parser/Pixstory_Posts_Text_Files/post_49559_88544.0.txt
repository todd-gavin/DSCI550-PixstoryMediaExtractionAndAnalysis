Memphis, Gonzaga and Sweet-16 have been trending today on twitter with hundreds of thousands of tweets.

Gonzaga leaned on its star junior to reach its seventh straight Sweet 16 after trailing at intermission for only the fourth time this season. On Thursday in San Francisco, the Bulldogs (28-3) will meet No. 4 seed Arkansas in the West Region semifinals.

Despite Gonzaga's run, Memphis (22-11) hung in there. With DeAndre Williams' basket, the Tigers drew even at 66. After Nembhard's 3-pointer put the Bulldogs up 76-69, Lester Quinones' 3-pointer with 32 seconds left gave the Tigers a one-possession lead.

Due to foul difficulties, the showdown between future NBA lottery choices Chet Holmgren of Gonzaga and Jalen Duren of Memphis never completely developed. Duren had seven points and seven rebounds in 19 minutes of action, but sat for more than ten minutes of the second half after picking up his fourth foul.

Before fouling out in the final seconds, Holmgren had nine points, nine rebounds, and four blocks.

For a time, Memphis appeared eager and capable of sabotaging what was basically a home game for Gonzaga, despite the fact that it was a 6-hour journey from its campus. As jittery energy permeated Moda Center, Memphis dominated the latter stages of the first half and built a 41-31 advantage at halftime.

Memphis' season began with great expectations and ended with a strong performance versus Gonzaga. With Duren projected to go for the NBA next season, the Tigers will likely look very different next season. Emoni Bates, a fellow freshman, could be next.

Gonzaga: The Bulldogs' free-throw shooting remains a huge concern. Gonzaga finished 13 for 24 from the line after going 16 for 30 against Georgia State in the first round.
