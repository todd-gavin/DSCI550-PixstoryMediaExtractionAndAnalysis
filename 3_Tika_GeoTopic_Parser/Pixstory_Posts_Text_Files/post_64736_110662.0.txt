Verdict?

The Swiss model doesn’t sound bad, but the current format is still very good. UEFA just wants more matches and elite teams playing each other more often to generate more money. It’s just the same as the proposed European Super League. This is a disgrace, forcing players to play more matches and not paying the clubs what they’re actually worth to the competition. The ESL proposed by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez doesn’t sound bad after these developments, everyone is trying to make this sport for the rich, while it should be for everyone
