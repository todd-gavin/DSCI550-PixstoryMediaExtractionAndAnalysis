Recently Mauritius sent an expedition to the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean and had its flag planted on the Peros Banhos atoll. A few Chagos Islanders who were originally part of the islands and were allegedly evicted by the British in the 60s and 70s were also part of the expedition.

Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth called the planting the flat an “emotional" and "historic" event for his country. (https://twitter.com/kwang_poon/status/1493351020142886916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1493351020142886916%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.africanews.com%2F2022%2F02%2F16%2Fmauritius-plants-flag-on-disputed-chagos-islands%2F) But Britain’s Foreign Office dismissed the expedition claiming that there was no doubt about the sovereignty of the islands which belong to Great Britain. 

Mauritius has been aggressive in its moves ever since it won in the International Court of Justice in 2019, according to which Britain should have given up the control of the islands. One of the islands, Diego Garcia, is home to one of the largest U.S. naval bases. (https://www.africanews.com/2022/02/08/mauritius-announces-boat-expedition-to-the-disputed-chagos-islands/) Britain, on its part, has argued that it will return the islands once they were no longer needed for military purposes. But it also argues that Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the territory and the U.K. does not recognise its claim.

Citing the international court ruling and its own historical claims over the islands, Mauritius has formally asked Google to designate the islands as part of its country rather than being identified as British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/mauritius-uk-google-maps-chagos-islands-territory) Britain acquired the Chagos Islands via a treaty signed after defeating Napoleon in 1814 It subsequently governed them from Mauritius, a British colony. 

Mauritius may have the wherewithal to confront the British and the U.S. to evacuate the island forcefully, it has been celebrating its victories on various forums over its claim of the islands. Last year, the country erupted when the U.N. postal agency decided to ban British stamps from being used on the Chagos archipelago.
