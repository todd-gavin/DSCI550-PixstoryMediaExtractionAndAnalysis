Last night I watched a Punjabi movie named Main Viyah Nahi Karona Tere Naal which means I don t want to marry you and I don t know why the Punjab film industry s producers and directors are walking on the same path since many years and making money with the same type of content but if audiences are liking these type of movies then writers of the movies will not try anything new Talking about the movie Main Viyah Nahi Karona Tere Naal is a story of a boy named Puran played by Gurnam Bhullar who s living in Canada with her mom and every Punjabi mom has only one wish which is his son should marry to a Punjabi girl asap For this wish Puran and his mom traveled to Punjab and with the help of their family Puran s mom saw a couple of girls for Puran but she didn t like any but one day Mannat played by Sonam Bajwa who is a friend of one of those rejected girls by Puran s mom confronted Puran and scold him but men will be men Puran started liking Mannat And after that Puran got to know that Mannat likes someone else so Puran decided to help Mannat to get married to that boy even though Puran loves Mannat a lot What happens next for that you have to watch the full movie and if you want to see a light hearted movie with your whole family then this movie should be on your watchlist As you all know this is a Punjabi movie so there is no Hindi dub but you watch it with the help of English subtitles Acting of the all the actors is good the message that the movie wanted to share with the audience is delivered very well but as I saw many Punjabi movies in the past there is nothing new in the movie
