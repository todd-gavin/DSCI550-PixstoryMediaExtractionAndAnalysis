According to Reuters, UN experts have reported on the deteriorating situation of Afghan women. Experts say the Taliban's "widespread gender discrimination" is exacerbating the plight of Afghan women. According to them, the Taliban are increasing the suffering of Afghan women by withdrawing from their commitments.

The experts also criticized the US blocking aid. Without elaborating, they said in a statement that the current humanitarian crisis, in which 23 million people are dependent on food aid, is having an "unfair effect" on women and children.

In February, US President Joe Biden issued an executive order extending sanctions, saying he was working to release half of Afghanistan's assets in the United States to help the Afghan people and the rest to deal with possible claims. Terrorism holds against the Taliban.

Independent UN experts have been appointed by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council.

In a statement, the group called the provisions of the US Presidential Decree "too broad" and said that they would "lead to too strict compliance with sanctions, thus preventing the Afghan people from accessing basic humanitarian aid."

The statement said that under international human rights law, governments, including the United States, have a responsibility to ensure that their activities do not lead to human rights abuses.

Experts say they have already conveyed their concerns and recommendations to Washington but have not yet received a response.
