Finally, the most two debatable types of peer pressure. Negative peer pressure and positive peer pressure.

Negative Peer Pressure:
A form of negative peer pressure involves asking an adolescent to act in a way that goes against their moral code or family beliefs. Teens are forced to decide whether to follow their values or disobey them after observing the behavior of other teens with stronger personalities. Teens with strong morals often find themselves acting in ways that go against their principles just to fit in because of this. 

Positive Peer Pressure:
If the group dynamic promotes healthy, age-appropriate, and socially acceptable activities, it may act as a form of constructive peer pressure. Examples of positive peer pressure include a peer group that encourages a child to study, go for their dreams or maybe engage in things good for themselves and others, like yoga, exercise or charity.
