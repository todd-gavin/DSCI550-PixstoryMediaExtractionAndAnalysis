For Mick Schumacher, this year cannot be defined as positive. Indeed, not only have the results fallen short of expectations, but there is also a series of accidents that are costing Haas too much in economic terms. Team principal Gunther Steiner had a face-to-face meeting with he before the start of the track sessions on the Baku track Schumi jr was told of mistakes like the one in Montecarlo there can no longer be any more It is not possible to continue like this and Mick knows it After Monaco we had a discussion because at a certain point we will finish the pieces and we will not be able to continue producing them And then even if more money could be spent we would physically not be able to do it So we must make sure that nothing happens in Baku the words of Gunther Steiner What risks Mick Schumacher therefore At the moment he seems to be safe from a possible dismissal for all the premises of the beginning of the year now seem to be just a memory He is a Haas driver but he is part of the Ferrari team and the third driver of the Prancing Horse The contract extensions of both Leclerc and Sainz for him are moving him away from the Maranello car Haas the main risk that you risk being left out of the game and pessimistically having to find a place in other categories
