Today was the prime example of how media can be so toxic and how fast fake news can spread and can create confusion in the world.

Almost an hour before, many verified football and media news channels broke the news that football’s super agent Mino Riola has passed away because of illness.

As a content writer, I also post this news on Pixstory but after a few minutes of posting the news, Mino Riola himself released the statement which said, 

“Current health status for the ones
wondering: pissed off second time in
4 months they kill me. Seem also able
to resuscitate.”

So, at last, I want to say that stay away from fake news and before posting anything on social platforms, do your research properly because today I also became a part of it and felt bad.
