Enter the Dragon: Chinese Invasion 
of Tibet continues .....

When the people of eastern Tibet protested in 1956 and a spontaneous uprising began:

‘The Chinese reaction was as swift as it was atrocious. Wives, daughters, and nuns were raped many cases repeatedly. Celibate monks were forced to have intercourse. In one case in Amdo, a monastery was turned into a stable for horses, and the Chinese brought in prostitutes and forced the monks at gunpoint to have sexual intercourse. When they refused two were crucified. Another had his arm chopped off. 

In the Amdo village of Doi, three hundred landowners were assembled and shot in the back of their heads. The townspeople were commanded to watch, then warned that the same fate awaited them if they continued to oppose the introduction of socialism. In the village of Patung Ahnga the people were assembled and then forced to watch twenty-five wealthy people being publicly burned to death.Monasteries were turned into barns and pigsties.

Others, like Lithang, were destroyed by bombing. Senior lamas were particularly singled out for humiliation. They were dropped into pits and the local people forced to urinate on their spiritual leaders. Then they were shot. Hundreds of monks were killed by firing squads. The nomadic encampments around Lithang were machine-gunned and bombed  from the air.

‘Children were dragged away from their homes and relocated to state-run schools and orphanages, while their parents were dragged away to horrible labour camps. In a village called Jeuba men and women had to watch twenty-four parents being killed by having nails driven into their eyes for refusing to send their children to Chinese schools. Parents were shot by traumatized children. . .
