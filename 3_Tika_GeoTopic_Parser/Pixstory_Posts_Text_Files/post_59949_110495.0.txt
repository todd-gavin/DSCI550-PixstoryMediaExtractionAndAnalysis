Eoin Morgan, the captain of the England team that won the 2019 World Cup, has announced his retirement from international cricket. Morgan desired to serve as England's captain at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Australia. However, the 35-year-old batter's troubles with his form and conditioning over the past 18 months have caused him to rethink his mind. 

He was the captain of the team during the one-day series this month in the Netherlands, but he was dismissed for a duck in two high-scoring games and was unable to play in the last match because of a leg injury.

Eoin Morgan has announced his immediate retirement from international cricket, according to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). In all ODI and T20I games, Morgan has scored the most runs for England Men overall and received the most titles.
