I have been waiting for this a long time now But I guess better late than never The Yankees Letter will be a secret no longer a court has ruled The United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals has denied the Yankees and Major League Baseball s pleas to keep a letter detailing a inquiry into the Yankees private nearly two years after a federal court determined that the letter should become a public document The Athletic said that the plaintiffs in a lawsuit contend that a news statement issued by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred punishing the Red Sox and the Yankees obscured the entire extent of what MLB had determined the Yankees to have done With the letter s approaching release any discrepancies between Manfred s public assertions and his office s internal conclusions are likely to surface The Yankees argue that the harm from the unsealing of the Yankees Letter will arise because its content would be distorted to falsely and unfairly generate the confusing scenario that the Yankees had somehow violated MLB s sign stealing rules when in fact the Yankees did not the court wrote That argument however carries little weight Disclosure of the document will allow the public to independently assess MLB s conclusion regarding the internal investigation as articulated to the Yankees and the Yankees are fully capable of disseminating their own views regarding the actual content of the Yankees Letter
