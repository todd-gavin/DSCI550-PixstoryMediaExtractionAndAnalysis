Those Winter Sundays BY ROBERT HAYDEN Sundays too my father got up early and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold then with cracked hands that ached from labor in the weekday weather made banked fires blaze No one ever thanked him I d wake and hear the cold splintering breaking When the rooms were warm he d call and slowly I would rise and dress fearing the chronic angers of that house Speaking indifferently to him who had driven out the cold and polished my good shoes as well What did I know what did I know of love s austere and lonely offices The poem shows the hardworking African American population who are not even being acknowledged The author s father belongs to this population and does even smaller things for his son as well despite working hard for the earnings The author is reminiscing on a memory Robert Hayden was raised by foster parents we can see the distance between this father child relationship too This free verse poem has only lines and is split into three stanzas each with a poignancy that builds up to the final two lines Does this also raise the question does sacrifice and duty amount to love Is it because of the responsibility or is it done out of love The language conveys the intense atmosphere of that blue black cold austere brings with its seriousness a strict kind of poverty whilst lonely offices suggest that these parental acts were more a duty than a kindness
