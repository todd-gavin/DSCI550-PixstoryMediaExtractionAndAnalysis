Arjun Tendulkar son of  the greatest ever cricketer Sachin Tendulkar is finding it hard to survive in his cricketing journey.

    Arjun, whose father was once hailed as the hero of Indian cricket team is finding it difficult to make it even to his domestic team of Mumbai. Although, he was part of their squad for past 3 years he could only find place in the playing 11 for 2 games in 2 seasons of Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy.

            His first match of note was a youth under-19 match against Sri Lanka in which he took a wicket for 33 runs in 11 overs. His first Syed Mushtaq Ali  match was against Haryana where he gave 34 runs in 3 overs for a wicket which was a bad performance but considering that he was the only wicket taker in the gane we can praise him. The next game we can praise him for his economy which was only 3 after giving 12 runs in 4 overs. 

          Arjun, however soon lost his place in the squad as abundance of new talent emerged in Mumbai. Now, under these circumstances Arjun has decided to move to the Goa cricketing team for more opportunities. This can be seen as a mater stroke or a desperation move. It can be seen as a desperation move since Mumbai is filled with so many stars that Arjun could not actually face and is moving to Goa where there is less number of players. The only player of note from Goa in the last edition of Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy was Suyash Prabhudesai who impressed people after playing for RCB in IPL. Whereas, in mumbai there are many players like Tushar Deshpande, Dhawal Kulkarni and many more talented people. 

               We are not saying that Arjun is not talented. But, the pressure facing against such stiff opponents in early days of his career might be bad due to which he might have changed to Goa where it can be seen as a masterstroke.

          But, I think We can all agree here that unless Arjun's performances improve it will be very hard to make it to Indian team for him.
