Last week, when Real Madrid went to London to play against Chelsea in the UEFA Champions league’s quarterfinal, Real Madrid won that match by a 1-3 scoreline and almost secure their place in the semifinals but it’s not over until it’s over.

Today, when Chelsea will play against Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu, they have a mountain to climb if they want to reach the semifinal.

Chelsea has only one option left by which they can reach the semifinal round which is to score at least three without conceding any and if they do that aggregate score will be 4-3 and they will qualify for the next round.

On the other hand, Real Madrid will only have one target which is to score the first goal as soon as possible to increase the aggregate of two goals to three and once they will achieve this, I think the match will be over there only.

Chelsea’s manager Thomas Tuchel wants his team to play as one and don’t rely on only players because if they didn’t play like a team, three goals will be a dream for them.

On the other hand, Real Madrid’s manager Carlo Ancelotti wants only one thing from his team which is to stay compact and don’t give too much space to Chelsea because if that happens Chelsea will run past Madrid and they will score goals.

Key players for Real Madrid will be Benzema, Fede Valverde, and Nacho. Nacho will be in the team in place of Militao because Militao is suspended because of the yellow card and in the absence of Militao, Nacho has to step up and prove his worth in the team once again.

Chelsea will be reliant on their defenders and Kai hertz because Kai havertz is the only player which is in form and looks lethal in the attacking position.

As a Madrid fan, I want my team to go through but Chelsea is a team that we can’t take lightly and football is a game that we cannot predict.
