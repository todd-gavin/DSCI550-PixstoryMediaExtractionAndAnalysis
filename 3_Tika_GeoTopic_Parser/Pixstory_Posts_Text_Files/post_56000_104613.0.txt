â€ŒThe Queen was complimented for "staying the course" as royals joined dignitaries at a thanksgiving service for the Platinum Jubilee at St Paul's Cathedral.

It was the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, inferring to her love of horse racing said she is "still in the saddle", even though she was not able to attend. The Queen watched the service from Windsor Castle. Her decision was because she experienced "discomfort" during Thursday's events.

She also announced that she would not attend the Epsom Derby on Saturday - and would watch the event on television.

Prince Andrew withdrew from the Thanksgiving service after being tested positive for Covid.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined for their first royal event together since leaving the UK two years ago.

As Prince Harry and Meghan arrived in St Paul's Churchyard, they received a big cheer from the crowd.

Notable guests included Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was received with mixed responses from the crowd: boos and cheers, and his wife, Carrie.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and former prime ministers John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May were also present. 

Mr Johnson gave a reading from St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians in the New Testament, beginning: "Rejoice in the Lord always".

The sermon was given by the Archbishop of York after Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, tested positive for coronavirus.
