According to NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ poll, the majority of American voters do not want Joe Biden or Donald Trump to run in the next presidential election in 2024.

More than 60% of voters and 30% of Democrats said Biden should not run again. Among all voters, 57% said Trump should not run again. Among Republicans, that total was 26%. But most of those polled do not know who they would like to run instead, either. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, were the leading named contenders.

Biden, 79 and the oldest president ever inaugurated, has said he intends to run for a second term.“I’m a great respecter of fate,” he said in December. “Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I’m in the health I’m in now, if I’m in good health, then in fact I would run again.”

Trump has suggested he will soon declare a third presidential run, probably as a way of avoiding potential criminal charges over his election subversion efforts and the deadly Capitol attack.

Respondents in the poll were asked who they would prefer as the Democratic candidate if Biden did not run. “Someone else” attracted 44.2% support but among named alternatives the vice-president, Kamala Harris, led with 16.1%.
