Didier Drogba, a Chelsea star, is one of six presidential candidates approved to run for the
presidency of the Ivorian Football Federation (FIF) in the upcoming elections. The 44-year-old
was one of the candidates who submitted nomination papers to the Normalization Committee,
and he was finally granted the green light to run.

Confirming the news, the committee’s President Mariam Dao Gabala told a press conference as
quoted by Africa News: “The filing of candidacies for the presidency of the Ivorian football
federation is closed. Six candidates have been registered. They are: Yatte Ellele Jean-Baptiste,
Arnaud Aka, Laurent Kouakou, Idriss Diallo, Sory Diabate and Didier Drogba.”

Gabala has guaranteed a credible, free, and fair election, with the list of all contestants to be
made public on April 15.

"We are ready for these elections and we must show a good image of Cote d'Ivoire through a
peaceful election. I ask everyone not to add to the crisis,” added Gabala.

The elections are set for April 23, and Drogba, who has also played for Marseille, Guingamp,
and Galatasaray among other major European clubs, has stated that if elected, he will breathe
fresh life into Ivorian football.

“Finally here we are! I can't wait for the campaign to start. Trust me to give life to Ivorian football
if I am elected,” said Drogba.

Drogba is best renowned for his stint at Chelsea, when he scored more goals than any other
foreign player in the club's history and is currently the club's fourth-highest goalscorer. Chelsea
fans chose Drogba to their team of the decade from 2010 to 2020. In 2006 and 2009, he was
named African Footballer of the Year for the second time. Drogba was an Ivory Coast
international from 2002 to 2014, captaining the side from 2006 until his retirement, and is the
country's all-time leading goalscorer with 65 goals in 105 matches.
