When we speak of heavy metal we most prominently associate it with countries such as England, USA, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Germany, France etc. All these countries lie in the Western bloc and sport the biggest names in the genre, but what about countries not part of that geographical bloc. 
Needless to say, metal knows no boundaries and there are several countries who have a vibrant scene. Some of these countries who lie outside the West have a pretty big and vibrant scene, some places it is still growing and in some places it is very much there but is for the most part unheard of.
 In recent days, the Western metal scene has begun to grow stale, plagued by the increasing problems of repetition and unoriginal ideas while places outside have begun on to innovate on existing ideas or creating a brand of their own, bringing a level of fury and creativity that Western metal scene has tragically begun seeing a decline in.
