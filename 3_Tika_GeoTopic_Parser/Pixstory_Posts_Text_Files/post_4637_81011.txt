The UK government recently announced a dramatic U turn on the COVID vaccine mandate for healthcare workers originally scheduled to take effect on April Health or social care staff will no longer need to provide proof of vaccination to stay employed The reason as health secretary Sajid Javid made clear is that it is no longer proportionate There are several reasons why it was the right decision at this point to scrap the mandate Most notably omicron causes less severe disease than other coronavirus variants many healthcare workers have already had the virus potentially giving them immunity equivalent to the vaccine vaccines are not as effective at preventing re infection and transmission of omicron and less restrictive alternatives are available such as personal protective equipment and lateral flow testing of staff But the question remains what does this imply for vaccine mandates more generally In a Twitter thread former UK health secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed concerns that the U turn will make it harder to implement vaccine mandates in the future This might be true politically but ethically it doesn t follow Indeed this provides an opportunity to reflect on when such mandates are ethically justifiable or even required The ethical principle that justifies some forms of mandatory vaccination of health professionals remains healthcare professionals have a fundamental duty to minimise the risk of harm to patients This includes taking reasonable steps to protect patients from infection Read full story at The Conversation Image Courtesy Andy Barton Alamy Stock Photo
