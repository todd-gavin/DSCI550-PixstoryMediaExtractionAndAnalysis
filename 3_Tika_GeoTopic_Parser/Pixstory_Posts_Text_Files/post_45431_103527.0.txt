Brazilian forward Neymar declared his goals for the next season would be staying on with PSG
and winning all the titles. Reports suggest that Paris Saint-Germain are willing to listen to offers
for Neymar and selling him in the summer.

Neymar has three years left on his current deal with PSG, with the forward suggesting he has
not hit the heights with the club he had hoped to do so.

Speaking to Canal+, Neymar said, “My ambition is always the same: to win every title possible,
Play well and win the World Cup and the Champions League. These are my ambitions for next
season.

It has to be with Paris. I have a contract with PSG, so there is no choice. Yes, it will be with
PSG”
The speculation about Neymar’s future has arisen after Kylian Mbappe’s new deal, signaling
PSG have a new main man now.

However, Neymar has been incredibly happy with the new
deal, insisting it was the right move for the Frenchman. "I was very happy, very happy that
Kylian decided to stay. I think the PSG project is the right one for his career.

For his career, it's a good thing to stay a few more years at PSG. To try to win a Champions
League in his country, in the team of his city. So I think it's the right choice. Maybe he will want
to change his mind and play in another team in the future, but I think his decision to stay is the
right one. Having players like Kylian in the team is always important."
