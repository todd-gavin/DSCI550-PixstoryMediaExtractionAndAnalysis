The UEFA Nations League is back in action this week, with Poland taking on a powerful Belgium team in a crucial encounter at the Warsaw National Stadium on Tuesday.

When the two teams played on June 8, the Red Devils won 6-1, although both teams had four points from their first three League A matches in Group 4.

Belgium is now in second position in their group, having rebounded from a shaky start to the season. After being held to a 1-1 draw by Wales in their previous match, the Red Devils will need to step up this week.

Poland, on the other hand, is now in third position in the group and has had a shaky start. The hosts drew 2-2 with the Netherlands last week and will be looking to improve on that performance in this match.

Poland vs Belgium: Probable Playing XI

Belgium : Simon Mignolet; Jan Vertonghen, Dedryck Boyata, Toby Alderweireld; Thomas Meunier, Yannick Carrasco, Axel Witsel, Youri Tielemans, Kevin De Bruyne; Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku

Poland: Wojciech Szczęsny, Bartosz Bereszyński, Kamil Glik, Jan Bednarek, Matty Cash, Krystian Bielik, Piotr Zieliński, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Jacek Góralski, Karol Linetty, Robert Lewandowski.

Poland vs Belgium: Prediction

Poland will be out to avenge their big setback to Belgium in the opening round, but we're having trouble separating the two teams here. A point would not be the worst outcome for either club, and a close game on Tuesday evening may finish in a tie.

Prediction: Poland 2 - 2 Belgium
