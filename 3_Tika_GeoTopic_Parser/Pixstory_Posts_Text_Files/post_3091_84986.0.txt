The plastic problem has finally reached the United Nations, where all nations have for the first time agreed to sign by 2024 a legally binding treaty to “end plastic pollution”. Plastic, however, has become so ubiquitous and indispensable that controlling its use has been next to impossible so far except at smaller levels.

At the biennial UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi on Wednesday, 150 countries passed the resolution: https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/38522/k2200647_-_unep-ea-5-l-23-rev-1_-_advance.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y It calls for the creation of an intergovernmental negotiating committee which will work out details of a treaty on cleaning up the waste and to curb future production of the material. The move has been described as historic: https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/historic-day-campaign-beat-plastic-pollution-nations-commit-develop

The delegate from the US was teary-eyed when she said, “This is just an amazing show of what the world can do when we work together… It is the beginning of the end of the scourge of plastic on this planet. … I think we will look back on this as a day for our children and grandchildren”: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/03/02/un-adopts-historic-resolution-aimed-ending-plastic-pollution/

The US, by the way, is the biggest polluter: https://www.nap.edu/read/26132/chapter/1

A product of the industrial revolution, plastic has made life easier in its countless forms, especially in packaging. It’s cheap, so it has been equally in use in the poorest countries as in the richest. However, most kinds of plastics do not biodegrade. Plus, most are of single-use variety and its cheapness promotes a use-and-throw culture. The result: billons of tons of plastic waste piling up on the planet. Water bottles have reached the top of Mount Everest (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332220305509) and possibly the bottom of the Pacific too.

The industry argues that waste should not be seen as a problem, since it can be recycled. But only a small part gets recycled. A representative of American manufacturers has already called any plan to restrict and regulate the production of plastic “a very shortsighted approach.”

Many cities have successfully restricted plastic use locally, but the UN-proposed committee will have far broader mandate: the whole planet and the whole life-cycle of the material;, from production to waste management.
