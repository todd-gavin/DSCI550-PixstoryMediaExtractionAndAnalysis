One day, it will be your turn. You will leave
homes, cities and countries to pursue grander ambitions.

You will leave friends, lovers and
possibilities for the chance to roam the world and make deeper connections. You will defy your fear of change, hold your head high and do what you
once thought was unthinkable: walk away.

And it will be scary. At first. But what I hope you'll find in the end is that in leaving, you don't just find love,
adventure or freedom. More than anything.
you find you.
