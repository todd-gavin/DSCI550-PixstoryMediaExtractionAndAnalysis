Now that the dust has settled and the pain has lessened I think we can take a step back and assess the game for what it was As I mentioned previously we hadn t beaten United in a full Old Trafford since this was certainly never an easy game The result hurts but considering that we re still top of the league I think it s definitely one that we can stomach as a fanbase Regarding Martinelli s disallowed goal I felt we were quite harshly done by The referee saw the play pan out and didn t judge there to be enough contact for a foul to take place This was then subsequently changed once VAR determined it as a clear and obvious error and the on field referee took further inspections in slo motion My problem here is that the ref had a good view of the challenge and his instinct said it was legal only upon video inspection does this start to become lost Anyway despite having an overall pretty good performance I don t think we deserved to win the game no matter what some of our fans or xG have said Again in possession I thought we were excellent but a naiveity and lack of attention to detail positionally off the ball cost us United carved us open on numerous occasions creating big chances which is uncharacteristic for us I must say I think this was somewhat affected by the occasion and a desire to go toe to toe but it fell right into United s plan of using their pace on the counter and taking their chances which they did well Nonetheless irrespective of the criticism I didn t find the performance concerning rather just another bump in the road which is on an upwards trajectory These small errors are easy to solve and this defensive unit is still novel to us The re addition of Thomas Partey into midfield will further plug up these gaps but going into a tricky fixture schedule we re going to have to learn from this game As I say though we re still top of the league and things happen we go again PixstoryArsenal Arsenal
