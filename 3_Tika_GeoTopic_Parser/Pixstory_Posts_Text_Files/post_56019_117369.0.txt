Three candidates remain in the contest after the fourth round of voting. The final ballot of Tory MPs is due to take place on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak is leading with 118-up from 115 in the third ballot - followed by Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss.

Meanwhile, Ms. Truss has the most experience as a government minister or cabinet minister as well as overall. Ms. Mordaunt has spent more time in government than Mr. Sunak but he was in the cabinet for longer. The new prime minister is expected to be announced by 5 September.

Councillor Sunak is the name being heard as the next PM as Contenders need to bag 119 votes from Tory MPs to get into the run-off and he already has 118.

Foreign secretary Liz Truss closed the gap on Penny Mordaunt in Tuesday's vote, gaining 15 more MP votes to Mordaunt's 10.

The internet has already declared Rishi Sunak as the PM with lots of following and support for him. Even after all the flaws and controversies that he faced; he does have huge support-in UK identity matters. He belongs to the generation born in the UK but has ancestral orgins in India. Acceptance and Identity would be at the forefront with Rishi Sunak and this is what matters most.
