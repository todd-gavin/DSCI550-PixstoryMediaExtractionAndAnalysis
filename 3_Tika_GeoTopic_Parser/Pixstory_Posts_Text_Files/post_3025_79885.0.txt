Picasso’s masterpiece depicting horrors of war, ‘Guernica’, had been on display – fittingly – at the UN headquarters at New York City for decades before it was taken off last year without explanation. It made a comeback there in the weekend. The ‘steward’ of the painting, a scion of the Rockefeller family, has offered a full explanation, laying speculations to rest.

Picasso painted the 11-by-25-foot tapestry during the Spanish Civil War. It depicts the bombing of a town called Guernica on April 26, 1937: https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/apr/26/picassosguernicabattlelives

After World War II, it emerged as the most incisive visual rendering of the inhumanity of wars. It has been a cultural landmark: ‘Guernica’ is to painting what Eliot’s ‘Waste Land’ is to literature. It was exhibited at many placed, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, before it moved to a museum in Madrid in 1981.

Meanwhile, the Rockefeller family offered to buy it in 1955 but Picasso refused. What they got instead was a full-size copy. The Rockefeller estate gave that copy to the UN on loan in 1985. And it hung at the entrance to the Security Council room until February 2021. 

As Nelson A. Rockefeller Jr. got it removed abruptly, diplomats were baffled and Secretary General António Guterres was anguished: “It’s horrible, horrible, that it is gone.” 

On Saturday, the tapestry was hung in the same spot again. Rockefeller and the National Trust for Historic Preservation said it would be gifted to the trust, which will later exhibit it at various venues around the world.

When Guterres came to know of this arrangement last month, he wrote to Rockefeller: “This is most welcome news as we end a difficult year of global hardship and strife. The Guernica tapestry speaks to the world about the urgent need to advance international peace and security. We are honored to serve as careful stewards of this one-of-a-kind iconic work – as we draw inspiration from its message”: https://media.un.org/en/asset/k18/k18lq6mpm7


Rockefeller says ‘Guernica’ was removed last year only for cleaning and preservation, and the controversy was the result of “miscommunication”: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/world/americas/guernica-tapestry-un-rockefeller.html
