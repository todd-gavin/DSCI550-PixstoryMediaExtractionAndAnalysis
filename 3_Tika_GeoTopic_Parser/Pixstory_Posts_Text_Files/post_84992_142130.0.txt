DM- Sergio Busquets

Suppose Barcelona is going to replace one of their reliable defensive midfielders. In thatcase, they will have a difficult time finding a successor for Busquets, who has been stalled inthat position, and no player has ever supplanted him until now.

Mr Consistent has made 708 appearances for Barcelona and has twice won the treble.
Barcelona will undoubtedly struggle to find a replacement for Busquets once he finds a new
club or retires from football.
CM- Xavi

A La Masia product who rose through the youth ranks to become one of Europe's bestmidfielders. He has served as a role model for La Masia's young players, who have thepotential to break into the first team.
The dominant midfielder made his senior team debut in 1998, and since then he has wonthree Champions Leagues and finished three times in the Ballon d'Or standings. In hisBarcelona career, he has 85 goals and 185 assists to his name in 767 appearances.He left the club in 2015 and later returned as manager.

CM - Andres Iniesta

Iniesta, like Xavi, has left his mark on Barcelona's history books. The three-time ChampionsLeague winner and nine-time La Liga champion wowed us with his midfield prowess. Iniestahas registered 138 assists and 57 goals, having featured in 674 games for Barcelona.
When Pep Guardiola saw Iniesta playing at the youth level for Barcelona, he told Xavi, "Youwill retire me, but this kid will retire us both." He was a club lynchpin, and his contribution inevery game for Barcelona earned him a distinct level of respect in the club.
