Indian National team head coach Igor Stimac took on a very unique topic head-on in a recent press conference. The Croatian talked about how cricket and its popularity have interfered in scheduling the Indian football calendar over the years. 

In recent years, the Indian Super League generally starts in mid-November and concludes around mid-March. Hence the whole league stretches out to around 4-5 months. Games are usually held throughout the week with a fixture being held every day, unlike the European model where leagues are played generally over the weekends. 

The ISL usually ends in March before the start of the cash-rich Indian Premier League. This issue has been talked about by the fans over the years, but it certainly shocked quite a few people when Igor Stimac brought it out so bravely. 

As per the Indian Express, Igor Stimac said, "I rather speak about problems instead of keeping quiet. Things need to be sorted out about the football calendar, which is still being adjusted with regards to IPL and broadcasting… This needs to stop if we want to make football great in India. Football calendar should not depend on other things.”

Longer leagues would certainly help the players improve their fitness and help them move on to the European leagues in the long term. However, Starsports, the official broadcasters of the ISL are looking more towards the TRP ratings as of now.
