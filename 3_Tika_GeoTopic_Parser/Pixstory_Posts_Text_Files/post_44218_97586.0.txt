Gianfranco Zola

Chelsea fans will be aware with Zola's post-Stamford Bridge career as one of the club's greatest
players. Before the defeat to West Ham in December 2021, he was last seen swearing on BT
Sport.

Tore Andre Flo

Flo was a good striker in the late 1990s, despite a stumbling time at Sunderland, and scored 50
goals in four seasons at Chelsea.

The Norway international retired in 2012 after playing for Rangers, Leeds United, and MK Dons.

He was Chelsea's loans director until December 2021, when he was named manager of
Sogndal, a Norwegian second-tier club.

Mark Nicholls

During his seven years with Chelsea, Nicholls was a bit-part player who made 52 appearances
before ending his career with a number of lower-league clubs. He was most last seen as the
manager of FC Clacton Town, when he resigned in October 2021.

Gianluca Vialli

Vialli only scored 21 Premier League goals in three seasons at Chelsea, but his impact on the
club was considerably greater than those numbers suggest. After taking over from the
dismissed Ruud Gullit in January 1998, the Italian was Chelsea's player-manager when he
scored twice against Oldham.

Before being fired in 2000, he won the Cup Winners Cup, League Cup, European Super Cup,
and FA Cup with Chelsea. Vialli resigned down from managing after a brief stint in command of
Watford and became a Sky Italia analyst. In 2020, he beat pancreatic cancer and was a
member of Italy's coaching staff at Euro 2020.
