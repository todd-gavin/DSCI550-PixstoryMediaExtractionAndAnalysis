When Faroe Islands hosts Luxembourg on Tuesday, they will be looking for their first win of the current UEFA Nations League season.


Luc Holtz's team will now focus on Tuesday's away match against a nation that is 30 places behind them in the FIFA global rankings, following their away day victory against Lithuania.

Luxembourg will be hopeful of a winning outcome on Tuesday, since they have only lost one of their past five Nations League games.


In their most recent match, the Faroe Islands defeated Martin Stocklasa's Liechtenstein 1-0. Patrik Johannesen of Keflavik scored in the first half to secure the victory for Hakan Ericson's Faroe Islands.
