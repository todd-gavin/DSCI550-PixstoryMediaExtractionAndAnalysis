This Indian sport is the opposite of tug of war. In the latter, you pull the opponents to your side and in the former, you push them out of a ring-shaped boundary.

Insuknawr is a sport of the aboriginals of Mizoram in North East India.

Two players hold on to a wooden rod and try to push each other out of the boundary in a set of rounds each lasting for 60 seconds.

This sport requires the players to have hulk-like strength and stamina to push the opponent out of a circle which is 16 to 18 ft. in diameter.

Traditionally, the wooden rod used to be a pestle called a suk is used by women to husk rice.

Several unusual sports were devised by the natives of Mizoram that involved the suk yet the popularity of Insuknawr beat them all.
