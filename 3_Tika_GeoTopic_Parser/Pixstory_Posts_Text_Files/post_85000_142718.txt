Tottenham conceded two last minute goals and suffered their first defeat of the season away to Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League Spurs largely dominated proceedings and created multiple opportunities but failed to take any of them They looked set to earn a point in Sporting which would have been a good result as a point away in Europe is considered to be solid as long as the team takes advantage of their home ties Paulinho headed home for Sporting in the st minute of the second half and Arthur Gomes finished off Spurs hopes with a brilliant low strike to make it Tottenham are currently second in their group behind leaders Sporting and must ensure they bounce back with a positive result in their next group game Richarlison put the ball in the net in the first half after he rounded the Sporting keeper but this then ruled out for offside The Brazilian was involved heavily in the second half but failed to convert his chances Antonio Adan must be give huge praise for Sporting s win after he denied strikes from Emerson Royal and Harry Kane Spurs proved to pay for their missed chances dearly but they did play good football and probably deserved to at least come away from the game with a point Antonio Conte was a frustrated man in his post match interview and stated We had two or three situations we can do much better in as he dissected the defeat He was also of the belief that his side should have scored Spurs currently sit third in the Premier League and have made a good start to the season therefore this defeat should not be too damaging While the nature of the defeat will surely deflate them they are still second in the group and are in a good position to advance to the next stage
