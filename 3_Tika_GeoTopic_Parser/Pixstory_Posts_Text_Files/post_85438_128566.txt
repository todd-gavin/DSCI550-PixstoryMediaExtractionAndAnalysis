Rep Liz Cheney R Wyo who just suffered a point defeat in her GOP primary on Tuesday floated the idea of running for president in on NBC s Today show One might argue that this is brave move but there are also some saying that this move will bear no fruit The Washington Post reported that Cheney has previously mentioned the prospect but on Wednesday she said she wasn t especially offended by her party s historic reprimand She also swiftly changed her House campaign into a leadership committee with the intention of blocking Trump in Let keep in mind that the campaign is quite close even in the best case scenario for Cheney a scenario in which she is shrewdly playing the long game and betting on Trump s ultimate demise The initial campaigns will probably start soon as Cheney pointed out Despite the fact that Trump has a number of legal issues and there are indications that GOP voters may choose someone else as their next nominee such as Florida Gov Ron DeSantis R there are also few signs of a significant anti Trump shift within the party It s also possible that Cheney is only using this supposition for political purposes as many politicians do Let s see what happens next Source
