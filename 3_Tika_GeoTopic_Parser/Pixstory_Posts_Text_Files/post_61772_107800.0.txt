Warriors are leading the NBA Finals series 3-2 as of this writing. 

They have been the favorites to win the series, ever since the beginning of the finals. But the road has been a tumultuous one for them, as they lost their first game, and barely kept their hopes alive throughout the series. 

Warriors only got their lead in the series in the last match, when they defeated Celtics to take the lead for the first time in the series. Warriors are in the driving seat right now, and they are in a very good position to win it all from here. 

As of this writing, the game 6 has started, and at end of the first quarter, Warriors are ahead 27-22, certainly bossing the proceedings. Curry and teammates would love to win the series here rather than play the next game under pressure in front of the home crowd. 

Hopefully by the end of the day, we would have crowned new BA champions
