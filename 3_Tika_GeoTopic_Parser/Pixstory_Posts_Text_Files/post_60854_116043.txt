I am extremely fond of plants and animals Christ s campus turns splendid whenever it rains All the trees and plants gives the campus a refreshing makeover during Bangalore s routine showers The weather naturally becomes chilly here because of the rain and jackets and sweatshirts become a common sight after the rains On my way to the library after my morning classes I spotted this little one sneaking in some warmth at the hollow of this tree This cat s pretty well known for trotting around the campus getting pats and treats from students everywhere I m glad our campus is quite animal friendly
