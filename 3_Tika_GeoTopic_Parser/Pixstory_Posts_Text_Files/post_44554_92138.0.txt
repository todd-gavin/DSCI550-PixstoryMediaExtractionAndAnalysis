The Snow Lion and the Dragon:
Tibet-China Relations continues....

In the spring and early summer of 1214 CE, Chinggis Khan besieged Beijing, then known as Zhongdu. The Jin emperor suggested an agreement whereby the Mongols would withdraw with honour: the giving of plenty of tribute to the Mongols, and the emperor recognizing himself as a vassal of Chinggis Khan, cementing the settlement by giving one of his own daughters to Chinggis as a wife. However, as soon as the Mongols had withdrawn, he reneged on the agreement by shifting his capital south to Kaifeng, which Chinggis considered to be an act of betrayal of their new alliance, and thus a rebellion. 

He was furious, and came back in the winter from Inner Mongolia with his armies, blockading the city all through the cold season of 1214-15 CE. Beijing was starved into surrender, and, after its citizens had been forced to resort to cannibalism, finally opened its gates on 31st May 1915. The enraged Chinggis put the inhabitants of the city to the sword and burned it to the ground. Even a year later, it was reported by an envoy from the Khwarizm Shah of Bukhara that the ground for miles around the capital remained greasy and dark from human fat.

It is difficult to justify by any logic the present-day Chinese position that Chinggis Khan and Kublai Khan were Chinese. Certainly the historical record does not suggest that either Chinggis or his grandson thought of themselves as Chinese.
