Justin Bieber spoke that he has Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which has left him unable to move half of his face and unable to perform on stage, in a video shared to his verified Instagram account.

“It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis," he said in the video. 

Then he proceeded to show the movements in his face which he could only make at one side of it. “As you can see this eye is not blinking. I can’t smile on this side of my face; this nostril will not move. So there’s full paralysis on this side of my face," he said.

The 28-year-old musician is presently on his Justice tour in North America, but shows in Toronto, Washington, DC, and New York have been cancelled.
