Some people find it very motivating to look at before & after pictures of themselves and others. It can be a source of motivation for yourself if you want to check your progress. 

But in other cases, they can be very toxic. Usually, the before picture looks sad, and depressed and is taken in the worst pose and lighting possible, while the after picture is all smiles and good lighting. This associates being at a higher weight with being unhappy and being at a lower weight with being very happy. 

The truth is, we never know what happens behind
the scenes. How did that person get to that weight? Was it by starving themselves every day? By depriving
themselves of social interactions? By working out till they feel lethargic? How is their relationship with food now? Are they binge eating after a long period of restriction? Are they now scared of certain foods? Are they afraid to gain all the weight back? These are never reflected in the after pictures. The only thing the world sees is that they are now happy because of their weight loss. 

This also reinforces the idea that it does not matter how we feel inside as long as we are thin and we look happy from the outside, which is a dangerous belief to have. For the person who sees the pictures, they feel like a failure, compare themselves and
wonder why they do not have the willpower to achieve
something similar. 

Both parties do not feel their best, so it is safe to say that before & after pictures are quite toxic (especially for people who are susceptible to having an eating disorder/poor body image).
