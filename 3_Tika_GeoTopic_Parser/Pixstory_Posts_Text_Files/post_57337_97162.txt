The COVID pandemic has brought many changes in our lives The uncertainty and unprecedented happenings surrounding us have made lives utterly different from those in pre pandemic times The situation has certainly become better as the cases of covid ebbed and people began attaining the lost state of normalcy But still the uncertainty hasn t left us with different variants rising again With this vagueness present in our surroundings many became the culprit of the time warp Distortion in time has many reasons Being stuck in our homes and not being able to do the things it was done before the pandemic is traumatic for many We lost our routines and hence we lost track of time Trapped in a room with an abundance of time in our hands we seemed to cancel our activities and the routine we followed earlier Without daily routines it became easy to get lost in time As a result the things that made our day fulfilled were incomplete The best way to mitigate the feeling of being stuck in a time warp is to create new routines that would help everyone keep track of time while keeping us focused The number of activities one is engaged in would influence one perception of time The busier a person becomes the less he focuses on passing the time
