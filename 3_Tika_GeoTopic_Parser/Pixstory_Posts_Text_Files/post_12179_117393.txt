This is a beautiful poem which I found on college life As we hit college we are lost in society We hit a point of endless anxiety All the pressure starts to kick in as we try to fit in when the real us seems to be trippin I enjoy the nice cafeteria food every minute I m not cramming but when my vacation time comes the cafe hits some type of famine After it hits students appetites start to become common in a sense that our diet is centered on top ramen The sleepless nights start adding up As our old hello turns in to what up Us homies start going clubbin but somehow end up in nevada after some envious troublin Our old playing of sports become a intriguing game of stratego and the more we start to win the bigger gets our ego As the freedom hits as we become too old Our common defeat phrase becomes Dangit I fold The laws leaves a certified note that we are now eligible to vote well excuse me Mr Govenator but I d rather milk a goat During this time life is so so Until we find that our old best friend is now a homo You d think at this point I could reach for the stars But freakin Avis wont let me rent a stinkin car That ticks my clock and makes me pissed It starts to excite my anger catalyst So us young adults may not be completely free But at least us poor students gets all the adult debris Trevor Schulte
