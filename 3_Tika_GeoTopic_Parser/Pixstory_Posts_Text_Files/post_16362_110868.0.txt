Actor and travel blogger Shenaz Treasury has revealed on her Instagram Stories that she suffers from a medical condition called prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness. In a series of Instagram Stories, Shenaz explained that she had recently been diagnosed with the cognitive disorder and is now able to understand the reason she has trouble recognizing faces and voices, even of people she has known for a while. She's often considered "aloof" and "snobbish" because of her inability to recognize or correctly identify people. "This is a real brain issue," Shenaz Treasury wrote, urging others to "be kind."
