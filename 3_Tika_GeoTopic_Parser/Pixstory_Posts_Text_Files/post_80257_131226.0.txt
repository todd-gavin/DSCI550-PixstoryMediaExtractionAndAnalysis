The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the world's oldest and arguably the most potent international security organization. NATO was established in 1949 by the North Atlantic Treaty signed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada. 

The treaty established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was created to protect the peace and stability of Europe by deterring aggression against any member countries. 

All NATO members must sign and ratify the treaty to join the alliance. As the "founding document of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," the agreement is regarded as such. The organization is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. Jens Stoltenberg serves as the NATO Secretary General at the moment.

NATO has 28 members as of 2018. The members are Albania, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United States, and the United Kingdom. 

NATO was initially formed to help keep peace in Europe during the Cold War. However, NATO has since expanded to become the world's most powerful military alliance and defence organization.
