A photo allegedly featuring BTS‘s V and BLACKPINK‘s Jennie has been making the rounds online. Given that the two are members of top K-Pop groups in the world, the rumors have taken the public by storm.

According to the original uploader, the two stars were spotted riding a car with untinted windows on Jeju Island. This comes after news that Jennie and her rumored boyfriend BIGBANG‘s G-Dragon have broken up. Their relationship had never been confirmed.

Some fans argued that the picture was edited, while others insisted that it is raw footage. Jennie’s label, YG Entertainment, neither confirmed nor denied the allegations in a statement to the media outlet, Chosun.

They argued that the dating rumor is being used to distract the public from the recent bullying scandal of Garam from HYBE‘s and Source Music‘s new girl group, LE SSERAFIM.
