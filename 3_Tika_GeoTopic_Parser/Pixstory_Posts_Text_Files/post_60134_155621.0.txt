In Pakistan's Balochistan province, a former high court chief justice was assassinated on Friday in front of a mosque, according to authorities.
Muhammad Noor Meskanzai was shot by assailants outside a mosque in the Kharan neighbourhood, critically wounding him, according to Kharan Superintendent of Police Asif Halim.
After being transported to a neighbouring hospital, the former chief justice reportedly passed away from his wounds.
Balochistan's chief minister, Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, expressed condolences and praised the "fearless judge" for his "unforgettable" services.
The nation cannot be intimidated, according to Bizenjo, despite the "cowardly attacks of the opponents of peace."
In a key decision, authored by Maskanzai, the Sharia was ruled to be incompatible with the Riba-based banking system.
Ajmal Khan Kakar, president of the Quetta Bar Association (QBA), strongly denounced Muskanzai's murder. He claimed that the passing of the former judge had severely devastated every Pakistani citizen.
