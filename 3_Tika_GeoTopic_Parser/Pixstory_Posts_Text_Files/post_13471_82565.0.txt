We are war-torn, over-erroneous, anxious, obsessive, and so on. Of human emotional possibilities, our share of negative and unpleasant emotions is greater. Deprivation of positive emotions has created a deep resentment towards them in us. True, if we have a hand in speech and writing, we describe love and happiness a lot, but if we see the real example of love around us, we react immediately, and we train a thousand reasons for making enemies with it: culture It's western, it's prostitution, it's dishonesty, it's slavery, and wow. Our balance in valuing real existence and emotional potential is disturbed, we have little happiness, we have little love, we have little appreciation, we have little smile.
From an early age, our children grow up with anxiety, fear and anxiety, the consequences of which are clear at the sheriff's level: the war on love. What is Western culture? Did you make the Kalashnikov that you hold in your hand and scare people with? Is your group and ideology originally your own, or is it the result of rivalries between world powers and their expansionist programs?
We are the eaters of the dominant world cultures, the fact that we accept Western-style killing and we do not accept love is due to the same imbalance that has made our minds and psyches the home of violence and anger.
The place of love and happiness in our culture and psyche is empty.
