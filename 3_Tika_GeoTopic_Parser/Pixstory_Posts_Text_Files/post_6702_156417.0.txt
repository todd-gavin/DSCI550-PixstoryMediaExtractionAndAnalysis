A 25-second-long video clip of a group of men, who appear to be Muslims, breaking the gates of a structure is widely circulating on social media. This viral clip is being shared on social media with the claim that Muslims in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur demolished an ancient Hindu temple.
Twitter user @yogeshDharmSena shared the clip with a caption in Hindi that can be translated as, “Jihadis demolish ancient temple in Andhra Pradesh 😡 Wake up Hindus, wake up this is happening in independent India…”

Author and freelance columnist Anshul Pandey also shared the clip on Twitter with similar claims. The user later alleged that Twitter forcibly deleted his tweets. (Archive.)
Columnist Tarek Fatah quote-tweeted Anshul Pandey’s original tweet which was apparently ‘forcibly’ deleted by Twitter. Tarek wrote, “Smashing a 40-year-old Hindu Temple in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.” Tarek Fatah has a history of spreading communally charged misinformation.
Like Fatah, another Twitter user, @MrSinha_, who also has a history of sharing misinformation, tweeted about the incident. Sinha did not share the viral clip in his tweet.
Users @arpispeaks, @IVijay_Pathak, @sudhirshiv567, @Chitransh57, @FltLtAnoopVerma and @TriShool_Achukamong others have shared the viral clip with similar captions.

We performed several searches in Telugu using relevant keywords and came across multiple videos related to the incident on Facebook. Shaik Nagul Meera, whose bio says that he is the zonal in-charge of BJP’s minority in Andhra Pradesh, had shared a series of updates related to the matter.
In a video he shared on his Facebook page on October 13, he referred to the religious structure as Dargah ‘Hazrat bajibaba Nishan’. The Facebook post does not identify the structure as a temple. However, it does say that Hindu-Muslim sentiments are attached to the place.
Alt News reached out to Shaik Nagul Meera who told us over phone that there were several symbols in the place that signified the existence of a Dargah. He said, “some anti-social elements came here and demolished these structures with the intention to build a mosque there. The news spread all over the locality and the police were informed.”
