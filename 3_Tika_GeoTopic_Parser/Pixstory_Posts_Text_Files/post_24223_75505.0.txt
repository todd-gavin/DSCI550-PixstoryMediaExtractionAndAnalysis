Villagers of Khampur in Delhiâ€™s Alipur are keeping 24-hour strict vigil, not because they fear any harm to themselves but to a tree which they say is 120-year-old. This banyan tree was allegedly trimmed by some unidentified people, while the villagers were asleep.

The local residents of the village informed that they have an emotional connection with the tree as it has been part of their life and is worshipped during festivals. Residents claim that the local mafia is responsible for this act.

Ajay Kumar, a local resident whose family has lived in the area for generations, informed that the villagers have been guarding the tree ever since the incident and that police had told them not to take the law in their hands and report immediately any untoward activity concerning the tree. Villagers are also planning to meet the District Magistrate and other civic bodies.
