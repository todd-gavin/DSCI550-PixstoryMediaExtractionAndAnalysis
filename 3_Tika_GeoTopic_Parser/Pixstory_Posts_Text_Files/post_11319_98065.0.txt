New study's have developed for children with Down Syndrome. As per National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), 60% of children with Down syndrome have been continuously experiencing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

Usually CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) devices or other surgery could be solved for those who have symptoms of sleep apnea. But for children this was less effective. 

The new research in JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surgery have found an implanted device I'd helpful to decrease sleep disruptions that's due to the condition among adolescents who are living with Down syndrome. 

Nerve stimulator to combat sleep apnea 

The experts conducted a test on the device that was conducted in a phase I among adolescents with Down syndrome. 

The implanted device is known as hypoglossal nerve stimulator, it was tested among 42 participants who was experiencing obstructive sleep apnea in five U.S. medical centers. 

Post one year 66 percent of the participants responded well to the treatment. 

Study discovers that there was 51 percent reduction in apnea events that happen per hour, the quality of life surveys that were filled by parents who reported great improvements in their child's ability to function, language and behaviour. 

In the study the most discomfort experienced by the individual was tongue discomfort that was faced by 5 participants which got sorted in weeks.
