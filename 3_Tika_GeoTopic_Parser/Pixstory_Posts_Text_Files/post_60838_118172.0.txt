Reading Films is one of my favourite classes this semester. It's a practical course (like most other media subjects) and has no theory paper we need to write.

I love the way we are taught the class. Although there's a lot of cinema history one can learn from books, the actual essence of a practical course like this is to watch films and make your own assessments. Our professor shows us movies and videos of shots taken from various genres and explains the elements involved.

It is fun to watch movies and then making inferences that facilitate class discussions. I have had a lot of practical subjects that involve too much theory learning. Although theory is important but practical and skill building courses should be taught practically. For example, in this case the best way to learn the film studies subject is to watch the execution and then breaking it down into parts to understand how it is made from scratch. This improves our analytical, problem-solving and discussion skills.

A lot of universities put emphasis on theoretical learning. However, in today's world, specific skills are more practical and in demand. If more universities design curriculums that focus on building certain skill sets then that would save a lot of time and effort. It would also teach students to apply their skills in various fields instead of just one to increase their job prospects.
