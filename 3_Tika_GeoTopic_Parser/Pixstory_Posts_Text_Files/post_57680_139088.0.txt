I think you mean that there should be a change in how schools teach, but that doesn't imply that school is a waste of time and money.
No matter how far one goes in enumerating the disadvantages, it will still not justify that school is a waste.
Schools are where a person not only learns history, arithmetic or science but also where their most precious years are renounced to make them a better person.
The fundamental values that shape their nature are built in school.
It is more of practical learning, which eventually happens even if the tainted education system doesn't allow it to occur.
And to mention it correctly, the students are not compelled to study all the subjects. Instead, it's a procedure where you enter the chaos of this big world and explore, then learn what you are interested in.
Education provides opportunities and better choices to people, in the long run, to decide what they want to do with their careers.
Furthermore, all social development occurs at the early stages of schooling, so calling school waste is not at all appropriate.
