Liverpool have officially released goalkeeper Loris Karius after his contract expired with the club.

Perhaps most infamous for his performance in the Champions League final in 2018, Karius has
struggled to find form throughout the rest of his Liverpool career, spending it on loan at different
clubs until the end of his contract.

A free agent now, Karius has the opportunity to start afresh, perhaps salvage his Premier League career and prove his doubters wrong. Or Karius could choose to stay as a second choice at a Premier League club, spending time on the bench and playing in cup competitions.

Where his career will shape up, is in the hand of Loris Karius. Here are the following Premier
League clubs that could look to bring Karius onboard:

1. Newcastle United

Newcastle United will be very busy in the transfer market, having new found money to spend
after their takeover last season. However, one position they must definitely strengthen is their
goalkeeping quality. For now, Newcastle have Martin Dubravka and Karl Darlow as their senior
goalkeepers with Dubravka the number 1 choice at the club.

While it would be difficult for Karius
to replace Dubravka who has often carried the club over the line in certain matches, he could
certainly edge Darlow in spot for the second goalkeeper.

With Eddie Howe believing in rotating keepers for cup fixtures, Karius would get playing time to
prove himself if he wants to stake a claim into the first eleven for Newcastle United.

Newcastle
United would be an exciting place for Karius to be if they get their transfers right, as the club has
been on an upward trajectory since the signing of manager Eddie Howe.
