Men if you are unsure about what you need to do in these times here s where you can start Believe the women who are coming forward even if the claims are against your friends or family Don t question why they didn t come forward sooner The least you can do is listen and believe them now Do not make sexual jokes or any jokes at all about women which is just scratching the surface right now If someone accuses YOU of moderate harassment inappropriate jokes gestures of basically being a douche take time to reflect understand apologize profusely and use this as moment for self growth Don t get defensive if you see women use the blanket term all men to address their stories Even if you are an outlier I bet you have been in a room where a guy said something inappropriate and you choose to stay quiet So yes you are part of the problem Don t participate in conversations which talk about women in a degrading manner Heck be the man who asks others to stop even This one will probably be difficult for a lot of Indian men but try and stop talking to your friends with mother sister cursing Clean your language clean your mind TheycallmeNari theycallmenari com
