The new trailer for Marvel s upcoming Black Panther Wakanda Forever from the initial looks seems like the perfect way to pay tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman who played Black Panther in the MCU and tragically passed away in Not showing much of anything and at the same time showing enough the trailer conveys a perfect sense of grief that has swept in Wakanda following the loss of their king T Challa and how there is a sense of loss as well as lack of direction for the future of the African nation Unlike standard MCU movies whose trailers often overdose on useless humour and cringe filed jokes to unnecessarily lighten up the tone and make it kid friendly the trailer for Wakanda Forever carries with it a sense of darkness and sorrow paying tribute to a fallen hero while at the same time looking hopefully towards the horizon for the prospects of a better future Now we only have to see if Marvel does not apply its standard MCU disaster formula to the final product and turn it into something like Captain Marvel or She Hulk by inserting some woke ideology instead of simply focusing on the future of Black Panther now that king T Challa is gone The trailer seems controlled in the right manner carrying with it an overtone of respect Black Panther s movie was far from the best Marvel movie but Chadwick Boseman sure as hell was a great actor and a great Black Panther and will be missed as he passed away way too early
