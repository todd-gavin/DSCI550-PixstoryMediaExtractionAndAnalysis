Sparks at the Athletics Championships concluded yesterday in Rieti In the men&#39;s high jump the title went to the great favorite Gianmarco Tamberi The Olympic champion had to suffer quite a bit by conquering first place only after beating Marco Fassinotti in the play-off, exceeding the quota of m The tensions they didn&#39;t finish with the end of the competition when the Piedmontese approached to shake his rival Tamberi&#39;s hand he pushed him away in a bad way it was Gimbo himself who explained the reason for his anger It was me who tried to greet him and he, like the others times in the past he addressed me with an unfortunate phrase You can&#39;t jump anymore he said to me knowing full well that my only goal for the day was to go much higher The gold medalist in Tokyo got a yellow card for unsporting behavior For his part Fassinotti explained I heard he was asking us to continue for the play-off to clarify the situation for him without getting further nervous I just told him I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible Everyone, however, saw how it went I didn&#39;t even bother doing what he wanted as always But we are adults i even asked that they not be given yellow that for me what happened was not a problem Not nice for an olympic champion
