But I think technology can make everything easier, and that's what it does with reading.
E-books are a far better option to choose; they don't need a bag for carrying all your paper books; instead, a device is enough.
Besides, we can just download e-books in a matter of minutes; there's no visiting the shop thing. Also, there are no time or place constraints.
It just makes everything easier.
For a bookworm like me, there's always an urge to read new books, and once it ends, you need another, and it goes on.
But with paper books, we need a whole library which makes it more difficult as we can't keep it all; whereas e-books don't come with these issues, you can make your digital library and save countless of them.
Also, as a bonus, some e-book apps allow you to highlight the quotations, search for the word by just clicking on it and just make a note on whatever para or line you want. It's all so handy and easy.
I don't think I would choose a book over an e-book.
