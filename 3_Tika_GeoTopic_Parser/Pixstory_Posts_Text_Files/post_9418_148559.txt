Lori Vallow was a loving and caring mother until she started believing in a new God and dark demons residing in the bodies dear to her She made a list of such bodies and set plans to eliminate them At the court Lori remained cool in a casual baba suit and in weird make up as quoted by her son Colby He speaks more in the tight three part docuseries based on a true event still under trial Raised a Mormon how she fell into the doomsday trap is not clear to even her closest family But the influence of Chad Daybell an author she met in obsessed with this ideology is evident A group of people involved in this believed world would end in and did early preparations to welcome it Lori Wallow s original voice and texts were gripping across the episodes Long conversations taken from close circles are patterned in real life events series But I didn t feel that lag in Skye Borgman s direction I was thinking how they would extend those accounts to six episodes but it rightly ended in three making it precise and electrifying Lori seemed a vibrant lady married five times and firm about her new religion During inquiries she could win the cops and often divert the case Her podcasts were powerful enough to woo followers similar to Chad You would wonder at the pace of insane things happening in a family oriented lady s life and how easily she could plan to kill her own children JJ and Tylee JJ was an adopted autistic kid All in the family loved him so much we can relate in live videos in the series When the US police and the media repeatedly asked Lori and Chad where are the kids both refused to respond and continued their cool life In a small critical conversation between them when the cops started digging the pit in the backyard of Chad s property I was surprised at their mutual coordination and understanding How fast an evil connection could influence and lead Lori to terrifying actions
