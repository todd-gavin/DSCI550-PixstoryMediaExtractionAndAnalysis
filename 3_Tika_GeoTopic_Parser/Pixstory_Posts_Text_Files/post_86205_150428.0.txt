I agree with you so much. Indians still believe periods to be dirty and impure and for what reason I'd never understand. 
Discrimination against menstruating women is widespread in india and this discrimination is not just tossed out to us by men, but even women. Other women, our mothers, grandmothers, aunts, women who jave been through the same things as we do discriminate against menstruating women in the name of "traditions". The hush hush about periods, the "mandir mein nahi jaa sakti ho", the no permission to go to kitchen mandate, and your own family avoiding you and making you feel like a lesser human is what having a period means in india. 
The sheer unawareness about period hygiene is disturbing. The fact that only 36% of menstruating women use pads makes it even worse.
Hope the taboo around periods reduces soon.
