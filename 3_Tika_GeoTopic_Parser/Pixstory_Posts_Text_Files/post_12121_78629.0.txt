From February 4, Aussie travellers can once again fly into Bali, after the popular Indonesian holiday island announced it is dropping its strict border restrictions.

Today's announcement, reported by Reuters, will see Bali open its borders to all of the world after initially only allowing in people from New Zealand, China, Japan and a small number of other countries from October last year.

However, in news that will likely stop a rush of Aussies booking a Bali holiday, vaccinated travellers will have to quarantine for five days.

Unvaccinated travellers must quarantine for seven days.

Due to strict coronavirus border control measures and a closed airport, Bali went from receiving millions of international visitors to welcoming a paltry 45 in 2021.

Bali received 6.2 million international arrivals in 2019 and 1.05 million in 2020. Around 1.2 million Australians visited Bali in 2019, more than any other nationality in the world.

According to World Health Organisation data, Indonesia recorded 10,100 COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours.

Other popular Asian tropical destinations Thailand and the Philippines are slowly opening up to the world again.

In October, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce predicted travel to Bali would resume by early 2022 "at the latest".

At the time, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said travel between Australia and Indonesia had been a "regular discussion" between himself and Indonesian President Joko Widodo throughout the pandemic.
