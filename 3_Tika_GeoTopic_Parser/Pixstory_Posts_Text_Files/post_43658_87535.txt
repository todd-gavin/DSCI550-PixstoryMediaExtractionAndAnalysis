K pop fans usually hold events for their favorite K pop idols These gatherings take place at nice caf s or other similar venues Most often than not caf s in South Korea have a first come first serve basis This is to ensure that there would be no conflicts of schedule among K pop fans and their idols But one caf from Hongdae named Caf Yellow Birthday has gone under fire for rejecting client bookings based on the K pop artist they want to surprise Eagle eyed fans were convinced ATINYS were the ones that tried to book the shop but they were rejected But other than ATEEZ s fans other fandoms also shared their awful experiences with the caf One of them posted their conversation with the store owner The customer asked if specific dates were still available for booking Initially the caf owner said yes before asking who the booking was for But when the fan told them the name of the K pop artist they plan to surprise the owner suddenly had a change of heart and said that they were fully booked Others also shared the strict rules customers need to follow if they want to host an event at Caf Yellow Birthday They said an USD down payment should be given to the caf but this amount will no longer be returned if less than people attend the event Additionally if there are cakes left in stock after the event the person that booked the venue should be responsible for buying them all No bottled drinks will be sold if the number of guests is below
