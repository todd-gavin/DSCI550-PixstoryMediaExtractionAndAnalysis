Where there is no nasty hatred and greed Where the mind is free from fear and weed Where there is no malaise and violence Where there is no ego and arrogance Where there is no anger and jealousy Sure there is peace and poise fine harmony Religions teach me to spread love and peace Little I care for what they teach with ease Who can bring this here and now pure and sure What can bring this nectar to more and more Noble poets with wisdom and passion Poetry with vision and devotion Krishna and Buddha Jesus and Prophet Gave message of love and peace to trumpet Lincoln Gandhi Mandela and many Did trumpet to follow with dignity Through the noble wings of poetry pure Tagore and Dr Krishna won our hearts sure Daisaku great apostle of world peace Five decades and more efforts not to cease To serve the Poetry World with deep ease God bless him with hundred years with grace
