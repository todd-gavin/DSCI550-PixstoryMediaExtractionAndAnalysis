Are we forgetting that using phones comes with its own sets of issues, especially among kids? While I understand all the points that have been made in this thread in favor and against the allowing of phones in schools, including yours, there's one thing that's not sitting right with me â€” using phones to teach kids.

There are projectors for creative learning, kids don't need their eyes in the phones to learn. Especially on school time. Have we forgotten just how many physical and mental health issues did internet schooling give to children around the world?

I don't think kids need any more screentime than required, in fact I don't think kids need any compulsory screentime at all. Their health is more important than efficiency in learning.

I also think phones make kids anti social. They don't talk among themselves or play. It takes away social skills and prevents them from socializing.
