Wow. Weâ€™ve done it. What a win. What a performance. I feel so lucky to have been there. Letâ€™s get straight in to some player ratingsâ€¦Ramsdale - 7 - Made a really nice save early on (although Richarlison was offside). Conceded only to a penalty.Zinchenko - 6 - Not his best performance but not bad.Gabriel - 5 - Made the mistake for the penalty but recovered well after.Saliba - 9 - MOTM - That was a perfect performance. Wow. He is absolutely incredible.White - 8 - Heâ€™s really, really good. Always feel confident when heâ€™s defending.Partey - 8.5 - Excellent performance, excellent goal.Xhaka - 9 - At fault in the build up to the Sp*rsâ€™ goal, but excellent otherwise. Got another goal - heâ€™s a real threat.Ã˜degaard - 7 - Wasnâ€™t the most influential but moved the ball nicely. Always presses well.Martinelli - 8 - He is so, so good. Always a threat, had the Sp*rs defenders on ropes.Jesus - 9 - Talisman. Leader. Goalscorer. Epitomises everything we want from Arsenal. I love him.Substitute:Lokonga - 7 - Thought he was very decent when he came on.Tierney - 7 - Looks like heâ€™s adapting to the new role very well.Other guys didnâ€™t really have a lot of time, so not going to rate them. What a win, what a statement. Thought Arsenal only beat the easy teams, eh?North London is ALWAYS going to RED. ðŸ”´
