After discussions on Monday afternoon,Matthijs de Ligt is expected to extend his contract with
Juventus until 2026.

The Dutchman has had a fantastic third season in Turin and is seen as a key figure in the club's
resurgence. According to the late Mino Raiola, De Ligt had previously toyed with the notion of
leaving Juve this summer, but the defender is ready to commit his long-term future to the
Bianconeri.

Giorgio Chiellini will miss the start of next season after saying his goodbyes to the Juventus
tifosi on Monday night, when Lazio wrecked the Old Lady's farewell night. At the death, Sergej
Milinkovic-Savic saved a point for the Biancocolesti, ensuring their spot in the Europa League
next season.

Many believed that when Juve recruited the Dutchman from Ajax for â‚¬75 million in 2019, he
would replace the likes of Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci as the club's main defenders.

De Ligt's time in Turin hasn't been easy, and even this season the defender has made a couple
of high-profile blunders, but he's clearly showing indications of evolving into a potential Juventus
captain.

The Dutchman has been the Bianconeri's standout player this season, and news of a possible
contract extension has been enthusiastically greeted by Juventini following Chiellini's departure.

According to Fabrizio Romano, Juventus is in "advanced negotiations" with the player's entourage over a new contract that will keep him in Turin until 2026. On Monday, conversations
with representatives from Raiola's agency began, as did discussions over the futures of Paul
Pogba and Moise Kean.

According to the press, De Ligt is never far away from leaving Juventus, and the recent appointment of his former Ajax coach, Erik ten Hag, at Manchester United, has several media
sites speculating about the defender reconnecting with Ten Hag at Old Trafford.

However, the announcement of his impending deal should put any transfer rumors about the
Dutchman to bed (for now).
