As the fight proceeds, we see the duel getting increasingly emotional, as the two former friends, Jedi Master and Sith Lord are giving it their all, matching each other blow for blow. Both the fighters are fighting with an obsession, though Obi Wan fights smart and exploits Vader’s anger more and more before bashing his breathing apparatus with his lightsaber handle, before finally slicing off half his mask.

Seeing Anakin’s half burnt face sticking out from the helmet after Kenobi sliced it Rebels style with a faint red hue on it, is really haunting and sad. When we see Vader, we see a scary and monstrously powerful killer, when we see the man underneath, we see only a horribly broken man. But the most powerful part of this entire duel is not even the duel itself, it is the perfectly written dialogue that follows after its end.


We see half of his face amidst a blue hue from Obi Wan’s lightsaber and a red one from his own, which seems to symbolize the conflict in him. Furthermore, when a person succumbs to the dark side fully, it does a number on them in a case similar to Palpatine as Anakin here is deformed from not just the third degree burns he suffered in ROTS, but also from the dark side of the Force.

When Obi Wan tearfully apologized to Anakin, I almost got a lump in my throat, while Hayden, whose voice was combined with James Earl Jones gave a terrific performance. These two actors were born to play Obi Wan and Anakin.
