Belotti waited to know his future before saying goodbye to his now old Toro fans Seven years together before leaving the Piedmontese capital and starting a new adventure in Mourinho&#39;s Roma The longed-for renewal has not arrived and the striker has waited to sign with the Giallorossi to restart Dear Toro dear Toro fans, it is difficult for me to explain what we have lived together over the years I arrived when I was little more than a kid and day after day I grew up based on the values that this team represents Belotti wrote on Instagram I searched to bring out everything I had inside in every training and in every game to try and repay the love you showed me We suffered, rejoiced and rejoiced together You have always been there in every situation I want to say a huge THANK YOU Thank you for what you have done for thank you for how you made me feel because even in the hardest moments I knew that you were always there and no matter what Your affection pushed me to give more and more It continues I don&#39;t know if I have managed to repay everything you have done for me but one you will always be there for sure in my heart I know that my silence in all this time may have hurt you and I apologize for that but there have been situations that have led me to do this My thoughts have always been to protect this shirt and these colors I thank all the people who have been part of this long journey for each of them I remember something that entered my life baggage and in one way or another made me grow I wish the best to each of you There are memories that will remain indelible captaincy the magic of May the curve Marathon screaming my name Now I&#39;m leaving as a man as a family man aware that I have given all of myself over the years It will never be goodbye because for me Turin will always remain home
