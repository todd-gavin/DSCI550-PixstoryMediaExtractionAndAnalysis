Due to her pregnancy, three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber withdrew from the U.S. Open on Wednesday. She joked on social media that "two against one just isn't a fair competition" and posted a series of emojis, including a baby bottle, to convey the news. 

US News reported that the German, 34, rose to the top of the WTA rankings in 2016 after winning the championship at Flushing Meadows. She added a Wimbledon title in 2018 and won the Australian Open that same year. 

Since losing in the third round at Wimbledon on July 1, she hasn't participated in any tour events. She is presently in position 52. 

“For the next months, I will take a break from traveling the globe as a tennis player but then again, I believe it’s for the best possible reason,” Kerber wrote Wednesday. “I will miss all of you.”
