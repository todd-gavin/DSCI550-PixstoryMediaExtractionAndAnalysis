Becky Lynch is remaining upbeat amid her recovery from a shoulder injury suffered during her loss to Raw women's champion Bianca Belair at SummerSlam last month.

Lynch gave an encouraging update, saying: "It's healing up real quick, I'm feeling strong, I'm feeling good!"

Lynch appeared on the Raw after SummerSlam with her arm in a sling, and she was written off television when she was attacked backstage by the newly formed stable of Bayley, Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky.

WWE subsequently announced that she had a separated shoulder, which would keep her out for "several months."

No concrete timeframe was given for Lynch's return, so it is anyone's guess when The Man will be in action.

Triple H has seemingly placed extra emphasis on the women's division since taking over as head of WWE creative, and he would surely love to have one of the biggest female stars in wrestling at his disposal in Lynch.
