The Snow Lion and the Dragon: Tibet-China Relations continues....

The King of miracles Tid-de-tsen and the Chinese King Bun Pu He-u Tig hwan Te, Nephew and Uncle, united their Kingdoms, considering the mutual welfare to Tibet and China, and thus conferred great benefits upon the people of the inside and the outside, making many and all happy and prosperous for a long time....

Tibet and China shall guard the land and frontier, of which they have hitherto held possession. All to the east of the frontier is the country of Great China. All to the west of is certainly the country of Great Tibet. 

Henceforth there shall be no fighting as between enemies, and neither side will carry war into the otherâ€™s country.... Thus the great Agreement has been made for uniting the Kingdoms, and the Nephew and Uncle have become happy.... The messengers from both sides will also travel by the old road as before. According to the former custom ponies shall be exchanged at Chang-kin-yok, on the frontier between Tibet and China. At Che-shung-shek Chinese territory is met; below this China will show respect. At Tseng shu-hwan Tibetan territory is met; above this Tibet will show respect.
