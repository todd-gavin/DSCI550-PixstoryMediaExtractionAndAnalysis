The above is the question in the minds of many people since the time government banned the game of BGMI in India. We cannot have a definite answer for that, because both sides have pros and both sides have cons. To start off the pros of banning BGMI. There are not many but there are a few namely, BGMI is often called a violent and gory game due to which the government said that it is having a negative impact on children. It frees up the child’s time by a bit so that they can study more but those are the only pros.

Now, we can look at the cons which are many. Krafton one of the biggest companies in the world and the makers of BGMI invested approximately an amount of 100 million dollars in the country. Since, they are losing this many other companies would be afraid to invest in the country and our development might suffer. Secondly, the amount of players playing BGMI is approximately 16 million players in total of which the number of people addicted to it was a number which is less than even 1600.

The reason these people might have got addicted to this games might have been due to their surroundings which they can’t control. The E-Sports community in India is rising the biggest reason for which is BGMI. Now, banning a game like this might impact careers of so many people working behind scenes for the game and those players who wanted to make a career for themselves in E-Sports playing BGMI.

 Finally, after listing all the pros and cons I guess it would be best to let you decide whether it was right decision by the government of India to ban BGMI?
