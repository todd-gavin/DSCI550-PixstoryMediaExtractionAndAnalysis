An exceptional performance against newly promoted Bournemouth saw us extend our perfect record over the first three games. Two goals from Ødegaard, and a Saliba wonderstrike, with a clean sheet, completed a perfect evening for Mikel Arteta’s Gooners. Here’s a look at my player ratings from the game…

GK – Aaron Ramsdale - 7 - He’ll be happy to get 2 clean sheets in 3 games. A solid performance.

LB – Oleksandr Zinchenko - 8 - So technically secure, he’s settled into the side perfectly.

CB – Gabriel Maghalaes - 7 - A solid performance at the back, can’t complain when you get a clean sheet.

CB – William Saliba - 8.5 - ⚽️ - Commanding performance and a brilliant goal. What a hit!

RB – Ben White - 8 - He plays so well for someone who isn’t a right back. Very good.

DM – Thomas Partey - 7 - A solid display, helped dominate the midfield. 

Left #8 – Granit Xhaka - 8 - Another assist for Granit in another great performance, just very solid. 

Right #8 – Martin Odegaard - 9 - ⚽️⚽️ - Had his shooting boots on today. Wanted him to be selfish and he did that today.

LW – Gabriel Martinelli - 8 - So energetic, got an assist, and was a threat all game.

ST – Gabriel Jesus - 9 - Unlucky to not get a goal, but another excellent performance.

RW – Bukayo Saka - 7 - Another solid performance, but not as good as we know he can be. 

9/9 points for the first time in 18 years. We couldn’t have started any better! Let me know your thoughts on my ratings!
