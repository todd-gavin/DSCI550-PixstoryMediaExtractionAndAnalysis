Captain Rohit Sharma led from the front when the team needed him the most on Friday in the second T versus Australia in Nagpur to keep the series alive The game was a truncated one as play could not resume on time due to a wet outfield Chasing to win in eight overs Rohit got started straightaway as he smashed Josh Hazlewood for a six in the mid wicket region After that there was no looking back as he remained unbeaten on off balls to help India square the series Following the win Dinesh Karthik heaped praise on his captain claiming that no one plays fast bowling better than Rohit Rohit Sharma played brilliantly To play such shots against New ball against top class new bowlers is not easy It shows why Rohit Sharma is such a big player in world cricket not only Indian cricket His ability to play fast bowling is second to none he said at the post match presser
