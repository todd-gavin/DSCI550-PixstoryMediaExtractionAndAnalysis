At the time of writing, there is just 10 hours until the transfer window slams shut. 11pm London times marks the end of a long summer of transfers, that has seen Arsenal sign 5 players.

The signings we have made so far are all very logical from the outside, and I’ll explore this in more detail in a transfer review blog, but there is still work to be done…

With Thomas Partey and Mohammed Elneny both out, Arsenal have been somewhat forced into exploring options for defensive midfield. Where the priority was in the #8 role and the right wing, it is now clear that Arsenal want a new number 6 - and several targets have emerged.

Arteta confirmed Arsenal’s plans to sign a new number 6 in his post-match interview last night: “We are a bit short in that position [midfield], we are looking at options in the market. If the right player is available and we can do it, we will try.”

The main target that has emerged this morning is, ironically, the player who scored against us yesterday. Aston Villa’s Douglas Luiz is our deadline day priority - and a bid of £20 million has been submitted, according to Sami Mokbel. The player wants the move, and he’s “pushing” for it, according to Fabrizio Romano.

I’ve seen a lot of criticism on social media regarding the rumours, potentially because it’s not a flashy signing, but it makes perfect sense for me. Premier League experience, only 24, good engine, can pass well and more. Little downside and a lot of upside.

Aside from Luiz, it looks like Arsenal will be fairly quiet on deadline day. Despite wanting a Bukayo Saka understudy all summer, there are no firm links to anyone at the moment. This is disappointing, especially with the heavy fixture run coming up.

Hector Bellerin is close to a move to Barcelona, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles is on his way to Southampton.

Let’s hope for a couple surprises from Edu today, eh? 😅
