For me Home is not just a house we live with family together but it s the collection f your feelings engaged within Home is somewhere you want to come when you really feel very Low the whole world is against you Home is not made of Bricks but it s made up of People people we live together When you are kid You re Parents House is your Home When you go out for higher Studies your Hostel is your Home When you get a job your Landlord s Flat is your Home When you are married you the plece you live with your partner is your Home Home in term is Peace
