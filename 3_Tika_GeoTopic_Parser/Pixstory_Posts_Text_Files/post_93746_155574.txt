Love set you going like a fat gold watch The midwife slapped your footsoles and your bald cry nbsp nbsp Took its place among the elements Our voices echo magnifying your arrival New statue In a drafty museum your nakedness Shadows our safety We stand round blankly as walls I m no more your mother Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow Effacement at the wind s hand All night your moth breath Flickers among the flat pink roses I wake to listen A far sea moves in my ear One cry and I stumble from bed cow heavy and floral In my Victorian nightgown Your mouth opens clean as a cat s The window square Whitens and swallows its dull stars And now you try Your handful of notes The clear vowels rise like balloons
