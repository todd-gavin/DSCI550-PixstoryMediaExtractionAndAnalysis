Ruo non requests us to chant this mantra for saving Dodo her year old who sees baddies walking on the wall It s also for her who violated a cult ritual six years ago when she just identified Dodo is forming in her tummy Let s chant along while watching Incantation Taiwanese horror film highest grossing one in the country revolves around this one liner More than horror I felt it is paranormal It could test your patience Not a dragging one either It falls in between Three young buddies are high on their YouTube page ghostbusters They shoot anything scary enriches their viewers interests Reaching one s village after a trip they witness a cult ritual conducts to please a malicious deity The older ones come to greet them inside advise only family people are allowed The wrinkled granny violates into the car and clutches Ruo non s hand signals the horrors coming That remote house and strange faces hook you At night while the ghostbusters team stealthily grabs the surroundings and ritual events take a mysterious spin Ruo non has a daughter now and they both start a new life Whether in her preschool or at home the baby seems a bit weird in her actions She talks and plays with Baddies Ruo non gets it It s just our choice to be scared or not in the following hide seek games But Ruo non s tiresome attempts to save her possessed daughter invoke our sentiments I was upset to see Dodo s body being consumed by worms during the folk medicine ritual Moved by Dodo s foster dad s help and his tragic end Ruo non decides to go back to the village and enters the dark tunnel to confront the deity Do you see light at the end of the tunnel I am impressed by the theory of the featured curse The more you absorb or share it the weaker it turns Also that charming hand gesture while chanting What else Incantation is a footage driven film Strangely enough shoot was on even after the intruders died So the deity handled the camera Am I asking a forbidden question Would I be possessed
