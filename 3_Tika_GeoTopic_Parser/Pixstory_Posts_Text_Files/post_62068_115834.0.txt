Cristiano Ronaldo was reportedly offered to Paris Saint-Germain by his agent Jorge Mendes but the French club isn’t interested in signing the Portuguese international. Ronaldo’s future remains uncertain after he was granted leave of absence by his current club Manchester United from their ongoing pre-season tour.

Various media reports claim that Ronaldo has asked for the leave to deal with a family issue. However, it’s also been widely reported that the the forward remains as ambitious as ever and wants to play Champions League football next season, a chance he won’t get with Man United since they have failed to qualify for the European tournament.

Additionally, the lack of transfer activity has also left Ronaldo unhappy even as rival clubs continue to shore up their squads.
