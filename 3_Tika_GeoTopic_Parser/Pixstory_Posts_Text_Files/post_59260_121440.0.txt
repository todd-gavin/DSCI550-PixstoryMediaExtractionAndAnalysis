In the 11th century, a Japanese woman known as Murasaki Shikibu wrote “The Tale of Genji,” a 54-chapter story of courtly seduction believed to be the world’s first novel.

Over 1,000 years later, people the world over are still engrossed by novels — even in an era where stories appear on handheld screens and disappear 24 hours later.

Books are often referred to as a Man's Best Friend, and it couldn't be more true.  Books contain endless knowledge and stories and  the power to craft an entirely new world into our imaginations.

Books like Harry Potter Series, The Olympians series, carve out such intricate pieces of alternate universes, that we cannot help but feel drawn to them, whenever we need an escape from the reality.
