Background The impact of a comprehensive therapeutic patient education TPE on the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcer DFU has been never evaluated in the literature Aim of the study was to evaluate whether TPE is a predictor of the outcomes of DFU in persons with type diabetes Methods We evaluated consecutive people with a recent and single DFU They were treated and followed up for months Patients were divided into two groups The TPE group included subjects who had been receiving regular sessions of a comprehensive TPE including a specific foot care education FCE for at least twelve months before DFU occurred n The NO TPE group included the remaining subjects n All the patients received intensive FCE during the treatment period Results A significant higher percentage of healed DFU vs p lt and a lower percentage of major amputations vs p minor amputations vs p DFU persistence vs p and deaths vs p lt was observed in TPE than in NO TPE group Among patients with healed ulcers the proportion of subjects with re ulceration was greater in NO TPE than in TPE group vs p lt Multivariate analysis showed that TPE can predict healing OR CI p and may significantly reduce DFU recurrence OR CI p lt and mortality OR CI p Conclusions A comprehensive TPE may have a positive impact on wound healing ulcer recurrence and mortality in people with DFU Sources
