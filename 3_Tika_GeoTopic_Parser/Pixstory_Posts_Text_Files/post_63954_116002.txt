Last week we saw the famous Witcher card game Gwent jump into its own universe when Gwent Rogue Mage was dropped on July Fans of The Witcher s Gwent card game were treated to an online multiplayer version back in as well as a standalone RPG Thronebreaker The Witcher Tales Since its release Rogue Mage is proving to be a solid expansion Just like Thonebreaker Rogue Mage utilizes Gwent battle system as a base pitting you against AI enemies and giving both sides some cards that would be hilariously unbalanced in its PvP player vs player counterpart Unlike Thronebreaker which focuses on an epic battle scenario Rogue Mage focuses on one character the mage Alzur who was responsible for creating the first Witchers centuries before Geralt of Rivia the protagonist of the Witcher series was born The game primarily focuses on hunting down powerful boss beasts for their mutagens and injecting them haphazardly into human subjects until you manage to invent a brooding mutant with extra sharp senses strong metabolism and ultimate sword fighting skills to slay ghouls for profit The game is a roguelike deckbuilder which will make you move around a procedurally generated map and take part in card battles based on mechanics from the original Gwent You ll be able to upgrade your army by collecting more cards and gear with dozens of available modifiers Functioning largely in the same manner as its Witcher counterpart you and your opponent take turns playing cards dropping units onto one of two rows on your own side of the board until your hands run out Whoever has the combined highest power score from their units at the end of the battle wins with unique abilities heating things up According to game developer Vladimir Tortsov it will likely take players north of hours to do and find everything in Rogue Mage which is designed for gameplay sessions that take up to an hour The game can be played entirely offline though there are online features like leaderboards and cross saves so you can continue playing where you left off on other devices
