I am ready to die on this hill! Jack Irish is the best crime and mystery drama!

As per collider, based in Melbourne, this show follows the eponymous Jack Irish (Guy Pearce), who was a former criminal lawyer but changes tack to become a private investigator and debt collector after the murder of his wife and a fall from grace in his legal career.

The storyline is adapted from crime fiction novels written by Peter Temple, and was first developed into a three-part miniseries before being adapted into a fully-fledged television series with three seasons. 

If you like action-packed crime thrillers - with a dash of corruption and endless twists and turns - like me then this show is right up your alley.
