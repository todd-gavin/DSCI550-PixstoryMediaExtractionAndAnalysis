Last I checked, comedians are supposed to make us laugh, right? Or we as a society, have “progressed” so much that one man is supposed to play the role of an entertainer AND an activist at the same time? 

Coming to the topic of ableism, it is definitely a sensitive subject which needs to be discussed at length in the RIGHT PLACE. I am appalled that instead of advocating for better healthcare and emotional assistance for people suffering with alopecia, people are getting offended over an innocent joke. 
You can’t go to a place made for entertainment purposes and expect an educational lesson. Teach people about alopecia and other disabilities in SCHOOLS, debate about how to make the society a better place physically, mentally and emotionally for disabled people in PARLIAMENT where it might actually make a difference. 

The intolerant behaviour runs pretty deep if we are now saying that a literal joke is racist or misogynistic. Race had nothing to do with the incident that took place at Oscars 2022. All the parties involved were black and the joke was not made upon the skin colour. Furthermore, it was also not misogynistic. 
If something was misogynistic, it was the display of toxic masculinity by Will Smith wherein, he felt the need to show how much of a ‘man’ he is by ‘defending’ the honour of his wife by resorting to violence nonetheless. 

And please, leave the comedians to their own devices. If you like the joke, laugh. If not, move on and stop putting the responsibility of activism on them.
