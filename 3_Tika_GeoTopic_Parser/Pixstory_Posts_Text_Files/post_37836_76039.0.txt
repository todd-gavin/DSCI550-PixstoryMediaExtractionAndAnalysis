National Girl Child Day is celebrated on January 24 every year in India. The day was an initiative of the Ministry of Women and Child Development in 2008. The purpose of this day is to spread awareness about the gender based discriminations that girls face in our society and to bring change in the attitude towards girls.
 
The day is marked by various events and campaigns on ‘Save the Girl Child’, child sex ratios, and creating a healthy and safe environment for every girl child.
