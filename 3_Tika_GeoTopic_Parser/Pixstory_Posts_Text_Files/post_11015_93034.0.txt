A 21-year-old mechanic, a car-garage owner, a private teacher: Some of 12 Shia mourners accused of ‘anti-national’ slogans and facing cases under India’s anti-terror law, which turns the burden of proof on the accused. In March 2022, seven months after a Muharram procession in 2021, eight were arrested and jailed—after courts had dismissed criminal charges in similar circumstances—roiling a community once regarded as being pro-India. Srinagar: On 8 March 2022, Mudasir Ahmed Ganaie, 21, left for his workshop in the Kirmanabad Sozait area of  Srinagar at 10 am, the motor mechanic’s daily routine over the last two years.



As Ganaie was about to reach his workplace, a call from an unknown number flashed on his mobile. A policeman was on the line, summoning him to the Kothi Bagh police station in central Srinagar that very day. Ganaie’s heart sank. Distraught, Ganaie returned home, and at 2.45 pm, with his brother and a cousin, left for the Kothi Bagh police station about 14 km to the southeast. When Ganaie got there, the police immediately arrested him.



It was only later that his brother learnt that Ganaie had been accused under under sections 88 (act not intended to cause death) and 269 (act likely to spread infection) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) 1860 and under Section 13 (punishment for unlawful activities) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) 1967, an anti-terrorism law. Ganaie and three other mourners, the police alleged, raised independence slogans such as “Free Kashmir” and “Azadi (freedom)”, considered “anti-national” by authorities, during a Muharram procession on 17 August 2021. Since this occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic, they were also accused under Section 51 (obstructing state officials from duty) of the  Disaster Management Act, 2005. Muharram is the first month of Islamic calendar, the second holiest occasion after Ramzan. The 10th day of Muharram is called Ashura, a solemn occasion for Shia Muslims, who regard it as the day Imam Hussain, the grandson of the Prophet died in battle in 680 AD. Muharram began on 11 August 2021 and Ashura fell on 20 August that year.
