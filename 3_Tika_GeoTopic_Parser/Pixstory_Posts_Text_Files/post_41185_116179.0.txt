Horses have been a significant part of human culture and daily life since they were first domesticated up to 6000 years ago. The symbiotic relationship between people and horses has enabled humans to increase their capacity for labour and travel while also taking care of and feeding these domesticated animals.

Many horses have even sacrificed their lives while working or participating in combat for their human owners. Horses are peaceful and, for the most part, powerful animals that make wonderful friends and companions for people. 

The establishment of National I Love Horses Day was presumably motivated by this. It only seems appropriate to celebrate them on this day because they are so adored and treasured by so many people.

Spend National I Love Horses Day observing and celebrating this beautiful animal that has been a benefit to humans for so many reasons.
