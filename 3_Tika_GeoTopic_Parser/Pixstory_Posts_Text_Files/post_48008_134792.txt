By NewsDrum Desk Tromso Norway I m standing at the edge of the Greenland ice sheet mesmerized by a mind blowing scene of natural destruction A milewide section of glacier front has fractured and is collapsing into the ocean calving an immense iceberg Seracs giant columns of ice the height of three story houses are being tossed around like dice And the previously submerged portion of this immense block of glacier ice just breached the ocean a frothing maelstrom flinging ice cubes of several tons high into the air The resulting tsunami inundates all in its path as it radiates from the glacier s calving front Fortunately I m watching from a clifftop a couple of miles away But even here I can feel the seismic shocks through the ground Despite the spectacle I m keenly aware that this spells yet more unwelcome news for the world s low lying coastlines As a field glaciologist I ve worked on ice sheets for more than years In that time I have witnessed some gobsmacking changes The past few years in particular have been unnerving for the sheer rate and magnitude of change underway My revered textbooks taught me that ice sheets respond over millennial time scales but that s not what we re seeing today A study published Aug demonstrates for the first time that Greenland s ice sheet is now so out of balance with prevailing Arctic climate that it no longer can sustain its current size It is irreversibly committed to retreat by at least square kilometers square miles an area considerably larger than Denmark Greenland s protectorate state Even if all the greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming ceased today we find that Greenland s ice loss under current temperatures will raise global sea level by at least inches centimeters That s more than current models forecast and it s a highly conservative estimate If every year were like when Greenland experienced a heat wave that irreversible commitment to sea level rise would triple That s an ominous portent given that these are climate conditions we have already seen not a hypothetical future scenario Read more
