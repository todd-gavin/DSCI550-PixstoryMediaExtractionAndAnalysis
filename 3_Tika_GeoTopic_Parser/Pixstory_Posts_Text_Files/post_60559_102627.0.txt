Lee Joon Gi kept his promise to the viewers of his current drama “Again My Life”!

“Again My Life” is a drama about a talented prosecutor who gets a second chance at justice after failing to bring down a powerful individual. Lee Joon Gi stars as Kim Hee Woo, a passionate prosecutor who was unjustly killed while investigating a corrupt politician, but who unexpectedly travels back 15 years into the past after getting a second chance at life.

On May 26, Lee Joon Gi shared a clip of his skillful dance moves on his Instagram account. In the caption, he states that he is belatedly keeping his ratings promise. Previously, the actor promised to dance if the viewership ratings of “Again My Life” exceeded 10 percent, and indeed, the drama surpassed the number.

Lee Joon Gi also wrote, “Actually, I should have put it into practice a few weeks ago, but I made an excuse that I was too busy. I apologize for not being able to live up to your great love and support. And thank you so much. Please watch prosecutor Kim Hee Woo’s final story to the very end of this week’s last episode.” He added that he was wondering what dance he should cover and decided to go with the much-requested PSY and BTS‘ Suga‘s “That That.”
