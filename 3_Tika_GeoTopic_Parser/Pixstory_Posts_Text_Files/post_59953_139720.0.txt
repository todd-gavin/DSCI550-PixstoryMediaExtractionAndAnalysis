Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress, claimed today that India is in the midst of its "worst-ever economic crisis" and is on the verge of a "disaster," and he also claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a small group of big businesses are in control of the nation.
During the British era, there was only one East India Company in charge of the nation; today, there are three to four. Mr. Gandhi made this statement at a rally marking the beginning of the Congress' "Bharat Jodo Yatra."
"The current economic crisis in India is the worst one to date. The nation is on the verge of collapse due to the worst level of unemployment we have ever witnessed "stated he
The former Congress chief claimed in his statement, which was being simultaneously translated into Tamil by an interpreter, "Unfortunately, our allies in the media are entirely controlled."
Everyone is aware of the nation's economic plight, according toÂ  Gandhi. However, only the prime minister's image would ever be shown on television and neither would unemployment or price increases.
He claimed that the BJP government had deliberately targeted the country's farmers, labourers, and small and medium-sized enterprises.
According to Gandhi, a small number of powerful corporations currently rule the entire nation.
He asserted that a small number of companies dominate every industry, including ports, airports, coal, power, and telecom.
"Without their backing, the prime minister will not survive even one day. They oversee the media and make sure the PM is broadcast on TV every day of the week. In return, the PM implements laws that are beneficial to them "Gandhi claimed
He claimed that the three agricultural laws, the flawed Goods and Services Tax (GST) system, and demonetisation were all implemented to benefit a select group of wealthy businesspeople.
"The concept is quite reminiscent of what the British used to do: split India, incite Indians to war, and then rob the Indian populace. The East India Company, as it was then known, was a large corporation that ruled over all of India "Gandhi stated.
