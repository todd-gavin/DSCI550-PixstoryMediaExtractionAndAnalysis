Doctors Day is celebrated on the memory of great physician Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy who was born and died on 1st July. 
The theme of doctor's day this year is "Family Doctors on the front line". This theme has been chosen to celebrate and respect the contribution of the family physicians towards the society and more so during the pandemic. 

There was a time when family physicians used to play the role of family friends and guardians as well.

Time has changed a bit, but doctors still remain the greatest friend of the society and play selfless role to keep people happy and healthy.

As a cancer specialist, I have experienced the mutual trust, respect and dependence of the people on doctors. 

Let's celebrate this day to uphold the bonding and respect between the doctors and our people of the society.
