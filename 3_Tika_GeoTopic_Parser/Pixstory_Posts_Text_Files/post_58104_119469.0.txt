Hey , hello everyone I am here with a new series about webtoon villains . I hope you all enjoy it . 

Villains are of many types , ones that you love to hate ,ones that you hate to love . Some who are sympathetic, morally grey  and some who downright psychotic,but you still love them . Everyone loves a classy nuanced villain who puts up real fight .If they have sense of humour it is a cherry on top. Most of the time people are drawn to  villains because they represent the opposite side of the moral spectrum,they don't have to follow any rules and can do what they want . Here is my series about webtoon villains that were more popular than the main character. 

Soleia Elard from Seduce the villain's father is a witch , in a literal way . She is the  Master of Magician's tower , one of the closest aides  of the King and his strategic partner . She is power hungry and ambitious she  wants to marry the king , at all costs. But  not for love  for power ,  when her plan is ruined due to the king falling for neighbouring kingdom 's princess she will stop at nothing to keep them apart . Fans loved her headstrong nature , her iconic dresses and charms . She is more popular than both of the main characters.
