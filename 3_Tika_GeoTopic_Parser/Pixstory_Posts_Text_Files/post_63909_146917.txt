Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the greatest Japanese manga of all time written by mangaka Hiromu Arakawa The manga was critically acclaimed and is considered one of the all time best by most people The series has also been featured into anime but for those who want to watch the anime and have no idea they may find themselves confused as the Fullmetal Alchemist in fact has two completely different and separate animes The first anime of the manga was released in and was simply called Fullmetal Alchemist while the second one was titled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and was released in Now both boast some high quality artwork concepts designs music stories voice acting action sequences comedy drama choice of colours and yet there is a fundamental difference between the two For those who do not know the anime adapts only a fragment of the manga as Arakawa was not yet done writing it and as such branched off into a completely separate storyline It introduced a different antagonist as well as different developments for most of the original characters while adding several new ones of its own The original anime had a darker tone slower pacing having episodes in total concluding with the film Conqueror of Shamballa in a somewhat scattered ending with a few loose ends Brotherhood on the other hand is nearly faithful adaptation of the manga adding in a different villain with different motivations new characters more refined artwork faster pacing as well as a vastly different storyline With episodes overall Brotherhood is the longer of the two and while it has its dark moments it ultimately has a more hopeful and optimistic tone Brotherhood also remains faithful to the manga s ending tying every plot point and character in a beautiful and organic fashion weaving in every previously introduced element into a more natural conclusion Of both the animes Brotherhood is certainly the better one though the one is a beautiful show in its own right with both being two of the greatest animes of all time and must watch for people who wish to watch anime
