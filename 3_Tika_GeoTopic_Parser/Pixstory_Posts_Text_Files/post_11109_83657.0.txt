"LATER"

 - Talk to you later.
 - I'll call you later.
 - See you later.
 - We'll walk later.
 - I'll tell you later.

We leave everything for later, but forget that "later" does not belong to us.

Later, our loved ones are no longer with us.Later, we don't hear them and we don't see them.Later, they are just memories.Later, the day becomes night, the force becomes helpless, the SMILE becomes a grimace, and life becomes death.

â€œLater" becomes "too late."
