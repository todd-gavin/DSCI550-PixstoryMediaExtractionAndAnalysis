Yoga is a form of mind-body fitness that involves a combination of muscular activity and an internally directed mindful focus on awareness of the self, the breath, and energy.

Feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression are calmed as we pace ourselves and take back the control. 

Yoga can help to reduce anger, reactivity, and help improve sleep while impacting the mood positively. 

With Yoga, as the emotional reac­tivity depletes, one starts to feel to indulge in giving  more tempered response when faced with stressful situations.

Contradictory to popular belief, stretching or becoming more flexible isn’t just what Yoga is about. It is a way to connect with your inner self and your body. It is the art of practising mindfulness that promotes relaxation by stimulating your parasympathetic nervous system and strengthening the subconscious mind.

Given the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, most of us are extremely disconnected from our bodies and mind that keep us grounded and centred. By developing a deeper connection and trust with our body we create a foundation towards better mental health.

Stress and anxiety are both dangerously harmful woes for the body and mind. They steal the joy and sense of fulfilment.

Thus there are Asanas in Yoga that can be practiced in order to achieve inner peace and get rid your mind of any lingering stress.
