The Islamic Emirate deployed more than 2,500 troops to the northern province of Sar-e-Pul to provide security there.  

“Over 1,500 Mujahedeen are settled in Squadron-3 and over 1,000 others stationed in Squadron-4. Now, also 200 Mujahedeen have graduated after taking six weeks of training,” said Mufti Mohammad Muqtasid, a senior commander of the Islamic Emirate in the province.  

The commander of the Al-Fatha corps in northern Afghanistan, Ataullah Omari, said that the newly deployed forces are professionally trained.  

The commander denied reports about the presence of Daesh fighters in the province and warned that they would prevent any attacks. 

The commander praised the sacrifice of Islamic Emirate forces, saying it was the main factor in defeating the US in Afghanistan.  

“The US with all of its selfishness and equipment and funds was defeated. They left our country in shame and embarrassment,” he said.  

The Al-Fatha corpse is in charge of ensuring security in Faryab, Sar-e-Pul, Jawzjan, Balkh and Samangan provinces.  

The process of training new forces is ongoing, the commander said.  

Previously, the chief of staff of the Islamic Emirate forces announced that efforts were underway to form a unit of 100,000 troops.
