According to the Pew Research survey center, More than 80% of Democrats think the government is not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis. Young voters of both parties are frustrated over the climate issues in the US.

 When 79 percent of the Democrats think that the climate policies of Joe Biden are taking the country in the right direction only Just 15% of Republicans think the same.

As it stands, the US is unlikely to meet its pledges to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, as Biden’s climate legislation has been halted by fossil fuel-friendly Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and the entire Republican party.

The political stagnation is shocking given that 71% of those polled by Pew said their community had suffered an extreme weather event in the past year. This included severe floods or storms (43%), heatwaves (42%), droughts or water shortages (31%), large wildfires (21%), and shoreline erosion due to rising sea levels (16%). Overall, more than eight in ten of those affected by extreme weather believe the climate crisis contributed to the event.

The survey was conducted over the first week of May – before the supreme court’s remarkable decision restricting the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to set standards and emissions.
