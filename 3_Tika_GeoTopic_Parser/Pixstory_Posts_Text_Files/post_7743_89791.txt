This isn t a shocker as Triple H he had a serious cardiac event the last year and also underwent a surgery It was coming but the fans didn t want to believe it I was a massive WWE fan in my childhood and Triple H was my favourite superstar His promos were fire and crisp he had a wit to him With time we saw him develop into an Executive Figure in the company but he did wrestle here and there Finally on a very sad note his in ring career has come to end for someone so legendary everyone wanted that one last title run or an epic final match guess that won t happen anymore He ll go down as one of the best to ever do it This is the end of the line for the The Cerebral Assassin The King of Kings Triple H What a career what a performer
