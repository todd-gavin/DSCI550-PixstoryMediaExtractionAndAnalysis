Several years ago scientists discovered a gene called ABCC The team that discovered this gene also came to know that it also determines whether a person s wet earwax will come out or dry earwax Since then it has also been found that people who have wet earwax build up in their underarms producing a chemical that causes their underarms to smell At the same time people who have dry earwax are deficient in this chemical An epidemiologist at the University of Bristol told Live Science It is these genes that tell whether a person s underarms will smell or not Mutations in these genes cause dry earwax and foul odor in underarms and people who do not have it have to face bad breath Why don t the people of Korea smell bad According to this report more than percent of people of European and African descent have a version of this gene that causes stench so people of this region are troubled by the smell On the other hand this does not happen in most of the East Asian countries especially in Korea and because of this they are saved from the problem of smell In regions such as Southern Asia the Pacific Islands Central Asia Asia Minor and Indigenous Americans percent of people with the ABCC gene are immune to odor problems
