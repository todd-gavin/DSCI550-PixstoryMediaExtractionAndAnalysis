I love reading books and poetry and trust me there is no one in the whole rap industry who was a better poet than Tupac Em himself will tell u Pac is his idol That Em NATURALLY talks very very fluently even when not rapping which he uses in his rap doesnt make him a better rapper than PAC Outside US and few European countries where Em is well known he doesnt cut across other world regions PAC is Global and i mean GLOBAL only next to MJ Kids born even yrs after his death still listen to him For technical peeps rap is about not being able to hear what Em is saying unless u get the word lyrics and have to replay times WE DONT GIVE A F Pac speaks to us Pac talks to our soul and mind U can listen to pac and he ll mould your mind Contents Message Flow Lyrics Pac is a god Rap doesn t have to be complicated to be rap If not bone thugs dudes flow better than Em How many peeps can sit and start rapping an Em song out of their mind without it being played We rap Pac songs off mind without hearing it It just flowsss Em sold a lot cos it was strange to have a white rapper That was his edge Rap is black and being white Em got that advantage PAC IS RAP GODFATHER STOP THE DISRESPECT
