Most of it stems from your childhood.
Which one do you resonate with?

These eating behaviours have become so deeply
engrained into your subconscious brain that you most
likely don't even realize that it is why you can't stop eating.

AND this is also why you when you try to diet, portion
control or diet it doesn't seem to work long term.
Instead you need to be able to change this
subconscious programming from happening.

Unlearning this narrative you learned as a child and
creating new programming that allows you to feel 100% in control when you are eating.
So you can STOP when you feel:
* comfortably full
* satisfied
* and content even if there is still food on your plate!

Imagine being able to stop eating, even though you still
have 1/2 a slice of your favourite cake in front of you...
No willpower - effortlessly because your new programming allows you to do this.

So you never have to go on a diet again AND you get to
eat foods you ðŸ’— love!
