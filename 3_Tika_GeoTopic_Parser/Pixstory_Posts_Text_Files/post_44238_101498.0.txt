Arsenal loanee William Salibahas reportedly told Marseille that he would like to stay at the club for the next season. 
RMC Sport has reported that the Ligue 1 young player of the year has sent a ‘strong and clear message in recent days to the club’s management over his desires to remain at Marseille. 
Saliba joined Arsenal in 2019 for 27 million euros but has yet to play a game for the Gunners. This has been the third season he has been loaned out to a club in France after prior stints at Saint-Etienne and Nice. 

He has enjoyed the best of his career to date with Marseille, making 52 appearances in all competitions and breaking into the French national team. 
However, with his loan spell coming to an end, Jorge Sampaoli’s side will either need to convince the Gunners to allow him to go out on loan or sign him up on a permanent transfer. 
Arsenal won’t be in any rush to sell Saliba, who is contracted at the Emirates Stadium for a further two seasons. 

The 21-year-old spoke out about his future during a ceremony in Paris on Sunday, where he was given the award for young player of the 2021-22 season. 

He said, “It’s an honour, a source of pride. I dedicate this trophy to my teammates, my club and the supporters. Did I play my last match with Olympique de Marseille? I don’t know, the future will tell us. The most important thing is to confirm this good season by qualifying for the Champions League. Afterwards, we’ll see.”

Marseille needs to pick up a point from their final game of the season at home against Strasbourg to guarantee themselves a place in next season’s Champions League. 

They will have to get that result without Saliba who is unavailable due to a suspension.
