The immune system helps our body to fight infections and other diseases. 
The past two years of the Pandemic have taught many lessons to people; one of them would include how a healthy immune system can help combat the disease faster.

Our eating habits critically affect the immune system. Foods cannot boost our immune system; a well-rounded diet can help prevent food deficiencies.
Maggie Mixhalczyk, a dietician based in Chicago, says,
“Having a well-balanced diet made up of nutrient-dense food helps to ensure that our immune system can function properly and protect our body from foreign invaders,”  She also says, "Vitamins and minerals are needed for the growth and function of immune cells, further underscoring the importance of a healthy diet that supplies our bodies with a variety of nutrients."

Foods that can harm our immune system include,
Alcoholic beverages: Alcohol compromises the immune system by reducing the cells that fight infection, says Shelly Wegman, a registered dietitian with UNC REX Nutrition Services in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Caffeine before bedtime: Caffeine is not bad for our immune system. Having it before bedtime hinders our sleep schedule, which eventually affects the immune system, as good sleep is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system.

Fast food: Mixhalczyk says fast foods contain no nutrients like vitamins and minerals, and hence they do nothing to boost our immune system.
