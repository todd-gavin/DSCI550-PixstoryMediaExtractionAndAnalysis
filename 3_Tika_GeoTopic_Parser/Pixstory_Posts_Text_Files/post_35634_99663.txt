I&#39;m in pain but I want to grit my teeth and make it through for the last two days These are the words of the Lazio striker and current top scorer in the Serie A championship Ciro Immobile who wants to be there on Monday evening for the match against Juventus Unfortunately his conditions are still all to be evaluated The ankle injury sustained after the stomp suffered by Ferrari in the match against Sampdoria seems to be more serious than expected and not a simple sprain as it was estimated at first. In this regard, the doctors advised to rest even for two weeks This would mean ending the season here for the Immobile player who does not share the same opinion and wants to help Lazio in the last two days More news will be given between Friday and Saturday when the striker will start working on the pitch again
