The temple consists of the sanctum sanctorum only in plan but it is likely that formerly there existed a pillared hall since several granite pillars and pilasters can be seen lying outside in the debris The sanctum is square externally and internally with the Lingam inside still being worshipped The walls inside have niches for holding lamps The roof inside is in the form of a tunnel vault consisting of arcs meeting at crown in a ridge and built of cut to shape bricks in a rather ingenious device wherein the bricks are placed edge to edge to form an arch Above the vaulted roof is an upper chamber inside the tower having its entrance in front in the form of a rectangle headed by a triangle formed by overlapping of bricks a characteristic quite peculiar with the temples also at Deo and Umga in Aurangabad district nearby Externally the tower is curvilinear each wall being divided into seven faces by deeply recessed upright lines the carved ornamentation being limited to brick mouldings and indentations covered by a later coat of plaster Some entrance hall must have existed in front of the main sanctum as indicated by the numerous granite pillars and pilasters now lying in front must have supported the roof Cunningham adds that a similar portico of two rows was added to the main temple at Nalanda and another of a single row to the front of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya Cunningham says that the existing pillared hall was added later to the main sanctum This can be seen from the large thickness of the front wall clearly composed of two walls touching each other the outer wall of thickness having been added to support the roof of the front hall The pillars and capitals of this hall lying in the debris are profusely carved but the workmanship is rough and coarse Each shaft has a large lotus flower at top where it joins a similar half flower carved on the face of a two armed bracket To be continued
