I am concerned at how easily people of current times talk about including children into politics. Why can't we let kids be kids?

Politics should not be a part of a child's life. To achieve their goals, they require love and compassion, not be fed political agenda. We can teach them equality without forcing them to be in these political campaigns. 

Everything has been politicized in our modern age. From the death of Harambe the gorilla to Christmas trees on Starbucks cups, safe spaces on college campuses, gender-neutral toilets, pronouns, and toys. Political life has consumed everything. Which is quite sad because everything we do has become equivalent to walking on eggshells.

Unfortunately, one of the more terrible symptoms of a hyper-politicized culture is that far too many parents are now using their children as a new political pawn in their efforts to further their particular political views. And they believe that this is an appropriate behaviour because of the righteous goal of whichever cause they support. It most definitely isn't. I do not appreciate or respect the fact that far too many kids are exploited as mascots for some group's moral outrage at these protests. Children have become a political prop in a game that should only be played by adults in a world where moral outrage is a leisure hobby. It's revolting.

A child should not be the spokesperson for any cause, no matter how noble one perceives their cause to be. This is unethical. These kids lack the cognitive, emotional, spiritual, or developmental skills to comprehend, appreciate, or cope with the politicised frenzy that is a protest. They shouldn't be used as pawns in their parents' game as a result.
