👑 Angeria Paris VanMichaels: The most glamorous ‘country bumpkin’ that you will ever meet. Loud, country and polished – sparkling like a star everywhere she goes. Grew up in the church and sang in the choir. An old-school pageant queen, Angie will “ballad you to death.” She’s won two maxi challenges, and one mini challenge. She’s been in the bottom twice.
