In search of new social marketing opportunities beyond Instagram, beauty has found its way onto the mobile messaging app WhatsApp. 
On May 6, Dior Beauty launched a four-day messaging-based campaign on WhatsApp featuring Blackpink member and the brand’s global ambassador Jisoo. For its new Dior Addict lipstick release, the luxury label allowed users to talk with a chatbot representing the K-pop superstar, attracting enthusiasm from her devoted fan base. While brands’ marketing efforts have already become widespread on other international messaging apps, they are just beginning to adopt WhatsApp promotions to tap into commercial activities.

Simple and accessible, the concept allowed a large number of people to access personalised content themed on the behind-the-scenes aspects of Jisoo's role as an ambassador, as well as on the brand and, more specifically, the product at the centre of this innovative campaign: the new Dior Addict Shine lipstick. In addition, the campaign was accessible via the luxury house's Instagram Stories, where Jisoo directly invited users to join her "exclusive WhatsApp group."


This Dior Beauty campaign could mark a turning point in the way brands interact with their communities -- other than on social networks -- to offer an even more innovative, interactive and personalised experience.
