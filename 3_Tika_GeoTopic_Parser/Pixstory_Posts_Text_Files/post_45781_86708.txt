A total of rock samples were returned to Earth by the Apollo missions to the Moon However NASA has only recently begun to open one of the last ones which was gathered years ago Some tubes were maintained sealed for the duration of that time so that they might be investigated years later using the most recent technological advances In a statement Lori Glaze head of NASA s Planetary Science Division predicted that science and technology will evolve and allow scientists to explore the material in new ways to address new problems in the future The sample in question dubbed was collected by astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt during the Apollo mission the program s final mission in December Phys reported that The tube cm long and cm inches by inches wide had been hammered into the ground of the Moon s Taurus Littrow valley to collect the rocks Of the only two samples to have been vacuum sealed on the Moon this is the first to be opened It could as such contain gases or volatile substances water carbon dioxide etc And the aim is to extract these gases which are probably only present in very small quantities to be able to analyze them using spectrometry techniques that have become extremely precise in recent years
