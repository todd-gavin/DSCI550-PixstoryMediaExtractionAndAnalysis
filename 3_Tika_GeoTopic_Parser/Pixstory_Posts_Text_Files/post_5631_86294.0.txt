Akhilesh Yadav is the national president of the Samajwadi Party and a Member of Parliament from Azamgarh who served as the 20th chief minister of Uttar Pradesh from 2012 to 2017. He is the son of veteran politician Mulayam Singh Yadav, the founder of the Samajwadi Party.

This election is crucial for Yadav as if he wins this will be his second coming as the CM of the state and he is fighting these elections despite being an MP from Lok Sabha. 

The exit polls have not been good for SP, as they are showing a big win for the BJP, on which Yadav during a press briefing commented “The Samajwadi Party is winning Ayodhya, that is why BJP is scared. Election Commission officials are tampering with EVMs,” citing instances of unmanned EVMs found in different parts of the state and alleging EVM malpractices favoring the ruling party. 

The last phase of UP elections ended on 7th March, now, the results are waiting to arrive on 10th. As far as the exit polls go, Yadav’s party is not doing well but the final results we will get to know by the end of today.
