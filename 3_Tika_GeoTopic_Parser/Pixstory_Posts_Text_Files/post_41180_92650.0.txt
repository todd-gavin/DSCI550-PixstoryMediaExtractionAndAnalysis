The toothbrush's first predecessor can be traced back to ancient times. The first toothbrush was little more than a stick with no bristles. To be more specific, a chewstick. 

Chewsticks have been around since 3500-3000 BC. Egyptians and Babylonians used them to brush their teeth. The chewstick's one end was frayed for brushing, while the other end was sharpened and used as a basic toothpick. 

Dental Art MV tells us that the first toothbrush is supposed to have originated in China. It was created during the Tang Dynasty. The handle of these early toothbrushes was made of bone or bamboo. Bristles from Siberian hogs were used to make the bristles on these toothbrushes.

It wasn't until the 16th or 17th centuries that the toothbrush made its way to Europe. The toothbrush arrived in Europe thanks to European travellers who travelled to China and carried them back to their native countries. Europeans then developed their own toothbrushes, utilising horse hair instead of hog bristles for bristles. 

In 1780, the first English toothbrush was created, with a handle made of cattle bone and pig bristles. In 1844, a three-row bristle design was created to improve cleaning outcomes. 

In the twentieth century, the toothbrush as we know it was invented. It was made with nylon bristles rather than animal hair in 1938. Brushes with softer bristles were employed in the 1950s to make tooth cleaning more gentle.
