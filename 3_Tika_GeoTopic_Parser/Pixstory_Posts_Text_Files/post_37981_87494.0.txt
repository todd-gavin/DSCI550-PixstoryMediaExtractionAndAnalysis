Barcelona have recently shown interest in signing Mohamed Salah from Liverpool. This has been confirmed by the 29-year winger himself as per the Mirror.

The Blaugrana are looking to make a major signing following the departure of Lionel Messi last summer. Club manager Xavi Hernandez has reportedly made Erling Haaland his priority. But it looks unlikely that they would be able to sign the Norwegian. 

Haaland is currently touted by Manchester City and Real Madrid among clubs as well. Hence, Barcelona are reportedly considering Mohamed Salah if their bid fails for the Borussia Dortmund star. 

Mohamed Salah acknowledged Barcelona's interest in December. But the Liverpool winger also added that he would prefer to stay with the Reds for now. However, Salah did admit that he would like to play in LaLiga in the future.

The 29-year old said, "It makes me happy that a team like Barcelona is interested in me, but I'm happy in Liverpool and we will see what happens in the future. At the moment, I prefer to stay in the Premier League as it's the strongest league in the world."

Salah has scored an impressive 153 goals in 238 games for Liverpool. This accounts for an impressive goal-scoring ratio of 0.64. Hence the fans would certainly be hoping that the Egyptian is given a new contract as soon as possible. 




Do Barcelona have the funds for a major signing?

The Blaugrana were marred by a severe debt under the presidency of Josep Bartomeu. The debt reached a whopping €1.3 billion and this also led to the release of Lionel Messi from the club. 

Since then the Joan Laporta management has worked on reducing the debt and they have been successful. Hence it is believed that the Blaugrana can complete at least one major signing in the summer transfer window.
