Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): CBT helps you learn to change how you see and respond to situations and objects that trigger symptoms. Many healthcare providers use CBT along with exposure therapy or hypnotherapy.
Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT): This modified form of CBT teaches people how to live in the moment. It can help you cope with distress, maintain relationships with others and regulate emotions. You might have DBT in a group setting or one-on-one with a therapist.
Hypnotherapy: Healthcare providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help alter how you look at the water. They may also use hypnotherapy to find the underlying event that led to the development of your water anxiety.
Medications: Anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants may help reduce aquaphobia symptoms. Healthcare providers often prescribe these medications along with CBT. In addition, if aquaphobia causes fear at night that affects your sleep, your healthcare provider may recommend sleep aids.
Yoga, mindfulness and meditation: Regular yoga can help you relax and reduce stress. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) teaches you to relieve anxiety at the moment. Meditation can help you focus on your breathing to prevent panic attacks.
