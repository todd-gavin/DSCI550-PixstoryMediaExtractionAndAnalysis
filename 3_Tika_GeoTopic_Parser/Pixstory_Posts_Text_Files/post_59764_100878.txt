 Vibes has become a common phrase in football now Whenever a manager looks like he s tactically weak a tag of being a vibes team is attributed to the team meaning that the wins come by as a result of individual brilliance The manager is just the cheerleader his main job is to keep the players happy not load them with instructions It is widely accepted that System triumphs over individuals Vibes can win you game but never tournaments This is why this year s Champions League final is such a curious case study between two teams whose models couldn t be more different from one another Liverpool built their success on clear tactical instructions from Klopp playing in a systematic way making the most out of each player Players unlock another gear in their arsenal when playing for Jurgen Klopp Real Madrid meanwhile live for chaos Carlo Ancelotti s team have not been trailblazers in any tactical department However they are stretching the limits of what a flawed team can achieve Benzema has spearheaded their season which has already resulted in a La Liga title In the UCL barely believable comebacks have become the norm Real Madrid get dominated but they are never down for long Real Madrid s success this season with minimal structure on the pitch has already challenged the Vibes vs system debate The UEFA Champions League final might give a definitive answer Does the system make the players or do the players make the system
