Ram Baboo won the gold medal in the menâ€™s 35km race walk.
Ram pushed past the finish line in 2:36:34 seconds, smashing the old national record, and creating a new laurel. 
Ram Baboo's journey from a waiter to gold medalist is very inspiring ðŸ™ŒÂ  
Cheers to all the hardwork, effort, and dedicationÂ  ....
