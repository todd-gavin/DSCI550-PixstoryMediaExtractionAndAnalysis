'Swallow with caution,' says AIIMS after a man chokes to death on momo.
The cause of death was determined to be neurogenic cardiac arrest caused by momo choking, which was discovered at the laryngeal inlet.

After a man choked to death while eating momo, the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has issued an advise.

The renowned medical institute recently released a paper in the latest edition of the journal 'Forensic Imaging' in which it discussed an unusual occurrence of a man dying after choking on a momo.

The man was in his early fifties and inebriated. According to the AIIMS report, he was taken dead to AIIMS from south Delhi.

He was dining in a store when he slumped on the floor.

According to the study, a "foreign body stuck in upper airway" was discovered using Post Mortem Computed Tomography (PMCT). "Here, the writers describe a case in which the dead died unexpectedly while eating a momo" (dumpling). The article published in Journal of Forensic Imaging stated, "India is in the early phases of virtual autopsy, and it has just been initiated in the country's leading institute, All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi."

The momo choked in the aperture of the windpipe, according to the autopsy.

The physicians went on to say that the slick texture and small size of the momo could cause complications, and they issued a'swallow with caution' warning for momos.

The cause of death was determined to be neurogenic cardiac arrest caused by momo choking, which was discovered at the laryngeal inlet.
