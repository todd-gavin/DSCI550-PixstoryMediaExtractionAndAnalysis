1. Ddeokbokki (Korean Spicy Rice Cakes)
The street food extraordinaire ddoekbokki is another one I had to try making at home to ensure that it was vegan (it’s typically made with “fish cakes,” i.e., hot dogs of the sea … blech!). This spicy dish has a texture unlike anything I’ve ever tried and was quite tasty. A popular option is to add a package of ramen noodles to kick things up a notch.

2. Hobak Juk (Pumpkin Porridge)
One of the best comfort foods I ate in Korea, hobak juk, is warm, sweet, and filling. Perfect for a cold winter day.

3. Tofu Kangjung (General Tso’s Tofu)
Here’s an interesting one that takes inspiration from American Chinese cuisine. This veganized classic uses tofu instead of chicken to keep our feathered friends happy.

4. Baechu Kimchi (Napa Cabbage Kimchi)
What Korean food list would be complete without a kimchi recipe? Some kimchi is made with anchovy paste, but many store-bought brands are vegan. There are many different types of kimchi, but the most iconic is made with cabbage and hot chilis, then fermented underground for some time. Kimchi’s pungent flavor is distinctive but can round out any Korean meal.
