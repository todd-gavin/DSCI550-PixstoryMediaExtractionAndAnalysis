The official website for the live-action sequel film based on Aoi Hiiragi's Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba) manga unveiled a new trailer and visual for the film on Wednesday. The trailer reveals and previews the film's theme song "Tsubasa o Kudasai," a cover of Michio Yamagami's popular folk song by Anne Watanabe.
 live-action film was originally slated to open on September 18, 2020, but was delayed to October 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
The original manga inspired an anime film by Yoshifumi Kondō and Studio Ghibli in 1995. The story follows junior high school bookworm Shizuku as she has a chance encounter with a mysterious antique shop, and the boy Seiji Amasawa, the grandson of the shop's owner. A novice violin maker, Seiji has also attracted Shizuku's attention as she has noticed for a while that his name is written on the checkout cards of the books she borrows from the library. Seiji's passion for violin-making inspires Shizuku to pursue her dream of writing a novel.

Hiiragi published the manga in Shueisha's shōjo manga magazine Ribon in 1989. Hiiragi published a sequel manga titled Mimi o Sumaseba: Shiawase na Jikan in 1995, and a spinoff titled Baron: The Cat Returns in 2002. Viz Media published Baron: The Cat Returns in English. That manga inspired Hiroyuki Morita and Studio Ghibli's The Cat Returns film in 2002
