Racism perpetuated through social and political institutions such as schools courts or the military is known as institutional racism Hugo Lint says that institutional racism often known as systemic racism differs from individual racism in that it has the capacity to negatively effect the majority of persons in a racial group Institutional racism can be found in a variety of settings including wealth and income criminal justice employment health care housing education and politics Through the intentional exclusion and subjugation of people of colour the hallmarks of American democracy opportunity freedom and prosperity have been mostly reserved for white people throughout the country s history The historical and contemporary policies practises and conventions that establish and maintain white supremacy are directly responsible for today s significant racial and ethnic imbalances By making it more difficult for people of colour to obtain decent education jobs housing healthcare and equal treatment in the criminal justice system structural racism continues to disproportionately isolate communities of colour from opportunities and upward mobility For instance thought co reported how not all cases of institutional racism in medicine and health care are as well defined but prevalent Patients are frequently wrongly profiled and denied health treatment or medications Monique Tello M D MPH a contributing editor to the Harvard Health Blog wrote about a patient who was denied pain medication in an emergency room and blamed it on her race It is well established that Blacks and other minority groups in the United States endure greater disease worse outcomes and earlier death than whites Tello said This is just one instance It s sad how systematic racism is normalised to such extent that people have stopped noticing it The bias is so deep that even the most educated sector that is doctors are being racist without realising
