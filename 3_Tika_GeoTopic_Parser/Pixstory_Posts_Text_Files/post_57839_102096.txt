Setting up an account on any website or social media is a thrill of its own Specially when you re a preteen or a new teen You have the most creative ideas floating in your mind for the username and you pick the one you like and identify with the most Now fast forward a couple years later you log back in and voila You re cringey username is still up and you headbutt the table going whyyy Gotta love how you grow up and your tastes change
