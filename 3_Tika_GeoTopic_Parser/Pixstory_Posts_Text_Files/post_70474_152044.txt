There were regular complaints from party workers and public about the functioning of his office which is not yet corrected Those who had personal references did have accessibility with MP office or Dr Tharoor himself He was missing from many of the protests and programs organised by DCC and KPCC It is hardly difficult to find him participating on protests related livelihood issues He had cultivated a system of sycophants to follow him just like any other congress leader All India Professional Congress was created as a department of Congress and Dr Tharoor is the founding Chairman Even though he demands organisational elections in Congress did not take effort to conduct one in AIPC National committee or in local chapters He had skipped questions on that The chapter committees are filled with his own close associates or with nominees of political leaders who already occupy one or other positions in party or affiliates In the last years of its existence there is nothing much to highlight on the contribution of AIPC or its own growth and impact it created in society or polity And recently he said he quit AIPC Chairman position in September But no AIPC fellows did not know about it Is it culture and change he wants to instill in AICC and headquarters In many times and instances he had violated party instructions including parliament protests or in regional matters He is not a type of person fit for Indian political system Till now he hasn t come openly against LDF government in Kerala even though there were many issues And in a recent interview in Indian Express he had mentioned there are other options before him if he did not get a seat next time Congress doesn t want a person as its AICC President who is open for other options He can take lead in social media digital media and other debating platforms But in Indian politics and within year old Congress it doesn t matter alone I wish Dr Tharoor continues to be in the core team of Congress as CWC Member or AICC Vice President or Working President but definitely not as AICC President Continued
