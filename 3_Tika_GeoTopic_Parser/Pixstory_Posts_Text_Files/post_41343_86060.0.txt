The news is a modest setback for Democrats who want her to run again, but it's a major setback for Republicans who have raised a significant amount of money from her. Some politically active people are disappointed by Hillary Clinton. And it isn't only her backers. 

U.S News reported that the politician who the right wing despises stated unequivocally Tuesday morning that she will not run for president again. That's a modest setback for Democrats who want her to run again, but it's a major setback for Republicans who have raised a lot of money over the years by warning Republicans about the dangers of a Hillary Clinton president. 

“No, no," the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and former secretary of state said with a laugh during a "Morning Joe" interview Tuesday morning, when Clinton was interviewed to honor International Women's Day. 

“But I am certainly going to be active in supporting women running for office and other candidates who I think should be reelected or elected, both women and men," Clinton said.

Clinton spoke from Abu Dhabi, where she is the keynote speaker at the Forbes 30/50 Summit, which is being held to commemorate International Women's Day. At the event, Clinton was given a lifetime achievement award. 

Clinton skipped the 2020 Democratic presidential primary after losing the 2016 general election to Republican Donald Trump and has remained active in politics and policy, notably in the field of women's rights.
