Music videos are an excellent way for musicians to generate publicity for their songs and albums, garner greater appeal of their work and most of all, enhance the meaning of their work, offering several creative ways to represent a composition visually. Some videos can be all sunshine and rainbows, some be cheesy, some comical and some really creepy.
Talking about the best of creepy videos in rock and heavy metal is no small feat as there are several such videos. Creepy music videos can range from a little deeply disturbing to playing on the atmosphere, music, or gore, and other elements, making them hard not to watch.
So what makes a music video really a frightening experience? Does it have to depend on blood and violence, or does it just need to express a distressing message? Does it need supernatural elements, or is an unsettling picture of human nature disturbing enough on its own? All of it ultimately depends on the individual viewer, as scary is ultimately a subjective term.
It means different things to different people and different elements of art and life cause varying levels of terror in different individuals.
