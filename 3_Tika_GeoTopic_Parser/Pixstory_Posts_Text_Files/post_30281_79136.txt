Australian motorcyclist Casey Stoner, two-time MotoGP champion, returns to talk about the causes that led him to retire early from racing in just years The former Ducati rider diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome has recounted his malaise experienced at the weekends race in the latest episode of the Gipsy Tales podcast I was only recently diagnosed with anxiety which I didn&#39;t actually think was a concrete thing I honestly thought it was just something people made up another way of saying they were stressed My back too anxiety freezes between my shoulder blades I feel it in situations I&#39;m not comfortable in It would have been easier for my career if I had known and maybe I could have handled the situation a little better I had a bad image for being shut down with the media and the people i never felt comfortable doing it i never felt comfortable with the crowds and then race day for probably my last two years in MotoGP the more i had a good weekend the more i wanted to die I would have literally curled up on the floor of the camper ill like a dog with a stuffy stomach I didn&#39;t want to race I couldn&#39;t feel worse Stoner won the MotoGP title in 2010 riding a Ducati and with Honda retiring at the end of the season closed in third place again with the Japanese house
