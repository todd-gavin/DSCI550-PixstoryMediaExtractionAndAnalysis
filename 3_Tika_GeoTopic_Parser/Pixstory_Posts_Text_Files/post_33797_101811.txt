Justin Fashanu was the first footballer to publicly declare his homosexuality in the United Kingdom Years later today, through a letter on Blackpool&#39;s official channels, the classy striker Jake Daniels decided to come out revealing that he is gay This season has been fantastic for me on the pitch I signed my first professional contract scored goals in the youth team and shared many successes But off the pitch I hid who I really am all my life I know I&#39;m gay Revealing my sexuality and being one of the first was a step towards unknown but I was inspired by Josh Cavallo Matt Morton and so many other athletes I had huge support from all club family and agent Even my team mates in the youth academy shared my decision to open up to the world I hated lying and hiding my whole life Now I want to be a role model for everyone by taking this step Who might feel uncomfortable about coming out but I want to tell them not to change who they are to fit the context Being yourself is what matters most
