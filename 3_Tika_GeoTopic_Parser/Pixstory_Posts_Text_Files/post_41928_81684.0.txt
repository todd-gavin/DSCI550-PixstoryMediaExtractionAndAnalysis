Would you want your partner to smell like a french fry? Moreover, would your partner want you to want them to smell like a fry?

“Whether you’re at a drive through restaurant or dining in, it’s near impossible to not grab a fry and take a bite before you dive into your meal. The smell is too good to resist,” Jamey Higham, President and CEO, Idaho Potato Commission, describes the logic behind the potato company’s new fragrance. 

“This perfume is a great gift for anyone who can’t refuse a French fry,” Higham said in a statement. 

Made from IPC’s distilled Idaho potatoes and essential oils, Frites by Idaho, is a limited edition perfume contained in a 1.7-ounce crystalline bottle at the rate of $1.89 – about the price of a large order of french fries.

“A recent national survey conducted by Pollfish, revealed that nearly 90% of Americans find the smell of French fries irresistible,” the brief statement cites.

The hyper-sexualization of women through food advertisements seems to be synonymous with the explosion of fast food and television, and of course, perfume ads always seem to be themed around attraction. 

But what about the intersections of food, gender, and objectification through perfumes?

In 2013, the thrillist documented a list of 10 food-scented perfumes that will quote, “make the ladies hunger for you,” which includes (for those wondering) Demeter Sushi Cologne, Candy Corn Body Splash, Tamal (after tamales), Pizza Hut Perfume and Demeter Celery Cologne.

Where is the boundary of acceptability in scents, between the generic citrus scents and the puzzling ‘sweet burger and pulled pork’? And how do these boundaries blur or sharpen in context to gender stereotypes and constructs?

Lastly, would you buy the greasy-salty french fry perfume or the seafood sushi cologne?
