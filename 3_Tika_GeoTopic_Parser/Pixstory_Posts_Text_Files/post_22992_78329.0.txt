I believe that Bollywood movies are dwindling in comparison to international  movies.
- reason is that, many bollywood movies lack sense. They lack proper script and fail to attract the attention of viewers.
- another reason is writers and directors lack of innovate new ideas. Many movies have same love story, same revenge seeking script and same idea applied in different movies portrait by different actors. Eg. Race 1 & Race 2. Golmaal fun unlimited and Dhol. Hate story franchise. 
- even many songs of bollywood are also remake its earlier hit songs.
- one major reason is bollywood movies making remake of south block buster movies like Rowdy Rathore, Drishyam, Rangrezz, Dabang, etc. and even copying movies foreign countries like Radhe remake of The outlaws (Korean), Rocky Handsome remake of A man from know where (korean), Murder remake of Collateral ( hollywood starring Tom Cruise & Jamie Fox)
- Bollywood directors also try to stretch  concept of same movie. Like Dabangg & dabangg2. Dhoom 1 & dhoom 2.
- today if we analyse good bollywood movies with excellent story, we will find just handful of it. Majority of Bollywood movies do not have good story or songs.
