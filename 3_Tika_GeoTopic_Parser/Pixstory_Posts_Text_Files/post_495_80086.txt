In order to better understand the association between dietary patterns and cardiometabolic risk factors among adults in India particularly among those at high risk for diabetes A collaborative study between university of Melbourne and medical institutes in Kerala published in Journal Nutrient analyzed the data of participants age years from baseline and year one and two follow ups from the Kerala Diabetes Prevention Program using multi level mixed effects modelling Dietary intake was measured using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire and dietary pat terns were identified using principal component analysis Two dietary patterns were identified a snack fruit pattern highly loaded with fats and oils snacks and fruits and a rice meat refined wheat pattern highly loaded with meat rice and refined wheat The snack fruit pattern was associated with increased triglycerides mg dL CI while the rice meat refined wheat pattern was associated with elevated Hb Ac percentage CI and central obesity OR CI According to researchers these findings show there is no clear line between healthy and un healthy diets of these two dietary patterns as each of them probably contribute to cardi ometabolic risks in different ways However although elevated triglycerides tend to be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases it cannot serve as an independ ent marker for increased cardiovascular events particularly in people with prediabetes and diabetes Therefore attention should be given to the rice meat refined wheat pattern given its likely effect on central obesity and Hb Ac in Indian populations who are at higher cardiometabolic risk than other populations These findings highlight the importance of nutrition and are likely to inform the designing of dietary interventions for the prevention of cardiometabolic risk factors and diabetes as well as early cardiovascular disease prevention in high risk individuals in the Indian setting What do experts say Prof Anoop Misra Chairman Fortis C DOC says Essence of the study is that snacks should be healthy and carbs should be complex carbs Rice should preferably be brown rice Meat should be replaced with fish
