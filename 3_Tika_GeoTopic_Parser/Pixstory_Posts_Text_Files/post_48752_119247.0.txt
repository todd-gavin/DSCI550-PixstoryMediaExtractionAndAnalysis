Uh huh, misunderstand me not, Mr Campbell. No woman needs a man in her life. We are perfectly capable of living a life without a man holding us back. Any relationship with a man should be a choice for women, not an obligation.

However, it's also the truth that men have oppressed women for so long that our world works like that by default at this point. Patriarchy is an institutionalized hierarchal system that has existed for centuries where women were treated like objects of dezire rather than human beings.

And this exact attitude of yours is what is failing millions of women everyday. How dare you say women are more privileged than men in our society when they're still being sold like inanimate objects, when brown women are still being killed for wearing jeans and black women are still dehumanized for their skin color. It is a rich claim coming from a white man that men are oppressed in a world that is run by privileged white old men and their ego.

Privileged women is a far fetched claim, let's reach equality first, then we'll talk.
