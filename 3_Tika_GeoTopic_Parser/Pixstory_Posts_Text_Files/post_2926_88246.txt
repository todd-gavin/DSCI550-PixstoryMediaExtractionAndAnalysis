Russia and Ukraine have remained locked in conflict for close to a month now with neither side gaining an upper hand Amid mounting fatalities there are speculations of backdoor parleys and a possible peace deal An agreement can bring ceasefire immediately even if its detailing may take a while The war has not progressed on the expected lines so far Russia despite its superior military power has faced strong resistance in Ukraine which however has suffered immensely with attacks on civilian localities Ukraine wants the war to end soonest and in any case it was not the one that started the action President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video address on Saturday morning called for peace talks Also Zelenskyy earlier told ABC I m ready for dialogue we re not ready for capitulation News reports suggest negotiations between Ukraine and Russia might be going on already through secret channels which understandably make the West nervous As for Russia a nuclear power s desperation after facing hurdles on ground is making the world jittery Still Putin has the other option of choosing peace too though he would like it at his terms and with a face saver There are neutral players like Israel and Turkey that have come forward to broker a peace deal On Wednesday the Financial Times reported Israel s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett was mediating a point deal The next day BBC reported on Putin s phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during which he listed his demands The demands broadly are of two types the obvious ones that Ukraine will have no trouble in expecting and some face saving ones which can be dicey The key demand is Ukraine would remain neutral and won t join the NATO Russia may also want disarmament to ensure that Ukraine is no threat to it backed by western guarantees and that might be difficult to meet Face savers might include protection to Russian language and de nazification The last item crucial to Putin s propaganda is ridiculous Zelenskyy himself is a Jew yet it too can be met by resolving to fight all forms of Nazism
