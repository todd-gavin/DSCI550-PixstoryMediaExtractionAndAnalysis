I learnt about different architecture styles back in my history class in school Domes marble arches etc tells us a lot about different architectural styles that exist in India India is an amalgamation of different architectural styles I especially love the Dravidian temple architecture you find in South India Other than that there s plenty of heritage in Mughal and regional architectural styles India is also home to the colonial buildings the British left behind British architecture in India is a mix of neo classical Indo Saracenic and the Gothic style So many buildings we use for administrative purposes now reside in these ancient structures What s your favourite architectural style and why
