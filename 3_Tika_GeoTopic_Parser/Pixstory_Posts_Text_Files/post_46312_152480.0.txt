I really want to share something about why some people tend to hide their pain from other people , even their loved ones , and it even becomes a habit ! 
⁠
There can be many reasons why people hide their pain ; 
1 Showing their pain would make others see them as weak and powerless .
2 They fear that others will use their pain against them .
3 They think - " i don't want others to risk hurting me more than they already have , so I'm going to put up a wall between me and them " !
4 They have lived with this mask of being ohky for so long that taking it off feels weird and unfamiliar .
5 They are scared of revealing who they really are to the people around them .
The thing is , on some level we all hide our pain , especially from people we are close too . But one should understand that - if we hide our pain even from people we're close to then the pain will be stuck inside you !
⁠
Think of a piece of rot inside your body , silently affecting all other organs . That's unaddressed pain , whether it's grief , loss , disappointment , regret , worry ... Whereas if we share it ,  even in limited quantities , it slowly starts to heal . ♥⁠
⁠
Everyone have valid reason for not showing their pain to others . But when you don't even show it to your loved ones , it helps us ! 
Your pain deserves to be treated and addressed by the right person . Perhaps it's time to lower that mask and stop hiding how much pain you are really in .
We cannot avoid pain in our lives - that's the point of life . But we can learn how to deal with it better , and sharing it with those we trust is one of the best ways to do that . 🙌⁠
