The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series between India and Australia in 2020-21 is remembered as one of the most spectacular Test series in history, as an injury-plagued India staged a comeback to overcome Australia in their own backyard. 

NDTV reported that Team India, led by Ajinkya Rahane, shown incredible courage and desire to defeat the hosts. The series had its share of controversy, with a few Indian stars being requested to stay in the hotel before the third Test in Sydney after being sighted at a restaurant. 

After the triumph in Melbourne, a video of Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Prithvi Shaw, and Navdeep Saini eating at a restaurant went viral on social media.

After staying indoors, these players tested negative for COVID-19 and hence were available for the third Test in Sydney.

Speaking about the incident on Voot Select's docu-series 'Bandon Me Tha Dum', former Australia skipper Tim Paine said: "I mean those four or five guys put the whole Test series at risk. For what? For a bowl a Nando's chips or wherever they went, like I just find that pretty selfish to be honest."
