It’s just four days left for the closing ceremony of Expo 2020 Dubai. Expo 2020 opened for the crowd from all over the world on 1st October 2021 and will close its doors on 31st March 2022.

You will be thinking, why there’s 2020 in a name if it began in 2021? So I’ll tell you that the main plan to begin the Expo was in 2020 but COVID hit the world and every nation shut their door and traveling becomes very difficult. So the committee decided to schedule the Expo in 2021 when COVID cases will be lesser than now.

Expo 2020 opened with a bang and people from all over the world visited there and loved it through and through.

In Expo 2020, there are pavilions of 192 countries where they show their culture and their history and how they are taking steps to make a better world with the help of technology and Human Resources.

I visited Expo 2020 Dubai back in November 2021 and unfortunately, I had only one day to enjoy Expo 2020. In one day, I visited around 12-15 countries’ pavilions and enjoyed some Italian and Spanish food, and watched Mexican orchestra group “La Sonora Santanera.”

Out of 12-15 pavilions I visited, my top 3 pavilions will be Switzerland, Spain, and Pakistan because they showed their culture, their history, and things that are unique and only be available in their country.

Things I liked about Expo 2020 as a whole was, how successfully they unite people from the whole world in one place and those people will get the knowledge of other countries as well even without traveling there.

In the last six months, many celebrities from all around the world came into Expo 2020 and share their knowledge and entertain the crowd with the skills like singing, dancing, sports management, developing business, etc.

So buy your tickets for Expo 2020 because it's just 4 days where you can enjoy the world in one place.
