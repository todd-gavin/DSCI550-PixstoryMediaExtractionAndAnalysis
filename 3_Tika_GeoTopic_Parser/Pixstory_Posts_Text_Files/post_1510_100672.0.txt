World Football Summit is where the football industry’s leading stakeholders meet to shape the future of the game. It is the football equivalent of the World Economic Summit.

WFS hosts a series of global on-site and online events that cover the challenges and opportunities of the different regions and sectors in this thriving industry. 

Pixstory is the official social media platform for the Football Innovation Forum. The event will be held in Sevilla, Spain on 18 May. 

The event will host 18 panels on topics linked to innovation, investment, and technology in the context of football, drawing on disruptive insights from inside and outside the world of football. The list of 18 speakers includes Pixstory CEO Appu Suresh, LaLiga TV presenter Semra Hunter and UEFA’s director of social responsibility Michele Uva.

Appu’s panel, “Hybrid Partnerships in Sport: Increased Flexibility for Increased Revenue?” will be from 10:15 am to 10:55 am (1.45pm – 2.25pm India time).
