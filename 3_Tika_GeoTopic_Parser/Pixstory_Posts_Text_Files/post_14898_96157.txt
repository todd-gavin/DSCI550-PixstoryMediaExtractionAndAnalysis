A good yield Much more than a void This is the name of the new national campaign promoted by the Association of Virtuous Municipalities, a network of local authorities which is at the forefront of promoting harmonious and sustainable management of the territories to increase environmental awareness and above all to spread new styles of consumption among citizens The metropolitan city of Turin immediately joined the campaign with a decree signed by the councilor responsible for the environment Gianfranco Guerrini With our participation, explained councilor Guerrini, we intend to support the introduction of an efficient collection system for beverage containers based precisely on the returnable deposit The method is based on the payment of a small security deposit required in this case for disposable containers for beverages made of different materials such as plastic, glass and aluminum The deposit is subsequently returned to the citizen when the container is correctly disposed of Help concrete to the fight against the dispersion of waste on the territory The Returnable VAR makes it possible to intercept this type of waste and ensure that it is not disposed of as often happens in non-recoverable waste or abandoned on the streets or in meadows and woods The economic incentive obtained from the return of the deposit it thus allows to save precious resources and improve separate collection but also to keep cities and parks cleaner This system is also the only one that can be implemented to achieve the European and national objectives on the levels of separate collection and recycling Also the European SUP Single Use Plastics directive aimed at reducing the impact of single-use plastic products suggests the introduction of deposit refund schemes to help achieve the defined recycling targets In addition to the introduction of a returnable system which has already led to excellent results in numerous European countries where it has been adopted, it is also important to underline the role of monitoring and control of the same to verify that the adoption of this method is as balanced as possible, does not have a negative impact on citizens and leads to an effective improvement in separate waste collection.
