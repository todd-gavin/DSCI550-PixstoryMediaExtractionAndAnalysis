The widespread of the English language around the world and its supremacy have created many problems for non native English speakers In America racism is an important issue but linguicism is a substantially less well understood subject Linguicism is the practise of discriminating against people based on the language they speak National organisations including U S English and English First have been pushing for an amendment to the United States Constitution that would make English the Official Language of the United States and place legal restrictions on the use of other languages Proponents of English as the official language believe that its supremacy is under threat and that it is the glue that holds our society together as well as a solution to the socio economic problems that many ethnic minorities in the US suffer Many non english speakers have been physically or verbally attacked in the open Even then not everybody who speaks English is treated the same way Because of the many various ways that different cultures and people use English it is always changing Rather than embracing this linguistic diversity we continue to place a larger value on certain forms and accents of English than others which means that non native speakers who deviate from the standard may feel evaluated marginalized and even penalized for the way their English sounds Many people don t realize that their innate biases are forcing them to make judgments they don t even realize they re making We tend to be unintentionally microaggressive towards non native accents Regardless of what causes these kinds of situations BIPOC suffer long term often demoralizing consequences And as long as these kinds of situations persist things may get worse for them as they are marginalized or outright excluded from discussions
