For all the disappointment on the field of football, Paris Saint Germain continue to prosper
profitably as far as non-footballing matters are concerned. The Qatar-owned franchise has
never had many problems attracting top sponsors and high branding commercial deals.

Now, with a team of some of the most recognisable names on the planet — the Parisians
continue to make a name for themselves in the world of fashion.

Eddy Lu, co-founder and CEO of the GOAT group, has added: "Paris Saint-Germain is one
of the most influential clubs in the world and we are delighted to partner with them to continue building our global community.

Lionel Messi was seen donning new PSG shirts with "GOAT" brandings on the left sleeve.

The picture that resurfaced across social media featured the Argentine alongside Neymar
JR, Achraf Hakimi and Marco Veratti with Kylian Mbappé a notable absence.

"We bring together two great lifestyle brands to unite and mobilize communities of athletes,
creatives and fans around the world. This partnership plays to each other's strengths, with
innovative collaborations in the months and years to come.", Lu added.

The 34 year-old is commonly referred to as the Greatest footballer to ever grace the pitch.

Having it imprinted on to his sleeve will delight fans. By his standards however, Messi's time
in France has been disappointing.

PSG's chief partnerships officer, Marc Armstrong, has said of the union: "We are delighted to
welcome GOAT into the Paris Saint-Germain family. Thanks to this partnership, GOAT joins
the tight list of club partners present on our emblematic jerseys.

"GOAT is the ideal partner for the club. It reinforces our position as an icon of sport and style
with fans around the world. Together, we will develop exciting and creative experiences to
delight fans everywhere."

The collaboration with the sneaker-brand is just one of many commercial deals PSG boast.
