Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been in exceptional form since coming on a free transfer from Premier League team Arsenal earlier this year. Manager Xavi is recognised with Aubameyang's sudden improvement in form. With regular performances in terms of goals and assists, the striker has lived up to his manager's expectations. Xavi's faith on Aubameyang paid off once more in a key El Clasico match at the Santiago Bernabeu against arch-rivals Real Madrid.

Xavi, a veteran of the El Clasico, started with Aubameyang, Ferran Torres, and Ousmane Dembele up front. The Gabonese international scored twice and assisted another, while Torres added his name to the scoresheet with a spectacular finish.

Despite the 4-0 score line, Aubameyang's one-of-a-kind celebration after his second goal in the 51st minute stole the show.

This amazing and rare celebration was noticed by the entire crowd as well as the players on the field. Toni Kroos was one of the players.
In the past, the Real Madrid midfielder has been a loud supporter of Aubameyang's celebrations. Kroos caused a commotion when he called Aubameyang's 'Black Panther' and 'Spider-Man' mask celebrations "nonsense" and said he wasn't suited to be a role model.

Xavi, Barcelona's manager, claimed he was taken aback by his team's 4-0 El Clasico victory over Real Madrid.

The Catalan giants put in an outstanding effort in Madrid to end a five-game La Liga losing streak against Los Blancos.

Prior to the break, the visitors took a merited 2-0 lead due to strikes from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Uruguayan star Ronald Araujo.

Barcelona, on the other hand, didn't let up in the second half, recording their largest El Clasico victory since 2018, with Aubameyang and Ferran Torres making it 4-0 on the night.
