Do you still visit those dusty shelves adorned with priceless gems?
When you hold one gem, your memories rush back and forth in head
Some are bitter, some are sweet, some are bittersweet,
While holding it in your hand, you smile and cry at the same time 
You take a cloth, wipe the dust off of it,
Cough a little, sneeze a little and then laugh a little,
You find a place to lay it and then draw the curtains 
The light kisses the gem and your hands 
You take the spectacle case, rest on a chair and finally look closely,
The peculiar aroma makes you feel surreal and alive 
And finally, you flip through those pages 
You also find those love letters and notes written secretly for your school crush,
Bliss is just this.
