South Korean K-pop act BTS won three of the six categories they were nominated in at the Billboard Music Awards. The band took trophies in Top Duo/Group, Top Song Sales Artist, and Top Selling Song (for “Butter”) categories. This makes BTS the most-awarded group in Billboard Music Awards’ history with 12 wins, overcoming Destiny’s Child’s 11 awards.

The group, however, was not present at the event.
