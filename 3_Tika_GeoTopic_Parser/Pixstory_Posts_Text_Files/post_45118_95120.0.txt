The youngster was pulled back by stewards during the League Two match. Exeter's Cheick
Diabate has apologised for shoving a ball boy who then attempted to square up to the defender.

On Monday, the incident occurred during the second half of Exeter's League Two match against
Tranmere Rovers at Prenton Park.

 Diabate tried to reclaim the ball after it had been taken out of
play, but the ball boy had other ideas.

What went wrong?

The ball boy threw the ball away from Diabate as he sought to grab it with Tranmere 1-0 up, and
the Exeter player pushed him away in frustration. The child retaliated by chasing down the
forward and yelling at him again.

Several stewards were forced to intervene and haul the ball boy away as the assistant referee
attempted to prevent his progress along the touchline. Diabate was charged as a result of his
involvement in the incident, and he has subsequently claimed that he has spoken to Tranmere
to express his regret.

He posted on Twitter in response to a photo of the incident:

"There was no need. I apologise for my actions and have sent an apology to Tranmere already.
"It was a heat of the moment thing, but you're right I should never push a kid like that. It’s
something I will learn from."

Exeter were unable to claw their way back into the game, as Tranmere secured a 2-0 victory
with a late second goal.
