 Jab we met A rom com which you must have seen but I just saw it a month ago It was released in when I was just but it took me years to watch it and I don t even want to watch it until I saw it while my brother is watching it I don t usually like romentic movies but this one is just a magical experience for me The emotions portrayed the self love Geet taught us the calmness and sacrifice in the character of Aditya are it s greatest element The story also shows two one sided love stories the love of Geet for Anshuman and the love of Aditya for Geet which was beautifully portrayed The character of Geet when abandoned by it s first love changes the Geet we all loved is lost but once again brought to life by Aditya The beauty of story is that they both help each other in finding life in no hopes without any reason without any benefit and without any selfishness And the dialogue wins the heart of every girl when Geet ask Aditya ki mai tumhe bht achi lagti hu na and he replies ha but vo mera problem hai this simply shows the idea of not imposing your emotions over other And the small comic scene in between wins it various times So that s how I liked it if you haven t watched it yet you re missing something so I would recommend you to watch it Thank you for reading Pic credit Wikipedia
