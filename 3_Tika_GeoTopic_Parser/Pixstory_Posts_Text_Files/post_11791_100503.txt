Recently I and we all have Heard a News Spain to offer Days menstrual Leave every month Women who suffer from bad period cramps every month are going to get relief They will be granted menstrual leaves from work for up to three days in a month However this good news is only for women who are staying and working in Spain Not Just Spain Other countries that already have this policy are Japan South Korea Indonesia and Zambia But my Question is why just Spain and These country why not India Why the Idea of Period Leave Is Still Sparking Debate To people Who Underestimate The strength Of a women can You bleed for a week straight without dying Do you know Menstrual cramps has finally been ruled as painful as having a heart attack If You ask me Nobody in this world can Bear this pain but We women s have to Bear this every month with the smile on our face Many women becoming silent sufferers choosing not to disclose their pain rather than demand their right to rest India s legislative system has been fairly backward in introducing menstruation friendly policies like menstrual leave Bihar is the only state in India which has been providing two days of special menstrual leave to women since through its Human Resources guidelines India has also witnessed the Menstruation Benefits Bill which was tabled in Parliament but is yet to receive assent According to me It is important to understand that menstrual leave need not necessarily mean a complete loss of productivity for women Menstrual leave can easily allow a woman to work from home These Change must come from the grassroots of society discussions on menstrual flow and cramps must move from women s locker room discussions to the open with Everyone showing the willingness to be included in the discussion in both personal and professional capacities
