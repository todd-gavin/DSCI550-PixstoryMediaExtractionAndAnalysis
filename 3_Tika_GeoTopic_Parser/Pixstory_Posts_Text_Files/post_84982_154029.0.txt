Bayer Leverkusen have had a mixed bag so far in the UCL. They lost their opening encounter against Club Brugge away from home but made a scintillating comeback in the second game beating Atletico Madrid 2-0 at home. In their last game against Porto, they lost the tie.
Porto had a tough time initially in this year’s UEFA Champions League campaign. They have, however, come back on track with a win over Leverkusen in the last game that they played at home against the German side.
