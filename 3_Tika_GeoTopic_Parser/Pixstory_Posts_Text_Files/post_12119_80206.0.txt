On Tuesday, the Director of Public Health and Family Welfare, Dr. G.Srinivasa Rao declared that the third wave of Covid - 19 in Telangana has come to an end and the time has come to bring an end to work from home. 

The third wave began from December 28th which peaked on January 28th and has since been on decline. 

The official told reporters that the infection rate has come down to the minimum. The daily positivity rate which had gone to 5 per cent at the peak has now dropped to lower than two per cent. 

Addressing a press conference, Dr Srinivasa Rao, however, while claiming the Third Wave was over in the state, urged people not to let their guard down and continue to follow 'Covid appropriate behavior'. 

The top health official also said it was time for people to start getting back to their pre-Covid lives and for all offices, schools and education institutions to return to normalcy in terms of ending work from home and attending classes. 

Telangana has overcome the Omicron wave under the guidance and direction of Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, he said. Though there may be some sporadic cases, we can expect the daily case load to drop to around a couple of hundred cases. The Third Wave was controlled in just about a month and a half, he said.
