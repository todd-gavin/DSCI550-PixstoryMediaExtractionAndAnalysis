I don't read novels that much but I read some of the novels. And my favourite amongst all these was "If It's Not Forever It's Not Love" by Durjoy Datta. Of course if I'll tell you guys the story then there is no point of reading yourself. But I want to say that feel each and every character from your heart in this book, at some point you'll cry for sure.
