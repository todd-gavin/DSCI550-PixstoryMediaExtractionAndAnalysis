This group of meerkats in the Tswalu Kalahari Reserve in South Africa has been habituated to humans for over a decade, and is very relaxed around people.

In fact, they mostly completely ignored Thomas's presence, being way too preoccupied with lounging, hunting, grooming and fighting.

He was therefore able to get in close and use a wide angle lens to include the arid savannah and mountains they call home.

To capture the meercats features, he applied techniques used for people in a portrait session, and used studio lights to photograph them.

Equipmemt used: Nikon D5 + 16--35mm f4 lens; 1/250 sec at f16; ISO 200, 2x Profoto B1 flash.
