El Clasico pits two La Liga titans, Real Madrid and Barcelona, against each other. The two clubs' long-standing rivalry makes this a highly anticipated match.

What most fans fail to notice is the sudden increase in the number of non-Spanish players participating in El Clasico. Previously, the list of El Clasico goal scorers rarely included players from outside of Spain, but this is no longer the case.

Lionel Messi – 26 goals

With 26 goals, Lionel Messi is the all-time leading scorer in El Clasico history. Messi, like Ronaldo, is widely regarded as the greatest footballer of all time. He has won 35 trophies in total, including the COPA America and Champions League, among others.

Messi had five braces, four of which came in wins. The Argentinian's most recent goal came in a 2-2 home draw in June of 2018. This was also the final time Ronaldo was involved in a Clasico goal.

Messi left Barcelona for PSG in the summer of 2021 as the La Liga's all-time leading scorer (474 goals).


Cristiano Ronaldo – 18 goals

Ronaldo and Alfredo Di Stefano are tied for second place on this list with 18 goals each. In the summer of 2009, the Portuguese maestro moved from Manchester United for a then-world record fee. The following season, Ronaldo scored his first El Clasico goal in a 1-1 home draw against Real Madrid in April 2011.

Ronaldo last appeared in an El Clasico match in June of 2018, when he scored in a 2-2 away draw. He left Real Madrid as the club's all-time leading scorer, having scored 450 goals in just nine seasons. He and Benzema are the only players on the list to have won the UCL three times.

Ronaldo currently plays for Manchester United, where he has 18 goals in all competitions.
