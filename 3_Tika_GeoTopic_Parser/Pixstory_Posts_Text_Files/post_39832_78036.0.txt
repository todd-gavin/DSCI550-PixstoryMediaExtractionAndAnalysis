I picked my brush to paint a paper with black colour, but I ended up painting with a blue colour. The paper was filled with the shades of blue. I couldn't think of anything to paint over it. I slightly touched the paper with yellow coloured brush, it looked like a flower. And I went with the flow.
Sometimes not knowing what you want to do can eventually lead to something beautiful.
