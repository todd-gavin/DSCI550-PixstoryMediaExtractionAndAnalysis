There are moments when you get a message but don't reply immediately or even if you are replying immediately, you type it out and get ready to send but somehow something happens, you either get distracted by someone, some thought in your head disrupts your flow in that moment, just something happens and you end up not sending the message 😂🤦‍♀️
And then later when you check your messages to see a reply or just like that, you find that you never ended up sending the message in the first place😂🤦‍♀️
