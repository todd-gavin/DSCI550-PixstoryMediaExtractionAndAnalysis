Meet your closest ancestors and relatives in this interactive exploration of human evolution. This 15,000-square-foot gallery invites you to explore the scientific evidence of human origins over the past 6 million years and traces how we evolved the unique traits that distinguish our species.

Discover fascinating stories of extinction and survival, and learn about some of the features that set us apart from other species: from walking upright to using tools, from our big brains to our ability to use symbols and language.
