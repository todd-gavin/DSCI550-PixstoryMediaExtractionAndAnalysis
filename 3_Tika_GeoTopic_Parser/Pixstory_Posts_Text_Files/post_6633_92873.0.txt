A video is viral on social media which shows a group of Muslim men performing a punishment called “murga” in Hindi where a person is made to squat, hold their ears and hop like a chicken. In the video, a person with a stick can be seen giving instructions to the men. It has been shared with the claim that the video is from Uttar Pradesh

A Pakistani Twitter user had posted the viral video on March 29, 2020, and tagged several prominent handles including the police. Manshara police responded to his tweet and wrote, “DIG Hazara and DPO Manashara have already taken notice of this incident and asked Ainda to desist from giving such punishments in any police station. The inquiry is going on, will warn you soon (translated from Hindi).”

Thus, a video of Pakistan has been circulating on the Indian social media ecosystem with the false claim that it shows the treatment of Muslims in UP under Yogi Adityanath. The same video was shared two years ago with the false claim that members of the Muslim community were punished by the police for flouting coronavirus lockdown rules.
