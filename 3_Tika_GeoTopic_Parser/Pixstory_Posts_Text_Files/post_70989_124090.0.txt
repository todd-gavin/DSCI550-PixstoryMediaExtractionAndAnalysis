For a Christmas boom, Paramount is getting ready.

On Monday, the studio said that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 would debut in theatres on December 20, 2024.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2's massive $72.1 million domestic box office debut earlier this year was a tremendous lift for the domestic box office recovery, especially for family pictures. The movie went on to earn more than $401 million at the box office globally, which is a respectable number given that the economic recovery was only just getting underway.

One of the rare movies from the COVID-19 era to debut before its predecessor was Sonic 2. Additionally, it was the largest launch ever for a video game adaptation, surpassing the first Sonic, and the biggest three-day opening for Paramount since 2014. 

Ben Schwartz, Jim Carrey, and James Marsden all appear in the movie series.

James Cameron's upcoming Avatar 3 will compete with Sonic 3 when it debuts in 2024 over the holiday season (the Avatar sequels have moved around numerous times).

In a related announcement, Paramount said that their untitled Smurfs animated musical, which was originally scheduled to debut in theatres on December 20, 2024, will now debut on February 14, 2025.
