Andreas Pereira will join Fulham on a four-year deal from Manchester United for a potential £10 million fee, the club has confirmed. Pereira played for United for 75 times in the first team and was loaned to Granada, Valencia, Lazio, and Flamengo. However, Pereira left the club in search of a more consistent schedule of play.


The club website quoted Pereira, who has the option of extending his contract by an additional 12 months, as saying: "I want to help Fulham as much as I can to be where they belong." "The role of (manager) Marco Silva in this was crucial. He and I chatted frequently, and he played a significant role in my arrival."
