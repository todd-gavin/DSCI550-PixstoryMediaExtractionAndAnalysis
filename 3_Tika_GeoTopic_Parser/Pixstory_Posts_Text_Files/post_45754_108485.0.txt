Chinese scientists hope to create a next-generation satellite observatory to look for dark matter in order to gain an advantage over NASA, the US space agency. The enormous project, dubbed VLAST (Very Large Area Gamma-ray Space Telescope), is still in the early phases of development. 

By the end of the decade, the scientists hope to have the telescope in orbit. According to media sources, they are awaiting authorisation from the Chinese government. 

Eurasian Times reported that the initiative involved researchers from Nanjing Purple Mountain Observatory, Hefei University of Science and Technology, and Lanzhou Institute of Modern Physics.

With the development of this telescope, the scientists hope to attain ten times the sensitivity of NASA’s Fermi Large Area Telescope.

NASA’s Fermi Large Area Telescope is the world’s most sensitive gamma-ray telescope. It is the successor to NASA’s Compton-Gamma-ray Observatory, which operated from 1991 to 1999. 

According to NASA, Fermi’s field of vision and sky survey capabilities were twice as large and 30 times as sensitive as one of Compton’s instruments. NASA defined Fermi as “an astrophysics and particle physics partnership,” with NASA developing it in collaboration with the US Department of Energy.
