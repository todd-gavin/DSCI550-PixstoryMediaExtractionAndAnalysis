Satyapira Padhan is a year old psychotherapist martial artist mountaineer and Guinness World Record holder for the fastest punch strike He was conferred Karamveer Chakra a global civilian honour in partnership with the United Nations in The Guinness Book of World Records has two formats for aspirants who want to get into the record book Priority application and standard application Under the priority application the Guinness jury will come and scrutinise the record breaking procedure personally from the UK This process is a lot faster but it s also very expensive as you have to bear the entire expense of the jury including flight tickets and hotel accommodation till the completion of the feat This can easily come to a few lakhs so most people who hope to get into the record book opt for standard application This can take up to four to five months to complete as you have to strictly follow all the guidelines instructed by the Guinness committee including a seven member team comprising senior national level coaches and referees of international repute to ensure that there is no foul play or malpractice during the record breaking attempt The record breaking event has to be recorded non stop and videos made from all angles While attempting the punch strike feat for which I won the record I had to perform the task in front of two eyewitnesses two time keepers and one punch pad keeper The one minute video was then recorded while I kept punching with my right hand I did three takes of my video The last video was done entirely in slow motion so that the jury can individually count the number of punches I delivered in a minute We counted a total of punches but did not include five punches as there was some confusion over whether these blows had landed properly and could be counted as full contact punch strikes The interview is a part of AKADialog initiative to capture the lives of newsmakers
