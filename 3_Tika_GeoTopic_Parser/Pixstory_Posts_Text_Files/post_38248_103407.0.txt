Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Sadio Mane would be leaving Liverpool in the summer. The Senegalese international leaves Merseyside as one of the best players in the club's history. 

With the next chapter set to be written in his career. Here are three clubs that Sadio Mane could join in the summer:





Bayern Munich:

The Bavarians are currently the favourites to sign Sadio Mane in the summer. Bayern could undergo a major transition as Robert Lewandowski looks set to leave in the summer. Hence the experience and the pace of Sadio Mane would surely add to Bayern Munich's quality if the winger decides to move to the Bundesliga in the summer!






Real Madrid:

Los Blancos missed out on Kylian Mbappe. Hence it is expected that Real Madrid would make a big money signing to bolster their right wing. Though Sadio Mane is primarily a left winger, he could also slot in on the right. Hence the European champions are expected to bid on the Liverpool star. 





Barcelona:

The Blaugrana could be the "wildcards" for Sadio Mane. Xavi Hernandez's side is rebuilding themselves. With funds coming in, Barcelona are expected to spend heavily in the summer. The addition of Sadio Mane to their squad could be important as Ousmane Dembele and Adama Traore are set to leave.

Hence these are the three major options for Sadio Mane for a possible summer transfer!
