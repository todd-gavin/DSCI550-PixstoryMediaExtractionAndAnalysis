The fact that a stun gun depends on the attacker being in close proximity to the victim puts the victim at risk, especially if the attacker is bigger, stronger, faster, and more adept at violence than the victim, which is nearly always the case. The attacker can trap the victim's arm or even punch or stab the victim before the stun gun can be used if the space between the victim and the attacker is closed. A larger and more powerful attacker can potentially steal the victim's stun gun and use it against him or her.
It can be used as a torture gadget or as a 
device for illegally confining someone. Though the severity of the injury it causes is minor, it has the potential to mentally harm a person if misused, and if used on an unhealthy person or recklessly, it can result in death. As a result, their capacity should not be taken lightly.
There have also been instances where stun guns have been used as a method of child abuse, with the children dying or suffering trauma in some situations.
It can also be used to perpetrate crimes such as rape, kidnapping, and human trafficking because it immobilises a person for 20-30 minutes.
Amnesty International deems it a high-risk form of torture when used by both police officers and civilians, and so opposes its use.
Aside from that, using a stun gun on sick, sickly, children, or pregnant women can have harmful cardiac and physiological consequences.
