Post the Karnataka Hijab verdict, a claim is in circulation that the Bombay High Court has passed an order that Muslim students in Mumbai can wear the gown, scarf, or hijab to their respective educational institutions.

The claim is viral with a Hindi caption that reads, ‚ÄúIn a groundbreaking decision made by the Bombay High Court, the court has said that no educational institution has the right to stop students from attending their classes because they wish to wear the hijab, gown or scarf.‚Äù The caption also mentions that this is a direct reply to the decision made by the Karnataka high court regarding the Hijab verdict. The disparity in the decisions made on the same issue by the high courts of two states has also been highlighted in the caption.
