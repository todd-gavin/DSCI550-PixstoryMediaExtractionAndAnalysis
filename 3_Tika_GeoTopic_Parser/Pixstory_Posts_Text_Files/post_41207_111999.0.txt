If you're anything like me, you're terrible at remembering important dates like holidays, anniversaries, doctor's appointments, and, let's be honest, just about anything else. There is simply too much happening in today's bustling world for us to keep track of it all, and people are terrible at remembering anything! 

National I Forgot Day is your chance to get a head start on all the apologising you'll have to do for the year and make up for things already forgotten. Unfortunately, this results in us having to apologise to people for missed appointments and parties.

As per DOY, you have the ideal chance to make up for everything you have forgotten on National I Forgot Day. Whether it was someone else's birthday or you failed to fulfil a commitment to your lover, today is your chance to make amends. 

It's likely that you have forgotten so many things that you can't possibly remember everything in one day. If that's the case, prepare a list and be sure to cross off everything that you should have finished by now.
