Five days into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, false or misleading videos and images about the invasion continue to go viral.

Among the things spreading quickly are old videos being depicted as current - along with claims that pictures such as the one above are old, even when they verifiably come from the present conflict.

We've been looking into some of the most viral claims.

Claims have circulated online that images and clips from the destruction of a residential building in Chuhuiv, in eastern Ukraine, on Thursday are instead from a 2018 gas explosion in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk. Some also claimed that an image showing a bloodied woman at the scene was from 2018 or that she was a "crisis actor" - someone hired to act out scenes from an attack.

Although at first glance they may bear a superficial resemblance, images from the gas explosion in Magnitogorsk in 2018 do not correspond with images from Thursday's fire in Kharkiv.

Early on Thursday, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine posted on Facebook saying they had been informed of "enemy fire" resulting in the death of one child and several other injuries. A journalist at the scene posted a video showing the aftermath of the fire, and other sources including photographers at the scene posted images from the same event onto social media.

Two photographers took images of the woman, and some of these photos appeared on websites and newspaper front pages all around the world over the weekend. Both photographers confirmed that the images were taken on 24 February - a fact further confirmed by metadata from the images which shows the same creation date.

However, other photos and videos posted in recent days don't show what some people say they are depicting.

A blurry video claiming to show a Ukrainian girl confronting a Russian soldier has generated 12 million views on TikTok and nearly one million views on Twitter.

But it actually shows Palestinian girl Ahed Tamimi, aged 11 at the time, confronting an Israeli soldier after her older brother was arrested in 2012.

Twitter labelled the video "out of context".
