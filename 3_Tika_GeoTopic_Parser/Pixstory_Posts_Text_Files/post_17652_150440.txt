As darkness enveloped the village of Sharan it also revealed the dark secrets of this forlorn village which stayed buried during the daytime Sharan was a remote village far away from the eyes of the world Located in a mountainous region it was blessed with fertile soil and abundant natural resources Hence the livelihood of the people here was solely dependent on farming But during the last decade the holy land saw a large influx of drugs and criminals The lack of a criminal system encouraged kingpins to establish and run their million dollar drug empires from here And the lucrative monetary incentives aided the infamous druglords in keeping the people quiet It was also a famous hideout for notorious criminals as the village lacked proper transport facilities People had heard tales about this village but none had dared to step foot in the den of the lion The darkness of the night bought with it criminals and peddlers who operated and stayed hidden in the dark Among them were two friends Shyam and Mannu who were the victims of the drug epidemic which had infested the village After the break of dawn the two met at an abandoned bungalow a hub for peddlers and addicts The building was one of the famous spectacles of the village but had been destroyed and torched in one of the bloodiest gang wars in Sharan Shyam and Mannu who were in their mid s had established themselves in the world of crime Having chosen the criminal world the two friends were not strangers to blood drugs or guns The duo were also addicted to smack and they met at this spot to inject evil into their veins Without which they both could not function But their daily routine was interrupted when they heard vehicles approaching their location At first they did not pay much heed to the outside world But they were soon brought back to their senses by the roaring gunshots As the two peeped through the broken window they both turned pale and quickly grabbed their guns as they stared death in the eye Next No one is a born criminal
