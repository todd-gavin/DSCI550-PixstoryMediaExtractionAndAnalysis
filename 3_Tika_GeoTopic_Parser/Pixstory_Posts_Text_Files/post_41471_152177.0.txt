In response to worries over the treatment of migrant workers' rights and the effects of the tournament in Qatar on the environment, Paris will not show World Cup games on massive screens in public fan zones. US News reported that despite being the defending champion, France made similar steps in other French cities. Other European organisations are also considering how they may protest. According to Pierre Rabadan, the deputy mayor of Paris in charge of sports, the decision to forgo public broadcasting of games was made because of "the conditions of the administration of this World Cup, both on an environmental and social level."He said in an interview with France Blue Paris that “air-conditioned stadiums” and the “conditions in which these facilities have been built are to be questioned.”Rabadan stressed that Paris is not boycotting the soccer tournament, but explained that Qatar's "model of staging big events goes against what (Paris, the host of the 2024 Olympics) wants to organize.”
