Erik ten Hag, the manager of Manchester United, has said he won't take offers for Anthony
Martial this summer. Ten Hag has concluded that Martial is not for sale after being impressed by
him during the preseason. Martial, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla,
returned to United this summer.

According to The Mirror, United were willing to let Martial leave or take a new loan before the
transfer deadline of September 1; however, ten Hag has stopped that after watching him play in
recent weeks.

Ten Hag believes he cannot afford to let Martial go since Ronaldo's future is uncertain and because United's most prominent player made it clear last summer that he was open to leaving
the club.

The 26-year-old Martial has three goals in three games while on United's preseason tour of Thailand and Australia, but club insiders claim manager Erik ten Hag made the decision to keep
Martial before the team's flight to Bangkok.

After two unsuccessful seasons, United officials had anticipated that Martial would be among
the club's exiting players, but the France international has not found a market. Martial, who is
under contract to United through 2024 with an option for an additional year, joined Sevilla on
loan in January but only managed to score once.

In the victories over Liverpool, Melbourne Victory, and Crystal Palace, Ten Hag started Martial,
and the Frenchman is ready to open the campaign on August 7 against Brighton.

Ten Hag stated that United needs a solid team, a good squad, to attain the correct results at the
end of the season during the pre-match press conference prior to tomorrow's last Australian tour
match against Aston Villa. The group needs to be strengthened even more, and they are
searching, but we need the proper players.
