These stereotypes and differences in perception have made your thinking so confined.
Like when a man takes time to decide, he is thoughtful, but a woman suffers from " analysis- paralysis."
 When a female boss asks for creative ideas they're often labelled with statements that she ran out of ideas or she doesn't have a creative skill, whereas when a male does the same, he is considered as encouraging others and asking them to give their ideas which are necessary for a job. Such a hypocrite, I mean!

When a male boss is well dressed, he is definitely a professional dude, but women, of course, waste their time putting on makeup and dressing up.
If she is being assertive, she would be aggressive, but if he is being assertive, then it is his assertiveness towards his work.

When a female manager listens to your personal problems, she is definitely too emotional. Still, if she doesn't, she is rude and bossy, but if a man does, it is because he doesn't want to mix his professional and personal life.

When a boss reminds you of deadlines, he is good at taking charge of operations and people, but if she is doing the same, then again, it's her bossy nature and competitiveness.

It doesn't matter how long I go on writing this; it will exist, but the notions and thoughts won't tell the truth, i.e. women would always reign as great managers.
