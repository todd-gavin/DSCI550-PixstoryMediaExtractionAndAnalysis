Actress Sonali Bendre believes that Bollywood has always been a soft target, but that due to an increase in the number of media organisations across the country, negative headlines about the business have proliferated nowadays. Bendre, who starred in films such as 'Diljale,' 'Duplicate,' 'Sarfarosh,' and 'Zakhm,' said it was disheartening to see the film business in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, particularly in the last two years.
