Not long ago I made a post on how amazing Carmelo Anthony had been in the Knicks. Seems like we have manifestation powers.

It has sentimental value for Carmelo Anthony to return to Madison Square Garden, where he was a legend and seven-time All-Star. And he's accepted that he's a bench role player at this point in his career for the past couple of seasons, and he's been solid in that role.

Anthony wants to end his career in a meaningful way. The Knicks are searching for cheap forward depth, which Anthony provided for the Lakers last season, averaging 13.3 points per game while playing 26 minutes per night off the bench.

According to the New York Post, the Knicks are debating whether or not to make Carmelo an offer, which is a really good thing. Like I said, he's one of the only players to bring back Knicks.
