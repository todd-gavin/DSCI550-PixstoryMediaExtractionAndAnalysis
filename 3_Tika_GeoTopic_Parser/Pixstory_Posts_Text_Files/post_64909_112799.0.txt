As many as five Amarnath pilgrims have died so far. 

In all, about 40,233 pilgrims visited the holy cave shrine in Kashmir after having 'darshan' of the naturally formed ice- Shivalingam from June 30 to Sunday morning, which seems a record of sorts. 

Out of these five, three passed away due to heart attacks. While Jai Prakash from Delhi died at Chandanwari, Devender Tayal (53) from Bareily collapsed at Lower Cave and Lipo Sharma (40) from Bihar passed away at Qazigund camp. 

Also, Jagannath (61) from Maharashtra lost his life due to some health condition at Pisu Top while another person Ashu Singh (46) from Rajasthan died after he fell down from a horse at MG top. 

Besides, a pilgrim identified as Virender Gupta has gone missing from the Chandanwari-Sheshnag route.

Generally, a person is cleared for pilgrimage after a proper health check-up. 

However, some pilgrims develop health complications at a particular height due to depleting oxygen levels that may prove fatal at times. 

The authorities have now decided to step up health check ups at certain points enroute the holy cave shrine. 

It is advisable to take all health precautions before embarking on such a holy journey and that too while trekking to such high mountain area.
