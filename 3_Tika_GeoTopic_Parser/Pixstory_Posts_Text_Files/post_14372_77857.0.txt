Earlier this week, Leo Messi was spotted at a Japanese restaurant with former FC Barcelona teammates Busquets and Alba. There was one noticeable absent - Gerard Piqué. 

Reposts suggest that Leo Messi is disappointed with longtime friend Gerard Pique in the wake of the contract saga which saw the seven time Ballon d’Or winner leave the club. 

Leo Messi made a sensational move to PSG on a free transfer at the start of 2021 season after FC Barcelona failed to secure funds to tie down the Argentine superstar. 

Though Busquets and Alba took pay cuts in a free up funds to help Barcelona extent Messi’s contract, the efforts didn’t yield any results. Pique didn’t take a pay cut until after Messi left the club and latter is said to be disappointed about the same, even now. 

Journalist Lluis Canut during an interview on TV3 said, 'The last contract renewal signed by Pique did a lot of damage to Messi and he felt disappointed. In part, he also felt deceived by Pique, because [he then didn't further reduce his contract] until Messi left the club and Messi felt he should have done that earlier to try and avoid his exit.' 

Is their relationship ‘broken’? Only time will tell but personally knowing what Pique feels for the club and how much he would have wished for Leo Messi to start at Camp Nou, it probably wasn’t even in his hands to make it happen.
