The 25-year-old Super Eagle recalls his time with the Serie A giants in Italy and does not rule
out a possible return.

Umar Sadiq, a Nigerian international, has refused to rule out a return to Serie A giants AS
Roma.

The 25-year-old attacker, who now plays for UD Almera in Spain, joined Roma on loan from
Spezia in July 2015 and made his Serie A debut on November 21 in a 2-2 away draw against
Bologna, replacing Juan Iturbe after 88 minutes.

On December 20, he scored his first goal for Roma, barely seven minutes after coming on as an
82nd-minute replacement for Mohamed Salah, in a 2-0 home win over Genoa.

Umar, who is presently scoring in the Segunda Division with Almeria, says he will always
explore a transfer to Roma.

Roma is like a second home to me. When asked if he would consider returning, he told
Tribal Football, as stated by Sporting Life, "I have my house and my family there." Roma
provides me with a great environment and all I need.

Umar had a fantastic season at Partizan,scoring 23 goals in 52 games, and when questioned
about the Serbian club, he remarked, "Partizan is a team that remains in my heart." "The club
wanted me when no one else did."

Roma confirmed on June 21, 2016, that they had activated their option and had signed Umar on
a permanent basis until June 30, 2020.

Umar was loaned to Bologna until the end of the season on August 31, 2016, with a buy option.

Before returning to Roma, he played in seven Serie A games. Umar signed a five-year contract
with Spanish club Almera on October 5, 2020.

Umar has made 40 appearances and played 3,166 minutes for Almeria in the current season.

Over the course of their 44 games, he has started 35 of them and came on as a substitute five
times.
