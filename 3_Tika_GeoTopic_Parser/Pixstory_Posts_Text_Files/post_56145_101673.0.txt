‌Opposition parties are urging the prime minister to explain a meeting with Sue Gray, a British civil servant over her statement on the party gate issue. 

It is said that civil servant Boris Johnson has met several weeks ago but the topic of their discussion is not clear.

A spokesperson for the Sue Gray investigation has debated a government source's contention the pair discussed containing photographs in her report. There has been chaos in the photos but it is said to be in the report. Labour has the fear that this meeting could damage confidence in the process and would repair the tarnished image of Boris Johnson. Ms Gray is all set to publish her full report on the lockdown gathering next week.

According to BBC said a senior official in No 10 said it was implied to Ms Gray that she might offer an update on her work to the prime minister. She approved that idea and sent the invite to ensure an appointment was put in both their diaries.

Her conclusions are anticipated to be published within days and the anticipation is reaching a climax. Anything that jeopardizes the authority of the report threats dragging out the partygate saga further and bogging Boris Johnson down in it indefinitely.

Of course, he's still confronting a parliamentary inquiry into whether he knowingly misled MPs about all this. We all know Sue Gray's report is important, but it won't be the last word.
