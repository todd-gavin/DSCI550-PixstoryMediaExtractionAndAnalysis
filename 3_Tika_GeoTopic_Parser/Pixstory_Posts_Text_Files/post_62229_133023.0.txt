If you want to know about the experiences during meditation, I cant describe them in general, because they have been diverse. I have felt restless at times, and there have been times when I have lost track of time. Moreover, I have realized that analyzing what happens during meditation is irrelevant. But I definitely want to share the transformations I have experienced due to regular meditation. It has:
1. made me more aware of my thoughts and yes, our mind is a chatterbox, the sad part being, that we dont even realize this.
2. brought more awareness about the body and whatever is happening inside.
3. given tremendous relief on the physical level, meaning more immunity and less pains.
4. given relief on the mental level, and helped me shut off the chatter in the mind.
5. made me more responsible towards everything around me, be it people or even the environment or, in a broader sense, towards the society.
6. brought a sense of dispassion (inside the mind) and more passion (outside, in the actions). I feel less attached to the results now.
7. made me look forward to life, with greater anticipation, and instilled a sense of wonder.
8. taught me acceptance for things beyond my control.
9. made me more content and grateful about the million blessings in my life.
10. brought awareness about my emotions, and reduced the time period for which one emotion exists.
I could write on and on, from different angles, but, it would be useless. In short, meditation has given me a glimpse of the love of the creation and instilled faith. This has inspired me to be a better human being. And I believe, THAT IS ENOUGH.
