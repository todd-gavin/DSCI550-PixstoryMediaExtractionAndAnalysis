Christian Pulisic appeared to be carrying the weight of millions of American soccer fans off his shoulders. 

Pulisic, the first American to play in and win a Champions League final, struggled in January, was moved out of his preferred position by Chelsea, and was even benched for a World Cup qualifier against Honduras, as reported by US News.

With his first international hat trick, he has propelled the United States to the brink of a World Cup return. He had energised his team, performed the worm dance for a supporter, received a yellow card for dissent, and finished the night by celebrating with his mother and father.

“The reason that tonight meant so much is because we want to be on the biggest stage, playing in the World Cup,” he said Sunday after leading the U.S. over Panama 5-1.

All the United States needs to do now is avoid losing by six goals or more against Costa Rica on Wednesday night in order to qualify for the tournament in Qatar in November. In qualifiers versus Costa Rica, the Americans have nine losses, one draw, and no wins, but they haven't lost by six goals since a friendly against France in 1979, and not in a meaningful match since 1957 at Mexico.

Pulisic, a 23-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania, is one of only four holdovers from the Clint Dempsey-Tim Howard generation's last night, including Paul Arriola, DeAndre Yedlin, and Kellyn Acosta.
