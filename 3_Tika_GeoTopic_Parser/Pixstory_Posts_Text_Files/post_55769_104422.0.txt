Aussies. Love. Brunch. What better way to start the day than with some robust bread, salty feta cheese, a lemon slice, and a big helping of thick, creamy avocado? 

As per NP, the modest smashed avocado has become a global favourite since it was first served in a Sydney bistro almost three decades ago. This meal is a perennial favourite in all Australian caf√©s, and it is now so popular that it is on the more expensive side of the brunch split, with some restaurants costing up to $23 for a portion! 

This led to the now-famous 2016 claim that smashed avo is the primary reason Australian millennials can't afford a home, which spawned a slew of op-eds, books, and memes.

Five years on, the property market may have changed, but the Aussie love for smashed avo on toast certainly has not!
