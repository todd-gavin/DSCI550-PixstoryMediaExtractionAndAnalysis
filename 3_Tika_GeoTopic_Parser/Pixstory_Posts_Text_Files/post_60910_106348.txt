As a HUGE fan of horror movies this is generally first movie in this genre which comes in my mind while recommending to anyone In my opinion this horror movie had the best plotline I d ever watched It was real creepy to me at first but as it went on all the mysteries had me more interested in the story I was coming up with theories again and again about all the mysteries in this movie and that last twist in the end just made my jaw drop six feet under I fully recommend this to all horror movie fans Trust me you won t regret watching it
