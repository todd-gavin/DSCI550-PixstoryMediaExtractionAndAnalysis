In the US News and World Report’s authoritative rankings of universities, Columbia figures at #2, alongside Harvard and MIT in the same spot, while Princeton is at the top. But a mathematician teaching at the New York-based university has challenged the ranking. With statistical analysis, he accuses authorities of cooking up the supporting data. The larger question he raises is if the rankings are accurate or helpful to students and parents. The debate triggered by the critique can improve the ranking methodology – otherwise it will reduce it to utter irrelevance.

Michael Thaddeus, professor of algebraic geometry at Columbia, thought there was something fishy about Columbia’s dramatic rise – from 18th in 1988 to third last year and now second. When he checked the data Columbia officials had presented to the US News, he found many ‘discrepancies’. For example, undergraduate class sizes were made to look smaller than they are, instructional spending was presented as bigger than it is and its professors appeared more educated than they are:  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/columbia-university-rank.html

University officials clarify that there is no standard for the data, one set of it can be looked in different ways, and they merely tried to meet the parameters set by the US News. (The newspaper meanwhile refused to take sides and said it would assume as accurate any data the universities provide.)

Thaddeus admits that the university where he teaches has indeed improved in many ways. He is questioning the data and the methodology, saying that all rankings are “inherently suspect.” If the data are not audited or scrutinized, anything goes. Several experts in the education sector have repeatedly criticized the ranking methodology in which 392 institutions are reduced to a neat hierarchy of academic excellence. Some say the ranking are biased to give more weight to reputation and wealth. Yet, it is “frightening” that students and parents take the ranking seriously.
 
Most universities too are unhappy with the ranking system, but since it has become the gold standard, they have to take it seriously. But University of Southern California has made a beginning this week by withdrawing from the rankings: https://www.wsj.com/articles/university-of-southern-california-pulls-out-of-education-school-rankings-citing-data-errors-11648055454?mod=hp_lead_pos13
