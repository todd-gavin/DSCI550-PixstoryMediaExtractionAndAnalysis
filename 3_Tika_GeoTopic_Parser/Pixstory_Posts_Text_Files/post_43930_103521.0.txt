With another exciting Premier League campaign coming to a close, we turn our attention to the headliner grabers - the goalscorers. This season was an enjoyable one for the race of the golden boot, with Mo Salah and Son Hueng-Min battling it out for the top spot. Ultimately, they shared the top spot with 23 goals a piece.

Here are the top 5 goal scorers for the Premier League this season.

1. Mo Salah (35 appearances, 23 goals, 5 penalties)

Mo Salah once again dazzled the Premier League with his goal scoring prowess, netting 23 goals in the season. Having finished second last year Salah had a blitzing start to the season, scoring 10 goals in the first 9 appearances with a hattrick against Merseyside rivals Everton.

He slightly dropped off after rejoining Liverpool after the African Cup of Nations but found his goalscoring touch at the end of the season - scoring late of Wolves to match Son’s tally for the season. The Egyptian averages just under 24 goals for a Premier League campaign, and would be glad to continue his record.

2. Son Hueng-Min (35 appearances, 23 goals, 0 penalties)

Son Hueng-Min has carried Tottenham to the top 4 this season, scoring goals at vital times when Harry Kane was struggling for form in the first half of the season. The South Korean improved on his previous season’s tally of 17 goals in the Premier League. Consistently reaching double figures in the last five campaigns, Son burst into life this season.

Son ended the season with a flurry, scoring 14 goals in the last 14 matches - leading Salah on the final day before the Egyptian came of the bench to tie their records. Hueng-Min Son will look to continue this form further into his Tottenham career, as he finally seems ready to step out of Harry Kane’s shadow.
