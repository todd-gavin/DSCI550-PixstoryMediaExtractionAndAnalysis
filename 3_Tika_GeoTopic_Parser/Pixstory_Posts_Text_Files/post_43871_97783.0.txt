Juan Mata

Few would have anticipated Mata's final season as a Blue, which finished with him retaining the club's Player of the Year award, would be his final season as a Blue. He left the club in January 2014 to join Manchester United, where he is still playing now.

Lucas Piazon

Piazon was the second of three debutants in this game, and he went on to make two more 
appearances before the turn of the year, however he has yet to add to his record of first-team appearances.

The Brazilian is now on loan at Rio Ave in the Portuguese top division, where he will be 27 in January.

Fernando Torres

Torres has followed the recent trend of allowing a film camera into his life, and his Amazon 
Prime documentary, The Last Symbol, is the result of this. He was scoring his fourth goal of 22 in his most prolific season as a Blue eight years ago, including our first goal in the Europa 
League final.
