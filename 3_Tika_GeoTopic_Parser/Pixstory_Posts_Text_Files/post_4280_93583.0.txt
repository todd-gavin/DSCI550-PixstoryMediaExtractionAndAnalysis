By all means, you still want to wash your hands after you visit the rest rooms, but you might want to lysol your cellphone while you're at it, as well. In a study by the University of Arizona, cellphones were found to have 10 times more germs than a toilet seat that was tested in the experiment. Guess what y’all? The grossness of the germs we interact with everyday doesn't stop at our cell phones: Your handbag can carry three times the amount of bacteria as a toilet seat. Your computer keyboard? Five times. Your faucet handle? 21 times. Your kitchen sponge? 456 times. So worry about the many other things that makes us sick and be sure to clean them daily.
