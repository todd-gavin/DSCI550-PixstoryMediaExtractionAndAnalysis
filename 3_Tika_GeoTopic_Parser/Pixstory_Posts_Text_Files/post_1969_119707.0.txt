Georgia Democrat Hank Johnson has introduced the TERM Act (Supreme Court Tenure Establishment and Retirement Modernization Act), which would restrict Supreme Court Justice tenure to 18 years. According to Johnson, term limits are "a necessary step toward restoring balance to this radical, unrestrained majority on the court.‚Äù

It seems that radical has become a term of art for describing individuals with whom you disagree. The introduction of such a bill at the highest level of government raises the question of whether Democrats would seriously explore term limits if the majority of the Supreme Court judges were liberals, and whether their goals are truly aligned with Democratic ideals.

Representative Steve Scalise said it perfectly: "When the Democrats get their way on rulings, they're happy with the Supreme Court. When they don't get their way, they want to pack the Supreme Court. They want to change the Supreme Court."

The Supreme Court has become the final untouched institution of power that Democrats are scrambling to seize. Fortunately, Joe Biden seems rational in at least one aspect, since he does not favor court packing. However, given how drastically his policy views have shifted over the years, it would not surprise me in the least if he were to change his opinion.
