Munshi Prem Chand was born on 31 July 1880 in Mouza Lamhi, near Banaras. His real name was Dhanpat Rai and at home he was called Nawab Rai. 
He had his early schooling in A Madrassa where he learnt Urdu. 
Prem Chand's first creation was a comedy-drama he wrote at the age of 14, based on his ugly uncles. The following year, he wrote another play, Honhar Barwa Ke Chakne. Neither of these plays were ever printed. His literary career began five or six years later with a short novel titled ‘Asrar-e-Ma’bid’, which was published serially in the weekly Awaaz-e-Haq in Banaras between 1903 and 1904. In 1916, he completed his huge novel "Bazaar-e-Husn" and it became popular in Hindi under the name "Siva Sadan". The novel was published in Urdu in 1922. Premchand gradually became a Hindi writer because he got better compensation from Hindi publishers. The same thing happened with "Ghaban" and "Maidan-e-Amal" (Karam Bhoomi in Hindi). 
The British government confiscated his writings several times. In 1934, he came to Bombay at the invitation of a film company and wrote the story of a film, Mazdoor, but influential people banned its screening in Bombay. The film was released in Delhi and Lahore but was later banned there as well due to fears of unrest in the industry. In this film, he himself played the role of a labor leader. In Bombay, he could have found more writing work in films, but he did not like the film industry and returned to Banaras. In 1936, The last days of Prem Chand's life were full of hardships and constant illness. He died on October 8, 1936.
