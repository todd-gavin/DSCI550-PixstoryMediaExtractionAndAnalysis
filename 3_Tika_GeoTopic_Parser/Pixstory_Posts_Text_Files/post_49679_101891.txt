Another Republican governor has come to a little sense Asa Hutchinson governed of Arkansas has acknowledged that an anti abortion trigger law that he signed on to the books would oversee a heartbreaking circumstances if Roe v Wade is overturned in which girls as young as who became pregnant through rape or incest would be forced to give birth Hutchinson s words are ONE of the aspects every abortion supports have been speaking about for years and still is fighting for every day He said he had signed an Arkansas trigger law Senate Bill which would ban almost all abortions the instant Roe was overturned even though he disagreed with its lack of exceptions for incest and rape When asked why he signed it then he said I support the exceptions of rape and incest I believe that should have been added it did not have the support of the assembly He also said that those are heartbreaking circumstances When we passed these trigger laws we were trying to reduce abortions but whenever you see that real life circumstances like that the debate is going to continue and the will of the people may or may not change A report by the Guardian this month found that at least US states have enacted laws that ban abortions without any exceptions for rape or incest Such trigger laws are legally written in such a way that they would come into effect the second that the constitutional right to an abortion embodied in Roe was overturned I am still asking how a state decide rights over a woman s body
