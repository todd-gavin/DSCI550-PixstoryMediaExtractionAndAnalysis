Farhan Akhtar will be seen in Ms. Marvel episode 4 and/ or episode 5, the 48-year-old actor-director has revealed. Akhtar's presence on the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe series — which also marks his Hollywood debut — was already known, but now we have a better idea of when we can expect to see him. On Tuesday, Akhtar revealed that he worked with director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy on Ms. Marvel. Given Obaid-Chinoy is helming Ms. Marvel episode 4 and episode 5 — set to air June 29 and July 6, respectively, on Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar — it's only natural to deduce that Akhtar is part of one or more of those episodes. Akhtar has an undisclosed guest role on Ms. Marvel.
