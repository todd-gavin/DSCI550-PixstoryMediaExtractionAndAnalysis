When is a sparrow not a sparrow? The Eurasian Tree Sparrow and House Sparrow are in a different family (Passeridae) from all the rest of the sparrows in North America (Passerellidae) and are not closely related. If you look carefully, youâ€™ll notice that the body proportions and beak shapes are quite different between the two groups.
