The sandwich that I would prefer the most is an unusual combination The combination that I prefer the most is two slices of bread along with a scoop of Nutella with some Lay chips that s of chilli flavour I usually have them as a reward for myself when i achieve something and sometimes use them as a cheat diet I get happy while I treat myself to this delicious and yet finger licking good sandwich I learned about this sandwich from my sister and we grew eating this kind of sandwich more than any other type of a sandwich I also sometimes have an extra layer of chips which adds on more of crunch Try this on and let me know about this combo
