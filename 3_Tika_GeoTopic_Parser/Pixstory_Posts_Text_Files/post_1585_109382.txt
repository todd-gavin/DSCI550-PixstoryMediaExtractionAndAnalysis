The Kings will be on the clock to make their pick in the next few hours Here are three reasons to just go with Jaden Ivey and figure everything else out later The first is that he will be the best player available unless something unexpected happens He showed the kind of game at Purdue that should have the three teams above the Kings in the draft at least talking about what he would look like on their team Secondly there seems to be this belief that because the Kings have Fox drafting another guard would be a silly thing to do The Kings can t get lost with this distraction Unless one of the top fall Ivey is the only consensus potential star left More than anything else the Mings need start talent If it doesn t work out with Fox an Ivey Mitchell backcourt tandem would work well Finally and perhaps most importantly the Kings should just draft Ivey because they can always move him later if they don t like what they see Remember this is the team that moved Haliburton who many believed was off the table in trade talks because of how high his upside was After less than two years in the league he was the main player in a deal that got them a former All Star in Sabonis So if Ivey shows even some promise his value will go up around the league We might live in a league saturated by guards at this point But if you are good enough you will still stand out Situations change quickly to the point where even organizations only a couple of years removed from the Finals could come calling about Ivey The only reason the Kings should entertain moving off the fourth pick is if one of the top three want to move down or if an amazing trade with star talent comes their way
