PepsiCo India has selected Publicis Groupe agency Leo Burnett India as its creative partner to drive long-term growth and momentum across its foods and beverages portfolio. 

As part of the partnership, Leo Burnett will be responsible for the company’s creative and digital mandate across all brands in the country. The account has been won after an intense multi-agency pitch. 

Earlier in April, PepsiCo ended its three decades relationship with WPP, PepsiCo India and called India’s top agencies for media and creative pitches, excluding WPP agencies. WPP’s Mindshare and Wunderman Thompson were the company’s media and creative agencies on record, respectively. 

Last year in November, WPP had won Coca-Cola’s $4 billion worth global business. Since then, it was anticipated that PepsiCo might change its agency soon as no brand wants to work with agencies with competing brands. 

George Kovoor, Senior Vice President, PepsiCo India, said, “At PepsiCo India, our aim is to create innovative and purposeful consumer campaigns that help us engage effectively with our consumers. With an intent to further accelerate our marketing efforts, we are delighted to welcome Leo Burnett as our new creative agency. Their strategic thinking along with robust creative & marketing capabilities make them the right partners for our next phase of growth.”

Dheeraj Sinha, CEO Leo Burnett, South Asia & Chairman BBH India, said, “We are overwhelmed with the trust posed in us by PepsiCo India in aligning their portfolio with us. PepsiCo’s business in India is witnessing a tremendous growth journey and we are looking forward to being their partners in accelerating this momentum. The mandate offers us a wonderful  opportunity to further create groundbreaking work, and integrate culture, creativity, data and technology in campaigns, going forward.”
