An interesting study I read on BBC today . The researchers studied 191 countries for real covid death numbers claims the real numbers are three times higher. 

The researchers just counted excess deaths- like how many people generally die in a year and what were the numbers in covid. Also the fact that many deaths were recorded under different diseases or health conditions was reason for under reporting . 
The researcher took into account the fact that covid worsened these underlined health conditions .

More than 18 million people - three times higher than official records suggest - have probably died because of Covid, say researchers.
Their report comes two years to the day from when the World Health Organization first declared the pandemic.
The Covid-19 excess mortality team at the US's Washington University studied 191 countries and territories for what they call the true global death figure.
Some deaths were from the virus, while others were linked to the infection.

This is because catching Covid might worsen other pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart or lung disease, for example.
The measure used is called excess deaths - how many more people have been dying than would be expected compared to recent years, before the pandemic hit.
