This happened when i was traveling with my parents.I was on a train and the staff served everyone grilled sandwiches.
A man was sitting besides me . When everyone was given their plates i was very happy cause i just loved grilled sandwiches.
Astonishingly i found the man eating my grilled sandwich.
I spoke with a dominating voice "uncle you have my sandwich ..give it back'
Everyone just looked at me .My mom was furiously looking at me.
Just as i stood i saw my plate of grilled sandwich besides me and then the situation was like 'lol'
I apologised and it was kind of a humourous situations.
