After a disappointing season the Los Angeles Lakers now have a big summer ahead as they look to get things back on track The Lakers have already made one significant change by firing head coach Frank Vogel and it looks like another could be on the way Perhaps no one took more blame for the Lakers failed season then Russell Westbrook who was the team s big acquisition last summer in hopes of getting back into championship contention For a variety of reasons Westbrook s first season in his hometown didn t go as planned and now with him expected to pick up his million player option for the season all reports have indicated the organization will look to trade him Considering Westbrook is a declining player on a high price tag trading him won t be a simple task for the Lakers He will be playing on an expiring contract though which could make him appealing to teams looking to get out of long term salaries One team that fits that category is the Charlotte Hornets who will need to pay Mile Bridges LaMelo Ball and PJ Washington in the coming years Because of that the Hornets have already been linked to the Lakers in Westbrook trade talks with the idea of them getting out of long term salaries such as Gordon Hayward Terry Rozier and Kelly Oubre Jr According to NBA insider Marc Stein the Lakers would prefer to acquire Rozier over Hayward given the latter s injury history Yet it has since been conveyed to me that the Lakers have more boundaries than advertised when it comes to weighing Westbrook trades One league source said that injury histories would be a prime consideration in any deal given how injuries have so routinely intruded upon the last two seasons for both year old LeBron James and year old Anthony Davis
