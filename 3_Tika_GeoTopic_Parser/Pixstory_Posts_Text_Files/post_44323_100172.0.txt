China was selected to host the 2023 AFC Asia Cup on June 5, 2019, at the AFC Extraordinary
Congress in Paris. China was going to host the tournament across 10 cities between June 16
and July 16, 2023.

The 24-team tournament already had its logo made and released into public and the brand new
Shanghai Pudong Football Stadium was going to host matches.

However, the Chinese Football Association has officially informed the Asian Football Confederation that they won’t be able to host the Marquee football tournament citing the rising
nature of the pandemic.

The AFC now needs to find new hosts for the tournament scheduled just a year away. The
Confederation has already released a statement saying that they’ll soon announce the new
hosts.

India is going to play the qualifiers for the AFC Asia Cup in the month of June. The Blue Tigers
were drawn in the group D besides Cambodia, Afghanistan and Hong Kong.

They will be playing their matches on June 8, June 11 and June 14, 2023 against Cambodia,
Afghanistan and Hong Kong respectively.

The matches are going to be played at Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan or the Salt Lake
Stadium in Kolkata.
