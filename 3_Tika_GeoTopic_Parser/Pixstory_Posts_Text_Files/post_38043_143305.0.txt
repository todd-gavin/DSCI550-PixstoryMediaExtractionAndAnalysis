European champions Real Madrid could reportedly attempt bringing in Bukayo Saka from Arsenal next season. The Spanish giants are looking to reinforce their right wing. For this, they have recognized the Arsenal star to be a possible option. 
As per 90m, Real Madrid along with Manchester City are currently monitoring the situation of Bukayo Saka. Talks have been going on for a few months regarding a contract extension for the Arsenal star. However, things are yet to materialize. The Gunners are reportedly positive about the winger's situation. However, Saka wants a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave in case of Arsenal failing to reach the Champions League. 
Real Madrid currently have Rodrygo and Marco Asensio on their right wing. With Asensio reportedly on his way out next season, Los Blancos would be in the market to sign a quality replacement. With Kylian Mbappe out of the picture, for now, Bukayo Saka could be a very good alternative for the Spanish giants. 
Saka scored 11 goals and provided 7 assists in the Premier League last season. The 21-year-old has started the 22/23 season positively as well, scoring a goal and providing 2 assists in six PL games. 
Vinicius, Rodrygo, Tchouameni, and a few other youngsters are getting a chance to flourish at Madrid. Hence this could eventually motivate Bukayo Saka to move out of Spain as well.
