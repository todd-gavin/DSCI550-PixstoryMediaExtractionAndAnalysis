Imitating Christ s Humility Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ if any comfort from his love if any common sharing in the Spirit if any tenderness and compassion then make my joy complete by being like minded having the same love being one in spirit and of one mind Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit Rather in humility value others above yourselves not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others In your relationships with one another have the same mindset as Christ Jesus Who being in very nature a God nbsp nbsp nbsp did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage rather he made himself nothing nbsp nbsp nbsp by taking the very nature b of a servant nbsp nbsp nbsp being made in human likeness And being found in appearance as a man nbsp nbsp nbsp he humbled himself nbsp nbsp nbsp by becoming obedient to death nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp even death on a cross Therefore God exalted him to the highest place nbsp nbsp nbsp and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow nbsp nbsp nbsp in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord nbsp nbsp nbsp to the glory of God the Father
