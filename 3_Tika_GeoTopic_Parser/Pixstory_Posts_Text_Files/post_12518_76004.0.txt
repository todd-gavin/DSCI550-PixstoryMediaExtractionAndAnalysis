Mental exhaustion can happen to anyone, and it can’t always be avoided. That said, taking a few preemptive steps can help lower your chances of experiencing ongoing mental fatigue.

▪️Take regular time off: Taking a short vacation, or even a single mental health day, can help you head off mental exhaustion when you start to feel depleted.

▪️Make time for self-care: Building time into your weekly (or daily, if possible) routine for rest, exercise, and enjoyable activities can help you feel more prepared to handle the tougher challenges life throws your way.

▪️Rest when you’re sick: Whether you’re dealing with mental or physical symptoms, allow yourself time to rest and regain your strength. Trying to power through without any downtime will generally only leave you feeling worse.

▪️Stay connected to loved ones: Maybe you already know your loved ones can’t do anything to change your situation. Still, don’t forget the power of a compassionate listener. Simply talking through what’s on your mind can often help — it might even lead you to a solution of your own.

▪️Know when to say no: Taking on more responsibilities when already overwhelmed can offer a nonstop route to mental exhaustion. If you dislike the abruptness of “No,” you might try, “I can’t, maybe next time, or “I’m not available to help at the moment.”

Untreated, mental exhaustion can have a major impact on mind and body wellness, and eventually, your relationships with others and overall quality of life. Professional support, however, can often make a big difference in your symptoms.
