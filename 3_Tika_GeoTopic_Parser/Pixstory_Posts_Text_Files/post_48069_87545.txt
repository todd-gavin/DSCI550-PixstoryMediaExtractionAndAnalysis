A flower does not think of competing with the flower next to it It just blooms The Japanese say if the flower is to be beautiful it must be cultivated To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow Every flower must grow through dirt Every flower blooms in its own time The flower that follows the sun does so even in cloudy days
