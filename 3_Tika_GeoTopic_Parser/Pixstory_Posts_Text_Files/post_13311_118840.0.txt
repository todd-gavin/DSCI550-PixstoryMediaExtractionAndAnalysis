The Italian Coast Guard announced on Sunday that around 700 migrants were rescued on Saturday off the southern coast of the country and five bodies were found in the water.

The Italian Ministry of Interior said that more than 34,000 migrants have entered Italy since the beginning of this year, which is 25,500 people in the same period last year.

Most of the 674 migrants were found in a fishing boat 124 miles off the coast of Calabria, Italy, and the rest were rescued from the water.

A search and rescue operation was carried out by a merchant ship and the Italian Coast Guard and the Financial Police.

In the statement of the Italian Coast Guard, it is stated that these migrants were transferred to port cities in Sicily and Calabria on Sunday morning, and five bodies were also transferred to the morgue of Messina Hospital in Sicily.

Data from the Italian Ministry of Interior shows that more than 34,000 migrants have entered Italy since the beginning of this year, which is 25,500 people in the same period last year.

Mediterranean countries that are on the main routes of refugees to Europe, expect more than 150 thousand refugees to enter these countries this year; Because the lack of food due to the war in Ukraine will probably fuel a new wave of immigration from Africa and the Middle East.
