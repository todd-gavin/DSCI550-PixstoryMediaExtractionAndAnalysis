Cinema has a major influence on setting beauty standards. How cruel is it when one has to abandon their comfort and follow the trends and fashion just to 'fit in' or else they are bullied?

‌At the Oscars, Chris Rock use his comments on Jada Smith's look as his punchline by quoting another woman Demi Moore from G.I Jane wherein she played a role of a lieutenant. He not only condemns the look of Demi Moore but also Jada Smith. Demi Moore at that time was trolled and faced criticism for her looks. Meanwhile Jade or Smith could have made a statement on how cool was Demi Moore's looks and how she carried herself in different looks throughout her career! Smith could have talked about Alopecia and raised awareness through his speech. Jada could have criticised Chris Rock herself or corrected him. But violence made the whole situation sink into dismay. No sides can be taken!

‌I see people hating their bodies and going through all kinds of transformations just considering their looks not healthy. It's perfectly fine to transform your body to remain healthy. It's not okay to hate your body alter it in a different way to go with the trend. 

Moreover, laws restricting discrimination based on hair is very important to eradicate these internalised standards of beauty. You never know what a person is enduring; so you don't have the right to judge/discriminate against them.
