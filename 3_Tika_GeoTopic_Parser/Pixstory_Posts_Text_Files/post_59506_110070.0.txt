After Saraswati Saha's national record time of 22.82 seconds and Hima Das' 22.88 seconds, it was the third-fastest time ever recorded by an Indian. 

Long jump champion Ancy Sojan continued her steady run and won the gold with 6.44m, while Asian silver medalist Annu Rani won the women's javelin throw with a strong 62.29m effort. Her most recent jumpers all exceeded 6.40 metres. 

Karanveer Singh won the men's shot put after Tajinderpal Singh Toor, the Asian record holder, withdrew. Eldhose Paul, who was desperate for a 17m or longer to increase his chances of competing at the World championships in the US next month, took the silver with 16.55m, and U. Karthik struggled through his series before producing a 16.15m in his final jump for the bronze.
