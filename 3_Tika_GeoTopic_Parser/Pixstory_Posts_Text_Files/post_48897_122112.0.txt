You're not helping white supremacy in veganism by calling veganism white—you're worsening it. veganism is a bipoc concept, bipoc vegans are tirelessly fighting white supremacy in the movement. Don't. Erase. Them. To end white veganism you gotta amplify bipoc vegans. (source: saarhairadha| twitter)

According to research, Black people are more likely than white people to go vegans. In fact, they are the fastest growing demographic in veganism. In general, people of color are more likely than white people to cut back on their meat intake, adopt a flexitarian diet, and become vegans, according to data analytics company Gallup.

When you try to imply veganism is a western concept, you are not only factually incorrect but also giving the credit of BIPOC cultures to white people – which means you're just contributing to the pre-existing practice of white people stealing BIPOC concepts and calling them their own. Just because it got an english term by a white man does not mean it did not exist before that dude gave it a name. Despite the fact that the phrase was just coined seventy something years ago and the majority of its present influencers are white, its roots may be traced back to ancient Asian traditions.

Al-Ma'arri, an Arab philosopher and poet, was one of the first supporters of what we now call a vegan diet, abstaining from animal products for his health and ideas in soul transmigration and animal care.

Claiming that veganism is a white concept is a misinformed, tonedeaf and a racist way to erase the constant struggles of BIPOC vegans who are trying so hard to be heard in white dominated spaces.
