Cereal Killer Café 
The bearded, tattooed (of course) twins behind the Cereal Killer café copped a bit of flack when they first unveiled their unconventional eatery. But while a bowl of cereal can cost up to £4.50, it’s important to note that there’s more than just a couple of dusty boxes of Weet-Bix and Milo on offer here. The café is filled with more than 120 cereals from around the world, 30 different milks and 20 different toppings, with the boys promising to bring back the fun-factor to our brekkie.
