Stalking occurs when someone repeatedly harasses or endangers someone else, causing fear or safety concerns. Most often, stalking occurs by someone the victim knows or with whom they had an intimate relationship.

Help prevent stalking by knowing the warning signs and how to get help. Stalking is very common and About 1 in 6 women and 1 in 17 men have experienced stalking in their lifetimes, according to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS). 

Common tactics of stalking include,
Unwanted phone calls, Unwanted emails, instant messages, text messages, voice messages, or social media messages, Approaching a victim or showing up unwanted, such as at the victim’s home, workplace, or school, Leaving strange or potentially threatening items for the victim to find, Watching, following, or tracking a victim, Sneaking into the victim’s home or car and doing things to scare the victim or let them know the perpetrator had been there. Anything familiar? These are the aspects often glorified in films which inspire people to do similar things in the name of love. Some people in this way, manipulate or force you to love or to be in love. 

We can be safe by Helping others define and recognize stalking behaviours, Creating and supporting safe environments within relationships, schools, and communities through programs and policies that promote healthy relationships.
