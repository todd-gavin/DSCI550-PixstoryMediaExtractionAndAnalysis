The side which got recently promoted to the English Premier League will face the side that barely escaped relegation in the previous season in the first game of the campaign. Bournemouth are all set to take on Aston Villa at Dean Court in the GW1. 

The preseason for Bournemouth did not go as they planned. Bournemouth lost games to Braga, Bristol City and Real Sociedad in the pre-season club friendlies. In their most recent friendly, they lost to Real Sociedad 2-1 which will be a cause of concern for the gaffer.

On the other hand, Aston Villa remained unbeaten in the pre-season friendlies. They won two games, whereas they drew 2-2 against Manchester United. In their most recent friendly, they registered a win over Rennes by 2-1 and will look to carry the momentum to the league.
