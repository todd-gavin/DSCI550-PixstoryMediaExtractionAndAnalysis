Not long ago Bengal was the dominating force in Indian football Three of the teams from the state Mohun Bagan East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting were the best in the country and won every club level trophy multiple times To add to it Bengal had a remarkable state team who won the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy with monotonous regularity Those days are gone Bengal football is very much on the decline Neither the club teams nor the state side from the eastern metropolis Kolkata perform to the level they once used The focus has shifted to other states Goa were at the top for a few years but currently they too are not at their best since two of their best clubs have decided to withdraw from the national scene The ongoing season certainly belongs to Kerala They proved themselves the most dominating force in every aspect in both men s and women s football It began with Kerala Blasters exceptional display in the high profile Indian Super League In the battle for the league title they finished fourth but they hugely impressed in the knock out round In the semi final they tamed league champions Jamshedpur FC and lost the final to Hyderabad FC on penalties after leading by a goal till the th minute Next came the Santosh Trophy Kerala hosted and finally won it too by beating Bengal in the final in front of home crowd The title round tie was a seesaw battle with Bengal first taking the lead before Kerala came back to score the equalizer and finally winning it in tie breaker At the moment one of Kerala s top teams Gokulam Kerala are doing a superb job in I League and also in the Indian Women s League If everything goes according to plan then Gokulam Kerala men s team are only a step away from winning the I League title ahead of Mohammedan Sporting At the women s front the team have done superbly by scoring goals in six matches The title could well be theirs for the second time in a row if they beat nearest rivals Sethu FC Madurai
