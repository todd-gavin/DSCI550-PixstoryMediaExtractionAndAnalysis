People with PGD are preoccupied with grief and feelings of loss to clinically significant distress and impairment, which can manifest in various symptoms, including depression, emotional pain, emotional numbness, loneliness, identity disturbance and difficulty in managing interpersonal relationships.
In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) approved another trait. They state that PGD symptoms also cause significant trouble in essential areas, such as personal, educational, or work life. If the person can still function in these areas, it’s only through intense additional effort.

Multiple assessment tools specifically for grief related to bereavement have been developed. The first such assessment tool was the Inventory of Complicated Grief in 1995. As of 2021, the ICG remains widely used. According to a 2020 systematic review, there were eleven assessment tools at the time, three of which were designed for clinical interviews. The Traumatic Grief Inventory Self-Report was the only assessment tool found to have empirical evidence supporting its use as a diagnostic tool. Later evidence suggested that the ICG also remains an effective clinical assessment tool.

Prolonged grief disorder therapy (PGDT) can help you feel better with this condition. This treatment is based on research on psychological and social functioning after loss. It’s a short-term treatment that focuses on and adapts to your specific needs. In PGDT, you’ll work with an expert to discuss your:

-Attachment relationships
-Self-determination processes
-Emotion regulation processes
-Cognitive processes
-The relational and social self
-And several other psychosocial processes
