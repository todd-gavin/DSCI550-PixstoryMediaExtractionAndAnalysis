The Uprising of with the the Sepoy Mutiny is not just about a rebellion against the British East India Company initiated by Hindu and Muslim sepoys who were upset about being forced to use rifle cartridges with grease derived from beef and pork It is also not just about Mangal Pandey and Rani Laxmibai who have leapt out of history textbooks to large silver screens now If one is keen to explore narratives that try to understand the same uprising from a different political and emotional location Tears of the Begums is a must read It focuses on the plight of Mughal royals especially women who were compelled to live in penury after the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was deposed and exiled to Rangoon by the British East India Company in The book estimates that approximately royals were living inside Delhi s Red Fort at the time of the Uprising This is Rana Safvi s English translation of Khwaja Hasan Nizami s book Begumat Ke Aansoo The original was written in Urdu and first published in There are heart wrenching stories here of women who were in dire straits all of sudden after a lifetime of luxury Some ran away and hid in jungles to protect themselves from British troops and Indian sepoys Some sought shelter in the homes of their wet nurses and servants Some had their jewellery stolen Some became widows Some were separated from their children Some had to beg for food Some had to wash utensils work as cooks or sew clothes to make a living Some were abducted and married off without their consent Some were dragged and beaten up Some died of cholera Some died during childbirth because there was no one to help Some were dependent on monthly pensions given by the British Some of the stories are filled with despair and resignation The people telling them feel that the havoc perpetrated by their ancestors in the past has led to their misery Fate retribution faith and repentance are recurrent themes in the pages of this book The spiritual function of storytelling seems quite important to Nizami who we are told was born into a Sufi family
