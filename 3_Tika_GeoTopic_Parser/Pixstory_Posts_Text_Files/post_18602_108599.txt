Inter begins to strengthen concretely for next season The first arrival not for the attack but for the midfield Raoul Bellanova arrives on loan with the right to buy from Cagliari even if at the beginning there were rumors that the midfielder hired to replace Perisic should first be bought outright But no, Inter will pay a sum to have the player available already in the season which will start in mid-August and then decide in a year whether to return him to Sardinia or to buy him for around million euros Bellanova should be used on the right wing by Simone Inzaghi but also on the left as deputy Gosens The arrival of the year-old continues the line chosen by Inter for the rejuvenation of the squad as already done with Empoli&#39;s Kristjan Asllani
