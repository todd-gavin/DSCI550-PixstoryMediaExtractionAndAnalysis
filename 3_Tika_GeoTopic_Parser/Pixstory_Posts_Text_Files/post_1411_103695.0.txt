The internet was in absolute uproar after finding out that it is apparently common cultural practice in Sweden NOT to feed guests who come to your house. A Reddit user posted their experience of going to a friend's house and being made to wait upstairs in a room while the friend ate dinner with his family. What was truly shocking about this was Swedish people confirming this habit! 

Twitter quickly united to condemn this practice. Jewish people, Black people, Arabs, Muslim people - all of them expressed how important it was to feed guests.

Now, there may be some cultural reasoning that explains this - apparently, Swedish people practice an economy of thrift, which necessitates only making a certain quantity of food. Also, people just eat at their own house before visiting other people's houses. 

However, I will admit to finding it somewhat distasteful- 'guest is king' is such a bone-deep principle in so many cultures, religions, and communities. I can't fathom the idea of eating in my house without serving a guest - like many people who responded to the original thread, I'd rather go hungry and let them eat, if there's not enough food! 

How about you?
