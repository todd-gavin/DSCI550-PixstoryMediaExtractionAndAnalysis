When it comes to rating clubs based on the amount of big-name recruits they've made over the years, Real Madrid appears to be at the top. Los Blancos have spent astronomical sums to acquire some of the game's best stars, thanks to their Galacticos philosophy.

Some of these players were able to justify their transfers at the Santiago Bernabeu by impressing with their performances and successes. Others, on the other hand, were unable to perform in the Spanish capital due to a variety of factors including adaption challenges, inability to handle pressure, reoccurring ailments, and simply poor luck.

#5.  Eden Hazard

In the summer of 2019, Eden Hazard completed his dream transfer to Real Madrid, leaving Chelsea for a fee of €100 million. Unfortunately, his time in Spain's capital has thus far resulted in more questions than answers.

Hazard has been a shell of his former self since his move to the Santiago Bernabeu, with persistent injuries limiting his impact. With 15 separate injury setbacks in only two years, the playmaker has spent more time on the treatment table than on the field.

#4.  Michael Owen

Michael Owen signed for Real Madrid in the summer of 2004, just three years after winning the Ballon d'Or. During his time at Liverpool, the striker was a formidable opponent. When he switched to the Santiago Bernabeu, though, he appeared completely lost.

Owen only stayed in Madrid for a year, largely warming the bench. He made 45 appearances for the Liga giants in all competitions, scoring 16 goals and assisting four times. In the summer of 2005, Newcastle United bought him for €25 million, bringing him back to the Premier League.
