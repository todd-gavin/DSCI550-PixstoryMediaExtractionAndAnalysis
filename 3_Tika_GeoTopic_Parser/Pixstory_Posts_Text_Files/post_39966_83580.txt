Kashmiris believe in a personal relationship with food they consume everything by hand The following set of dishes would arrive just as one had finished eating the meat This practice is repeated until all mutton dishes have been served When a Kashmiri refuses to eat a variety of foods or an additional serving they consider it rude They ll go to tremendous lengths to convince you including threatening to kill you if you don t accept an additional serving And without considering the rice chutneys and curd each person is offered easily kg of mutton and chicken The meal is provided in such a way that the chef strives to make room for more food For example radish chutney is offered between two heavy mutton meals to stimulate hunger and allow the previous dishes to be digested swiftly It s also worth noting that Kashmiris have an easier time digesting all of the meat due to the high mineral concentration of the Calley s water which aids in meal breakdown Here are some of the tempting Wazwan dishes Methi Maaz Minced sheep Tripe Curry flavoured with Methi fenugreek leaves the first dish set in Tream Daniwal Korma Mutton Korma cooked in coriander and Ghee with yogurt based gravy Sabz Haakh Spinach like leafy greens cooked in mustard oil with chilly without which Wazwan is incomplete Goshtaba Meatballs with cheesecake like texture minced with fat and dipped in mutton broth with gravy based on curd cardamom dry ginger and fennel Marchwagun Korma Fiery hot Kashmiri chilly korma three quarters of the chilly used in the entire wazwan is singularly used in this dish Kashmiri Pulao Basmati chawal cooked in milk and ghee with saffron and dry fruits and kishmish separately roasted in ghee Tabakh Maaz Glossy ribs cooked in ghee then simmered in yogurt till dry Aab Gosht Mildly flavoured sheep ribs cooked in milk gravy with cardamoms and saffron Amir Khusrow rightly said perhaps after this meal Gar firdaus bar rue zameen ast hameen asto hameen asto hameen ast If ever there is Paradise on Earth It is here It is here It is here
