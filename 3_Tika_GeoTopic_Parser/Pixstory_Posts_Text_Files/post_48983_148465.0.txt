Why are we still celebrating a sport like hunting, fishing and whatever other ways in which humans can be cruel to animals? It's a barbaric practice that needs to end like yesterday! It has absolutely devastated our ecosystem.
Furthermore, hunting animals often leads to their deaths slow and agonizingly. They're usually shot multiple times with high-powered rifles, which can cause them to bleed to death slowly. Once they're down, hunters often take pleasure in finishing them off by making them fight for their lives until they die.
Hunting also has a devastating impact on the environment. Not only do animals killed in hunting consume vast amounts of resources that would be better put towards more sustainable forms of food production, but their bodies also leave behind massive amounts of waste that has to be disposed of somehow. This not only harms wildlife ecosystems, but it also poses a serious threat to human health because it's full of toxins and diseases.
In fact, some studies have even shown that hunting can actually increase the risk of human violence, and hunters are generally more aggressive than others. I mean, do you not see what it must take for humans to literally ENJOY killing and bloodshed? It encourages people to kill other beings for fun or entertainment instead of using more ethical methods like shooting targets or hunting in a controlled manner. Hunting should be banned because it's an unnecessary cruelty that has no place in today's world.
