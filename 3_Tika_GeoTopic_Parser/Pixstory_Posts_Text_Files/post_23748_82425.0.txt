Peter looked on as a herd of elephants closed ranks, pushing their young into the middle of the group for protection.

A bull elephant had been trying to separate a newborn calf from its mother.

Peter was photographing the herd in Addo Elephant Reserve, South Africa, when the newborn let out a shriek.

The herd reacted instantly -- blowing loud calls, flapping ears and then surrounding the young and reaching out their trunks for reassurance.

Elephants create bonds that last a lifetime, and they can show emotions from love to anger.

Peter feels 'There is something magical and beautiful when you observe elephants -- it touches your soul and pulls at your heartstrings.'

Equipment used: Fujifilm X-H1 + XF 200mm lens; 1/5000 sec at f2; ISO 200; handheld.
