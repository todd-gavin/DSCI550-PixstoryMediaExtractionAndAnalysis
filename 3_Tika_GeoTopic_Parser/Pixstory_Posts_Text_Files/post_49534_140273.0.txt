"Hundreds of colourful bouquets and rows of flickering candles brightened the gates of Buckingham Palace as night fell on Thursday.
A thousands-strong crowd remained outside the royal residence, with many huddled under umbrellas and tearfully consoling one another"
The country mourns the death of their Queen after her passing. She lived through fifteen prime ministers in her time of reigning â€“ 70 years, as the longest reigning monarch of England.
