When most Americans had a shared view of the Capitol attack on Jan as an unwarranted attack for which Donald Trump and his backers in Washington that day are to be blamed But a significant subset of Americans comprising a large chunk of Republicans disagree New polling conducted by YouGov for Yahoo News gives a new assessment after the house committee s series of public hearings started About half of the people said that they hadn t watched the hearings live or even later coverage of it Among those who specified Fox News as their preferred cable news outlet nearly half said they d seen no coverage of the hearings Was the riot justified Again most Americans said no But half of the Republicans said either that it was or that they were not sure if it was On this question though not others to the same extent the views of the didn t watch group reflects that of political independents YouGov also asked whether the attack was part of a conspiracy to topple the election and if so whether Trump was at the head of it Most Republicans said that the attack was not part of a conspiracy Perhaps the most remarkable finding centred on the causes of the riot As noted above most Americans point at Trump as earning blame for the riot But that s true of only a quarter of Republicans and less than half of those who didn t watch any hearing coverage Who do Republicans think deserves the blame Nearly three quarters said that left wing protesters striving to make Trump look bad deserved at least some blame for the attack more than accused Trump or even the Trump supporters involved in the day s violence Among those who said they didn t watch coverage of the House committee hearings half accused these theoretical leftists Many even believe that the committee was lying this is the influence Trump has over his followers literally making them blind to evidence Source YouGov and Washington Post
