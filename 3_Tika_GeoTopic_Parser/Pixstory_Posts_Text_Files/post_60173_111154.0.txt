The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced that Jasprit Bumrah would captain India in the rescheduled fifth Test matchup against England at Edgbaston. On Friday, the series-deciding game will start in Birmingham.

Rohit Sharma's availability was in question when head coach Rahul Dravid told the media that he had not yet been "ruled out." Bumrah would take the helm in Rohit's absence, it was announced moments before the captain's news conference on the morning of the game. Rishabh Pant, a wicketkeeper, has been selected as the match's vice-captain.

During India's match against Leicestershire on their international tour, Rohit Sharma tested positive for COVID-19.

Bumrah will captain India in its 36th Test match and become the first fast bowler to do so since Kapil Dev.
