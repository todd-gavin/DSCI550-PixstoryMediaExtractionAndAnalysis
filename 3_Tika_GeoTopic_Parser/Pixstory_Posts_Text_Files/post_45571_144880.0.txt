When it comes to country music, nothing compares to Vern Gosdin!He had the nickname "The Voice" before the NBC programme even existed. I am unsure of how much clearer that needs to be. As per Billboard, Jones and Haggard, two of the singer's biggest fans, both thought Gosdin's phrasing was on par with anyone. Gosdin was always a bit of an underdog in the industry, and much of his recorded work was released on smaller, independent labels. However, record labels played a minor role when you heard him on authentic country songs like "Today My World Slipped Away" or "If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)". He inspired a generation by performing every song as if it were his last.Do you like Vern Godsin?
