Management of everything that life throws at you isn't easy. As you get older, it keeps on increasing, and the only way out is to prioritize. Everything can't be served on a silver platter, and one needs to work for what one wants.
At the age of 18, post my graduation, I took a job with the Railways. This was a great help to my family as I could also contribute to buying my equipment. Along with this, I had to also look at my studies, sports, and family. One of the factors that helped me manage was that I had no choice. I had to do all of it if I wanted to play well and additionally, Sports is a field that teaches you how to manage everything while prioritizing mental peace as you go on. In my final year of college, as everything was going on, I managed to win the national medal in the youth category!
Now I am in CAG in Guwahati. Due to my great performance, I have been the captain for the past 7 years and I work from 10 am - 2 pm. The rest of the time, I focus on my other priorities. I stay independently here, my family is back in Dibrulghar. So, I need to take care of my additional basic needs myself which becomes very hectic sometimes. 
My day starts with an early morning practice post which I leave for my office. I come back around 2 pm, and I rest and practice again. This facility of working for only four hours is a blessing. Right now, I pay more attention to fitness. Closer to the tournament, I connect with dieticians and nutritionists to help with my food intake. I also do a lot of meditation and focus exercises on improving concentration. Table Tennis is the 2nd fastest game, so your hand, eye, and mind coordination are indispensable. Out of say, 100 aspirants, only 1 succeeds because you only have a fraction of a second to apply your strength and still make the ball land within the table.
All this is nerve-wracking and tiring, but, definitely worth it!
