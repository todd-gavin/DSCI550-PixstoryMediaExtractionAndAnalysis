Arsenal s third choice goalkeeper Arthur Okonkwo spoke in an all exclusive interview to GOAL this week The year old opened up about his experiences since the start of the season where he made the big leap to the Gunners first team Despite not having played at all the Englishman is grateful for the course of his development in the first team I m a completely different goalkeeper now than I was in pre season he says Being in and around the first team every day you improve not only as a keeper but as a person You learn how to communicate better you understand your environment better He was expected to transfer away from the Emirates last summer but the Arsenal goalkeeping position was in jeopardy Soon after he signed a long term first team contract but was essentially the squad s third choice keeper Brighton and Hove Albion keeper Aaron Ramsdale was soon signed and spent much of the season as first choice ahead of Bernd Leno As soon as Aaron came in last summer you could see his character and how he presented himself every day Okonkwo reveals I have to say I ve never met anyone like Aaron before He s a little bit crazy but an amazing guy and he s a great person to be around Both he and Bernd are amazing and I m so privileged to have worked with them They are two top keepers On Leno s position as second choice Okonkwo said Bernd has sat out most of this season after playing almost all of the games last season But he s been amazing He hasn t once changed his character or the way he has trained Day in day out he s still good around everyone He s still the same Leno I knew last season and that shows me a lot from a learning point of view
