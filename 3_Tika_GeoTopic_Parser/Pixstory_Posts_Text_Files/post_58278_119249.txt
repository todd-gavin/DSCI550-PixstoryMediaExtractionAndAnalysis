There a few things which are essential for a romantic story a male lead a female lead a heartbroken second male lead and a Villainess mean girl But do we really need an evil girl who sabotages the main couple because she is obsessed with male lead Why in almost every romance story does the second girl have to be a villain while the second male lead receds and accepts defeat If two boys can bond over heartbreak girls can bond too Why must girls fight each other and resort to petty things just to get the guy Most of the time they potray girl friendships as fragile and delicate that easily break when a guy is involved While this not the case In real life if guys follow bro code girls do as well They are not petty obsessive creatures that try to harm every girl who crosses paths with the guy they like Most girls don t go around bullying people like that Why cant we have two girls bonding over their failed love and consoling each other Having them realise in the end that they do not need to end their friendship because of love It s high time we get good portrayal of women friendships in media
