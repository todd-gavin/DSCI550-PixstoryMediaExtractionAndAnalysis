We ll be alright guys My thoughts exclusive of any external factors The performance in general was positive I think we imposed our game the way I thought we would We lacked the final pass at times or the big shot chances The goals we conceded could have been prevented had we not been too naive with the ball Sambi was caught out but that s the risk we take on a young player who s still developing We worked hard to get it so there ll be disappointment in how we were cut open so easily Overall there s a lot of positives to take away If we play like this at every away ground there ll be more good days than bad The three subs may have impacted the rhythm of our pressure the front end appeared to lose momentum in the final minutes However Fabio Vieira has shone a light on his qualities I think we may have a gem here Looks direct and seems to have a taste to shoot on sight On to the next one
