Reports in Spain suggest that La Liga giants Barcelona are working on a swap deal with Serie A
giants Inter Milan. Barcelona have always been keen on securing the services of Argentine
forward Lautaro Martinez but haven’t found themselves in a good financial situation to pursue a
cash deal. Thus the club is looking for a swap deal, offering Inter Milan Miralem Pjanic and
Memphis Depay in exchange of the 24-year-old.

Lautaro Martinez has been highly regarded across clubs and his stats talk for themselves.

 The
forward has 66 goals and 23 assists to his name in 173 appearches for Inter Milan. In the
current ongoing season, the player has registered 17 goals in 41 appearances across all
competitions.

The player is also a regular for the national team, playing 37 games so far netting 19 times and
was part of the team that won the Copa America last year.

However, it remains to be seen if Inter Milan are interested in the offering. Pjanic has experience
of playing in Italy, having represented AS Roma and Juventus and was widely considered one of
the best in the league, however since his move to Barcelona things haven’t been top notch for
the midfielder who currently is on loan at Besiktas. And on the other hand, Depay too has
struggled to find form with Barcelona having scored 10 and assisted twice this season and
currently is nursing an injury. While reports suggest Inter Milan are keen, Barcelona will be clear
gainers if they land Lautaro Martinez.

Barcelona are also said to have already spoken to Martinez’s representatives and hope to
secure the player with several other reports linking the player to rivals Atletico Madrid and Real
Madrid.
