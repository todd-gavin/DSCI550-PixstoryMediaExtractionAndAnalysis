Wearing too many colours Nothing is wrong with a bit of colour or a colourful outfit as long as it sticks with one main one However when we mix many colours it looks mismatched making us appear less severe and a little garish Wearing clothes that don t fit Sure not everyone can afford a personal tailor or perfect fittings but it is essential to make sure our clothes fit us for the most part At least we need to check the sleeves the overall size the length and how tight our outfit is primarily according to our looks Overlooking comfort for style Looking good is essential But those fancy shoes that squeeze your feet and leave you in pain are not worth it The overlooking style for comfort The opposite is also true Your comfort is essential but it should not be a good reason to put on a worn t shirt for an important meeting Of course comfort matters more in some cases like if health is involved but alternatives will always allow you to move freely and feel good without looking weird or careless Caring too much about brands Good clothes are not always synonymous with branded clothes or expensive clothes
