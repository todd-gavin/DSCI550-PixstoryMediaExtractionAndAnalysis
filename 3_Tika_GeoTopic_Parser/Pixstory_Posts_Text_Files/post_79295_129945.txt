I think by now almost everyone is on board the Arteta train and rightly so but it s fortunate that the owners had a lot more patience than some of our fanbase The state that the club was in was going to take a huge overhaul and a lot of trust for one man and I think we chose the right one Looking back years ago and seeing the way we play now shows such a huge contrast but that s not down to a change in ideology of the man in charge but rather Arteta finally getting his players something that those who backed him always said was going to make the difference Expectations still need to be tempered because Rome wasn t built in a day and whilst we re slowly improving game by game eventually we ll get to the top Remember these players are still young and inexperienced and we will inevitably face adversity at some point in the season How we respond to that will be key as to how successful we end up The way Arsenal are moving right now should be a lesson to other fanbases to be patient and trust the process but it really does feel like we ve got something going now and it s exciting to be a part of it There s still work to be done in this transfer window to build on what we have but adding a CM a winger makes this team very serious Let s take every game as it comes and see where we end up Arsenal PixstoryArsenal
