Montpellier will be taking on Monaco on 9th October Sunday at Stade de la Mosson. This is the encounter of two teams in the upper half of the table with Montpellier in the 9th position and Monaco in the 5th position although they only have a point difference of 5. 
Montpellier are coming off facing a disappointing defeat from Toulouse as they lost 4-2 even after taking a lead in the 7th minute. In the last four games Oliver Dall'Oglio's team has just won once and would like to come back stronger as they have the required momentum from the previous game.
Meanwhile Monaco are having a good season and are currently in a four game winning streak and defeated Nantes 4-1 last weekend with Wiss Ben Yedder scoring a hat-trick. They also beat Turkish side Trabzonspor by 3-1 in the UEFA Europa league.
Let us now have a look at the details about this upcoming match.

Match prediction:- Montpellier 1-2 Monaco
Montpellier would be playing at their home which would prove to be a positive for them as they performed well in their home so far this season and would like to escalate their position in the points table. 
Monaco, however, are in great form in the French league lately and they are the favourites to win this encounter.
