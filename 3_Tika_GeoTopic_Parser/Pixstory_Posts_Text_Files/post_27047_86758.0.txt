# Red Notice
 
Netflix has had many high budget original films, Red Notice is the most recent one of them. With a colossal budget, this movie is yet another heist drama which makes it’s way around Dwayne Johnson. 

Dwayne’s character is very similar, since it’s a heist movie, Dwayne could only play one character… yes you guessed it right he became an Interpol officer. Joining him are two strong forces in form of Ryan Reynolds and The ever so lovely, Gal Gadot. 

But even a trio as strong as this could not save what was destined to be a sunken ship. There is no plot, even for a no brainer heist movie, Red Notice is unbelievably drab. The twists are set up as if we are going to see a “Shutter Island” type of twist but they fall flat on your face, it is pretty easy to guess every single event of the movie, nothing takes you by surprise and if by chance you cannot guess it, you really need to watch some more heist movies, considering this as your starting point. 

Ryan Reynolds is indeed a strong screen presence and even though he plays the similar kind of roles over and over again, this performance was one of his weakest, his jokes just weren’t funny but he still somehow managed to outshine both Gal and Dwayne, so good for him. Gal Gadot does not show the dynamic of a character that should have been portrayed better. 

In conclusion, Red Notice is definitely skip worthy, don’t go by the numbers presented by Netflix, if you want an action flick which actually satisfies you and is there on Netflix, watch 6 Underground but definitely skip this.
