WHO estimates that 47.4 lakh covid related deaths took place in India in last two years. The official count is 4.8 Lakhs. 
The figure vehemently denied by government of India besides individually by governments of some 20 states. Speakers at a health conference objected to WHO report today- the figure is 10 times the official count. 

WHO revised death figures for most countries putting the deaths due to covid 19 and its impact to around 15 million which is more than twice the official count around 6 million. Most of these deaths according to the organisation have been unreported in Southeast Asia, Europe and Americas. 

So did India undercount? 
Opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi tweeted “science doesn’t lie, Modi does”.
According to data, India is ranked number one interms of numbers of deaths followed by Russia and Indonesia with more than 10 lakh deaths each. 
Could such a large number of deaths have been missed . 

We all know people died in large numbers. We all know those who died post covid with covid complications were not even recorded as covid deaths . I have a case in the family. 

What about those who didn’t report covid deaths due to the stigma that was attached to it in the earlier days of covid?

What about deaths in far off villages/ rural areas, where people did not even figure out that covid was killing them. 

We do still remember the pictures of pyres and the ganga ghat. 
But can over 40 lakh deaths remain unaccounted ?
