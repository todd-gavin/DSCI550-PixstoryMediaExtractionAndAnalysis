After months of training and playing friendly matches outside the country, FIFA World Cup 2022 host Team Qatar started its local camp in the country Saturday.
Felix Sanchez’s men started training at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha’s Al Sadd Club as preparations for the grand event pick up steam 50 days ahead of the tournament.
Qatar News Agency reported that the training is open to the public on Sunday as part of improving interaction between fans and players ahead of the World Cup that kicks off on November 20.
The Qatari squad will leave on Wednesday for the Spanish city of Marbella where it will join a new camp which will be an extension of the camps that started in June in Spain and then Austria and ended late last month.
Qatar played three friendly matches in the Austrian capital Vienna in September during which coach Sanchez tried out new combination of players including younger members of the squad before choosing the final team that will compete in the World Cup and includes 26 players, to be submitted no later than November 13.
Qatar played Canada on September 23 at Villa Park in Vienna, losing 2-0 to the North American side. The match against Chile, also at Villa Park, ended in a 2-2 draw, giving some cause for hope to the Qatari side.
