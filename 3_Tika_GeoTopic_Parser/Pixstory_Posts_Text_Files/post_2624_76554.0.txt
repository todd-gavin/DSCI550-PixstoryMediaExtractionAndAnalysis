*HAPPY REPUBLIC DAY* to all !!!

Amazing and incredible but true. This picture is of the invitation card issued for the Republic day celebration in New Delhi, today.. In the foot area of the card it is mentioned that 'Sow this card to plant an Amla plant' ', in English .  It is incredible but true that this card is made of seed paper, which contains the fertilizer mixed in during production process of that paper and can actually be planted in the land to grow an 'amla' plant...!!! This paper on which the card is printed also called plantable paper, which is a biodegradable paper..

Kudos to those, who conceived this novel idea..!!!
