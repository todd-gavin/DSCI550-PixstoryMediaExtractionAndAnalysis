Have you ever travelled in Delhi Metro? I bet if you did, you would relate to me.

On my very first day of college, I had class at 8.30 and had to catch the metro around 7 am. I was pretty worried because it was the first time I was travelling alone, this far, and that too, this early in the morning when this city doesn't even wake up completely.

And to my amusement, I was totally wrong! The metro station swarmed with people as if there was some kind of fair going on. Yes! that was how much the entire station was crowded. And from then onwards, till now , of the very few things that I learnt, boarding the "women's only" coach when you're travelling alone, has been the best. Here's my personal directory of the few things (rather saviors) you should always keep account of, while travelling in Delhi Metro:

Metro Card: You know you will have to spend 20-40 bucks more if you forget your metro card at home (students like me relate most to this, lol, afterall we can plan an entire meal in 40 in college canteens, can't we?)

Earphones: It is a long journey to your destination my friend, if your earphones don't accompany you throughout. (remember to charge them every night else you'll be equally ditched)

A quick breakfast, wrapped in aluminium foil (this is a luxury, people living away from their families, mostly can't afford)

and last but not the least, 

Your favorite book or journal to read, because nothing matches the vibe of being lost in reading a book in crowd with your favorite music as background score.

I'm sure it helps and may the voices of constant announcements "The next station is.....", haunt us forever XD
