 January was when this picture was taken In the celebration of New Year s my mom s family and I had a bonfire on the verandah We had paneer and kebab on sticks over the fire keeping us warm during the chilling night in Rajasthan When I look back at this photo it reminds me of my burning passion during New Year The passion to be a better version of myself to work on me and make priorities in life
