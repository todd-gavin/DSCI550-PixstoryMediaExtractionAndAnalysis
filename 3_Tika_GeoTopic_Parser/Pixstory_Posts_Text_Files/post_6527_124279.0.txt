Fact-check
Alt News closely examined Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel to gather more information on this video. The full video of this press conference was uploaded on Rahul Gandhi’s YouTube channel on August 4. We listened to the press conference in its entirety.

Responding to a question asked at the 11:30 minute mark, Rahul says, “The opposition that fights in democracy fights on the strength of the institution. This means that the opposition derives its power from the country’s legal structure, judicial structure, electoral structure, and the media. All these institutions are giving full support to the government. Why? Because the government has installed its own workers inside these institutions. Today, not a single institution in India is independent. Today, every institution in India is under RSS control. Every institution has at least one RSS member sitting inside these institutions. So, we are not fighting a single political party, we are fighting against India’s entire infrastructure. When Congress was in power, the infrastructure was neutral, we did not control the infrastructure.
