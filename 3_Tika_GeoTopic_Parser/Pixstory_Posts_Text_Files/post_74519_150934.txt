Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan s big action movie Vikram Vedha has just hit the screens yesterday and it comes up with a lot of expectations Having said that the film had low start in some centres while it had a fair opening in selected multiplexes According to early estimates the movie has collected in the range of Rs crore The opening has come across as a shocker for the entire cinema going fraternity since it s lower than the conservative expectations too but a sign of respite here lies in the fact that the film reports on the ground are on the positive side The hope from here on lies on is on the reviews and word of mouth to translate into footfalls over the weekend and then maintain a healthy trend until the two big Diwali releases roll in While the three national chains PVR Inox and Cinepolis have clocked approximately Rs crore with Inox and Cinepolis putting in Rs crore The single screens and mass belts have surprisingly not come on board despite a high on action trailer While there might be multiple explanations for this one of the main aspects for not exciting the youth mass seems to be the lack of music and romance in the film Apparently the opening of the film is similar to Shamshera but this one has a much wider release in terms of its screens so that should add up to the higher collection But trade predicts that the film will be catering to multiplexes more than single screens owing to the on going Navratri celebrations As per the trade website the makers should have released the film on October which is the Dussehra holiday That would have led to the film getting an extended day weekend and it would have also motivated people to go watch the film once Navratri is over
