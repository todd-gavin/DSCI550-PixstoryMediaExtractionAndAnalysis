Success is a highly subjective term. It's definitely not achieved in one night. It takes a lot of mental strength and self-control, irrespective of its definition. However, I believe the route still stands to be the same. Discipline and smart work is the key. A mistake made by many people is that they wish to master every aspect of a field. However, the trick lies in not doing everything well, but doing one thing perfectly. Many are scared to start their path to potential victory due to fear of failure. However, failure is a part of your way to success!

For instance, I've had my share of downfalls. The most challenging year for me was 2007-08. Before this, I was a part of many matches and was performing well. In fact, I took 6 wickets against Bangladesh in the Asia finals. Unfortunately, I could not play for India in a specific league due to certain circumstances. So, in 2007, I joined the "Indian Cricket League," or ICL. This was before the very known Indian Premiere League came to existence. The issue was that the BCCI did not sanction this.
Consequently, they ended up banning ICL and the cricketers involved in it. It was a mess and we couldn't play for a year. This phase of one year was highly excruciating and unpredictable. I was uncertain about my future in Cricket. Thankfully, it passed soon enough and I made a comeback in IPL as a part of Mumbai Indians.

I've learnt a lot throughout my journey in Cricket. All I would tell young cricketers is that do not waste time trying to ace everything. Trust your instincts, figure out your strength, and follow proper guidance from your coach.
Life will throw a lot of obstacles in your way and you need to be mentally tough. Attend yoga classes, meditate, go for one-day workshops or do courses. You have the potential to reach wherever you want but without determination and patience, you won't be able to go beyond a point. The earlier you realize the vitality of it, the better!
