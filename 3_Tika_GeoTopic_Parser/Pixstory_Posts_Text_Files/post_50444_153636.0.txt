Learning new things and adventuring on our own way. Making mistakes , falling 'n' no. of times, but still there is a smile on our face. While working in the lab, we itself learned that mistakes are common to happen and sometimes mistakes are fortune to happen, we learned how to stay patient, we learned to appreciate the beauty of nature and so there are more things to learn.
Cheers!
