These two overlapping spiral galaxies, SDSS J115331 and LEDA 2073461, are more than a billion light-years away from Earth and were photographed by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. The alignment of the two galaxies is probably purely by accident; they are not actually interacting, despite looking to collide in this image. Hubble has photographed a stunning variety of other galaxies that are in fact interacting, but these two galaxies may just be ships passing in the night. This image is one of many Hubble views diving into highlights of the Galaxy Zoo project. The huge citizen science initiatives Galaxy Zoo, which was first launched in 2007, and its offspring crowdsource galaxy classifications from a pool of thousands of participants. These volunteers categorise galaxies that robotic telescopes have captured.Volunteers working on the initial Galaxy Zoo project found a variety of bizarre and amazing galaxies, including rare three-armed spiral galaxies and colliding ring galaxies. The project's coordinators requested Hubble time to observe the most peculiar residents of the Galaxy Zoo, but in keeping with the project's beginnings in crowdsourcing, the public decided the list of targets.Source: NASA TV
