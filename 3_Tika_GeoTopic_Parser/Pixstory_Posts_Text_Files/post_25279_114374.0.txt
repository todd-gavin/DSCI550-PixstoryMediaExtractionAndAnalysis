On the night of 17th june, i posted this story on Instagram, desperately wishing for rain. And i slept.
I was woken up by the sound of the rain and i loved it..
Today again i want it to rain, with all my heart.
I've posted about it here instead of instagram, and i hope I'm woken up by the sound of the rain.
