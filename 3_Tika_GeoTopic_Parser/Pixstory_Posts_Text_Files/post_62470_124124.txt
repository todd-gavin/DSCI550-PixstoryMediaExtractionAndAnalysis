Since sunderban tigers were not systemically hunted like other tigers these ones have no innate fear of people These tigers will attack and kill people just like they would do to any other animal They are the most ferocious tigers in the world and hold a record of being the biggest maneating beasts These ambush predators have unmistakable offense technique and their claws make it nearly impossible for their prey to escape Komodo Dragons are not much different These gore y merciless creatures are on top for a reason Nobody dares mess with them in the wild because they know there s no winning there These dragons will eat anything in sight without a second thought Humans Sure Komodo Dragons are dangerously venomous with their venom immobilizing its victim pretty quick and killing it in a few hours So which one wins a fight A bengal Tiger and a Komodo Monitor are both apex predators of their lands which means none of these asian maneaters have a natural predator in their environment They both have similar length averaging feet even though sometimes the lizard can be bigger When it comes to body weight the tigers have an advantage While a dragon can go from anywhere near to lbs the Sunderban tigers can go up to lbs The bengal tigers best senses are their hearing and smell which makes them extremely stealthy Komodo lizards have an extremely good sight and an advantage of smell and of course the Jacobson s organ which give them a certain advantage over the tiger However the tiger s speed will have the lizard wondering what got it Komodo s skin however is not so easy to get through If they were put in a room together a crazy fight will surely ensue A tiger s defense skills are better than the dragon too While the claws of our furry friend won t do much a damage to its scaly opponent its height would give it enough advantage to take a savory bite of the lizard s neck Enough to cause serious damage and much likely death
