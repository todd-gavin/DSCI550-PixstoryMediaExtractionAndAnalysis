Our hearts were created to be guided, not to be followed. Our hearts were made to believe in God; they were never intended to serve as our personal gods.

Making our hearts into gods and letting them guide us will only lead to narcissistic suffering and, ultimately, damnation.


   Trust in the LORD with all your heart,
    and do not lean on your own understanding.
    In all your ways acknowledge him,
    and he will make straight your paths.
    Be not wise in your own eyes;
    fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.

(Proverbs 3 : 5-7)
