Back in 2012 when I saw Student of the Year, I would have said no. Wow, a rich beautiful girl acting as a rich beautiful girl.. incredible. I rolled my eyes and moved on. But then with the release of Highway and in Udta Punjab, I felt she did really well. Even the dance she did in 2 States was well done Alia has completely transformed my opinion of her and I‚Äôm truly impressed. I never expected her to be good, but she became one of the best in such a a short time. And now in Gangubai kathiawadi her acting was brilliant and when i saw trailer of Gangubai I thought vidya balan suits best for this role but after watching this movie my pov changed i liked that film a lot‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî•
