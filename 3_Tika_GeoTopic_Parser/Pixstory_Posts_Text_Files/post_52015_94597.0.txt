In a social media post on Monday signed with his partner Georgina Rodriguez, the pair said their new baby boy could not be saved.

"It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away," they said.

"It is the greatest pain that any parents can feel."

Ronaldo announced in October last year that the couple was expecting twins.

The Portuguese footballer has four other children, the eldest being 11.

In their statement, the pair thanked doctors and nurses who tried to save their son's life.

"Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness," he wrote on the social media post.

"We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time

No other information has been released about the birth.

Ronaldo, a five-time world player of the year, rejoined Manchester United this year after spells with Real Madrid and Juventus.

Manchester United released a statement saying: "Your pain is our pain. Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time."

A number of players and clubs passed on messages of support via Twitter, including Real Madrid, which sent its condolences to its "beloved" former player and his partner.

Ronaldo made headlines on the pitch this weekend after scoring a hat-trick to lead Manchester United to a 3-2 victory over Norwich City.

It was his 60th professional hat-trick.

United will play title-chasing Liverpool on Tuesday evening.
