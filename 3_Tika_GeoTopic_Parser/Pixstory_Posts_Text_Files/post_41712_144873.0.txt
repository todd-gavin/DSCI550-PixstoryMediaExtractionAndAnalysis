FIFA 23's official player ratings for the Socceroos have been made public by EA Sports. After a challenging season, Australia's men's squad eventually made it through the playoffs to their fifth consecutive World Cup. Sporting News reported that with a few players representing their teams in the UEFA Champions League this season, the current Socceroos roster is loaded with quality. The best part is Maty Ryan is the highest-rated Australian player in FIFA 23 for a fourth consecutive year. The seasoned goalkeeper received a grade of 78 overall, which is a slight improvement than the 77 he received in 2017. Ryan moved to FC Copenhagen in the off-season after having trouble getting regular playing time with Real Sociedad last year. He is currently representing the club in the Champions League Group Stages!
