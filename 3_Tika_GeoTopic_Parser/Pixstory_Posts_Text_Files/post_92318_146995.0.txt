Birsa Commando Force (BCF) chairman Durga Hasda, who laid down arms on August 15, 2004.
For me, there is no place for violence in a civilised society and in a democracy. Peace must prevail at any cost.
The BCF was formed in 1997 in the wake of continued atrocities on tribals between 1996 and 1998. It has been on a ceasefire since 2004. The BCF has about 550 cadres, and is demanding a separate Adivasi land, Scheduled Tribe (ST) status and security for the community.
I was initially disillusioned with the system,and returned to the mainstream after realising that nothing can be achieved through violence.
