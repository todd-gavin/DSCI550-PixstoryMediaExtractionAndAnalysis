Every human from corporate worker  to  students to athletes everybody loves coffee. There’s no end in learning about coffee, the coffee varieties depending upon the terrain to continents, climate to their cultivation, procurement and roasting. Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. 
The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread. As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe. There are four different types of coffee beans: Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa.

08 Steps from Seed to Cup 
1. Sowing: A coffee bean is a seed. It's dried, roasted, then ground to make coffee. It may be planted as a coffee tree if it isn't processed. In general, it takes 3–4 years for young coffee trees to yield fruit, depending on the type.
2. Harvesting the Cherries A significant harvest occurs once a year. With two flowerings every year, like Colombia, there is a major and secondary crop.
Most nations harvest the crop by hand, but in areas like Brazil, where the terrain is flat and the coffee fields are vast, the process is automated. Coffee is collected in one of two methods, by hand or machine: Strip All of the cherries are picked at once, either by machine or by hand.
