It is a known fact that Sara Ali Khan is very particular when it comes to her workout sessions. The beauty doesn't miss even a day of her workout and often gets clicked taking classes from the same Pilates instructor. Today too, she was snapped as she exited post a rigorous Pilates session. Sara was seen wearing a white colour short jumpsuit with her hair open. She was carrying a huge black colour bag and continued wearing a black mask.
On the work front, Sara was last seen in Atrangi Re and she has recently wrapped up the shooting of an untitled film co-starring Vicky Kaushal. The shooting was done in Indore.
