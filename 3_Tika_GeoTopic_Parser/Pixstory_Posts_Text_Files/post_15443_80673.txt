The thirty-three year old British singer Adele at the end of the Brit Awards ceremony which this year for the first time saw all the artists competing in a single category raised the trophy saying I understand why the name of this award has changed but I love being a woman and being a female artist I do I m really proud of us I really really am It was who via social media wanted to raise the controversy by accusing Adele of being a TERF acronym for trans exclusionary radical feminist and of confusing teenagers Now a reflection seems necessary to me Historically women have always had it tougher than men In much of the world still today their life is worth zero In the world of work they still struggle to gain respect it&#39;s nice that there is acceptance that there is inclusion that there are equal rights that everyone is free to wake up in the morning in a man&#39;s body and feel like a woman and vice versa that there respect for everyone&#39;s sexual choices BUT if a woman is no longer free to say she is proud to be a woman and to have won a competition that includes only one category competing as a female artist then we have a problem So let&#39;s take a step back tens and dozens of years Because If someone wanted to stand up tomorrow and shout from the stage to be proudly male or straight or gay or whatever he couldn&#39;t But what do we do then discrimination on the contrary This inclusion For me not something absurd and forgetting history a story that has seen women perpetually submissive and that TODAY must allow them to shout their pride always and in any case I think so and honestly I also believe that many confuse equality rights with the fact that we are all the same We are not all the same not at all we are all unique and special
