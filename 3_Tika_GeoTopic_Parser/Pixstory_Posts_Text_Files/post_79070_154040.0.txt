An early Martinelli goal, just 58 seconds after kick off, put Arsenal ahead in a lively first 45 minutes.That was, unfortunately, the best moment for Arsenal - who were ultimately not at their best from then on.Credit where it’s due, Liverpool have been good - but a range of sloppy passes from Arsenal have seen the home side surrender their lead in this “Big 6” clash.Some poor defending in the build up to the goal, and an easy finish for Darwin Nunez, who’s been really good to be fair.TIME TO EDIT! WE’VE SCORED! Martinelli leads the counter attack after being played in by Jesus. He takes on Henderson and Trent, then cuts inside and plays a perfect ball to Saka for a tap in at the back post.Big 45 to go…
