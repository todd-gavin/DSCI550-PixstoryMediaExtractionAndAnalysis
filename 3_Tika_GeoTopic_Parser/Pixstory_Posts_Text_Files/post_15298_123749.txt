Cystic fibrosis represents the most widespread serious genetic disease in Italy with over new cases per year caused by the mutation of the CFTR Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive systems. In particular, this genetic alteration causes a production of very thick mucus which obstructs the bronchi and leads to repeated respiratory infections up to progressive respiratory insufficiency The particular involvement of the respiratory system typical of the disease had led to the hypothesis that patients affected by the CFTR gene mutation could represent a group at higher risk of SARS CoV infection A recent study of the University of Verona has instead highlighted how in the bronchial cells of subjects affected by cystic fibrosis the replication of SARS CoV is significantly reduced thus opening original considerations in understanding the mechanisms of SARS CoV infection and in perspective be a basis for the development of new strategies pharmacological The results of the study carried out thanks to the support of the Cariverona Foundation Progetto Enact and with the contribution of the non-profit Italian Cystic Fibrosis League Veneto were recently published in the scientific journal Cells in an article entitled CFTR modulation reduces SARS CoV infection in human bronchial epithelial cells Del research team led by Davide Gibellini professor of Microbiology and Clinical Microbiology in the Department of Diagnostics and Public Health in collaboration with Claudio Sorio professor of General Pathology and Andrea Sbarbati professor of Anatomy and Histology are part of Virginia Lotti Anna Lagni Andrea Di Clemente Marco Ligozzi Flavia Merigo and Paolo Bernardi with the scientific contribution of Ercole Concia former university professor Researchers from the universities of Bologna and Chieti Pescara also contributed to the collection of data The research group of the University of Verona studied different models of bronchial epithelial cells with and without mutations of the CFTR gene by identifying a significant reduction in the replication of the SARS CoV virus in cells that presented mutated CFTR The mechanism underlying this phenomenon still to be clarified in its details explain the researchers but the current hypothesis that one of the determining factors may lie in the alteration of the balance intracellular ionic and molecular inducing a significant lower efficiency in virus replication
