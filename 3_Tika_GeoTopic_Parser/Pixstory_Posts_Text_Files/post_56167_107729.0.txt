About 500 Ukrainians are still living in hotels a month after coming to Scotland, MSPs have heard.

Yevhen Mankovskyi, the Ukrainian consul general in Edinburgh, said he did not understand what was resulting in a "block" to stop those coming to Scotland from being fitted with hosts. He had asked the staff to visit those in hotels. 

The consul general said he discern that Edinburgh is "full" and Ukrainians are being shifted elsewhere in Scotland.

He told Holyrood's Europe committee: "Approximately 500 people throughout Scotland live in hotels for more than one month. Unfortunately, we don't have direct numbers.

Mr Mankovskyi said he did not assume those arriving in Scotland to be refugees, but instead, Ukrainians who have earned "temporary protection status" will one day return home.

Neil Gray, the Scottish government minister said that he doesn't want to see people in hotel rooms for any longer than is necessary.

The minister pledged to leave "no stone unturned" in making sure the matching service was working as quickly as possible. Why are people still in hotels does this means the super sponsor scheme isn't working?
