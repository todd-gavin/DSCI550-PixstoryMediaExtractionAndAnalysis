The diva and undisputed queen of world pop blows out the candles and decides to do it in Italy The star of Vogue is not new to celebrating birthdays in our beautiful country but usually she spent them in Salento while this year she decided for Sicily Landed yesterday with her large team of family and friends immediately decided to celebrate their second son Rocco, also a lion whose birthday was a few days ago The singer and her daughters wore Luisa Beccaria dresses another splendid tribute to the country that hosts her and of which she too feels part About twenty years ago a guest on an episode of Carramba the unforgettable Raffaella Carr asked her what Italian was in her given the origins of her family Without even thinking about it in a decisive and confident tone the singer replied my heart We are therefore happy that Madonna has decided to celebrate another special event in Italy and we are immensely grateful to her for the cultural revolutions she has carried out for having opened and paved the way for many of her colleagues and have shaken up the modest and limited public of the past Best wishes Regina
