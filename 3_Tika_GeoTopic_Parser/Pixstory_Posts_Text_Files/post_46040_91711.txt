If you haven t heard about the eight epics adaptations of Harry Potter by J K you are probably living under a rock The popularity of these movies cannot be comprehended in words The movies and books form an imperative part of childhood of almost everyone I know These are movies that are not loved by one generation only but are like a legacy which is being carried on It goes without saying that when it comes to adaptations nothing beats Harry Potter To justify this first we need to ask ourselves what exactly is a good adaptation of a book According to me a movie that is creative project as a standalone project but at the same time true to its source is a good adaptation While Lord of the Rings is undoubtedly a good adaptation it just fails to bring that magic on screen which was in Tolkien words on pages It maybe called good as a separate fantasy movie but people who have read the Tolkien novels have certain expectations which the movies quite not meet Harry Potter movies on the other hand should be a touchstone for future directors or filmmakers on how to adapt a movie It is a tough feat to bring Hogwarts the characters their mannerisms the great hall to life but the makers of Harry Potter have done this beautifully Do you know that when JK Rowling saw the sets of Diagon Alley she could not stop her tears because it was exactly like I had imagined This alone is a testimony to my argument
