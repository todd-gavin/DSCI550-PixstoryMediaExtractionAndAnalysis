👉Unlike his fun characters on screen, Akshay is not a very social, party-lover kind of a guy. Not only does he stay away from alcohol, cigarettes and caffeine, he also starts his day at 5 am in the morning, does yoga and other cardio exercises and prefers to run back from the sets to his hotel after pack up. 

👉Yes, one of the fittest and most disciplined actors in the industry at his age, Akshay Kumar is one big idol for everyone. When it comes to diet, he believes in having a balanced one and is not the biggest fan of health supplements. In short, discipline is one word that he starts and ends his day with.

📍So, here is a look at what he eats: 🍴

•For breakfast, he prefers to eat paranthas and a glass of milk. This is the heaviest and most indulging meal of his day. 🫓🥛

•As mid-day snacks, he prefers to have fruits, dry fruits, mixed veggies etc., something that’s healthy, filling and nourishing. 🍒🍎🍊🥭🥒🥦🥬🥜

•For lunch, he prefers having roti, dal, a cup of vegetables, dahi and some boiled or steamed chicken.
And for dinner, he likes to keep it light and simple. He makes sure to keep it nutritious by having soups and veggies. 🥒🥬🍗🥣🍲

•Also, he makes sure to finish his dinner before 8 pm in the night. 🥘🍴🍱

Another very important thing that he does is to sleep after two hours of his last meal. This helps the dinner to get properly digested. 🛌😴
