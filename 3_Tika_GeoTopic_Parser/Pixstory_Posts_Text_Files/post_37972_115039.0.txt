Paris Saint Germain had an unsatisfactory 2021/22 season as they managed to only win the Ligue 1 title. Owing to this, Mauricio Pochettino was sacked and Galtier took over the reins of the French club. 

Christophe Galtier's first job as the new PSG coach is trimming the squad as he is tasked with removing fringe players. As per Marca, the coach has already selected Donnarumma over Navas as his first-choice goalkeeper for the next season. Hence the Costa Rica GK could be headed out of the club this summer. 

Apart from Navas, other fringe players including Ander Herrera, Julian Draxler, Georgio Wijnaldum, Mauro Icardi, and Abdou Diallo could also be leaving the club in the summer. All the mentioned players are earning a significant sum at the club. Hence PSG would have to sell these stars in order to free up the salary base to sign new players in the transfer window. 

This appears to be an instruction from the new coach Christophe Galtier who said in his press conference last Tuesday: "We have to reduce the squad. You can't have players who hardly ever play all season."

With the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Mbappe set to take centre stage once again, it has to be seen if PSG can go deeper in the Champions League or even win their first title this time around.
