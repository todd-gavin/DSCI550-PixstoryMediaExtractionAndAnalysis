Medicine, as advanced as it is now, was not always as is. Unwritten history is not easy to interpret, there was no knowledge of the human anatomy, nor the potential causes of many ailments. It took centuries for practitioners to find solutions through trial and error. Initially, death and diseases were not considered natural phenomena, but the malevolent acts of the devil and other evils. The folklore of medicine is probably the most ancient aspect of the art of healing, for primitive physicians showed their wisdom by treating the whole person, soul as well as body. Treatments and medicines that produced no physical effects on the body could nevertheless make aÂ  patient feel better when both healer and patient believed in their efficacy, such placebo-effects that are still prevalent in modern clinical practices and medicine. After the industrial revolution in the 18th century, modern medicine was introduced due to growth in both manpower and economic activity at the time, with diseases at an all time high and an even higher demand for a cure. Doctors of the time created modern medicine, thanks to which, the average life span of humans has increased significantly.
