Not all goodbyes are hard!! ❤️‍🔥

I’m gonna keep these people in my heart forever, the memories, the fun, last minute exam preparations, our fav eating joint, canteen, classrooms and what not.

This is something everyone has experienced who has lived their college life, if you haven’t then buddy you’re missing alot in life.

I have we all have our hidden stories behind everything inside college, with friends, our with someone you disliked throughout years and you have no reason why! 

I don’t know where we all will going to land in our lives but surely we’ll be in touch, we might be busy with our lives but we’ll find a way to meet once in a month or may be more.

I’m gonna work hard in life and will make all of you proud one day!! I promise. ✨😅
