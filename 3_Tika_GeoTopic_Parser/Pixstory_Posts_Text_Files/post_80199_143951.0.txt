Cuba

Even though Coca-Cola opened a bottling plant here in 1906, production was halted in 1962 after Fidel Castro led the Cuban Revolution, which ousted former President Batista. Castroâ€™s government began seizing assets owned by all foreign countries that had a presence there, and a trade embargo was initiated. This seizure began on August 6, 1960, and targeted American companies. Coca-Cola moved out, never to return. Since the United States currently holds a commercial, economic, and financial embargo against the Republic of Cuba, no American companies may trade with Cuba.

North Korea

The Korean War took place from 1950 to 1953, and during this time the United States imposed trade sanctions on North Korea. When North Korea bombed South Korean during the 1980s, these sanctions were tightened further. From 1950 to 2008, trade between the U.S. and North Korea was also restricted, and North Korea has not distributed or sold Coca-Cola since the Korean War.
