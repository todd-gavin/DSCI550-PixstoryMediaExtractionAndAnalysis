As per the Sun, The Red Devils are set to lose out goalkeeper. Backup keeper Dean Henderson reportedly wants to move to a Premier League club in the summer. 

The 25-year-old has been in Manchester United's books since his youth days. Henderson signed a professional contract with the club in 2015. But he would only make his debut for the Red Devils in 2020.

Between 2015 and 2020, Dean Henderson was loaned out to various clubs. These include the likes of Stockport County, Grimsby Town, Shrewsbury Town, and more famously Sheffield United. 

Dean Henderson helped Sheffield United win promotion to the Premier League in 2018/19. He stayed at the club in the following season, playing all 36 games as the Blades achieved a respectable 9th place finish in the 2019/20 Premier League season. 

Owing to this, the goalkeeper was called back to Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put him in goal for 13 Premier League matches last season as David De Gea was suffering from a lack of form. 

However, Dean Henderson hasn't started a single Premier League game in the 2021/22 season. The reason for this is David De Gea's incredible form in goal. However, this has made the England international consider his future at the club.
