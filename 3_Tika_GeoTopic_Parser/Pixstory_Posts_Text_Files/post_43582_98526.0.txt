Children’s Day in Korea is an important holiday. On this day, South Korea celebrates its most-loved inhabitants: its children.

This public holiday (“red days”) is celebrated on May 5th every year in Korea. That means that salaried workers get a day off work, and children get a day off school.

The origins of Children’s Day in South Korea come from the 1920s. During that time, students wanted to draw attention to their situation to improve their status. One of the main supporters of the movement was children’s writer Dr. Bang Jeong-Hwan, who started using the word 어린이 (eorini) to mean children.

Children’s Day was originally on May 1st, but as this coincided with Labor Day, it was moved to May 5th. The day became an official public holiday in the 1970s. Koreans have been enjoying a day off work on May 5th ever since.
