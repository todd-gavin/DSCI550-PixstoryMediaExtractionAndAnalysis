Santosh Bangar, a rebel Shiv Sena MLA who had joined the camp of CM Eknath Shinde just hours before the Maharashtra assembly floor test last month, is accused of abusing and assaulting a private catering manager on Monday. He claimed that labourers in Hingoli, the constituency he represents, were receiving subpar midday meals.

On camera, Bangar criticises the food's quality before slapping the catering service manager. The video has gone viral on social media.

The manager then stated that the meal in question was leftover and was supposed to be thrown out, but the MLA "would not listen" to him and smacked him.

Food is provided to labourers who have registered with the labour department under the state government's noon meal programme. The department awards a private contractor the contract for the same. Before being given to workers throughout the city of Hingoli, the meal is made at a contractor's location.

Bangar asserted that after receiving a complaint about the poor quality of the food being supplied to the workers, he went to the location where it is produced.

According to Bangar, he discovered that the food provided to the workers by the concerned contractor was of "extremely bad quality" and did not adhere to the menu set forth by the government.

“Contact the district collector immediately and suspend those who are responsible for this,” Bangar is allegedly heard saying in the video.
