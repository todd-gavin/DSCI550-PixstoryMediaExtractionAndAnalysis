Racism in the private rental market is creating a path to homelessness for Aboriginal people a leading Aboriginal community organisation has warned Moorditj Koort Aboriginal Corporation board secretariat officer Robyn Withnell told the inquiry into the financial administration of homelessness services in Western Australia a new group of homeless people was being created by racism and the tightening rental market A group of Aboriginal employed people who were successfully renting in private accommodation and had been doing so for many years Ms Withnell said But with so many landlords deciding to sell or put their rents up massively now we have a new group of homeless people They have been told to vacate the property so they go and attend maybe or home opens to try to find secure new accommodation and they just get completely rejected Moorditj Koort s submission backs experiences raised by Aboriginal renters across the country who often find themselves seen unfavourably by agents and landlords Ms Withnell said this racism was causing substantial problems for Aboriginal people Even if those Aboriginal people have been renting successfully have fabulous property reports and references from their previous landlords it s not making any difference she said That path to homelessness means they may have to go live with their mother and father or an aunt or uncle it disrupts the children they may end up couch surfing They might be in Wanneroo one night then outstay their welcome or the Department of Housing says you can t have that many people living in a home and the next night they might be down in Medina or Kwinana the kids can t go to school they drop out of the system It may affect the work arrangements of the parents and if the kids are not going to school what do they do with the children It is a massive problem Ms Withnell said more social housing was needed to address the issue WA Greens Member for South Metropolitan Brad Pettit said the investigation had made clear racism was ingrained in the housing market
