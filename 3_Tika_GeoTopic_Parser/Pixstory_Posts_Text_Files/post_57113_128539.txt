However this movement tried to bring a change by talking about a positive body image but what it failed to do was set some realistic standards It focuses more on physical appearance which makes it irrelevant because physical appearance is just a mere concept we need to focus on the non physical characteristics so that the person with body image issues doesn t have to say unrealistic things to feel good The debate should be more inclined toward the body s abilities and what it can actually do for you like you have an incredible body because it keeps you healthy and active not because it looks good irrespective of how it is Honestly speaking feeling positive all the time is not an authentic emotion You need to feel genuine about things and if you talk more about body neutrality it will remove the pressure of just complying and loving your body when you don t want to It could be more like you accept your body and appreciate it for whatever it does for your well being Just some affirmations would not always help you need to ingrain the acceptance within yourself
