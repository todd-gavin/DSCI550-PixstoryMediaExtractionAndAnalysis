Trust men to even defend a man like Andrew Tate. A man who fled a country to escape sexual assault charges, keeps a woman hostage in Romania, is an alleged human trafficker (and freaking proud of it, shame was found nowhere), tells young boys to rape girls who tell them a no. Yeah, sounds absolutely like a man who should have freedom of speech.

Instagram has a policy against hate speech because it believes that this type of speech can incite violence and hatred.

Instagram prohibits content that promotes violence or hatred against any person, group of people, or organization. This includes Holocaust denial, genocide denial, and advocacy of hatred against any group or category of people.

Hatred against any group or category of people.

Read that again.

Instagram is a private company that has its own set of regulations. You follow it or you get it. Just as simple.

A person like Andrew Tate should be in jail like yesterday.
