Every year, 25 young people gather in Aquarius and celebrate a day called Valentine's Day.
 But religious scholars believe that Valentine's Day promotes Western culture in Islamic countries, and that celebrating this day leads young people to prostitution and denial.

"From this day on, lovers are subjected to hundreds of immoral, religious and value-based uses, and this is a false culture that is gradually taking root in society." It's a day celebrated by Westerners in Islamic countries. ". Morally, Westerners want to use software to divert our youth from Islam and lead them to prostitution and denial.

 Over the past decade, in Kabul and other major cities, we have witnessed the enthusiasm of some young people in the world of ignorance, imitating the vulgar culture of the West, to celebrate this day, who intend to buy red bouquets and more nonsensical gifts. , To welcome this day.
