Manchester United vs Arsenal A top match up with league leaders Arsenal regarded as the favourites to win against an inconsistent United But what exactly went wrong for Arsenal which left them defeated at Old Trafford United had far less control of the ball than Arsenal but their quick transitions cut open Arsenal s defence too easily at times The breakthrough for Antony s debut goal occurred due to Gabriel not being aggressive enough towards Fernandes which left him with all the time in the world to turn and create that goal Gabriel is often caught up in moments of indecisiveness which ends up in him negatively affecting crucial moments of the game With Partey s injury a young year old Sambi Lokonga was required to step up in such a big game Arteta decided to use a man for man system in a lot of moments of the game which meant Lokonga had to move higher up the pitch to press United s midfield and left him exposed on a number of occasions when United attacked further putting pressure on the backline He was equally responsible for the first goal Arsenal conceded but he still is very young and had a promising game where he completed out of his passes made which were important in Arsenal s buildup Zinchenko was responsible losing possession in the counter attack for the second goal when he made a poor pass to Lokonga Saliba was slow to react which Rashford happily exploited with his pace and finished the goal with precision The right side overload through which Fernandes played a beautiful pass to Eriksen helped him break the defensive line and was just kept onside by White while he fed Rashford the ball for the third and final goal for United Arsenal still remain league leaders but this match was a statement of intent from Ten Hag s United Though the Gunners controlled the game for a long period and created chances they failed to capitalise on that and were dubious against counters which needs improvement by Arteta as the run of fixtures is about to get hectic with Everton at home next
