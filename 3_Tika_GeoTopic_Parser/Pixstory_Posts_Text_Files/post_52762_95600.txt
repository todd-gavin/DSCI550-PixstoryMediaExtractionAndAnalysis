Before covid mask was normal for me like we have to wear mask sometimes but due to covid now mask is equal to the body part Initially it was very disgusting to wear the mask all the time but as the time passed I got used to it Now it s normal for me as I said it s a body part We have to accept this and move forward and I already accepted and now I think that it s for for safety only so it is good to wear mask however we have to consider and accept it
