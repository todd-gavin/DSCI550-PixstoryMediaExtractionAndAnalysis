The word ‘Metaverse’ is derived from two words; the Greek word ‘meta’ which means beyond and ‘verse’ which means universe. Metaverse implies an artificial, three-dimensional universe wherein you can experience real life situations. It is touted to be a technology that would replace the internet in the future and will change the destiny of humanity. The concept was developed in the science-fiction novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. In the novel he talks about a dystopian world wherein real-life had been demolished and the outside world had become uninhabitable. These circumstances forced everyone to be confined to their homes and to spend their lives in a virtual reality. Neal Stephenson referred to this virtual reality as metaverse. Metaverse was again popularized in 2021 by Facebook when this social media giant changed the name of the company to ‘Meta’. The new name reflects the company’s growing ambitions beyond social media and describes its vision for working and playing in a virtual world.
