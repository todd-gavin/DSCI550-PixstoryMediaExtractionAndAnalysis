Barcelona fans can now have a breath of air as the club has decided to use the economic levers
to come out of the dire financial situation. The Catalans initially had to sell players worth 140
million to register or sign any player.

The La Liga outfit was about to be pushed to corners by
the rival clubs to sell their key players. Now, they are in a better position and can afford to shell
money and keep their big players too. Amongst the players that Barcelona are chasing, Cesar
Azpilicueta is one of the important transfers.

On the other hand, Cesar Azpilicueta wants Todd Boehly to honor Roman Abramovichâ€™s words
and let him move to Camp Now on a Bosman transfer. With both parties interested, we can
expect the deal to cross the line before the transfer windows slam shut.

Barcelona finished 2nd on the points table after a slow start and getting knocked out of the major competitions. The team lacked severely in a few departments and needed a lot of players.

Here are the reasons why Barcelona should sign Cesar Azpilicueta.
