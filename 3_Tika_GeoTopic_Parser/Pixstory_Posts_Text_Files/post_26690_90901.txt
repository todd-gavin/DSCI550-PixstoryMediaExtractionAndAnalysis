In fact, the brand created by Matiussi has launched the Ami for Ever platform dedicated to second-hand items from its previous collections. The same consumers will be able to help revive the pieces they have loved by sending them and after an evaluation they will receive credits useful for buying new garments or piece of archive The items on sale on Ami For Ever will have a price established based on their condition, seasonality and the fact that it is an item with the Ami de Coeur logo, but overall the price lists will fluctuate between and less than the new products The Ami For Ever project will initially be available only to French citizens, but we hope that such a contemporary project interested in the themes of sustainability and second hand will be successful everywhere
