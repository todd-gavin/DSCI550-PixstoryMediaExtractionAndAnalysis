the CHRONOS interventional study for colorectal cancer just published in Nature Medicine demonstrates once again how precision medicine can improve patients&#39; quality of life For the first time, researchers have used liquid biopsy as a measurement tool to understand the right moment in which to administer a second therapy with a molecular target to an oncological patient suffering from colorectal metastases The study coordinated by the Niguarda Hospital of Milan and the Candiolo Institute IRCCS with the collaboration of the IFOM of Milan, the University of University of Milan The liquid biopsy is an examination which, starting from a simple blood sample or in some cases saliva or urine, allows to obtain more information on the tumor of which a person is affected. Basically it hunts for the tumor cells that circulate in the bloodstream or of the DNA they release The analysis of these molecular traces provides valuable information on the tumor and its progress by detecting, for example, the presence of specific alterations in the tumor&#39;s DNA that can make it sensitive or resistant to various oncological treatments In the CHRONOS clinical trial published on August in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine Sartore Bianchi A et al Nat Med the researchers of the Niguarda Hospital in Milan and the Candiolo Institute IRCCS in collaboration with IFOM of Milan University of Turin and University of Milan have integrated the liquid biopsy directly into the process of therapy decision For patients affected by metastatic colorectal cancer, the expectations of survival and improvement in the quality of life depend on the possibility of slowing down tumor progression thanks to targeted therapeutic interventions. of Milan and Director of the Department of Hematology Oncology and Molecular Medicine of the Niguarda Hospital in Milan, a molecular target therapy directed against the EGFR growth receptor is administered. Although the therapy is effective, the patient may develop resistance to the drug over time and the disease progresses
