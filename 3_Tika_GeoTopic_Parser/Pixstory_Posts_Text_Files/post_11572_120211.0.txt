Ayurveda suggests one incorporates mildly bitter and pungent foods in the diet this season, and advises us to avoid heavily salted foods as these are responsible for water retention in the body that can lead to bloating. This includes avoiding naturally sour foods like tamarind, tomatoes, and lime.

One can eat bitter vegetables including bitter gourd, and bitter herbs including neem, turmeric and methi to balance the state of doshas and to detoxify the body.

Drink lots of fluids to flush out toxins and eat only fresh, well-cooked food.

Herbal teas, especially those with antibacterial properties, prepared with ginger, pepper, honey, mint, and basil leaves are highly recommended. 

Excessive intake of coffee and tea dehydrates the body fluids, so these should be avoided.

Fasting is an Ayurvedic method of detoxifying the body, recommended at least once a week during the monsoon.
