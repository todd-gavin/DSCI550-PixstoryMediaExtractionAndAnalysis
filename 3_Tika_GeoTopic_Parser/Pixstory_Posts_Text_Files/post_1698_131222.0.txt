Rome has a well deserved reputation for martial prowess. If there was one thing the Republic and the Empire both took seriously it was military tactics and strategy. While the Greeks had philosophy, the Romans had the legions.
Indeed, one of the oldest traditions of Rome in warfare was that no battle, major foreign policy decision or expedition should be initiated without the approval of the Sacred Chickens.
The Sacred Chickens were poultry which had received a special and ritualised upbringing by priests and whose behaviour was seen as a strong indicator of the approval of the gods.
When a decision was to be made grain would be put in front of the chickens. If the birds happily set about their dinner with much flapping about and such like then this was taken as a positive sign of the gods’ favour. If they were reluctant and picky this was taken as a very bad omen and either no action would be taken or the action would be delayed.
During the Battle of Trepana in 249 B.C., Roman consul Claudius Pulcher, seems to have ignored the signs given by the Sacred Chickens. They simply refused to eat, probably signalling a quit from the war.
The ensuing battle was a disaster for Rome – the vast majority of the fleet was either sunk or captured and very few made it back to Rome.
It seems obvious to us that even the most pampered poultry does not have powers of foresight or a hotline to divine beings who can predict the outcome of major events.
Yet by ignoring a sign which so many of his fleet and army would have put so much store by was Pulcher guilty of hubris and of damaging their morale?
We do not know – but it should give us pause for thought the next time some traditional knowledge or beliefs point one way and we find it a bit too easy to treat them with scorn and throw them overboard when we want to take some new radical course of action. We might find out that the chickens were right after all.
