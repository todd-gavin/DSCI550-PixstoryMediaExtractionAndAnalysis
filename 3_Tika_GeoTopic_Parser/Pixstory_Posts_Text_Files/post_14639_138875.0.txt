The body requires omega-3 fatty acids for a variety of functions, ranging from muscular activity to the growth of cells:
ðŸ‘‰Brain health:Omega-3 for toddlers helps in brain development and maintaining overall health. An increase in the quantity of omega-3 fatty acids consumed can boost the efficiency and performance of school kids.
ðŸ‘‰Good for ADHD kids: Omega-3 supplements have shown a beneficial effect on the symptoms of ADHD, i.e. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The symptoms of ADHD are hyperactivity, impulsiveness and problems with focusing. Intake of omega-3 fatty acids helps in improving brain functions such as memory, attentiveness, learning ability, and impulses.
ðŸ‘‰Helps in the development of new cells: Omega 3 fatty acids are key to the development of nervous and cardiovascular systems and help in the absorption of nutrients. These are also essential for the development of eyes.
ðŸ‘‰Helps decrease asthmatic symptoms: Asthma is a long-term condition that results in breathlessness, pain in the chest, cough and wheezing. Few studies have shown that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can help in reducing asthmatic symptoms in toddlers.
ðŸ‘‰Helps in proper and improved sleep: Studies show that low amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet can result in increased chances of sleep disturbances. Hence, omega-3 is vital for adequate and undisturbed sleep.
ðŸ‘‰ Increasing the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy can improve the pattern of sleep in neonates too, as per a study.
