Golden Gaytime is a vanilla-flavored ice cream, drizzled with a toffee topping, and finally covered in crumbled honeycomb biscuit. First released in 1959, the ice cream has remained an Aussie classic through the decades.

The sweet treat’s name, however, has been the source of very recent controversy, with petitions to both change and keep the name coming from within the LGBTIQ+ community.

Regardless of what’s happening in the media, this sweet treat is an Aussie staple, to be enjoyed during the country’s sweltering hot summers, preferably poolside.
