After the February 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, some students argued that local government authorities were to blame for failing to provide enough security. Following that, federal judge ruled that the government agencies "had no constitutional duty to protect students who were not in custody."

This has been established that the police is NOT there to protect you, and not only through their actions but pretty much through the word of law as well. I've always leaned towards the pro-police crowd but this incident has angered me way too much to stay there. It is absolutely baffling how police just doesn't give a shit to our lives but keep exercising and exploiting its power when it comes to hurting us or taking advantage of us.

For the gazillionth time, police is not there to protect you and they have proven it time and again. We need a system that protects us, not one that finds excuses after killing us.
