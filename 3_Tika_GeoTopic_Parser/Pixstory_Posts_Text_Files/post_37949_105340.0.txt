The Bloodline has emerged as one of the most successful factions in recent history. The team of Roman Reigns, Jimmy Uso, and Jey Uso have become unstoppable under the guidance of Paul Heyman. This has led to Reigns establishing his persona of the Tribal Chief, having a record run as the Universal Champion in the company. 

The Judgement Day on the other hand is just starting out on RAW. Damien Priest and Rhea Ripley joined forces with a renewed Edge to form the faction. The trio has already garnered a lot of attention in recent weeks. Go add to this, it is also rumoured that new members are going to be joining the team soon. 

Both the factions have emerged head over shoulders on their respective brands. Hence it could be only a matter of time before they are pitted against one another. 

Edge and Roman Reigns themselves have had bad blood in 2021. The Tribal Chief beat the Rated R Superstar at Wrestlemania 37 and the previous Money in the Bank pay-per-view owing to some "help". 

With Edge having turned heal and having partners of his own now, Roman Reigns could face his biggest test yet. This could also make Reigns eventually lose either the WWE title or the Universal title to the Rated R Superstar. 

I expect the duo to start their duel following Summerslam. Do let me know what are your thoughts regarding this mega feud!
