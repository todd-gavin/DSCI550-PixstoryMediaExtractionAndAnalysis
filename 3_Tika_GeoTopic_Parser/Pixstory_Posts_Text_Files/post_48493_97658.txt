It is funny you would say something like that but it s nothing I haven t heard before You say religion injects fear then why do believers feel so liberated Believers aren t strange because they re evil We re strange because we re unfathomable It s a mystery what goes on within believers It appears to be a kind of tense faking a kind of constant nervous opposition to reality as far as it can be deduced But that s the point of faith It is ours to call it is something personal to an individual Belief requires you to discard deception after deception whereas contemporary common sense necessitates constant airy pretending fooling that is so completely incentivised by our culture that it might as well be systemic Its easy to call something wrong and right something that you have no knowledge of that is It is like telling a doctor how a surgery should be done There s a reason why eternal sin is unforgivable Conscious and hardened resistance to the truth leads man away from humility and repentance and without repentance there can be no forgiveness That is why the sin of blasphemy against the Spirit cannot be forgiven since one who does not acknowledge his sin does not seek to have it forgiven Religion teaches us humility acceptance and love And above all religion teaches us forgiveness But you just don t get forgiveness you have to work for it You have to realize that you have made a mistake which people fail to do Christ died for humanity to rid it of fear So there s a big chance that religion doesn t inject fear but your idea of religion does I tell you my friends do not fear those who kill the body and after that can do nothing more v Jesus himself Do not be afraid little flock for it is your Father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom v Mary don t be afraid the Lord is with you Simple but so profound This is the antidote to our fear faith in God who is actively involved in the lives of his people a God who is present with us
