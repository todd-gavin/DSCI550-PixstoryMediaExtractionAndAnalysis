Katsuya Shibuki Takao Aoyama Abstract Background and aims Clinical trials indicate the efficacy of add on therapy using incretin related drugs to treat type diabetes mellitus DM inadequately controlled by insulin However heterogeneity exists among these studies Baseline body mass index BMI accounts for the heterogeneity of add on therapy with dipeptidyl peptidase DPP inhibitors and the associated higher BMI with a lower efficacy The efficacy of add on therapy with glucagon like peptide GLP receptor agonists remains unclear Methods We performed a meta analysis of randomized controlled trials of weeks reporting the endpoint of adjusted mean change in hemoglobin A c levels AM HbA c or hypoglycemia incidence Patients with type DM treated with insulin alone or with metformin for at least weeks before the study treatment were included The intervention group received liraglutide co administered with insulin or a fixed dose combination The control group received a placebo or insulin Covariates included five baseline parameters HbA c fasting plasma glucose BMI type DM duration and treatment duration Results Seven studies patients were selected AM HbA c was confidence interval CI to I The odds ratio for hypoglycemia incidence was CI I Covariates did not account for the heterogeneity in AM HbA c or hypoglycemia incidence Conclusions Liraglutide add on therapy reduced HbA c levels without increasing hypoglycemia incidence independent of BMI in insulin non responders with type DM GLP receptor agonists may be more suitable than DPP inhibitors for add on therapy in patients with high BMI Registration number PROSPERO CRD Sources
