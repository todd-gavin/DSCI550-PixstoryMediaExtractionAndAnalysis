Meditation changed my whole personality Everyone has different experience and different ways Mine was little different I used to be a short temper person Little things made me very angry My anger was different first I become angry and then feel very bad about myself I wanted to change myself but I don t know the way then someone told me about meditation I started following the things as that person told me After many days I felt it s working So I continue my meditation journey Some things which I tried myself to improve my meditation I feel food was very important part of my meditation I read in many books that food has so much impact on your thoughts I am vegetation so pure food was not a problem for me But I tried to eat pure food like food with no garlic and onion I started living a disciple life I started control myself This was very difficult I wanted to do something but I wanted to control myself The more I controlled myself the more I wanted that thing I guess controlling yourself is one of the most difficult task After many months meditation become part of my life I could control myself My anger was gone People said anything on my face I only smiled I become a happy soul Many people will not trust what I am going to write now Sometimes I could read people mind For example my mother was doing something and I saw her and I asked her mummy are you thinking this With surprised she said how do you know There is so many things Meditation is a path that lead you towards a beautiful life
