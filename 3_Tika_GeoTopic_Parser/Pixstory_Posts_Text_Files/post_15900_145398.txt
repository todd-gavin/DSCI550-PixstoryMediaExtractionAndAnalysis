Summary Background Accurate data on type diabetes prevalence incidence associated mortality and life expectancy are crucial to inform public health policy but these data are scarce We therefore developed a model based on available data to estimate these values for countries for the year and estimate the projected prevalent cases in Findings In there were about uncertainty interval million individuals worldwide with type diabetes of these million were younger than years million were aged years and million were aged years or older In that year there were million new cases diagnosed median age of onset years about non diagnosed individuals died within months of symptomatic onset One fifth million of individuals with type diabetes were in low income and lower middle income countries Remaining life expectancy of a year old diagnosed with type diabetes in ranged from a mean of years in low income countries to years in high income countries Missing prevalent cases in were estimated at million In we predict an increase in prevalent cases to million higher than in with the largest relative increase versus in low income and lower middle income countries Interpretation The burden of type diabetes in is vast and is expected to increase rapidly especially in resource limited countries Most incident and prevalent cases are adults The substantial missing prevalence highlights the premature mortality of type diabetes and an opportunity to save and extend lives of people with type diabetes Our new model which will be made publicly available as the Type Diabetes Index model will be an important tool to support health delivery advocacy and funding decisions for type diabetes Sources
