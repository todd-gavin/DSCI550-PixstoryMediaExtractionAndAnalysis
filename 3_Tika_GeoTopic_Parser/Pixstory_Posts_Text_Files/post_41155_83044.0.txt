The Beach Boys are a rock band from Hawthorne, California, that formed in 1961. Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, as well as their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine, formed the initial lineup of the band. They are one of the most important performers of the rock era, known for their vocal harmonies, adolescent-oriented themes, and creative creativity. To create their own sound, they drew inspiration from older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B, and under Brian's leadership, they frequently blended classical or jazz components as well as unorthodox recording techniques in novel ways.

The Beach Boys are one of the most well-known and commercially successful bands of all time, with over 100 million albums sold worldwide. They affected the development of music genres and movements such as psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi by helping to legitimate popular music as an art form. Between the 1960s and the 2010s, the band had 36 singles chart in the US Top 40 (the most by an American band), with four of them reaching the top of the Billboard Hot 100. On Rolling Stone's list of the best artists of all time, they were ranked number 12 in 2004. In 1988, the original members of the band were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
