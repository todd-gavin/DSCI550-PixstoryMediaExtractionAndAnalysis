The main factor directly contributing to losses in marine biodiversity is fishing, whether it is intentional or accidental. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its subsequent agreements, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and the Convention on Migratory Species are just a few global and regional initiatives that address fishing pressure on marine species (CMS). However, 1 in 16 marine fish species are included on the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and one-third of fished stocks are exploited to biologically unsustainable levels.

The above data comes from a study conducted by Nature Communications.

Despite being regularly monitored through fisheries stock assessments, some populations of threatened fish and invertebrates are handled differently from other wild animals and, in many cases, are allowed to be captured in industrial fisheries regardless of the species' overall conservation status.

As much as we love eating fish or depend on it, the only way to save marine life of for that matter slow down ecological collapse is by regulating our sea food consumption. Climate change denial does not make sense at this point when we are seeing the consequences of it every day â€” sometimes in the news, the other times just with us. It's our moral responsibility to leave the Earth habitable for future generations and for the wildlife for that matter.
