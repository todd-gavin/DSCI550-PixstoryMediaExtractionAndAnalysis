La Liga side Espanyol have appointed Diego Martinez as head coach. The Spanish manager
has been handed a two year contract by the club.

Martinez has been out of a job for a year, after leaving Granada in 2020 following a very impressive stint at the club. He helped guide Granada to the La Liga in his first season and subsequently qualification to the Europa League. Martinez will be replacing former manager
Victor Moreno, who was sacked two games before the end of the campaign.

Espanyol's CEO Ye Mao was keen to bring Martinez on board, commenting “He is the kind of
coach who could give a lot of things to the club,” Martinez prefers a brand of attacking football,
playing a 4-4-1-1 formation with the advanced playmaker the fulcrum around which the team
functions.

Martinez has previously coached Sevilla's B-team, leading them to the Spanish second division.

Espanyol will be looking to move up the table with this appointment, having finished 14th last
season. They will be counting on Diego Martinez’s squad building and player management
ability to turn the fortunes of the club around.
