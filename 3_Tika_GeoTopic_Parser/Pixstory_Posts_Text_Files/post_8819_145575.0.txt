An acknowledgement of this letter was received but I do not 
think that any action was taken on it. 
I also sent a copy of this letter to the President who wrote to me 
in reply: 
â€œI have read with great interest your letter regarding changes in the Constitution which you propose. I agree with you in your analysis of our history 
and I know that there are separatist tendencies prevailing even now. It is a 
fact that it is only since 1950 that the whole of India, as it is today, is being 
ruled under one Constitution and one Supreme Head of the Nation with one 
Parliament, one Prime Minister and one Cabinet for a number of matters 
connected with the administration of the country and it is not only desirable 
but also necessary that this position is safeguarded. It is also true that 
the British Government passed the Act of 1935 providing for a Federal 
Constitution in it more with a view to keeping in check what then were 
known as provinces which were under the Congress influence with the help 
of Indian States, minorities etc. But the idea of autonomy of the Provinces 
was very strong and it was really the Chief Ministers of the Provinces who 
belonged to the Congress who insisted upon the provisions relating thereto. 
The States came in at the end and practically no objection was raised on their behalf and the status given to the Provinces was more or less given to them 
and they were satisfied. It was not as if the States insisted upon autonomy and 
the Provinces were brought in line with them. It was just the other way 
about. So you can understand the difficulty that will be faced in introducing 
the change which you suggest. Some of us were even then anxious to have 
some unifying power and some of the provisions giving power to the Centre 
were the result but we could not do more to get the Provinces under the 
influence of the Centre.
