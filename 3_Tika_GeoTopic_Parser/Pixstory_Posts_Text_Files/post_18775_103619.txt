Tomorrow the quarter-finals of Roland Garros will offer a match between Djokovic and Nadal that promises to be fully enjoyed. On the one hand, there is the number one in the world who has recently resumed playing seriously given that since the beginning of the calendar year he has had to give up several tournaments due to lack of vaccine On the other hand there is Nadal the most successful in the history of tennis with his Grand Slams one more than Federer and Djokovic Before the start of the French tournament Nadal had made it known that he had been living with bladder problems for years a torment that has never left him and always forced him to grit his teeth He could never do anything to live with it except fight every single match Now that he is almost years old he begins to think about when to say enough with his favorite sport And the match against Djokovic could also represent an end I am aware that I don&#39;t know what will happen next year he said in the conference in the post match against Auger Aliassime lasted hours and minutes an eternity every time I play here I know it could really be my last game in this tournament Maybe it&#39;s unlikely that it can really happen but after winning matches on Parisian red clay and losing only times against Djokovic the one who defeated him these times could be the last time of the King of Paris
