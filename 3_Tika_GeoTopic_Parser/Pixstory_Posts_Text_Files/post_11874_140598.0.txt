Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is ten-fold less common among competitive female athletes in comparison with male counterparts.The commonest cause of SCD in older athletes (935 years) is atheroscleroticcoronary artery disease (CAD), whereas in young athletes (G35 years), inheritedcardiac diseases, such as cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, predominate.
Recent studies suggest that the most common finding at autopsy in youngathletes who died suddenly is a structurally normal heart (sudden arrhythmicdeath syndrome or SADS), where primary arrhythmia syndromes as long QTsyndrome, Brugada syndrome, and cathecolaminergic polymorphic ventriculartachycardia (CPVT) are the probable culprits. 
The higher prevalence of SCD in males was previously explained with the higher proportion of male athletes participating in competitivesports. However, the increasing participation of women in recent years was not paralleled with an increase of SCD incidence in femaleathletes.Various theories to explain the higher incidence of SCD in maleathletes have been proposed. 
Sympathetic tone and increased catechol-amines may trigger malignant arrhythmias in individuals with pre-existing cardiac disease and males appear to have a higher sympathetictone than females with possible deleterious effects in predisposed individuals.
