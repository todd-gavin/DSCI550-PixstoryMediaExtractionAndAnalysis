Some food items must be there that prevent further percolation of Kidney Stones-

ðŸ‘‰Increase citrus intake

Citrus fruit, and their juice, can help reduce or block the formation of stones due to naturally occurring citrate. 

ðŸ‘‰Stay hydrated

Fluids, especially water, help to dilute the chemicals that form stones. Try to drink at least 12 glasses of water a day. If it is becoming difficult, try having it with Glucon-D or as lime water.

ðŸ‘‰Eat lots of calcium 

If your calcium intake is low, oxalate levels may rise and that increases the chances of Kidney Stones. Good sources of calcium include milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other types of cheeses. Vegetarian sources of calcium include legumes, calcium-set tofu, dark green vegetables, nuts and seed.
