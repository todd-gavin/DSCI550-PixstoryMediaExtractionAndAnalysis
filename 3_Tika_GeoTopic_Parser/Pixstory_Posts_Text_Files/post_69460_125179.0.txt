The Bangus Valley is one of Kashmir's lesser-known yet highly promising tourist destinations. Bangus, which is located in the Trans-Himalayan region, is a distinctive ecological combination made up of a Taiga or coniferous forest and a mountain biome that contains a grassland biome with lower altitude vegetation. The valley, which is located in the northern region of district Kupwara inside the Handwara sub district, is located at an elevation of roughly 10,000 feet above sea level. The main valley, colloquially referred to as Bodh Bangus (Big Bangus), is a linear elliptical bowl situated along the east-west axis, occupying an estimated area of 300 sq.kms (20x15km). The valley is surrounded by Rajwar and Mawar in the east, Shamasbury and Dajlungun Mountains in the west and Chowkibal and Karnah Guli in the north. A smaller valley known as Lokut Bangus (Small Bangus) lies on the north-eastern side of the main valley. Both the valleys have level green meadows surrounded by low-lying mountains covered with dense Coniferous forests (budloo) and a stream flowing through them.
