Agnipath is a fantastic opportunity for young people to join the military and serve their country. Because the recruitment process has been blocked for the past two years, many people have been denied the opportunity. PM Modi raised the age restriction for them from 21 to 23 years.

As the anti-Agnipath rallies enter their third day across the country, defence minister Rajnath Singh announced that recruitment for this newly created initiative will begin soon.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday that the Agnipath scheme for military recruitment will begin soon, adding that young people should begin preparing now. The minister's remarks came as widespread anti-Agnipath rallies entered their third day across the country. The defence minister praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for approving age waivers for the first batch of recruits through the scheme, calling it a "great opportunity."

Concerns have been raised about the Agniveers' (young people who will enlist under the plan) future prospects, given the scheme will only provide four years of employment in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Another important point raised by opposing parties was that young people between the ages of 17.5 and 21 may not be capable of ensuring the country's security. The Congress on Thursday backed the protests against the Agnipath project, calling it a "hare-brained" idea devised at a time when several military jobs were empty.
