 I am a boxer and I m from Assam I won the Gold Medal at the AIBA Youth Women s World Boxing Championships in I also won a Gold Medal at the North East Olympic Games that were held in Imphal in nbsp I ve also won many other medals In at the AIBA Youth Women s World Boxing Championships I was given the Best Boxer title I started boxing in but couldn t participate in the Nationals as the Boxing federation was banned so I participated in my first Nationals in Women are getting good opportunities in boxing in India I m proud to say that Women have got medals in both Olympics and Commonwealth in Boxing I believe that we can win even more medals if we continue to work hard like we have so far I also think that Women in Assam get more support in the form of facilities and funding but there are some places where women dont get the same support and I believe if given the opportunities they will shine for sure
