The secret to looking flawless every single day?  outfits derived from timeless basic essentials. I am sharing today a checklist of wardrobe basic essentials every woman must have!

1. THE BLACK SUIT
The black suit is the answer when denim is not enough but the dress is too much.

Throw it over a dress to add some grit or pair it with denim .

3. BLACK SKINNY JEANS 
The black skinny is what you wear when you don’t know what to wear. 

4. BLACK PENCIL SKIRT
The pencil skirt became an instant hit.

5. LITTLE BLACK DRESS
There is no explanation needed as to why you need one.

There’s nothing as daring as the ‘click-clack’ of a woman walking in high heels.

7. THE BLACK LEATHER BAG
The perfect finish touch to every outfit!
