Arsenal have secured the services of Gabriel Jesus as per Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano. The Sky Sports reporter broke the news on his Social Media account stating that the Manchester City star is set to move to the North London club! 

The Gunners have been linked with Gabriel Jesus since February. The latest update states that Arsenal have completed a verbal agreement with Manchester City for the signing of the Brazilian star. Arsenal will reportedly pay Â£45m for the services of Jesus in the coming days. 

Arsenal lacked a goalscorer in their ranks following the departure of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in January. Owing to this, the North London side also missed out on the UEFA Champions League as they finished fifth in the Premier League. 

Manchester City on the other hand have welcomed Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez to the club. Owing to this, the chances of Gabriel Jesus would have been significantly reduced. Hence a move to Arsenal seems to be the perfect story in the next chapter of his career.

Gabriel scored a total of 95 goals in 236 appearances for Manchester City in his 6-year stint at the club. The Brazilian was mostly the backup for Sergio Aguero during this tenure. 

It has to be seen if the 25-year-old striker brings a new dynamic to his game at Arsenal.
