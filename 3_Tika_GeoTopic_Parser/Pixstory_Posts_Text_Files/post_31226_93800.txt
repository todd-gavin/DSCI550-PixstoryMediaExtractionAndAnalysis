Many consider it an object of other times and yet according to the survey commissioned by Facile it to the research institutes mUp Research and Norstat, there are more than million Italians who still have a landline telephone at home. Analyzing the data for we discover that today its function is at least partially changed or even inverted compared to that of the mobile phone Those who continue to keep the landline at home do so mainly for safety reasons in the event of an emergency or as a means of communication reserved for a few close friends explains Mario Rasimelli Managing Director Utilities of Facile it In short, once upon a time close contacts used to be the only ones we gave out mobile numbers today they are the only ones who can reach us even when our smartphone is off What instead determined the choice of those millions who gave up cord and handset In some cases they chose to eliminate the landline for economic reasons in order to replace it with a mobile phone and in order not to be disturbed at home by call centres
