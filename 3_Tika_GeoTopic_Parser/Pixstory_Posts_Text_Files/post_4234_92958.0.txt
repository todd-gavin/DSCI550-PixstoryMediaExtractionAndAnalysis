â€ŒIt's a sad truth that most of the time people don't realise that they have been sexually assaulted! Can we really blame them? No! This happens to everyone regardless of their age. Here is why we have to raise awareness. We should not be proud of our culture wherein people speaking up about their sexual assault was not normal. This persists. 
â€Œ
â€ŒMany are intimidated or weary of calling it an assault. Why is it so? When someone touches you inappropriately without your consent it is sexual assault. You shouldn't have to bear it. You should feel guilty. You should not be afraid of being blamed! You are not the bad person here. You can never be it even if someone says so. No one should dare to blame a victim for taking the time to process or report it years or months later. The mental strength they have to acquire after the incident is a struggle. This struggle is the cause of the assault they face or the judgemental society in which they live. Even their trauma response could block out some events, leading to forgetting them (especially during a very small age).

â€ŒSometimes many think just because you were in a relationship with somebody or the abuser belongs in your family you can't react. Be it your married partner still they are entitled to verbal consent. Understand abuse to fight it. And finally to all the victims and survivors you have not done anything wrong. You can still live a happy, healthy life. You are awesome and you deserve all the love in the world like anybody elseðŸ˜Š
