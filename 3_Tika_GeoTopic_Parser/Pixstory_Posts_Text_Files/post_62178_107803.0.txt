Unfortunately I have to disagree with Mae West who said "too much of a good thing is wonderful". When it comes to meditation, as well as almost every other "good thing" in life, there can be too much. Food, water, sunshine, exercise, rest, everything in life, needs to be in balance.

Too much meditation can make you "spacey" and ungrounded. It can weaken your mind-body coordination. 

It's just possible that some emotions are being released as a result of the deep relaxation in the meditation. Usually emotional releases would happen during meditation time and not create any concern. But if there starts to be a lot of release or intense emotional processing outside of meditation, it could be that too much is happening too fast. 

Meditation is an essential part of the routine, but meditating too much can get you in a space  where you will be irritated at most mundane things, coz you'll be used to the quiet so much. It's a tricky situation really, while you will be at transcendental peace, it will be disturbed at the simplest of inconvenience. 

So it is wise, to meditate in a proper and appropriate amount. The recommendation is to meditate for 20 minutes twice a day!
