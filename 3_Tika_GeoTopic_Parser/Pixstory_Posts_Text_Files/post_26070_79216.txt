Details in those lit up small babyfaces dominated by the curvature of smile Details in the oval onion domes that round up the linear structures in order to complete it They complete it giving it a shape enclosing the structure Like it caps the desire of an artist to go further to go endless Details are so insignificantly significant we cannot let go of them A girl smiling broadly passes by but my eyes the eyes lookout for details I cannot let go of that spot I see on her face But why is that spot the spotlight when her smile should be I see the whole structure but I miss on the elaborate carvings I see the smile and I miss on the rest of the body Why did I let go of the details because they were so insignificant or because they were so significant
