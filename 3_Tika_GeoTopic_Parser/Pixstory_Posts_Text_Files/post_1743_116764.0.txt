BOMBAY RAINS IN 1979: 

I have never lived in Bombay (Mumbai sounds very parochial & backward I am afraid). In fact, I have never visited the metro. But I have heard so much about its legendary monsoon rains. 

For people like us, one of the best ways to experience the legendary Bombay rains, vicariously, is to watch the song 'Rimjhim Gire Saawan' from the film Manzil (1979). 

It has a fresh-faced Moushumi and an equally fresh-faced Bachchan running, stomping and playing around in the heavy downpour. Quite remarkable how Basu Chatterji managed to record the song in the heavy downpour. The female version of the song, rendered by Lata, is what I like better, simply because of its breathtaking picturization. 

The film started sometime in 1973, with a Zanjeer-esque Bachchan in some of the scenes and finally released in 1979, when Bachchan was about to hit his ugly 'Coolie' and 'Mard' phase. 

Splendid song. 

With the two lovers oblivious to the world.
