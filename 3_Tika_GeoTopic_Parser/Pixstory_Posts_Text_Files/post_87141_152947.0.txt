In the ninth gameweek of the English Premier League, seventh placed Newcastle United are all set to host tenth placed Brentford in their own backyard. Both teams are set to face each other in the clash at St James Park. 
Newcastle United registered a win over Fulham at Craven Cottage in their previous English Premier League fixture. They ran riot against Fulham by scoring four goals and won by three goal margin. However, they might be without Allan Saint-Maximin who is nursing the injury. 
On the other side, Brentford played out a goalless draw against AFC Bournemouth. Despite enjoying the majority of the possession and shots/shots on target, they failed to find the back of the net against AFC Bournemouth. They will look forward to registering three points against the Magpies.
