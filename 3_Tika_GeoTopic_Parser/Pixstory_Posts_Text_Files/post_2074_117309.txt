The US attorney s office in Washington DC recently informed the Colbert staffers who were detained and arrested by capitol police for unlawful entrance into the Longworth house office building which has congressional offices that they would not be prosecuted In a statement the US attorney s office cited congressional staffers invitation as the rationale for their decision not to prosecute Despite being invited by them they were required to have an escort with them at all times however they did not do so despite being warned numerous times that they were required to have one The prosecution s decision not to prosecute is seen by many as an example of liberal privilege Regardless of the circumstances it is evident that privilege exists in this situation whether it is advantage based on their political convictions or privilege based on their political connections In any instance however these Colbert staffers were allowed something that many other demonstrators might not We need go no farther than the black lives matter riots after the death of George Floyd or the physical occupation of a large area in Portland If a significant number of Republicans seized a multiblock area in any big city they would undoubtedly be labeled terrorists and punished to the fullest extent of the law Instead like the Colbert staffers they are not even given a slap on the wrist for who they favor they were not even pursued
