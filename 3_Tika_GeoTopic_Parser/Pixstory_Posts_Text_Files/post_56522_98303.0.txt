Kylie Jenner’s Met Gala 2022 outfit, a wedding dress paired with a white baseball cap, has reminded Desi Twitter of none other than Anjali (played by Kajol) from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Anjali’s character in the first half of the movie was portrayed as a “tomboy" whose fashion sense was derided in general. Her signature look included short hair and a baseball cap worn exactly the way Kylie wore it, minus, of course, the veil. As such, Kylie Jenner- kind of a beauty mogul of contemporary times- turning up in that baseball cap is being seen as a “proud moment" for Anjali.
