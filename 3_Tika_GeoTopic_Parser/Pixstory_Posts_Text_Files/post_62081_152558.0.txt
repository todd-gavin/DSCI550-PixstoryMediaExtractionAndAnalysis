Tennis fans recently took to social media to point out the similarities between the antics of Carlos Alcaraz and 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal during coin tosses ahead of their matches.
During his opening-round match against David Goffin at the 2022 Astana Open, fans claimed that the Spaniard was using his antics to intimidate his opponent, with many suggesting that he was imitating compatriot Nadal.
One fan mentioned that it was incredibly rude of the 19-year-old during the coin toss, touching on how distracting it was to his opponents.
"Incredibly rude & annoying to jump like that when someone is talking to you," said a fan.
