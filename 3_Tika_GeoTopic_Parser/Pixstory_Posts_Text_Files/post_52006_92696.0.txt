Daniel Ricciardo has reason to smile for the first time this season after McLaren showed signs of improvement during practice at the Australian Grand Prix on Friday.

Ricciardo finished in the top 10 of both practice sessions at Albert Park while teammate Lando Norris was fifth fastest in P1 and eighth quickest in P2.

It’s a welcome change from the first two races of the season, which have seen McLaren gain just six points from Norris’ seventh-placed finish in Saudi Arabia.

Ricciardo has endured a shocking start to the year, slumping to 14th in Bahrain then failing to finish in Saudi Arabia.

But speaking after practice, Ricciardo seemed upbeat about the steps his team has taken since it became clear in pre-season testing McLaren was well behind its rivals.

“It does (feel good to drive). Hopefully there is not too much sandbagging going on with the others. The feeling in the car was good,” Ricciardo said.

“I think both sessions were top 10, hopefully we can keep that going tomorrow. The main thing is that we have a decent level of confidence in the car.

“I think we found a good set-up this afternoon. Especially the first part of the session on the medium, I was pretty happy there. I think with the softs, I didn’t find as much as I think I can. So yeah, there is more to come from that tyre but otherwise from driving, I felt like I was getting on the limit today.”

However, Ricciardo isn’t expecting any miracles.

“Look, I think it will be better. Is it going to be 10 times better? Probably not to that extent but I think it will be some degree better,” he said.

“I think it’s also complimented by an extra DRS zone, the cars can follow a bit better this year, so if there is not more overtaking I think you are at least going to see more closer racing and more kind of nose to tail.
