THE FAULT IN OUR STARS I read this book a while back and I have to say it s an amazing read The writing style is immaculate and relatable When Agustus dies you really see how it affects Hazel and how she feels empty You see her grow From never leaving the house to falling in love You can see how Gus affects her and anyone who reads their story in such a deep and powerful way The only reason I give this book four out of five stars is that I know all the other books John Green has written and what he is capable of I like this book a lot But it did not make me cry like Paper Towns or Looking For Alaska did That being said it was an amazing book and I recommend it to any young reader just starting to get into nbsp books But this is all in my opinion of course
