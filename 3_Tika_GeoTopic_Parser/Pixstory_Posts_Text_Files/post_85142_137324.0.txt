Racism is an ugly side of the world that unfortunately is present everywhere. The
sporting world too has been subjected to various issues related to racism. Even in
football, due to the close proximity of players with fans, many have experienced
incidents that are shameful and shouldn’t occur. Some of these players have gone on
to speak about these issues. Thus here are a few instances when footballers took a
stand against Racism.
#1. Wijnaldum calls De Jong for Celebration
In a Euro 2020 qualifier between Netherlands and Estonia, Gini Wijnaldum
and Frenkie De Jong celebrated in a unique and powerful way. Wijnaldum hadopened the scoring in the 6th minute and while celebrating called De Jong byhis side. Both players showed off their hands signifying that their colors do notmatter. Netherlands went on to win the match 5-0 as Wijnaldum’s celebrationmade the headlines. This stand was in reaction to racist remarks faced byDutch Second Division team, Excelsior’s striker, Ahmad Mendes Moreira whowas called names by opposing team, Den Bosch’s fans.
#2. Dani Alves and the #WeAllAreMonkeys Campaign
Dani Alves is arguably one of the most entertaining footballers in the world.
But for someone so talented, he has faced unnecessary hate from fans. In 2014while playing for Barcelona in a La Liga fixture against Villareal, Alves receivedracist slurs. Barca had won a corner and as Alves was about to take it, a fanfrom the stands threw a banana at him. What followed was an epic reactionfrom the Brazilian. He simply picked it up, peeled the banana and took a bitefrom it and proceeded to take the corner. Later teammate Neymar posted apicture of himself having a banana on his social media. Other footballers like Balotelli and Lewandowski followed, showing solidarity with Alves and used
the hashtag #WeAllAreMonkeys.
