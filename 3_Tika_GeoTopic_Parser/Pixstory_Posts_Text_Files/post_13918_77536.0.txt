Donny van de Beek is keen to leave Manchester United to play football, and reports from Netherlands suggest he’s using some contacts to get it done.

Sky Sports reported earlier today that Crystal Palace have accelerated the discussion to sign Van de Beek on a loan deal till the end of season, and the trigger seems to be discussion between former Arsenal player, Dennis Bergkamp and his ex-teammate and current Palace manager, Patrick Viera. Van de Beek is eager to get the move done this transfer window. Dennis Bergkamp is father to Van de Beek’s girlfriend, Estelle Bergkamp. The two are also getting ready to becoming parents to their first born.

Amidst the beautiful personal life that Donny is enjoying, he has had to go through a torrid time at Old Trafford managing just 2 assists, and 2 goals in 50 assists in a year-and-a-half at Old Trafford.

Van de Beek was signed by Manchester United last summer under now ex-manager, Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer. He was being chased by the likes of Real Madrid, and Juventus, before United swooped in and offered close to £40million to Ajax. United also would have used their own contact, and relationship with former player, and legendary goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar, who runs Ajax Football Club as the CEO.

Once coveted by the likes of Real Madrid, it’s a shame that this has now come to this, where he is eager to get a move to Crystal Palace. No disrespect to Crystal Palace intended. In fact, this could be a great opportunity for the fans of the club from South London to see him play in front of a packed Selhurst Park. That will give both Van de Beek, and Crystal Palace to turn their fortunes in the immediate future.

It is a World Cup year, and Van de Beek has not been selected for the Netherlands squad since Louis van Gaal took over due to the lack of game time he’s had at Manchester United. He needs to change that, and play football regularly if he is to catch that flight to Qatar with his teammates in November 2022.
