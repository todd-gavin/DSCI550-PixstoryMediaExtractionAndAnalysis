Coming from the Orange city Nagpur there is not much to complain about It s calm yet bustling and with people working round the clock But of course no place is perfect and there is one big issue that is faced by all Nagpurians We ve a poor system of rainwater management All roads are congested during the rains the dams overflow and the houses are flooded with rainwater Houses in the slums sometimes entirely wash away This rainwater also gets mixed with sewage water and becomes dirtier Rains are very essential and much needed after the heat of the summers but they become a menace for the people in the city due to improper sewage and water management systems The floods are also a threat to life With the current climate crisis I think better infrastructure and water management is definitely required
