As per Collider, in contrast to many other crime dramas, Mindhunter is based on genuine incidents that have been fabricated for television. 

It centres on fictional characters who play off real FBI agents from the 1970s who assisted in the development of the criminal profiling of serial killers. The show revolves on two agents named Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (Holt McCallany), who are in command of the behavioural science department at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, where the majority of the action takes place.

Collider further correctly points out how a serial murderer series that never actually shows serial murders strikes one as a little odd. The focus of the show is on interacting with the serial killers and convincing them to spill their secrets in the hopes of getting just close enough to see the bottom of each killer's individual abyss without falling in. 

Yes, it presents a number of serial killers, but the majority of them are in prison. Mindhunter never actually displays the horrifying murders; instead, it only ever shows the aftermath of them, as seen in the scattered crime scene photos and the chalk outlines.
