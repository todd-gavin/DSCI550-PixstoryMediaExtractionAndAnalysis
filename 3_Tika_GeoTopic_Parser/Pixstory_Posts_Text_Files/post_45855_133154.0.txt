According to a report by TweakTown, the Perseverance Rover of NASA has just discovered that although Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet, it also has some green areas. 

Data from the rover that found olivine grains on the Martian surface was analysed by Purdue University researchers, which produced some green patches in the generally unending red sand of Mars. 

IT has reported that Perseverance has only revealed the most unexpected of discoveries: that Mars once had liquid water, air, and even a magnetic field similar to that of Earth. When Perseverance first landed on Mars' Jezero crater, scientists had anticipated finding numerous minerals of a reddish hue. 

They also thought the crater would include sedimentary materials, but instead, they actually found several volcanic rocks. Moreover, most of these rocks were made of large grains of olivine -- a mineral thatâ€™s one of the most abundant on our planet. 

They make up more than half of the upper mantle due to their abundance. They are also to blame for the green hue that covers many Hawaiian beaches. The rover is currently looking at samples that could be up to 4 billion years old and in remarkably good shape. 

In order to better comprehend the early conditions of the planet and whether or not they ever supported any life, researchers are now trying to understand the origin of these rocks.

Do you think this is a sign of life on Mars?
