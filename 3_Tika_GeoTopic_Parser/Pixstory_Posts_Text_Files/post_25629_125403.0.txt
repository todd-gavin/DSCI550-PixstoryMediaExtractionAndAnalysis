Manchester United have said that Marcus Rashford is not for sale this summer amid reports the forward's representatives have held talks with Paris Saint-Germain, reports claim. The England international is looking to force his way back into Gareth Southgate's squad for the World Cup in November but in order to achieve that feat, a new challenge may be required.

He is hoping to put his patchy form behind him as he looks to kickstart the new era under Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.

His drive hasn't stopped PSG from testing the water though with the French giants said to have held talks with Rashford's entourage last week.

The club would be open to signing the 24-year-old, who they believe would benefit from a new challenge and change of surroundings.

However, football reporter Julien Laurens claims United have already relayed that the player in not for sale this summer.

He tweeted: "Manchester United say that Marcus Rashford is not for sale. Only a crazy offer, I guess, could make them change their mind and PSG won’t make the crazy offer.

"Luis Campos has showed already this summer that he doesn’t pay over the odds and over his valuation of a player."

PSG are in the market for additional attacking reinforcements this summer having previously targeted Gianluca Scamacca and Benfica's Goncalo Ramos.
