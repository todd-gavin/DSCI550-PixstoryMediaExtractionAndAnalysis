Following U.S. sanctions against Russia, Airbus and Boeing have announced that they will be halting the supply of aircraft parts and services to Russian airlines. 

If the sanctions continue, Russia could face the same problem Iran has been facing for several years now. According to some reports, Iran has been forced to ground more than 50 percent of its planes because of lack of spare parts after the sanctions. 

In fact, several air accidents in recent years in Iran have been blamed on acute shortage of spares after years of sanctions against it. In the meantime, reports have emerged that China has refused to help Russia with spares to violate international sanctions. ( https://www.airport-technology.com/news/china-aircraft-parts-russia/ )

There was a celebration in Iran after it struck the nuclear deal with the U.S. as one of the main reasons was that Iranians could fly fearlessly after the lifting of sanctions on the aviation industry. ( https://asiatimes.com/2022/01/in-iran-there-is-reason-to-have-a-fear-of-flying/ )

Sanctions will mean that Russia would not be able to get scores of new planes that were up for delivery this year, comprising mainly from Boeing. Hundreds of planes that have been leased from companies outside Russia are worry the companies. Will Russia allow for repossessing of jets from various carriers or “nationalise” them as some speculate will be watched closely.

According to reports, Russian airlines could run out of spares within weeks, and much of its airline industry could be grounded. As Russia is a vast country with several airlines, airline safety could become a major issue. And the aviation industry could end as one of the most unsafe countries to fly, and it could have its consequences on the economy.
