Season opener India Open Throws competition at National Institute of Sports Patiala was the first competition of the domestic athletics season As far as my performance was concerned it was an average outing for me I touched m mark for gold but it was m short of my expectations Hopefully in the coming Grand Prix I will touch the mark For this year my target is Commonwealth Games
