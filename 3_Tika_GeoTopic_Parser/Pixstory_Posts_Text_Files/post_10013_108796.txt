You can find the Chatta Chowk covered market shortly after you enter the Red Fort past the Lahore Gate This is a historic covered market that occupies the passage area just inside the Red Fort as you enter through the Lahore Gate History suggests that the market area was built at the order Shah Jahan in the mid th century to satisfy the shopping needs and desires of the Mughal women of rank who resided within the fort but wished to not venture outside its gates This explains the peculiar small market of or so shops lining the covered passage way into the main interior of the fort The historic element of the Chatta Chowk makes it of interesting note but the shopping experience here is nothing you can t find in the nearby Chandni Chowk street markets or in the shops that line Janpath Rd and others near CP Shop prices are clearly marked up for the tourists that tend to pass by and potentially patronise these shops Overall we found Chatta Chowk to be a minor point of interest only but you can t help but pass through if you are planning to visit the Red Fort so a quick peek inside a few of the shops can do you know harm
