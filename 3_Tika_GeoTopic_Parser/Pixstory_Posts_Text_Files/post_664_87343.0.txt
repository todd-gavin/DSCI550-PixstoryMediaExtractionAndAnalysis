So now Hijab stands banned. Karnataka court has ruled that “ it is not essential in Islam”. 
What does it mean for the girls who were protesting for their right to cover their head? Will college reinforce the ban? Will other educational institutes follow? So will Conservative muslim families allow girls to go to colleges without Hijab? Or will some people for whom hijab holds utmost importance stop their daughters higher education?
Will some educational institutes also like some residential societies in various parts of the city also be out of reach for Muslims ?Will the  counsellors be telling Hijabis that sorry u might have to chose another college? What if tomorrow my daughter, who is ten and happy moving around in her shorts, decided to wear a hijab. Will she get a college of her liking. 
All of this takes me back to pre-independence India, when my grand father who was an official in the revenue department had his first child a daughter. A very educated man but also a religious scholar,he decided education was important for women as per Islam. My paternal aunt got educated and later worked as a teacher. She stayed in a PG accommodation while unmarried. She did all this wearing a Burqa. A proper one with a veil which covered her face . She retired as a headmistress and till her last day of work wore a burqa. Later she switched to a dupatta and a chadar before she passed away. But she set the foundation of everything each one of us, the forth generation educated women in the family do. 
I wonder if the burqa was banned would she have been able to study. I don’t think my grandfather who preferred one convent school, the one I studied in, over another on the basis of what the nuns wore - the ones in my school wore a sari and the other one had more in skirts.That was almost 40 years ago, more than 40 years after my aunt went to school. I keep wondering what would have happened if burqa was banned than. Would we have been educated?
