As stated by Jayaswal in all 230 pieces were received in Patna Museum including “pedestal, conches, miniature crystal stupas, bells, potteries etc. The actual images are about 150. 

Three of the images are plated with gold. There were a few images of solid silver; but they did not reach the authorities and the museum…. Although there were a few pieces which are pre Pala, the collection as a whole is Pala,” and it is certain that 105 of them are inscribed pieces. Only 6 of the images represent Hindu deities such as Siva-Parvati (three in all), Vishnu, Balarama and Surya. All the others represent Buddhist deities, of which as many as 51 represent the Buddha wearing a crown, a representation which is otherwise “unorthodox” or “uncanonical” from the Buddhist point of view. The Buddhist images represent mostly the goddess Tara, Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara or Lokanatha Vagishwara or others.

To the south of this great mound is a large tank on the banks of which Jayaswal noticed, in about 1930, numerous monolithic votive stupas. In Cunningham’s sketch plan another larger tank is shown towards west surrounded by a row of mounds; but these do not appear to have been explored so far.
