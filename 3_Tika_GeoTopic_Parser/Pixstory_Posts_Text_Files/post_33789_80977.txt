Teased by journalists in the press conference Antonio Conte answered the journalists&#39; questions in no uncertain terms I think our work brings a lot of stress not only for me but for all the coaches These are the words of the Tottenham coach after two consecutive defeats in the Premier League against Chelsea and Southampton unbeaten after the first nine games To keep up you have to deal with this stress every day I think it&#39;s normal for us and if you don&#39;t want pressure this job is not for you You have to stay at home in bed quietly drinking a good tea with biscuits adds the former blue coach who will face Wolverhampton tomorrow Credits profile picture twitter Tottenham Hotspur
