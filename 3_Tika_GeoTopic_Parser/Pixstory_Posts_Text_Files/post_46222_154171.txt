It s very true and common for a long time no one really want to talk about depression But to all those people who don t want to talk about depression i want to say that Nobody wants to be depressed Understand this straight up But now some people are taking depression seriously and working hard to change the thinking The point is we all should learn how to talk about depression and what to say to a depressed person It s very important to control our words We can t help someone with depression in any meaningful way without talking to them about it That s why it s so important to have the courage to speak up and find your words Let s discuss what to say to a depressed person No one can imagine how you feel but I m here for you if you need me Give a silent hug to them We all care about you I m sorry I know that was important to you If you want to talk about it you can Things are difficult right now but I have confidence in you Is there anything you need from me Remember You re enough and you re not weak Don t ask people why they are depressed even though everything in their life is sorted When you ask a depressed person why he was depressed even though life was joyful It is like asking why pneumonia patients suffocated while the air was there Often the simplest way to initiate a conversation is to be direct Show your support ask them what they are feeling remind them that effective treatment are available Make you mental health as your priority
