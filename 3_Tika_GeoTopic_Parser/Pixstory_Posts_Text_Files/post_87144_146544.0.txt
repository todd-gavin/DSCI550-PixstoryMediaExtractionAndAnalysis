5 David Luiz
Luiz may have played fewer minutes, but he had a big impact on the club and helped them win the Champions League. Many managers preferred him as a defender who worked well with any center-back. Luiz was a great passer of the ball with leadership qualities that many people have forgotten.
He made 143 appearances for the club and was instrumental in their Champions League victory over Bayern Munich.
4 Ricardo Carvalho
When Mourinho took over as manager of Chelsea, he decided to bring in his Porto guardian Ricardo Carvalho and the price was worth it because he was a quiet player who was hot-headed and was not an English outspoken player in the club. On the field, he evidenced his qualities through his intelligence and understanding of the game.
Carvalho formed an excellent defensive partnership with John Terry, assisting the club to its first league title in 50 years. On their way to the title, the club only allowed 15 goals. He was an excellent defender who helped his team win three league titles.
3 Ashley Cole
Cole's arrival at Chelsea was marred by controversy, as he was signed from Arsenal, causing uproar within the club. When it came to light that he wanted to sign for Chelsea and met Jose Mourinho on Arsenal's back, both player and manager were fined by the court. Aside from that, he was established as one of Chelsea's best left-backs.
He was quick, intelligent, and effective in both offense and defense. Cole won the champions League and the Premier League during his eight years at the club.
