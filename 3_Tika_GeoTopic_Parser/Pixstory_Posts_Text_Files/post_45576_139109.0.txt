Fans seem to be enjoying House of the Dragon, not just in the US but also in the UK. 

Sky has reported that the critically acclaimed Game of Thrones prequel's premiere episode has received 4.08 million views, making it the biggest US drama launch in company history. 

According to Virgin Radio, additionally, the debuts of Rhaenyra Targaryen (Milly Alcock) and Daemon (Matt Smith) enabled Sky Atlantic to have its biggest series premiere in its 11-year history. 

The introduction of HOTD was more popular than Game of Thrones in 2011, according to the seven-day viewing stats, and episode two might help Sky set even more records. 

MD of Content at Sky, Zai Bennett said of the massive success in the UK: “Momentum around House of the Dragon just continues to build, as more and more people spread the word about its ever-current narrative of political power play married with visuals of epic scale and imagination. And thanks to Sky making the first episode freely available to watch via YouTube, more people than ever before will be able to sample the world-class world of Westeros.”
