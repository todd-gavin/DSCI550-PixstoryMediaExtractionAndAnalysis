Memories of what was once one of Southport's most opulent hotels have been recounted. 

In its heyday, the Prince of Wales Hotel on Lord Street was a thriving social centre that hosted events for hundreds of people and would be busy every weekend. It is now a dilapidated hotel with a fair Trip Advisor rating.
