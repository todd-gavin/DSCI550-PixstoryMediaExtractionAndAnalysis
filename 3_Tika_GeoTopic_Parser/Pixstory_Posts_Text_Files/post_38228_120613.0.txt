Chelsea are set to be very interested in Frenkie De Jong as they attempt to tempt the midfielder to move to London instead of Manchester. For this, the Blues reportedly have a two-for-one swap deal in mind. 

As per the Mirror, Thomas Tuchel's side want to revamp their midfield before the 2022/23 season. For this, the Blues have narrowed down their sights on the outgoing Barcelona midfielder Frenkie De Jong. The Dutch midfielder looks set to be heading out of Barca with Manchester United being the prime target. 

But Chelsea could upset this equation with a newly proposed swap deal. As per the report, "The Blues could possibly offer current defensive duo Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta in part-exchange for De Jong. Barcelona have of course already been chasing the signings of the Chelsea pair this summer - despite having already sealed the services of Danish defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer."

Frenkie De Jong wants to play in the Champions League and hence Chelsea's offer could tempt him to move to the London-based club as Manchester United would not be contesting in the Champions League this season. To add to this, Barcelona's interest in Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta could also play a huge role as the Blues attempt to successfully sign the midfielder this summer.
