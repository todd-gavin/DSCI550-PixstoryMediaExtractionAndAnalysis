The shoot of Yash starrer upcoming Kannada magnum opus KGF: Chapter 2 is on the verge of completion. On the occasion of Yash’s birthday, the makers of his upcoming film released the most awaited teaser of the film.

After that, he lights up his cigarette with the barrel of the gun and the Health Department has raised concerns as the visuals do not feature the mandatory “smoking is injurious to health” warning.
According to department officials, the visuals violate Section 5 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) 2003. It has, therefore, decided to ask the visuals be deleted from the teaser from online platforms. Department officials have sent a letter in this regard to the film’s director Prashant Neel, producer Vijay Kiragandur, and Yash.
