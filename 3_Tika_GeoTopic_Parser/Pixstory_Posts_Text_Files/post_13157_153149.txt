They jump up after victoryAnd they land in the distanceUntil their way endsand their wingsSink into the orange rays of the sunand find the courage to ask for the skyThe bird sings in the cageHe trembles with fear of the unknownBut it waits for shutdownAnd his song is heard in the distant hillsA bird in a cage sings for freedom
