The early roots of tea were those of revival: one legend has it that “divine famer” and mythical inventor of agriculture, Emperor Shennong, accidently poisoned himself 72 times till a miraculous leaf landed on his tongue, saving his life as it disintegrated in 2737 BC.

This story might not have enough evidence to establish itself, but tea is believed to be an integral part of ancient China for over 6000 years, starting as a vegetable to be eaten, long before it was introduced to the west.

About 1500 years ago, tea made its debut as the hot beverage we know today – thriving communities of artists, poets, connoisseurs formed around matcha, which became the standard way to prepare tea in China (long before it left the nation to become the trend it is today).

In the 9th century, Japan was introduced to tea when a monk carried a plant back to the country. 

As the world became acquainted, things took a dark turn: Britain’s demand for tea and its illegal imports of opium into China, led to the mid-19th century a Opium-driven public health crisis in China.

Later, tea plants and tea workers were “smuggled” into Darjeeling in India, through an undercover mission by the British East India Company.
