Ed Sheeran is one of my favourite artists I love the melody and the words he brings to his songs Galway Girl Perfect Photograph and even Shape Of You I love almost all his songs However I do have a special soft spot for Thinking Out Loud It s a song that blurs the lines between realism and fantasy that fairy tale of a love story but also an ugly reality He s daydreaming about the time he has spent with the girl he loves he s thinking out loud There s a love here that goes beyond the surface The phrases paint a vivid image of the lovers as they grow older He recognises the inevitability of age related frailty As he matures and loses his charms he wonders if she will remember and love him the same way she does now Like most of his songs this tells a story too A story that hits too close to home for people I absolutely adore that
