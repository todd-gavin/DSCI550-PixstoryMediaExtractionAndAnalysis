Rumours have been circulating that Raheem Sterling is looking to exit the club in the summer. But Pep Guardiola has now admitted that the player is important to the club.

Raheem Sterling has been vital for Manchester City in recent months. Owing to this, it seems that Pep Guardiola has had a change of heart over his English winger.

The England international scored a hat-trick as Manchester City beat Norwich City to extend their gap at the top of the Premier League. Following the win, the Sky Blues are 9-points clear of second-placed Liverpool.

Pep Guardiola was interviewed after the win against Norwich City. The Manchester City manager showed his admiration for Raheem Sterling's performance. But the Spaniard agreed that he was in the dark about the winger's future. 

As per Manchester Evening News, The City manager said "In the future, I don't know what's going to happen, because the club decides. The club all the time. When they extend the player contracts, I give my opinion but the club takes the decisions all the time."

Pep Guardiola added that he knows how important Raheem Sterling is to the club. The Spaniard also said he hopes that the winger would put in similar performances day after day. 

The manager concluded by saying that he would continue to make changes and substitutions to the starting XI when needed. The Sky Blues would face Tottenham Hotspur next in the Premier League.


Sterling's legacy with the Sky Blues


Raheem Sterling joined Manchester City after moving from Liverpool in 2015. Since then the winger has made 322 appearances, scoring 126 goals for the Sky Blues. He has also helped the club win multiple Premier League titles among other trophies. 

The England international has scored 10 goals in 21 Premier League appearances this season. It is not known if he would stay with the Sky Blues after this season. Hence Sterling would surely be looking to make the most of the chances that he gets under Pep Guardiola.
