In El Clasico, the Blancos will debut a new black kit designed by Yohji Yamamoto in partnership with Adidas.

Real Madrid will face Barcelona in a new black uniform at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday in a Clasico rematch.

The kit is the second collaboration between Yohji Yamamoto's Y-3 brand and adidas, with Yamamoto's Y-3 brand previously designing Real Madrid's third kit in 2014-15. The normal adidas logo will be replaced with Y-3 this time on the jersey.

The 2021-22 kit, like the last collaboration, features a stunning contrast of black and white colours. The new uniform is slightly simpler than the 2014-15 design, which had a faded dragon motif.

Meanwhile, the accompanying goalkeeper outfit will be pink instead of orange, as it was previously.

The connection isn't only restricted to the equipment; a full line of warm-up tops, jackets, and accessories like scarves and wash bags has been released.

In El Clasico, why is Real Madrid wearing black against Barcelona?
Real Madrid's black jersey is a symbol of celebration for the club, which was founded in March 1902, as well as Yamamoto's connection with adidas, which is celebrating its 120th birthday.

The two great businesses in their respective sectors have teamed up once again to create a commemorative collection, with the Meringues set to debut the kit at the Bernabeu against fierce rivals Barcelona.

El Clasico will take on a new style this year, with Barcelona expected to wear their recognisable Senyera uniform, which has the yellow and red of the Catalan flag.
