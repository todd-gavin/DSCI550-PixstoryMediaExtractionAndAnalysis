This time we decided to fly to Leh Driving up I feel is better though The places enroute both from the Srinagar Manali side have their own beauty not to mention the acclimatization is taken care of But time oh dear It s always such a fight for time against time We went early in the tourist season At the beginning of May the passes hadn t opened the schools hadn t shut in the north so we managed to beat most of the crowd Each month of the tourist season has something to offer May has the pale beauty of the apricot blossoms snow July is a riot of colours with the wild flowers blooming then there are the festivals spread over various months with the accompanying hordes Take your pick We made trips to Dras Batalik the Nubra valley Pangong Tso Chumathang Tso Moriri would have required more time for some obscure reason Zanskar didn t feature on the itinerary Life will bloom anywhere where it gets nourishment So at the end of this visit I have worked out the itinerary for the next Will begin with Tso Moriri take it from there I have heard so much about the Chadar trek too but the one piece I did read about it ironically was about why we should not be doing it It made total sense as it is for someone like me who can turn blue even south of the Vindhyas in winter I will pass hope global warming doesn t get to it before I do
