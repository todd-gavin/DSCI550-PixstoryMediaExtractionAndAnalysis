US President Joe Biden talking at a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, said withdrawing the US troops from Afghanistan was the right decision.

He said the US spent trillions of dollars in Afghanistan and would have continued spending money and sending US troops into the country if he had not pulled the troops out.

"Look, we were spending a trillion dollars a week, I mean, a billion dollars a week in Afghanistan for 20 years. So raise your hand if you think anyone would unify Afghanistan under one single government. It's been the graveyard of empires for a solid reason. So it is not susceptible to unity, number one," he said.

The Biden Administration has faced harsh criticism following the US withdrawal, the chaotic evacuation at Kabul airport and an attack in which over 100 people, including 13 US service members, were killed and over 100 people were injured. "There is no way to get out of Afghanistan after 20 years easily. Not possible, no matter when you did it. And I make no apologies for what I did," he said.

The 20-year US military engagement in Afghanistan ended on August 15, 2021, as the last batch of US soldiers left Kabul airport.

Three days after the airport attack, a US drone targeted a house in Kabul in which 10 civilians, including seven children, were killed. Next, US forces targeted a vehicle they believed to be carrying Daesh fighters, according to public statements, but later their findings showed all the victims were civilians.
