Former e-cigarette giant, JUUL, recently agreed to pay a $438.5 million fine as a settlement in a case against them by 33 states. The case revolved around JUUL marketing their products to teens through their flavored e-cigarettes.

Connecticut attorney general, William Tong, bluntly admonished JUUL’s actions in a statement where he said, “Juul’s cynically calculated advertising campaigns created a new generation of nicotine addicts. They relentlessly marketed vaping products to underage youth, manipulated their chemical composition to be palatable to inexperienced users, employed an inadequate age verification process, and misled consumers about the nicotine content and addictiveness of its products.”

Although JUUL has become more moderate in recent years, altering its corporate image by reducing advertising and eliminating its attractiveness to teenagers, it has reaped enormous profits from its previous misconduct. In 2018, their efforts generated $2 billion in revenue, for instance. 

Obviously, money cannot remedy the wrongdoings of JUUL, but it is a start. The settlement funds, as well as additional funds, will be invested in programs to combat e-cigarette addiction.
