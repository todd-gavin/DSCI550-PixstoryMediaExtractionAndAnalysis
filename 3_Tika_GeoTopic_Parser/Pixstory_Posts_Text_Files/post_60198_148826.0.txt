At the residence of Ashok Gehlot friend Shanti Dhariwal, nine Rajasthan Congress MLAs, including four ministers, are meeting in advance of the key party conference where the next chief minister will be chosen.
Although the purpose of this meeting is unknown, there is suspicion that it will serve as Team Gehlot's attempt to maintain an ally in power. There are rumours that Sachin Plot, the Chief Minister's bitter opponent, may finally succeed him.
Later in the evening, the key Congress meeting would take place in front of state in-charge Ajay Maken and central leader KC Venugopal. But according to insiders, Sonia Gandhi, the party's acting chief, will choose the new chief minister.
The front-runner for the position of party president, Mr. Gehlot, has been very hesitant to resign from the top position in Rajasthan in order to keep Mr. Pilot away. His options are limited as a result of Rahul Gandhi's strong support for the recent "one man, one position" decision.
Sources had previously said, however, that Mr. Gehlot would prefer a loyalist to lead the government if not him.
