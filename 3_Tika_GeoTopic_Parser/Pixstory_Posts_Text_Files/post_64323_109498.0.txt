Help the Firemen to Help You....

Fireman is your friend: –

Give way to fire engines to enable them to reach at the incident quickly.

Allow them to use your telephone to communicate with the control room.

Don’t park your cars / truck close to fire hydrants / underground static water tanks.

Guide firemen to water sources i.e. Tube wells, ponds, static tanks etc. in case of fire.
