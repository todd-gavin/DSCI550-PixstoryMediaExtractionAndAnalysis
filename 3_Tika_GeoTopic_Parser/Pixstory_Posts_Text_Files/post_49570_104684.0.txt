Teachers in America are incredibly underpaid and uncared for. Most teachers just cannot do without a second job. The job barely makes up for their expenses and give them any time for themselves or their own families.

Let me remind you: Teachers are not some sort of robots that the country is experimenting with. They're real human beings with real life. They did not sign up for violence, they signed up for teaching kids. They're not supposed to take the responsibility of stopping a shooter, the cops are supposed to do it.

Arming teachers buy more time for the police to act? But when does the police ever act? They stay outside like cowards letting the massacre unfold. On one side, you advocate against defunding the police and on the other hand prove that they're incapable of doing their job.

Jessica made valid points. It's too risky to hand over guns to teachers who can very easily harm the children themselves. In your post, you only made one right point. That a teacher who could harm a child shouldn't be there in the first place. But our country doesn't get it. It's very common to mistreat students in school for teachers and in a system that allows that, it's just foolish to give them more power.
