Prior to the 1st of December in 2006, I had never ever imagined even in the wildest of my thoughts that I would someday be posted as the SP of Bagaha.

The name of Bagaha in the subconscious mind had often seemed like some distant land in Bihar cut-off from the mainstream, and of which I had no particular knowledge. But so quick was the transition that just one phone call at around 9.45 p.m. changed the whole way in which my thinking process was set. At that time, I had completed about 9 months being the City Superintendent of Police in Patna.
 
On that particular day I had left office late for my residence as I had been busy with signing the orders on several crime files. As I was alighting the stairs to reach the Bedroom of the old Historic City SP Residence in Gandhimaidan, Patna, I saw the phone ringing with the name of the caller being the DGP, Bihar. 

As I picked the call, the DGP congratulated and informed me that the Government had posted me as the new SP of Bagaha and had desired my presence in the new place of posting overnight. I was advised to start within 1 or 2 hours on the journey for Bagaha via Muzaffarpur. So sudden was the impact of the call, that I could hardly react and just affirmed my consent as the short call ended. As I was on the first floor of the old residence, I saw my wife waiting who totally unaware of the new development, was seemingly perturbed about my having been very late from office.
