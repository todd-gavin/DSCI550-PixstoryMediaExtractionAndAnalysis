Gourmet Food is less more or just expensive If I were ever asked about my favorite type of cuisine it would be Gourmet without a second thought What exactly is Gourmet Gourmet may be described as a class of restaurant cuisine meal or ingredient of high quality of special presentation or high sophistication The food of the elite some may say But what s most surprising is whether this class of food is worth the crazy dollars it s priced at To maintain the high standard and keeping the niche crowd in mind the luxury restaurants source the ingredients from various places that increases the production cost of the dish and as a result it also affects the end price of the dish So to make the dish affordable they are served in small portions This is where the phrase less is always more comes into play A new study from Cornell says that people s perception of food changes based on how much it costs and the pricier a meal is the better we think it tastes So much for having discerning tastebuds In the end fine dining is an experience of its kind And to enjoy such precise and strategic cooking is worth when you have a heart to spend
