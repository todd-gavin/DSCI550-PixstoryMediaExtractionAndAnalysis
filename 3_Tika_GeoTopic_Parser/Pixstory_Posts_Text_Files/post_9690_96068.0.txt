To avoid being tainted by the Cold War, it was Pakistan that took up the Afghan cause at the UN and other international fora. Pakistan managed spectacular successes in getting both Muslim and non-aligned countries to vote against the Soviet invasion—starting with 104 votes in favour in the first vote in 1980, then 111 in the second vote in 1980 and in 1981 rising  102 to 116.
