Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said the 5G technology in India is completely indigenous except for some "critical parts" imported from countries like South Korea.
During an interaction with students at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, the minister asserted that India is ready to share the 5G technology with other countries as well. (I Mukesh Ambani says will roll out high quality, more affordable 5G services)
"The story (of India's 5G) is yet to reach the public," Sitharaman said. "The 5G that we've launched in our country is completely standalone."
"There could be some critical parts coming from, say, countries like (South) Korea, but certainly not from somebody else. So complete indigenous technology that we can now provide 5G (to any country) who wants it," she added.
Citing the private companies that launched 5G in limited cities, the minister said that most of the country will be able to avail the technology by 2024.
