After departing Turkish club Goztepe, the former Flying Eagles star will continue his professional
career at TQL Stadium. Major League Soccer team FC Cincinnati has confirmed the signing of
Obinna Nwobodo from Goztepe. The former Nigeria U20 midfielder has signed a three-year
contract with the TQL Stadium giants, which will run through 2024 with an option to extend until
2025.

“FC Cincinnati have signed Nigerian midfielder Obinna Nwobodo as a Designated Player from
Göztepe S.K. of the Turkish Super Lig,” it read.

“The 25-year-old has signed a three-year deal with FC Cincinnati through the 2024 MLS season
with an option for 2025. He will occupy an international roster spot.”

Nwobodo began his professional career with Enugu Rangers, with whom he won the Nigeria
Professional Football League title in 2016.

 Following that success, he was signed for an
undisclosed fee by Hungarian side Ujpest on a three-year contract.

He was signed by the Turkish Super Lig after finishing his career with the Purples. He had now
established himself as a major member of Stjepan Tomas' team. Prior to joining Cincinnati, the
African appeared in 29 league matches with Goz Goz, but scored no goals.

 Nwobodo's arrival
impressed Cincinnati general manager Chris Albright, who claimed that he would be a good fit
for the team.

“We’re excited to welcome Obinna to FC Cincinnati,” Albright the club website.

“His overall quality will complement our group, while his work rate and defensive presence in
midfield are both exceptional.

Obinna is a world-class ball-winning midfielder who brings a unique energy to the club. His
ability to break up plays, as well as his forward-thinking attitude, make him a fantastic
complement to the team. With this move, he joins Isaac Atanga (Ghana) and Dominique Badji
as the third African in Cincinnati (Senegal). On Saturday, Nwobodo might make his debut
against Atlanta United.
