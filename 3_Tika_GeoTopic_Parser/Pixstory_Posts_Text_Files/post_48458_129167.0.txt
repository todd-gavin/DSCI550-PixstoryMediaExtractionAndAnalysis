Death penalties are cruel. There are many reasons why we should absolutely not support the death penalty. Jesus said "He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone." This means that anyone has no right to judge or punish another person. We have all sinned. We have all hurt others and it should not be in our hands to punish someone else with death. 

Second, the Bible teaches that all human beings are made in God's image. This means that we have inherent dignity and worth, regardless of our crimes. We are not mere animals who need to be killed in order to satisfy human anger or revenge.

The Bible calls us to love our enemies and forgive them â€“ even if they've hurt us deeply. This is because hatred only leads to more violence and suffering. It's much better to try and understand why a certain crime is happening. We can come together and battle it. I understand why someone would want to support capital punishment, I get that. But the truth is the only thing it will do is cause more bloodshed and that's about it.
