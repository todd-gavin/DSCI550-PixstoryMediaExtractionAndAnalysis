An Ohio man who claimed that Donald J Trump was legally responsible for his decision to break into the Capitol on Jan and make off with a bottle of bourbon and a coat rack was convicted on Thursday in the first trial connected to the riot to feature a defense that blamed the former president The defendant Dustin Thompson an unemployed exterminator from Columbus based his entire trial defense on the argument that he had merely been following orders from Mr Trump last year when he walked up to the Capitol after the former president s speech broke into the building with a pro Trump mob and stole the items from the Senate parliamentarian s office When Mr Thompson testified in his own defense on Wednesday he tried to paint a sympathetic portrait of himself telling the jury how he had fallen down a rabbit hole of election misinformation starting after he lost his job during the pandemic in March and culminating in his presence in Washington for Mr Trump s speech near the White House on Jan He testified that he believed that he had been answering the president s call to go to the Capitol and fight like hell when he joined the throng that swarmed into the building If the president s giving you almost an order to do something he told the jury I felt obligated to do that But the jury in Federal District Court in Washington took less than three hours to reject that claim and find Mr Thompson guilty of all six charges he was facing The most serious charge in the indictment accused Mr Thompson of obstructing Congress s duty to certify the final results of the election a count that carries a maximum penalty of years in prison Within minutes of the verdict being read Judge Reggie B Walton who oversaw the trial ordered Mr Thompson who had been out on bail for months to remain in jail before his sentence was issued Credit The New York Times
