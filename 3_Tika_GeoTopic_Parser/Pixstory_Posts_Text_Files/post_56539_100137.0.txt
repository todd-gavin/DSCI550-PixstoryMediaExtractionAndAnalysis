Nicki minaj 
 A surprising trend on this year's Met Gala red carpet? Baseball hats. Nicki Minaj wore an elevated version—leather, with an extra detail on the crown for height—with her Burberry look by Riccardo Tisci. Of course, the look also came with a giant belt, leather leggings, and layers of leather and tulle, finished off with a whole constellation of body jewelry.
 
Fredrik Robertsson in Iris van Herpen
Robertsson pushed the envelope into another dimension with this shape-shifting couture Iris van Herpen gown covered in undulating spikes and cut-outs. Extra points for matching hair and makeup, too.

Jessie Buckley in Schiaparelli
Buckley took a note from the menswear book in a Schiaparelli pinstripe suit, complete with a matching tie and wide-brim hat. But what really takes the cake is the drawn-on pencil mustache. Bravo.

Emily Ratajkowski in Atelier Versace
EmRata's eclectic look had a little bit of everything: beading, fringe, ruched printed fabric, shimmer, tassels—all courtesy of vintage Atelier Versace (with REZA jewelry).

Jeremy Strong
A loose-hanging strip of pink fabric as a tie. A smattering of buttons-turned-brooches. Shiny leather shoes paired with shimmering velvet pants. This look is chaotic but fitting on Succession actor Jeremy Strong. 

Cole Sprouse
Is it a straitjacket? A utility...vest? No one's quite positive what Cole Sprouse is going for here, but he seems quite proud of it! Bonus points for going all-in on metallic silver.
