Prime Minister of Kashmir continues... 

Q. “When will such steps be taken?” 
A. “I will study this question. In every State from Nepal to Travancore reforms are going on. Hyderabad is also bound to give reforms soon. Our position is more or less like that of Hyderabad. I want to see what Hyderabad is doing. These reforms are coming very soon.” 

Q. “Will you tell us whether the Government will give some further reforms, if not full responsible Government?” 
A. “I cannot say anything, I have told Sheikh Abdulla that completechange-over could not be agreed to but if any other scheme could be proposed, I would examine it and make a recommendation to His Highness.” 

Q. “You have said that it has not been decided to which Union the State is joining. Could you kindly tell me whether public opinion will be consulted before doing so?” 
A. “Public opinion will be consulted but it will be for the Ruler to decide how that public opinion is to be obtained. The Independence Act gives complete authority to the Ruler in exercise of his sovereign rights on this matter. The same thing is mentioned in the Instruments of Accession.” 

Q. “If the Ruler decides to join with any dominion which may be detrimental to the interests of the State what should be done?” 
A. “There is no reason to believe that it will be so.” 

Q. “We did not get many visitors this year. We could not export our timber. We have had no imports. Our fruit is also rotting here for want of facilities for export. What do you think can be done?” 
A. “I will do what I can. I have no petrol to spare beyond the military needs and the needs of the Police which are essential services. If the Pakistan Government gives me petrol, which they have promised, I will allow a number of services.” 

Q. “Could you tell US which dominion the State is joining?” 
A. “I have an open mind on this subject.”
