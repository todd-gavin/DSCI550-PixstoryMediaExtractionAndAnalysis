Now, in an upcoming test launching in three countries
- Chile, Costa Rica and Peru - Netflix will let members who share their accounts with people outside their household do so "easily and securely, while also paying a bit more," according to Chengyi Long, director of product innovation at Netflix. The new options will roll out in the next few weeks in the three countries (and may or may not expand beyond those markets).

According to the Netflix terms of service, a customer's
account "may not be shared with individuals beyond your household." After years of turning a blind eye to password- sharing behavior that falls outside that requirement, the company last year ran a limited test prompting users to enter their account credentials as a way to nudge freeloaders into paying for their own accounts.

"We've always made it easy for people who live together to share their Netflix account, with features like separate profiles and multiple streams in our Standard and Premium plans," Long wrote in a blog post about the test. "While these have been hugely popular, they have also created some confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared. As a result, accounts are being shared between households impacting our ability to invest in great new TV and films for our members."

With the "add an extra member" feature, members with Netflix's Standard and Premium plans will be able to add subsidiary accounts for up to two people they don't live with, each with their own profile, personalized recommendations, login and password
- for less than the cost of a separate Netflix plan.

In the test countries, the cost for adding a sub member is 2380 CLP in Chile, $2.99 USD in Costa Rica, and 7.9 PEN in Peru.
