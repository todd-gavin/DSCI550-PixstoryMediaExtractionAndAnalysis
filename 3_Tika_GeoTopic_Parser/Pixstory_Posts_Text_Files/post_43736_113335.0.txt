A footballer who spent 10 years at Stamford Bridge has been added to the Liga's elite squad by the club. Andreas Christensen has been signed by Barcelona as a free agent after severing connections with Chelsea. The move to Camp Nou has been revealed.

Since it became known that the 26-year-old center-back will not be renewing his contract at Stamford Bridge, rumours of a move to Catalunya have circulated. 

A protracted saga that was made more problematic by Barca's persistent financial problems has now come to an end.

The international player from Denmark, who has 56 international appearances to his record, will provide Barcelona's back line valuable experience. Another season performer is prepared to replace Ronald Araujo and Eric Garcia as Gerard Pique nears the conclusion of his career.

Christensen played in 93 Premier League games for Chelsea between 2015 and 2017, during which time he also spent two seasons on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach in the Bundesliga. He regularly participated in continental competition as well, and he brings Champions League, Europa League, UEFA Super, and FIFA Club World Cup championship medals to Camp Nou.

Barcelona was able to offer Christensen a lucrative four-year contract through the summer of 2026 without having to pay a transfer fee. It is the same length as the agreement Franck Kessie, whose status as a member of the Barcelona team had earlier in the day, signed. The release clauses for both players total â‚¬500 million, and Christensen will make his debut on Thursday, one day after joining from Milan.

There are still problems with new player registration, but the Blaugrana claim they have enough room in their pay cap to bring in new players and formally confirm them.
