Naan afghani, naan obi, bolani, lavasa, roghani ... the list is exhaustive. Wondering what they are? They’re typical Afghan breads that are available in the heart of Delhi. Thanks to a bustling Afghan community, the traditional naanwais of Afghanistan have been transported to the Capital. Naanwais, as the name indicates, are makers and sellers of naans or bread.

In a typical Afghan household, bread is a staple. But it’s rarely made at home; it is instead bought from the naanwais in the lanes. The naanwais, mostly men, knead the dough and make fresh bread through the day.

When the migration from Afghanistan to India started, many of the immigrants made Delhi their base, especially areas such as Bhogal, Tilak Nagar and Lajpat Nagar. With them, they brought their culture of bread making.

The naans today are available across the city where the population has settled. So it is in Bhogal’s Kashmiri Lane, where there is a sizeable portion. Then there is Lajpat Nagar, where an entire lane is now called Afghan Street, while Malviya Nagar and Tilak Nagar also have a smattering of Afghans.
