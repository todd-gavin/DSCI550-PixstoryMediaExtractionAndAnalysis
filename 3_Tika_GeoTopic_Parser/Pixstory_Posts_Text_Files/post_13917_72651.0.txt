Indian Superhero Movies are either an exaggeration or VFX mess. The reason why Indians look upto Hollywood for superhero narratives is because of rhe amazing storyline, effects and the narrative rooted in logic. Minnal Murali wasn't exactly expected to deliver on public expectations of superhero movies considering that it is not that large scale and comes out of a small but increasingly popularizing industry of Malayalam Cinema. The cast wasn't all comprised of known faces and neither was the director one of the most blockbuster ones but yet Minnal Murali was able to deliver a narrative rooted in reality and relatable. The backdrop, attainment of superhero powers and the action all have a certain logic. The hero and villain both draw from the same source of energy and are at par with each other. They both have a certain purpose that drives them and a logical explanations for all their actions. The acting of the entire cast of the movie is exemplary and the storyline serves the motivea of common men as exactly that and not seen as gods. They have human selfish emotions and values and keep it aside for a higher purpose. There is no drastic change with the attainment of powers but a gradual one. Hence, this superhero movie is more believable by the audience. With not too over the top vfx or theatrics, Minnal Murali had popular opinion and public love!
