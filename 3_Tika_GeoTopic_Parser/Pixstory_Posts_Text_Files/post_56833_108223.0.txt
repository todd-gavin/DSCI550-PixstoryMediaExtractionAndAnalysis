On Friday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said that facebook-owner Meta Platforms is launching a digital clothing store where users can purchase designer outfits for their avatars.

Initial fashion brands participating in the store launch will be Balenciaga, Prada, and Thom Browne. Still, Meta aims to make the store an open marketplace where developers can create and sell outfits, said Zuckerberg, speaking on an Instagram Live.

The new virtual store, which will be available on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, will allow users to purchase digital clothing for their avatars. In addition, meta aims to turn the store into an open marketplace where developers can create and sell outfits.

The store will open next week in the United States, Canada, Thailand and Mexico, initially offering digital outfits from Balenciaga, Prada and Thom Browne, with more brands to follow.

Although the company has released no pricing information for these digital outfits, it is worth noting that the free clothing options for Meta avatars will remain available.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, commented on the launch, “We’re launching our Avatars Store on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger so you can buy digital clothes to style your avatar. Digital goods will be an important way to express yourself in the metaverse and a big driver of the creative economy.”
