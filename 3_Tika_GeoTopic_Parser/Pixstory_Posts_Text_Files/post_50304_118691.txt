The day was a cold one with shades of sunlight appearing as we entered the forest near Jatashankar temple at about a m to reach Panchnad Nala only after crossing not less than streams using vehicles in the same manner as described before Though looking around in the hope of spotting tigers in the wild none could be spotted that day despite roaming around for kilometres inside the jungles and the highlights of the day included two groups of spotted deer and wild boar apart from some birds After dinner at the Valmikinagar rest house we again roamed around in the night around the barrage and airstrip where a lot of hares could be seen along with birds in the open grounds with tall grasses Several herds of deer and nilgais were seen close to the road as we moved upto Kotraha from where I left for Bagaha as the senior officers retreated for the night I was not so lucky on this night as the previous one but nevertheless did see some more deer in the woods near Valmikinagar road railway station as I reached Bagaha and entered into the quilt to spend the hours before the morning The next morning breakfast was planned at the Sugar Mill guest house at Bagaha as the officers had to depart early by train for their headquarters As I left them at the Railway Station I was feeling very happy to have been posted in Bagaha where I could freely explore the jungles and natural beauty of the diaras in pursuit of the dreaded criminals which was my main task It was a place which doubled Work with Adventure and at the young age that I had been posted I was sure to make the most of it To be continued
