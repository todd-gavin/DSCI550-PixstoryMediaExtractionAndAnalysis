Who else could it be when his team needed him again Cristiano Ronaldo stood up to the task The first half performance by Manchester United against Norwich was brilliant except conceding that one goal at the end of the half United progressed the ball slowly and took their time to take apart Norwich who weren t pressing the Manchester United players at all Elanga took the ball in the opponent box and assisted Ronaldo to score a tap in The next goal by Ronaldo was a leaping header from a corner taken by Telles Things didn t look good for Manchester in the second half when Pukki equalised for Norwich but then in the minute Manchester United recieved a Free Kick in the range that we ve seen Ronaldo score goals from when he first player for Manchester Turning back the years Ronaldo slotted a Knuckle Ball free kick even though the keeper got a hand to it but the power was too much for him to control This is the th career Hattrick for Cristiano Ronaldo and the second one of this season When it comes to the clutch no one comes close to him
