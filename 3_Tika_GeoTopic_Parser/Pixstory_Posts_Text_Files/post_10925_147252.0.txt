On a humid September day, dressed in a loose, white shirt and worn trousers, 48-year-old Asmat Ali waited for the 3  pm boat to take him on a 45-km, two-hour journey home here in India’s far east. 
Standing on the banks of the Dhansiri, a branch of the Brahmaputra river, Ali pointed to the faint, shimmering view of shanties on the other bank. “If you can see the houses that seem like ants right now, there is Nangli Char No. 5,” he said. “That’s where my house is.” 
Ali hauls a rickshaw for a living for up to 14 hours every day in Assam’s capital Guwahati city, 62 km southwest of Nangli Char No. 5, a village of about 30 tin-roofed mud huts on a sandbank, called char in Assamese, that stays barely above the ever-shifting river—sometimes under it—ceaselessly eroding the land, limiting access to only rickety boats that run on noisy diesel engines.
He visits home once a month with about Rs 3,000 that he saves for his wife, 12-year-old son and 18-year old daughter, who studies in a government-aided residential school in a village called Dhula, 70 km away in the northwestern Assam district of Darrang. Ali’s two elder daughters are married.
The son of a poor farmer who grew mainly rice on 2.5 acres, Ali did not study beyond the fourth standard. He worked on his father's farm and the fields of neighbours. 
One monsoon when he was a young boy, his father's land was consumed by the river. With no means of making a living when he became an adult, Ali moved to Guwahati and began hauling a rickshaw in 2010.  
Life, then, was always hard for Ali. But it got infinitely harder when one day in 2013, the police randomly picked him up from the streets of Guwahati, fingerprinted him and asked for proof of citizenship.
