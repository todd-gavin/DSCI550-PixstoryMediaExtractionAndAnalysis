I believe cancel culture is the notion that people should be diregarded or shunned because they hold opinions or behave in ways that others find objectionable which does not sit well with me People isolate other people over disagreements The craziest part about this is that if you offended them it s not just them who d stop talking to you They want everyone to do that Cancel culture has become a manipulative tool to make people follow cultish beliefs and never question them otherwise you d be cancelled The majority of people who engage in cancel culture do so because they watch others doing so It is a simple affordable method of risk free virtue signalling Following the crowd does not take guts Cancel culture is a new way to directly attack on the free speech rights of this country It feeds on fear Anyone who wants to challenge the idea of the crowd are put on a leash otherwise they d be cancelled The most affected group here that becomes the victim of cancel culture is anyone who doesn t agree to the leftist propaganda Anyone who doesn t agree to them is somehow not worthy of living in the society Cancel culture is the violation of our rights through fearsome tactics
