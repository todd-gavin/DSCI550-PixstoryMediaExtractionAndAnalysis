Seriously This sounds like you re planning riots not protests If you are not planning on doing anything illegal then why do you want to stay hidden Why won t you sign up for a protest that s literally there for you If you re having to hide your face maybe there s something that s bugging your conscience You want to do that because violence and crime will be committed It s pretty obvious what you all plan on doing if you were exercising your st amendment rights you wouldn t need to do all that I can t believe this is how the new generation protests You all seemed to be really mad at the Jan Capitol building riots because they were violent but it s okay when you do it The left is just a bunch of hypocrites after all
