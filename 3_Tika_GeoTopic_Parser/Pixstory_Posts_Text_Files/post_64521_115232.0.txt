Raja - the tiger from SKB rescue center in West Bengal, died today around 3 AM at the age of 25 years and 10 months while he was the second oldest tiger in the world and oldest in the country.

Locals and officials paid tribute to his body while messages poured in on across Social Media platforms for the royal bengal tiger.

"He was one of the oldest tigers in India, and was brought to the Khairabari Leopard Rescue Centre at Jaldapara in north Bengal in August 2008," said Deepak M, divisional forest officer of Jaldapara.

Normally, tigers live up to 16 years in the wild and up to 28-30 years in captivity, according to data publicly available.

Raja was brought to the rescue centre in north Bengal after a crocodile partially bit off its right hind leg. The incident took place in the Sunderbans, the largest mangrove delta in the world, and home to the famous Royal Bengal Tiger species.

"It was almost 11 years old when it was bought to the South Khairbari rescue center, and there it survived for another 15 years, making it one of the oldest surviving tigers in the country," tweeted SK Meena, district magistrate of Alipurduar.

RIP Raja üêÖ
