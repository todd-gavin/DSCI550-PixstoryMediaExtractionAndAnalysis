Hazara Girls
By the term, Hazara Girl, I don't mean merely girls coming from Hazara ethnic group. But in the past twenty years in Afghanistan if you saw a girl fighting for her rights, embodying a dignified free citizen in public spaces, at universities, civil gathering, workshops, etc. there was an 80% probability that that girl was coming from Hazara ethnicity. So, Hazara Girl means, a  passionate girl struggling for liberty, for education and for life with dignity  in an extremely difficult circumstance in Afghanistan. 
So if you are a girl enjoying freedom and going to school, just remember you sister in Afghanistan. How it feels like to be imprisoned in your own home and not allowed to go to school because you are a girl?
How it feels like to be sold out to a man much older than you against your will because you are a girl? 
How it feels like, in twenty first century, to be deprived of most of your rights because you are a girl? 
Hazara Girl was the girl who stood against these injustices when they could, however they were tortured, labeled, rediculed and even killed. 
Actually the name Hazara Girl become significant to me a few year back . Hazara Girls were the most enthusiastic and passionate for learning anything that help their personal growth, thinking power and personal-social-psychological skills. 
Last year, the attack on a girls school in Kabul, was actually an strategically well-thought attack against Hazara Girl, since she was representing the fight agains the grave injustices against women in Afghanistan. Hazara Girl was questioning the ceturies-old cultur and religious dogma for imprisoning women and enslaving them as second degree humans. 

Go girls! Don't forget those years if you are now in better place to learn and grow. 

Note
I do not know who the photo is, not necessarily a thousand girls, the Hazara girls were exactly like this photo and with the power of their cries forced to send them to school.
