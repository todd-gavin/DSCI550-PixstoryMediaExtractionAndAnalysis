Alexia Putellas has won the 2021/22 UEFA Women's Player of the Year award.
The Barcelona and Spain forward finished ahead of Beth Mead and Alex Popp in the voting, becoming the first player to claim the award two years running and joining Pernille Harder as a multiple winner. 
The result was announced during the 2022/23 men's UEFA Champions League draw ceremony in Istanbul.
Alexia said: "I feel very happy to win this award for the second consecutive year, especially right at this moment. Unfortunately I'm not able to do what I love doing most [due to long-term injury], so being here again motivates me. The coming year will be a tough one for me but I want to get back to playing and training and to be able to do my job, which is what I like doing most. I'm working towards that with my recovery every day".
