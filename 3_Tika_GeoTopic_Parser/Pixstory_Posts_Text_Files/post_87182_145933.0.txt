He was a United fan who rose to prominence through his performances and was named United player of the year in 2012 and appeared in 464 games for the club, winning five titles and the Champions League.

Keane played 480 times for United and was one of the deadliest midfielders United ever gained from Nottingham Forest. He had 51 goals, demonstrating that he could score goals in addition to being a midfielder. His devotion to the club made him captain, and the player embodied United,playing every game as if he were going to war, with his heart on his sleeve.
During his time at the club, the Irishman won the Premier League seven times, including three times in a row, as well as the Champions League once.
