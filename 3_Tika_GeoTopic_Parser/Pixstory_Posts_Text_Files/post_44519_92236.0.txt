Carlo Ancelotti has passed a coronavirus test and will go to London on Wednesday evening for Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Chelsea.

Last week, Ancelotti tested positive for Covid-19 and was not on the bench when Los Blancos defeated Celta Vigo 2-1 on Saturday, with son and assistant manager Davide filling in. The Real Madrid coach did not go to the capital with the rest of the team on Tuesday, opting to test himself in the morning in the hopes of being allowed to rejoin his players a day later. Since then, the club has confirmed that the Italian would be present at Stamford Bridge.

"Real Madrid C.F. is pleased to announce that our coach Carlo Ancelotti has returned a negative result for COVID-19, and will therefore travel to London this morning to join up with the first team," their statement read.

Real are in good shape ahead of the crucial match, with only Luka Jovic and Eden Hazard missing out – both of whom were unlikely to play anyway. The match is a rematch of last season's semi-finals, in which Chelsea won 3-1 on aggregate before defeating Manchester City in the final.
Clément Turpin will be in charge of the opening leg encounter between Real Madrid and Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals at Stamford Bridge (Wednesday, 9pm CET). For the fourth time in this competition, the Frenchman will officiate our team.

The first time came against Ludogorest in the 2014/15 Group Stage, which Real Madrid won 4-0. The second came in the 2018/19 Group Stage, when the Whites defeated Roma 2-0 away from home. The last time was in a match against Inter Milan at the Alfredo Di Stéfano in the 2020/21 Group Stage, which Real Madrid won 3-2.
