It seems like every day there’s a new plant-based milk promising to be the creamiest, dreamiest, dairy-free alternative for your coffee or cereal. Just this week, potato milk, the newest member of the plant-based milk family, has exploded all over the internet. But, we have some questions. Mainly: what is potato milk? And is it healthy? 

📍Potato milk is the newest plant-based milk option to hit the market.
📍You can make your own potato milk with a simple recipe or find it in supermarkets across the United Kingdom.
📍Dietitians say it’s similar nutritionally to other plant-based milk alternatives.

For now, the DUG website describes potato milk as “deliciously creamy, makes perfect foam in coffee, works just like any other milk, and just so happens to be the most sustainable alternative on the market.”

Some homemade versions, like this one from the blog The Green Creator, say to blend boiled, peeled potatoes with water and flavorings (like maple syrup and vanilla), straining the liquid, and using the remaining liquid as potato milk. But DIY-ing the plant-based milk leaves some holes nutritionally, according to experts.

The nutritional value of homemade potato milk will depend on the flavorings you add, like any sugars, says Keri Gans, R.D.N., nutritionist, author of The Small Change Diet, and host of The Keri Report podcast. But, for 100 ML (about a half cup) of unsweetened DUG potato milk:

The DUG website boasts potatoes carry a ton of antioxidants—so much so it’s comparable to blueberries and blackberries. Additionally, they claim potatoes carry protein, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and carbohydrates, including ⅓ of your daily requirements of vitamin C in 100 grams of potatoes.
