Former Indian cricketer Arun Lal  has credited star batter and former captain Virat Kohli  for making Indian cricket team a force to reckon with in the traditional format of the game. The 66-year-old was full of praise for Virat’s leadership in the Test  matches and said that the 33-year-old changed the mindset of the team and made them play for a win without the fear of losing.
Kohli took over the leadership role in Test matches from MS Dhoni during India ’s tour of Australia in 2014–15 and remained at the helm till the end of the South Africa series earlier this year. Under his leadership, India won Test series twice in Australia and maintained a very handsome record in Indian conditions. Virat ended his tenure as India’s most successful Test captain and won 40 out of the 68 Test matches.
