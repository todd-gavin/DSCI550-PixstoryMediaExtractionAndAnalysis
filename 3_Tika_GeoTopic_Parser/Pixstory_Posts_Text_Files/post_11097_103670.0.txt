Though we say some relations are unique! Beyond expectations!,Does it really happen ?

 
If someone says he or she has no expectation from anybody for me he or she is a great snob. We are human not Saint.We are normal human! We feel. We Love. We Care.

Don’t we all expect something from all relationship? Yes, we do…

Only too much expectations and it’s over reactions bring pain.When this expectations aren’t fulfilled, it creates a sense of unhappiness in relationship.

The more you assume, define and analyse the more expectations you create.We assume that good friendships mean lack of conflict or a good marriage means blind faith or good parenting means having all the solutions for our children’s problems.
