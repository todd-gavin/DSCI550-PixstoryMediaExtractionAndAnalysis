Fascinating life story of renowned criminal lawyer Ramesh Gupta. Here is part two…..

After 2 months, a new announcement came that anyone who received a compartment in two subjects, wouldn’t be admitted to the university and just how easily I got admitted, my admission was revoked. 

I had no other option, nor could I sit idly so I started taking typing classes. Time passed and I was appointed as a storekeeper at the British High Commission for 2 months. I don’t remember how much I earn but after some time, due to family sources, I got a job in the Flour Mill Association as a clerk. 

A year passed and in 1966, I finally got admitted to Motilal Nehru College. 

In the second year of my graduation, I took the NDC exam, UPSC. My results came in January 1969 and I passed the exam. I was asked to join the Home Ministry and on April 18, 1969, I joined the Home Ministry under the AD1B section.

I worked in the administration section for the following years. However, according to the rules of the ministry, after completing five years, we would have to apply for the post of Junior Reception Officer which was a UBC post. So I suggested to my supervisor, Mr. Dumeer, that for the graduates the minimum time limit to apply for the post of JRO could be three years and for a 12th pass student, it could be five years. He sent the proposal which got accepted and I became the JRO. 

Life works in mysterious ways. After becoming the JRO, I was posted to the planning commission building in Mayur Vihar. I worked there for two years but soon resigned and started practicing law. 

In those two years, a lot happened. I graduated in 1969 with 47 percent marks. At that time the minimum marks required to sit for the exams of LLB was 45 percent. Yet people weren’t accepted until they secured around 55 percent marks.
