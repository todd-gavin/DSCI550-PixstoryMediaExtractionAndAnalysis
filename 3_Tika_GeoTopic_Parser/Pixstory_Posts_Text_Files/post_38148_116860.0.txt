Robert Lewandowski has completed his move to Barcelona. Hence this leaves a massive gap in Bayern Munich's attack line. Owing to this, the Bavarians are expected to make a major scoop this summer in order to sustain themselves and win their 11th Bundesliga title in a row. Here are three strikers that can help the club in doing so...


1) Cristiano Ronaldo 

The 37-year-old is in the last stage of his career. However, Ronaldo is still going strong and would certainly be a good fit for the Bayern squad. CR7 certainly has the pace and hunger to play for the Bavarians upfront. Hence a two-year deal for the striker could certainly work wonders for Bayern. 



2) Roberto Firmino 

With the signing of Darwin Nunez, Roberto Firmino could face a challenge to break into Liverpool XI. Hence the Brazilian could be open to a return to Germany because this is a World Cup year. This would certainly be a huge plus for Sadio Mane as well. 


3) Harry Kane 

The English striker is reportedly being rumoured to be the successor of Lewandowski at Bayern. However, it looks unlikely that Kane would want to leave the Spurs at least this season. Hence, if a deal is made, Bayern Munich could have to wait at least for a season to sign Kane.
