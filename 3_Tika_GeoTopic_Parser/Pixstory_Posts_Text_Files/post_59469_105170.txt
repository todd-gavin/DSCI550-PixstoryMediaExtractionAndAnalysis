If you feel tired lazy and unmotivated or don t feel any excitement in your life or if you are feeling down You need to understand that it is okay to have a bad day cause sometimes things don t work out and nothing feels good anymore You need to understand that it is ok to have a break You don t have to exhaust yourself in the process of becoming the best So next time you feel this way remember to make yourself a cup of coffee or tea and be there for yourself cause your mind needs you too So don t think about anyone but yourself it s ok to be a lil selfish for your own peace and try to figure out why are you feeling this way Life s too short and it will be worthless if you don t get to meet the real you
