Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu is the tragic hero of this election. First,everyone in Punjab Congress used his shoulder to fire at Captain Amarinder Singh and when captain was removed, Sidhu too was dumped by his supporters and Charanjit Singh Channi was declared the CM by the party. Now if field reports are to be believed he has been cornered by arch-rival Bikram Majithia of Akali Dal in his Amritsar East constituency.  If he loses the election, knives will be out for Sidhu in Punjab Congress as allegations are being leveled against him that he undermined CM Channi on many occasions. 

While many refer to him as a political outlaw, Sidhu claims that he has simply done what he believed was right. Lets see if his 'right' brings right electoral results for him too!
