A Karnataka government ban on all students from wearing a hijab to recent 10th standard exams—even in those colleges where headscarves were allowed and those where students had no uniform—was against the tenets of a 15 March 2022 High Court judgement because it was limited to those government colleges where a uniform is required by school committees. The widened ban, said legal experts, makes the government’s original undefined grounds of ‘public order’ even harder to justify.
Lucknow: On 27 March 2022, when the education minister of Karnataka, referring to a recent high court verdict, said female Muslim students would not be allowed to wear a hijab while appearing for the state board (SSLC) examination a day later, his government’s action went against the judgement itself, his own government’s previous order and settled principles of law.
That is because the high court order was limited to colleges where uniforms are regulated by college councils called college development committees—it was never meant to be widened to all colleges; many colleges require no uniforms, so the court order was irrelevant to them; and the ban was limited to students, not to teachers (one of whom was removed as an invigilator for wearing a hijab)
On 15 March 2022, the Karnataka High Court upheld a government ban on the wearing of headscarves or hijab by female Muslim students in classrooms where uniform was required by school committees and said wearing a hijab was not an essential part of the Islamic faith.

We analyse how the Karnataka government has misinterpreted the high court order, which has in any case been widely criticised (here, here, here and here) and challenged in the Supreme Court
