Amidst the rise in technology and the world moving too fast with new findings in the metaverse and other tech fields, a part requires the most attention.

During a recent investigation, it was found that children using metaverse are surrounded by a lot of horror and misconduct.
A 13 year- old girl in a virtual reality app was exposed to sexual content, rape threats and other profanity. VRChat is an interactive platform where people can speak to different avatars ( characters in the app).


This investigation has led to warnings from child safety charities, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), about children's dangers in the metaverse. The metaverse refers to a network of VR worlds that Meta (formerly Facebook) has positioned as a future version of the internet, eventually allowing us to engage across education, work and social contexts.

The question arises of how safe is children in this tech-friendly world. If this space can't safeguard children's safety in this online world, it is a fiasco.
Technology companies need to make these spaces more preventive and shielded for the children.

Many companies have claimed that these platforms also provide a section where one can report any abuse or assault that seems inappropriate to anyone. But children who are unaware of these tools need someone to guide them, which can be done by some elder in the family and parents have a crucial role to play here by ensuring what their child is doing with these online spaces and whether the ambience is amicable for them.
