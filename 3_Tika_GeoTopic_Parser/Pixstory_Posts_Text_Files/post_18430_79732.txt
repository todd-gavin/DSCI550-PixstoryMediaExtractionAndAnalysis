The former is not yet of age and has already taken charge of Barca&#39;s midfield; Atletico all through Carrasco Two minutes and Barcelona equalize through Jordi Alba before Araujo who scores at the end of the first half The second half opens in the same way Barcelona&#39;s goal through Dani Alves who gets sent off minutes later Before the red card for c time for the goal by Luis Suarez&#39;s ex who reopens the game But until the result will not change With the three points won, Barcelona surpasses Atletico Madrid in the standings and moves to fourth place and therefore in the Champions League The risk this year that one of the two remain right outside the most important European competition The season is still long
