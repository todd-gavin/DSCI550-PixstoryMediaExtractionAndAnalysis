On Thursday, international indignation over Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensified when US and Ukrainian officials alleged Russian forces killed civilians waiting in line for bread and sheltering in a theatre. US President Joe Biden referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal in remarks the Kremlin described as "unforgivable," despite the Kremlin's insistence that the war in Ukraine was progressing according to plan. 

According to Ukraine's foreign ministry, Russian soldiers dropped a heavy bomb on a theatre in Mariupol, a beleaguered southern port city, trapping numerous civilians and killing an unknown number of people.

Maxar Technologies, a private US firm, released satellite data from March 14 that revealed the word "children" inscribed in huge Russian lettering on the ground outside the red-roofed structure. 

According to Human Rights Watch, the theatre housed at least 500 civilians. More than a thousand individuals, according to the Mariupol city council. “Today, the invaders destroyed the Drama Theatre. A place, where more than a thousand people found refuge. We will never forgive this,” the Mariupol local council said in a Telegram post.

South Morning Post reported that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba blamed Russia for the attack. “Another horrendous war crime in Mariupol. Massive Russian attack on the Drama Theatre where hundreds of innocent civilians were hiding. The building is now fully ruined. Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,” tweeted Kuleba.
