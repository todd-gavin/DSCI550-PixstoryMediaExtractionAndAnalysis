Not an easy moment at Manchester United After their elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Atl tico, the Red Devils have also lost ground in the league in the last few games Bruno Fernandes and his teammates have barely scored points Complicating the race for the place currently occupied by Tottenham and distant lengths with days left in the championship The last misstep arrived yesterday against Everton who beat United at Goodison Park for An important success for the Toffesses in terms of salvation but at the same time a defeat that could be decisive for the Reds Devils in the fight against Champions so much nervousness in the Manchester dressing room starting with Cristiano Ronaldo At the final whistle of the match with Everton annoyed by the knockout and another insufficient performance CR took a fan&#39;s phone and angrily threw him leaving the pitch A few hours later the Portuguese apologized for the bad gesture It is never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments However we must always be respectful and set an example for young people I apologize for the outburst and I would like to invite this fan watching a United match at Old Trafford
