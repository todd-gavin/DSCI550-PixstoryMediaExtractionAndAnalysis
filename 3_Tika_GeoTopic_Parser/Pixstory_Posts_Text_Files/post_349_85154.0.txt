It’s one thing to try and act like a chef and other to be a chef. The only thing that I have in common with my friend Adam is the accidents. Obviously I don’t have any recipes to exchange but a lot of kitchen accidents ! Looks like I can compete with him on that count. 

For Melbourne chef Adam D’Sylva, cooking was always going to be his lifeblood. Growing up in an Italian-Indian household, constantly surrounded by food, it’s no surprise he runs two of Melbourne’s most successful restaurants — Coda and Tonka.

Thanks for wonderful time in Melbourne! See you soon in Pixstory
