We have dreams and goals and we all crave success. In that path we overwork, we stress, we often forget to look after ourselves- then some trauma pops into you and gets hold of you in the form of depression or any other kind of mental illness. You struggle, you try even harder still you find a big hole inside you that you can't explain. What do you do? Prioritize yourself. Give yourself a break! 

You deserve success, you deserve everything but that should not cost your physical and most importantly your mental health. You achieved everything you have but you struggle with untreated mental health issues- you might be able to enjoy what you have-your dreamed. Is this what you want. How about you treat yourself kindly. Take breaks, rejuvenate only to come back stronger than ever. Love yourself so much that your mind doesn't control your opinion about yourself. Slowly in this process, you will realise how strong you have become throughout these years. Trust the process, heal, grow, and take steps according to your convenience as you have to be yourself when you have everything you deserve. 

Good day!
