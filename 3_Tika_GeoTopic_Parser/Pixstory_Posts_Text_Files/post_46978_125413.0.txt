Over the past few weeks, the Indian movie ‘Laal Singh Chaddha’ – remake of a popular 1994 movie ‘Forrest Gump’ – has been hit by boycott calls in India. The hashtag ‘#BoycottLaalSinghChaddha’ trended on Twitter, meant to urge the people to not watch the movie following its actor Aamir Khan's comments on “India's growing intolerance” a few years ago. Similar calls were raised when the trailer of the movie was released in May earlier this year as well.

Former England cricketer Monty Panesar, who has his roots in the Indian state of Punjab, also joined the bandwagon on Thursday as he posted a tweet supporting calls for the movie's boycott.

“Forrest Gump fits in the US Army because the US was recruiting low IQ men to meet requirements for the Vietnam War. This movie is total disgrace to India Armed Forces Indian Army and Sikhs !!Disrespectful. Disgraceful. #BoycottLalSinghChadda,” Panesar wrote, as he attached a picture of the movie's poster
