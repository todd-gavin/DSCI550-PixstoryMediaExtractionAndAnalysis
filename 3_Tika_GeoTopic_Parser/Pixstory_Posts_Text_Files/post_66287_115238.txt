My name is Dattatraya Das I am years old and I like music literature and football Like other people I have numerous obstacles in life but I do my best to overcome them The old me is demure innocent always asking for my parent s help and following their advice My father is an office worker whereas my mother is a housewife We live in a flat As I am the sole one so everyone loves me a lot they take care of my every little requirement I generally like stepping out of the hustle and bustle of the world and being by oneself for moments in time When people are alone there is more flexibility for relaxation and freeing of the mind Throughout high school I was quite a socialite Through my student leadership class and holding class offices I would be put in charge of planning school events such as community service projects dances pep rallies and so much more In college too I socialise a lot even though I am a very introverted person at heart It s great to meet new people and understand their worldviews ideas and interests It is good to think about the future therefore I always think about my future as I live in a joint family so there are a lot of people from whom I get different advice My ambition in life is to be a Civil Servant This ambition helps me to set my goals in life and gives me the support motivation and determination that helps us to accomplish it Another aspect of mine is that making decisions is hard for me I generally think over and over again to avoid consequences I hope I can be a good and upright individual and fulfil my dreams
