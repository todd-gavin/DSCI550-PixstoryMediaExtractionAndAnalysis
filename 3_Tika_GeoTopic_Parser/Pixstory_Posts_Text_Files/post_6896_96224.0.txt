Trans environmental activist Precious Brady-Davis is running for Chicago’s Metropolitan Water Reclamation District to protect water supply in Greater Chicago, and everyone's right to healthy water.

Brady-Davis’ roots can be traced to the Nebraska housing project, followed by foster care, living with her grandfather and becoming prominent in the local drag scene after attending Columbia College, and mentored unhoused transgender youth in her job at the Halsted LGBTQ community center. 

“I would like to use my voice on a bigger stage, to create change.. This is the city that I love, this is the city that raised me, and I think that I have a political future,” Brady-Davis told Chicago Tribune.

As the Associate Regional Communications Director for environmental organization Sierra Club, Brady-Davis has been moved to take action in response to fossil fuel pollution. 

“In particular, communities of color are most impacted by this pollution. My whole career has been rooted in advancing equity and justice issues,” she told LGBTQ Nation.

Brady-Davis’ advocacy has been boundless throughout: she led Illinois to remove birth-certificate related barriers, to more accurately mention the gender of trans parents on their child’s documents.

Brady-Davis’s forthcoming memoir, ‘I Have Always Been Me’ reflects on a childhood of neglect, instability, and abandonment: https://www.amazon.com/Have-Always-Been-Me-Memoir/dp/1542044308/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=I%20have%20always%20been%20me&qid=1611851492&sr=8-1
