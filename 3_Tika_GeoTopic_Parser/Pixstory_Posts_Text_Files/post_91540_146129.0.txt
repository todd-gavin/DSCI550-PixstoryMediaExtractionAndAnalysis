 Once, someone randomly asked me to introduce myself. Trust me! I never felt so short of words in my life. I could not believe that such simple question could make me feel so handicapped.
Whenever I look back at the incident, one thing I clearly understood is that knowing oneself is not an easy task as it might seem to us. With each and every passing day in our life, we learn and unlearn a bit about ourselves.
 For what I knew about myself so far that I am self motivated and passionate person who devotes all of the efforts at one task and always look forward for the next task at hand. The gratification that comes after drives me to the most.
If I talk about my hobbies, i like to spend my free time listeningÂ  music as it rejuvenates and unburdens me.
