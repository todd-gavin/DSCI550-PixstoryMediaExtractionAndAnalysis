Lokesh Kanagaraj is the new sensation in Kollywood Multi starrer blockbuster Vikaram the fourth one in the Logesh Cinematic Universe has earned the director big volumes of appreciation from across the world Logesh s inclination to Matin Scorsese is known and never hidden in his action thrillers When I saw the catchy trailer of Vikram in a theatre here I was drawn to Kamal The veteran actor who appeared on screen after a gap was so enthusiastic and handsome at A wholesome presence in Vikram how admirably he accommodates the brilliance of co stars Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupathi who share equal or more screen time A distinct narrative That makes Vikram engaging and entertaining never an easy job for a hr action thriller with immense bloodshed Script envelops a good story It has sentiments It has love It has an ideology It connects Kaithi Logesh s third movie Beautifully layered and packed Nothing bulges out First half was on track Movie turns a bit superhuman in the other half All kudos to the stunt directors Anbariv masters They use all dark corridors and passages to execute actions instant and effective I would say these sequences combine stunts from the old and now giving the audience no pauses to nail them out Equally impressive is Girish Gangadharan s camera which hardly rests Anirudh s music keeps us glued to the scenes Fahadh steals the show His darting eyes and commanding body language blend into the character flawlessly How subtle and loud he is The guy has covered quite a distance in Indian Cinema and the track is damn clear ahead I am not so impressed with Sethupathi He acted a psycho don but didn t get the potential of a big character penned for him I see performance lags in all of his recent movies Kalidas and Narain were notable in their stints Back to Kamal Watching the chic actions and unique dialogs from this mesmerizing man I failed to distinguish who is young and who is old in Vikram And somebody comes with a bang to hijack the whole movie in the end Rolex
