The Republican party is widely anticipated to win back at least one chamber of Congress in the mid term elections later this year The problems exist as the leader of the the party is not sure what they want or would do post elections Many have kept the agendas and the details particularly vague hoping this would pave the path to their success because hence the information has less chance to leak so that Democrats might not jeopardise it But is convenient for the citizens According to polls a majority of Americans plan to vote for Republican congressional candidates they only need to flip a handful of seats to take control Normally they have two ways uniting against a president who has been there monotonously for years or an agenda that gets the conservative blood pumping This year Republicans are focusing their messaging on disappointment with President Joe Biden and the Democrats rather than advancing a particular governing agenda Among Republicans the crests between the party s big business corporate interests the Christian evangelicals and the white working class voters who herded to Mr Trump s America First rhetoric have been calmed over but still run deep The agenda they have put forward is regressive which includes barring transgender athletes from competing against women rescinding China s preferred trade status with the US closer regulation of social media companies and making Trump era corporate tax cuts permanent moreover some agendas by republicans like banning abortion and requiring students to say the US pledge of allegiance at school has already been excoriated by Democrats and accelerated a dispute within the Republican party Now republicans are only focusing to defeat Democrats and nothing more If they gain power too these regressive laws might be promoted and yes voters will be eager to bring them down
