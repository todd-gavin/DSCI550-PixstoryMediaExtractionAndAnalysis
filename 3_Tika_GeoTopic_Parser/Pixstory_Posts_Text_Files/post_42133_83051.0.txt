I feel that the whole point of metaverse is introducing us to a new digital world. A new digital reality which may soon become the new normal. I feel that this is a good approach since technology will only develop further in the future and its better to use it to our advantage in every way possible. Even though this would simplify many things like actually meeting people digitally and buying and selling of digital items but at the same time this can increase the physical connect needed for people to remain in touch with each other. We may be moving towards  more robotic connections.
