The trailer of the much-anticipated movie, Brahmāstra, was dropped on 15th June. Upon the release of trailer, the reactions were highly positive with visual effects comparable to those of Hollywood movies.
Brahmāstra in itself is an adventure-fantasy movie. Although references from the Indian mythology such as the Brahmāstra, an ancient weapon capable of destroying the universe, are taken. As Brahmāstra is a 3-part series, with Part One: Shive all set to be released on 9th September this year, we look at whether Brahmāstra movie is based on a remake of Shiva trilogy book.

Brahmāstra is based on which book?

The concept of Brahmāstra movie is simple. A reference from ancient times is taken and it has been adapted to the modern world. As Shiva Trilogy also comprises 3 books, references are drawn if Brahmāstra is actually based on the Shiva trilogy. 

Brahmāstra trilogy is not based on Shiva trilogy or any other book. The story and screenplay have been written by Ayan Mukherji who has been working on Brahmāstra project for more than a decade now.

Even if Brahmāstra movie is not based on the Shiva trilogy, there may be a chance that books and movie share some things in common. The similarities can only be known once the movie is released. A glimpse of the trailer suggests there is no reference to Amish Tripathi’s Shiva trilogy. It can only be known once the movie has been released in theatres.

The only thing common between Brahmāstra movie and the Shiva trilogy book is that except for mythology, weapons, and mythological characters, everything is fictional.
