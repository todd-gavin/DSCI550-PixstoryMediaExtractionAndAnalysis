Jurgen Klopp transformed Liverpool from a midtable team to European and Premier League big boys once again. This is exactly what Manchester United need as well. But can they find them? 

Manchester United News: Should United have trusted David Moyes?

When Sir Alex Ferguson retired from the club in 2013, he handpicked David Moyes to become his successor. Moyes had previously worked with Everton and he had done a respectable job at the club. 

But the 2013/14 season did not go as expected for David Moyes. The defending champions finished 7th in the Premier League as they lost a whopping 12 games in the competition. 

The lack of form along with the pressure from the fans and media would turn fatal for David Moyes. The Scotsman was relieved of his duties in April 2014, just months after he became the manager. 

But was it too soon? Should David Moyes have been given more time? I would say yes! The Scotsman currently manages West Ham United. And he has transformed the club since joining there. 

The Hammers were relegated from the Premier League just over a decade ago. But they are currently competing to qualify for Europe in the Premier League. To add to this, they are also one of the favourites in this season's Europa League.



Who can be United's very own Klopp?

As per reports, Manchester United are currently trying to secure Mauricio Pochettino as their next manager. The Argentine does have the pedigree of managing top clubs. But is he the one? 

Pochettino's greatest achievement was taking his Tottenham Hotspur side to the Champions League final in 2019. But the Argentine has not had the best of campaigns with PSG. 

Erik Ten Hag is another option that United are said to be considering. The Dutchman has been managing Ajax and even led the side to a Champions League semi-finals. We feel that Ten Hag could be a better choice than if he is brought it at United next season.
