The largest attendance at either a men's or women's European Championship match was reached on Sunday with 87,192 people watching England VS Germany in the Euro 2022 championship game at Wembley.

Comparing this year's competition in England to the last women's European Championship five years ago, attendance has more than doubled.

The Lionesses 1-0 victory over Austria to kick off the competition in front of 69,000 spectators at Old Trafford broke the previous mark of 41,000.

The 1964 final between Spain and the Soviet Union had the most spectators ever with 79,115, setting a record for men's European Championship games.
