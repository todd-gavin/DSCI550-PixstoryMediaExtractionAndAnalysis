We'll learn more of how Sarawat persuaded Tine, from feigned to direct, up until Sarawat could be with the one he had pined after for years, while Tine was just discovering this connection. We'll look into their future-lives after they've both begun their first long-term relationship. Finally, we will see the lives of the other couples as they continue to love and care for each other.
