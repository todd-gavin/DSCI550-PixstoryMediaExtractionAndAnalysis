1999 â€§ Drama/Thriller

Unhappy with his capitalistic lifestyle, a white-collared insomniac forms an underground fight club with Tyler, a careless soap salesman. Soon, their venture spirals down into something sinister.

The movie story is about a depressed man (Edward Norton) who is suffering from insomnia and meets a strange soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and soon finds himself living in his squalid house after his perfect apartment is destroyed. The two bored men form an underground club with strict rules and fight other men who are fed up with their mundane lives. Their perfect partnership frays when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a fellow support group crasher, attracts Tyler's attention.

Fight Club is an extraordinary, beatific film about consumerism, violence, greed, mental health, sex, and material obsession, this on its own makes the movie incomprehensible for younger audiences. 

The plot twists in the movie are mind-blowing and is a must-watch!
