Will – my heart says I will but mind finds ways to counter
“Will I not” is my fear that I need to encounter
I oscillate between my heart and my mind
My fear of losing perspective and my grit to find

Where there is a will there is way, 
Is what I have heard them always say
But I dread the anxiety innate, of losing face,
Of losing my image, my esteem, my identity, my place

“What if” is the big question that make me pause,
Overthink my options and explore the endless odds
I resolute to focus on the positives and look at the brighter side
Only to fall in the same trap again and nosedive

Will I do it all over again or Won’t I
I can only promise that I will try
Try to be more intent, try to be more motivated
It is my WILL and I must impel it to be undaunted.
