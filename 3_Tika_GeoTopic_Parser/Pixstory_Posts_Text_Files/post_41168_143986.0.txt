The first group of English-speaking Pilgrims' arrival in America would not have had the same effects on American history. They undoubtedly had no idea what was ahead of them when they boarded the Mayflower for the New World, and they certainly had no notion how their decisions would affect the course of human history. Mayflower Day is a holiday held in what is now the United States to commemorate the Mayflower ship, one of the first ships to reach the New World. The Mayflower brought the first Pilgrim or Puritan settlers to America, first to the settlement of Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts and then to Cape Cod. Three of the 102 passengers on board the ship's 30 staff members were pregnant.Mayflower Day was founded to commemorate and celebrate the important event that launched the first community of Europeans to live in the New World in what is now the United States of America.Source: DOY
