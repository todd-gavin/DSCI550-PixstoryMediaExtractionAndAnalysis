For me, as a celiac, moving in some areas of the world and eating as expected for my health is quite difficult. Here in Montenegro, in addition to there being an objective problem with the language, which makes it difficult to make people understand the problem, it seems that some types of diet are not contemplate yourself I had brought some supplies of gluten-free food with me but I ran out of them and now I have trouble orienting myself This morning I scoured the largest supermarket in town to find only and exclusively these gluten-free rice cakes not a biscuit not a variety of cereals for breakfast I wonder one thing maybe not a widespread disease here Another thing I haven&#39;t seen a trace of legumes either in restaurants or mini-markets yet the contamination with Mediterranean cuisines that make extensive use of them here is very noticeable Everything a bit strange Maybe we are here much more subject to intolerances and allergies it would be interesting to understand more. If you are an expert on the subject, write me in the comments
