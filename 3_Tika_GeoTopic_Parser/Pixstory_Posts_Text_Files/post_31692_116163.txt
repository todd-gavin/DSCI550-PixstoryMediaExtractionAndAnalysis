The battle of Colle dell&#39;Assietta in July followed a very long series of skirmishes between the French and the Piedmontese. In the days preceding the battle, the Piedmontese placed a series of entrenchments on the Assietta plain visible from the buttress between Colle del Sestriere and the Testa del Gran Serin that divides the Val Chisone from the Valle di Susa The Piedmontese entrusted the command to the lieutenant general Giovanni Cacherano count of Bricherasio who, in addition to the regular Piedmontese troops, could count on the contribution of the Waldensian militias of the Pinerolese and upper Val Chisone while four Austrian battalions led by General Colloredo arrived last to reinforce the positions The Piedmontese positions were arranged in a semicircle on a narrow ridge and leaned against the Testa dell&#39;Assietta and the Testa del Gran Serin The assault by the French was long and ruthless but thanks to the heroic Grenadier Company of the Guards battalion then reinforced by the Grenadier Company of the Casale provincial regiment the enemies were stopped The French, after having replaced the fighters on the front line with fresh troops, continued the assault but the Piedmontese grenadiers, even if they were out of ammunition, attacked them making a massacre At sunset the French army was already exhausted he retired from the battlefield leaving behind official soldiers including two generals five brigadiers and nine colonels while the Piedmontese lost only seven officers and soldiers and the Austrians two officers and soldiers
