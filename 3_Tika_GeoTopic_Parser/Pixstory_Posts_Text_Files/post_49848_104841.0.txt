‌ The parents of a 10-year-old victim in the mass shooting in Uvalde, and a staff member at Robb Elementary School are on the way to moving towards legal action against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used by the gunman.

Gunmaker Daniel Defense was under scrutiny for days and the company has only published a statement conveying “our thoughts and our prayers” for the victims.

 Alfred Garza III and Kimberly Garcia — the parents of Amerie Jo Garza, a student killed in the shooting had sent a letter to Daniel Defense insisting on information about its lobbying of guns to teens and children. Georgia-based company’s marketing to teens and children, according to their attorneys. 

“My purpose for being now is to honour Amerie Jo’s memory,” Garza said in a news release. “She would want me to do everything I can so this will never happen again to any other child.”

A lawsuit has not been filed, but the letter is among the first indications that a trial could be expected for the Uvalde Shooting.

The grief of the couple is incomparable. Through her attorney, Marin refused to talk directly about her experience or the suit. Flanary says she has been receiving medical treatment for her psychological trauma.

"We're realistic about our path forward," Flanary says. At the same time, he adds, "Things are changing and we have to put the pressure on."
