Manchester United legend and current DC United coach Wayne Rooney has had his say on the Ronaldo transfer saga The Englishman wants the Red Devils to let the Portuguese superstar leave as he wants Ten Hag to establish a clear playing style As per the Times of India Wayne Rooney said I think United should let Cristiano Ronaldo go It s not that Ronaldo can t play in a Ten Hag team He can play in any team Ronny will always score you goals But my personal view is that United aren t ready to challenge for the title now so the aim has to be to build a team that can win the league in the next three to four years and you have to plan for that Cristiano Ronaldo started on the bench vs Brighton on Sunday The Portuguese superstar did come on but he could not have a say in the game as the Red Devils lost to the Seagulls on Matchday of the Premier League season The loss was not received well by the United fans and the Old Trafford stadium was drowned in a chorus of boos at the full time whistle Manchester United next face Brentford on th August and it has to be seen if they can turn their fortunes around when they travel for the away game next Saturday
