The principal fortifications now existing are at Raja ghat and Kathautiya as the narrow neck joining Rohtas to the table land is called The latter was the most vulnerable part of the fortress and the Hindus are said to have cut a moat across it as a defence against invasion Man Singh still further strengthened the defences in by adding some massive works which are the finest remains of the fortifications still extant These consist of two gates on the northern side of the neck about thirty yards apart with many winding passages and bulwarks attached both they and the ditch are commanded by a double line of ramparts and bastions which rising along a low hill tower sixty or seventy feet above the moat for a lengthof four hundred yards Further to the north across the plateau ran another line of defences but the only part now standing is a fine gate called the Lal Darwaza from the red stone of which it was built Buchanan visited the Singh Dwar Rohtas Fort on st of December and mentions At Katautea the Hill of Ruedas contracts suddenly by two recesses That to the south is semi circular and of inconsiderable depth but that towards the north comes winding from the Kolurea Kauriari gap and forms a deep glen with exceeding abrupt sides The neck at the narrowest part between the two recesses is not above yards wide but it suddenly enlarges to atleast double that size and that the land there rises into a rugged hill towards the south with a narrow level towards the northern glen which is called Guloriya An irregular rude ditch has been dug across the narrowest part of the neck In this has been left standing a kind of truncated cone flattened at the sides against one of which are two or three steps This my guide a Dangar said was the God which guarded the territory of Ruedas and that it continued to be worshipped by the Koirwar Kharwar as was indeed evident from its being daubed by red lead To be continued
