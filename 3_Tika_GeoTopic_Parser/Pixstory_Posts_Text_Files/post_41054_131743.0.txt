The Hollywood Reporter has reported from numerous sources that a restricted group of insiders will be able to view Batgirl this week during private screenings on the Warner Bros. lot rather than on HBO Max. They are allegedly for those who contributed to the film, including the cast and crew as well as executives and representatives. 

One source referred to them as "funeral screenings," which are held prior to the film being taken to an unspecified afterlife and feature footage that has been stored in a vault—either a physical or digital one—for safekeeping. 

When word spread on August 2 that new Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav had decided to axe the $90 million DC film in order to take a tax, Batgirl quickly became the most talked-about movie in the world. 

David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery, decided to axe the $90 million DC movie so he could deduct it from his taxes. (The newly combined company's CEO is aiming to save $3 billion in costs.)
