The Serbian star was quick to point out how effective his unit was in comparison to theirs.

During Arsenal's Premier League triumph on Saturday, Manchester United player Nemanja Matic was seen pointing with three fingers towards Arsenal fans insulting him.

Mikel Arteta's team put on a strong performance, inflicting additional pain on the Red Devils, who are limping towards the conclusion of the season.

Few title-winning generals remain among United's ranks, with Cristiano Ronaldo, David de Gea, and Phil Jones among those to have won the trophy during their tenure at Old Trafford-but Matic is one of them, as he was sure to remind opposing fans.

Matic was pictured gesturing at himself and raising three fingers to a section of the Arsenal support as he sat on the dugout bench during Saturday's defeat after being replaced near the end by Marcus Rashford.

Following that, the Serbia international made a zero gesture, reflecting Arsenal's recent lack of title victories.

Arsene Wenger led Arsenal to their last Premier League triumph in 2003-04.

Matic's three fingers appear to relate to three Premier League titles won over his career, but he is just a two-time winner of the competition, according to official statistics.

The Serbian only played two games in the Premier League as a youth for Chelsea in 2009–10, totaling less than an hour on the pitch, and thus did not qualify for a winner's medal.

After a second term with the Blues following his time at Benfica, Matic was a crucial member of their 2014–15 and 2016–17 titles, which the Premier League recognises as his two titles.
