Cyberpunk 2077 is going anime, with the CD Projekt Red based game now having its own anime adaptation titled ‘Cyberpunk Edgerunners’, as the game developer teams up with Netflix to throw the viewers into the world of Night City, with new characters and from a new angle. In the trailer we see a futuristic ultra violent, flashy world adorned with bright colours, looking like a mix of both Cyberpunk and Blade Runner. Releasing its opening credit clips a few days ago, things could not go any more Cyberpunk-like, from the design of the credits to its atmosphere, accompanied by Franz Ferdinand's ‘This Fffire’. According to the official synopsis: “Cyberpunk: Edgerunners tells a standalone, 10-episode story about a street kid trying to survive in a technology and body modification-obsessed city of the future. Having everything to lose, he chooses to stay alive by becoming an edgerunner—a mercenary outlaw also known as a cyberpunk.” Cyberpunk: Edgerunners will release September of this fall.
