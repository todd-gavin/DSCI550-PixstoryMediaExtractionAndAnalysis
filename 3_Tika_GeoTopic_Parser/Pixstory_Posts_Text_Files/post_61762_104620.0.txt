The Boston Celtics made a miraculous comeback in the last quarter of the game to take it away from the home team as they hit a staggering NINE three-pointers in the final quarter to not only overturn a 12-point deficit but also to beat the Golden State Warriors 120-108 in Game One of the NBA Finals. 

Stephen Curry was unleashed on the Celtics as he hit a game-high 34 points for the Warriors. 
Warriors were dominating the game at the end of the third quarter as they led 92-80. Smart money was on Warriors to win this one as they had not lost in their nine previous home games in this season's play-offs. 

Unfortunately for the Warriors, their fans, and pundits who had favoured the team, Jaylen Brown led a miraculous comeback as he hit 10 points in the final quarter to spark a Celtics win. 

Two teams will be going head to head again on Sunday in Game Two in the best-of-seven series is which will again be played in San Francisco. 

Warriors coach Steve Kerr did not shy away from praising their playoffs opponents by stating in the post-match interview, that Celtics had a helluva fourth quarter and deserved to win because of that.
