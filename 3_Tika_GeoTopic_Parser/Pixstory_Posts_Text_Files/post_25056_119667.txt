Paul Pogba returned to Juventus this summer after a six year stint with Manchester United His stint with the Red Devils did not quite work out as planned however the Frenchman was looking forward to returning to action with the Italian club However his hopes were dealt an early blow after it was discovered that he suffered a meniscus tear This has cast a cloud of uncertainty in regards to Juventus short term plans for the start of the season Moreover there is a possibility for the Frenchman to even miss the World Cup in Qatar later this year According to Calciomercato it has been reported that Juventus are considering a move for former Chelsea loanee Saul Niguez The Spaniard had a disastrous loan outing at the London club but that takes away nothing from the quality he possesses in the midfield Initially the Atletico Madrid midfielder was offered to AS Roma but the move did not materialise into something substantial Hence Juventus are now eyeing a loan deal for Saul to fill in the void left by Paul Pogba Saul made just appearances for Chelsea last season with the majority of them coming off the bench The Spaniard is among the most reputed midfielders in Europe having as many as appearances for Atletico Madrid in seven years Hence it could be a brilliant idea for Juventus to secure a loan deal for Saul
