A study by the Monzino Cardiological Center and the University of Milan published today in the prestigious Journal of the American College of Cardiology Basic to Translational Science JACC BTS explains for the first time the pathophysiological mechanism that correlates migraine with aura to the congenital heart defect of the patent foramen ovale PFO commonly called hole in the heart, i.e. the lack of complete closure at birth of the communication between the right and left atrium of the heart. the are women and that in these patients the migraine attacks disappear or are significantly reduced after the interventional procedure to close the foramen. However, the mechanism linking PFO and the symptom of migraine with aura has never been clarified. To date, none of the international cardiological guidelines includes migraine with aura among the indications for PFO closure surgery. Yet it is a disabling pathology that in many cases does not respond to drugs and occurs incessantly for days, impeding normal daily life and life planning. In our case studies of success in the treatment of PFO we decided to research the pathophysiological mechanism of connection between the two pathologies to demonstrate at the level of cellular mechanisms how the closure of the foramen can in fact prevent the triggering of migraine crises with aura explains Daniela Trabattoni Head of the Monzino&#39;s Interventional Cardiology Unit and coordinator of the clinical part of the study With the new scientific evidence that we have obtained with LEARNER and with the support of other clinical studies already launched at an international level, we hope to convince neurologists and cardiologists through their respective scientific societies to recommend the percutaneous closure of the PFO in all cases of migraine patients with drug refractory aura In the meantime it is important that these patients know that we have in our hands an effective weapon to say goodbye to their dreaded crises and to protect the brain from risky ischemia conclude the female researchers
