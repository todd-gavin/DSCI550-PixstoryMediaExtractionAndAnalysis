In every summer, the picturesque fields of Sumbal, Aru, Budgam, and Pulwama in the Kashmir Valley covered in the finest lavender flower bloom, which bursts forth in a variety of purple and violet tones. The flowers have been used for ages to make potpourri because of their aromatic nature. Lavender is a perennial bushy shrub that grows 50 to 80 cm tall and has lovely spikey blooms. Women have always utilised this prickly part of the flower as their own personal perfume. The most versatile essential oil ever known to a human race comes from Kashmiri Lavender. This oil harmoniously combines with extracts of cedarwood, pine, clary sage, geranium, and nutmeg. With several benefits such as anti-inflammatory, skin-healing properties help heal burns, bug bites, wounds, bee stings, rashes, acne and skin irritations or infections.
