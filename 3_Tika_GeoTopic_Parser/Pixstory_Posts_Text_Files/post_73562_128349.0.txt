As fashion changes fast, keeping up with the latest fashion trends will help immensely, be that for a Covid-safe dinner date or just a walk in the park. To top it up, replicating the current fashion trends won’t cost you a dime.

1. Hoodies under blazers

One of the most popular styles rocking the current fashion trends is the ever-so cosy hoodie, however, worn with a twist. Regardless, wearing a blazer with a hoodie is no longer just another street style but a transcendent, mainstream look.

Look for a slim, tapered hoody — preferably a darker, solid hue, without too much embroidery or graphics. Pair it with a dark, solid blazer. Slacks or denim is up to you — either will work depending on the occasion.

2. Puff sleeves

However, the puff sleeve trend cracked the fashion veneer in 2018, when ’80s references raved the runway. Fast-forward to 2021, the supersize sleeve is more popular than ever.

With balloon sleeves on sweaters at Fendi, billowing sleeves attached to pleated shirtdresses at McQueen, perfectly puffed gowns at Rodarte, and double-breasted winter coats at JW Anderson.
