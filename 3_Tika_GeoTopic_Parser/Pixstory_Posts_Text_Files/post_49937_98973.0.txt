The nation's economy is worsening and many Americans feel the strain in their daily lives. This attitude is affecting President Joe Biden and pointed out as his failure. According to CNN politics, a majority of US adults say the policies of Biden have hurt the economy, and 8 in 10 say the government isn't doing sufficient to combat inflation.

Although economic dismay is most noticeable within the GOP, it traverses party lines. A near-universal 94% of Republicans rate current economic conditions in the US as poor, as do 81% of independents and 54% of Democrats. And across party lines, most Americans say they've heard little or no recent good news on the issue (88% among Republicans, 80% among independents, 61% among Democrats).

The problem for Biden is that most Americans are much more likely to be concerned with the economy than Ukraine or Covid-19.Â This is forgotten by the democrats or are they ignoring it. Biden's image is getting worse because the effect of inflation is equal and direct to many considering other cases. 

With gas and food prices rising, most Americans say economic conditions have led them to reduce nonessential spending, change their grocery-buying habits and cut back significantly on driving. A third say they've had difficulty finding affordable housing, rising to 42% among those in households making less than $50,000 annually, and 57% among those younger than 35.

CNN polls show that the government must first address inflation rather than anything else. If to interfere in the Russia-Ukraine war let be to stop this impending strain on the citizens of America as this will only help them to win elections. People will forget all the regreesive notions of republicans and will vote for them if inflation isn't dealt right away.
