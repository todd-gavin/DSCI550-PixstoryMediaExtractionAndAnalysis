Ten days from now and we will witness the th Oscars Ceremony As an aspiring filmmaker I am excited to know that who will win the Best Director award This year there are five nominees and I ll give my opinion on who did the job very well and who missed the list Jane Campion Jane Campion directed the movie The Power Of the Dog Jane Campion has the best chance to win the Oscars this year because The Power of the Dog is really amazing The story emotions performance of all the actors are top notch and if the movie is this good then all credit should go to the director Steven Spielberg Steven Spielberg get the Oscar nomination for the movie West Side Story and this movie is a musical drama based in America of the s where Americans and Spanish are fighting for their rights According to me West Side story is a good movie but In the Heights is the better movie who missed the nominations Paul Thomas Anderson The movie directed by Paul Thomas Anderson is Licorice Pizza The story of the movie revolves around the character of Alana and how she and Gary grow up together and fall in love with each other Licorice Pizza is a light hearted yet impactful love story Ryusuke Hamaguchi He directed Drive my Car which is an adaption of Haruki Murakami s books This is a story of a widowed actor who is looking for a new driver and a year old girl becomes his driver Initially there was nothing between but later they develop a relation which is so special Kenneth Branagh Movie directed by Kenneth Branagh is Belfast Belfast is yet another period drama movie that shows a life of a working class family and their son s childhood Performance in the movie is top notch but the story of the movie is not upto the mark One name that I think is missed from this list is Dennis Villeneuve He is the director of the movie Dune and he was the deserving candidate for the nomination
