Verdict


RB Salzburg has been credited with nurturing Haaland, Daka, and currently, Adeyemi. Is the 18-year-old behind them to get plucked by a big club? If rumors are to be true, then Man Utd are looking to add the Slovenian to their forward ranks. He can be one for the future. But he won’t come cheap as the Salzburg club has slapped a 55 million price tag on him. However, United are not alone in scouting him as Newcastle is after this 18-year-old kid. Wherever he goes we can guarantee that he could set the Premier League on fire. With his age on his side, watch him turn to another Haaland or he’ll choose his own path.
