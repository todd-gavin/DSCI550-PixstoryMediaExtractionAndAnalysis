The idea of loving your body and its physical aspects irrespective of all the flaws, shape, size, skin tone or other physical abilities is called body positivity.

Although there's no specific time when this positivity movement began, many research and studies have mentioned it starting from 1969. 
It began with the Fat Rights Movement.

Judgments about one's physical appearance inherently place one on a particular rung of a ladder that rates and values one's desirability, effectively increasing or reducing one's power in society.

The movement aims to challenge unrealistic ideals of physical attractiveness, build a positive body image, and improve self-confidence. A central belief advocated is that beauty is a construct of society and that this construct should not determine one's confidence or self-worth. Instead, individuals are encouraged to love themselves fully while accepting and embracing their physical traits.
