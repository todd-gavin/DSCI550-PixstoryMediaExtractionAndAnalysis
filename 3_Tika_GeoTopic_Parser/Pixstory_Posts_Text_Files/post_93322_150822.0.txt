JK Rowling enraged with MERMAIDS effort to support trans youth 
The 'Harry Potter' author took her Twitter account to display her transphobic views by targeting UK charity organisation MERMAIDS. 
Mermaids provides lifesaving support for transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse young people and their families. 
They mentioned that they have robust security and moderation processes in place to ensure our forums are a safe space for the concerned community, and also they provided information about the medically recognized safety of puberty blockers.
JK Rowling criticised MERMAIDS for their work in providing gender-affirming care, support and advice.
