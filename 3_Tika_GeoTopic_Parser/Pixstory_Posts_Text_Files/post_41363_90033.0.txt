President Joe Biden praised the spirit and determination of Ukrainian refugees in the aftermath of Russia's tragic invasion, hugging mothers and children and promising unwavering Western assistance. 

US News reported that while in Poland's capital, Biden listened closely as children detailed their parents' tragic departure from neighbouring Ukraine. He took up a young girl in a pink coat, smiling heartily, and told her she reminded him of his granddaughters. During a stop to a soccer stadium where refugees go to receive a Polish identification number that allows them access to social services such as health care and schools, the president linked hands with parents and offered them hugs.

Some of the women and children informed Biden that they fled without their husbands and fathers, males of fighting age who were compelled to stay behind to join the resistance against the soldiers deployed into Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin — "a butcher," as Biden put it — more than a month ago.

“What I am always surprised by is the depth and strength of the human spirit,” Biden told reporters after his conversations with the refugees at the stadium, which more recently had served as a field hospital for COVID-19 patients. “Each one of those children said something to the effect of, 'Say a prayer for my dad or grandfather or my brother who is out there fighting.”
