The Bianconeri squad and, specifically, the Bianconeri attack has been enforced. Arkadiusz Milik has signed for the club on loan from Olympique Marseille and from today he is officially a Juventus player.


Born in Tychy, Poland, in 1994, Arek, as we learned about during his first Italian adventure with Napoli, is a striker, who, in addition to having extraordinary physical strength, is skilled in aerial play and is above all very dangerous in the penalty area. Milik is a centre-forward with a real sense of goal. The numbers more than back it up: in his last experience in Ligue 1, Milik made 55 appearances, scoring 30 goals since January 2021, becoming their top scorer in all competitions.

Going back to his beginnings, Arkadiusz began his footballing career in Poland with GÃ³rnik Zabrze, where he made his debut as a starter at 17. In January 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen, before going on to play a season on loan at Augsburg. Then he made the move to the most successful team in the Netherlands, Ajax where in two years he scored 47 goals in 76 games. Important stats that earned him a move to Italy with Napoli where Milik stayed for four seasons, also becoming the all-time Polish goalscorer in Serie A with 38 goals to his name, overtaking his Partenopei teammate, Piotr Zielinski (37) and former Juventus forward, Zbigniew Boniek (31). Milik scored a grand total of 48 goals in his first Italian adventure and during his time in Serie A he was the fifth-highest ranked player with the best minutes-to-goal ratio (with a minimum of 30 goals scored) in the competition, averaging out a one goal every 135 minutes.

Now, Italy is waiting for him again, this time to wear the black and white shirt, our colours, and most important, with the goal of continuing to update his already impressive numbers.

Welcome, Arek!
