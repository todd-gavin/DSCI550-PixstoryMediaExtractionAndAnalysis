Derby County got relegated They were already in free fall when they were deducted points for breaching the League s Profitability and Sustainability P S rules Ex Man United legend and ex Derby player Wayne Rooney was fighting an uphill battle to keep his club afloat Let s dive into the analysis part of it to know that despite players giving their all and fighting a lost battle they were not able to salvage their season We can see that Derby were not amongst the highest goal scorers as mostly Fulham took the cake with the highest number of goals scored It was mostly due to the poor positioning of the players and the inability to get into a good area that could guarantee goals The Rams rank in the th quadrant in the total amount of goals scored and penalty kicks converted Derby had scored a mere goals and spot kicks in the whole competition while Fulham scored goals and they had converted spot kicks putting them at the top of the quadrant Derby had a total of shots taken per out of which were on target Compared to that Fulham had shots taken out of which they were able to convert per Rooney usually plays a high line and tries to control possession in the opposition half leaving older defenders vulnerable but they have proved their doubters wrong in marking and defending against quick forwards The defenders got help from the midfielders in the form of Liam Thompson and Max Bird helping them back with defensive work and helping in quick passing The two midfielders progress play methodically passing quickly but smartly and moving in tandem to make spaces to build through the middle third it is also an important aspect of their game to take on equal responsibility without the ball when they don t have much of it The Rams could muster up a total of passes per game They had through balls per game which is very low and they had key passes per game
