 In the midst of MCU Phase Marvel has planned out is entire future from Phase by presenting a full roadmap for what it calls the Multiverse Saga Much like the Infinity Saga before it there will be three phases that tell an overarching story culminating in a couple of Avengers movies Given the success of the Infinity Saga there is a lot of pressure riding on Marvel s shoulders to repeat its previous success While it may indeed replicate its financial success it seems unlikely that there can be another MCU film which can repeat the quality of its Phase movies We are definitely not going to get another Daredevil or Iron Man again given how stupid MCU has become So far unlike Infinity Saga Phase does not really have an overarching story or theme connecting it to any of the other movies in the franchise So far it all seems like a disjointed mess with pathetic movies and serials that are highly lacklustre in terms of quality ambition and vision Unlike Phase where the post credits scenes helped elevate all the movies from stand alone affairs into a connected whole Phase so far seems to lack any such connectivity Furthermore Disney seems adamant on making the Multiverse Saga content tools for driving some kind of twisted socio political agenda The Infinity Saga took eleven years in the making while its follow up will take little more than four years should the MCU stick to its current release map and with the release of Disney Marvel has been frequently rushing its projects With a roadmap complete Marvel will need more VFX artists than ever before Marvel Studios is known for making its VFX artists work in very poor conditions grinding them to do overtime and providing poor compensation in return With a hectic schedule on the way this is likely to only further demotivate the already tired and unmotivated VFX artists and may even possibly force them to switch jobs Aside from the strained VFX community and rushing of content there is also a growing sense of discontent among the audiences due to the frequency of releases
