What a pass it was from Ramagnoli?!! Splitting the field all the way from defense, reaching the final third at Leao, who just had to take the ball into the box and fire a low shot to open the scoring. One from Raphael Leao and 2 from Olivier Giroud in the first half itself has killed Mauricio Sarri's Lazio in Coppa Italia quarter finals. Even with league top scorer Ciro Immobile, Milinkovic Savic like players in the attack, Lazio could hit the target just one time in the entire match. 


Milan, who is growing stronger with each match, is looking at the Coppa Italia and league title with this kind of performance. On 5th February, they defeated table toppers Inter Milan 2-1, coming from behind, thanks to 2 goals from Giroud again. Unable to say who fills confidence in this team , experienced coach Sam Pioli or experienced and still young at 40 Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

In the semi finals, Milan meet Inter on 2nd March and Juventus play against Fiorentina on 3rd. Milan played 4-2-3-1 with Giroud as lone striker and Brahim Diaz, Junior Messias, Rafael Leao as attacking midfielders. Kessie and Tonali were handling defending midfielder duties but Kessie scored the fourth goal. Leao's goal came in the 24' min, and Giroud hit the target at 41',45+1' minutes. Kessie did the icing on the cake at 79th minute. 


Milan have won Coppa Italia, a tournament which was founded in 1922, 100 years ago, 5 times whereas Inter have won 7 times. Milan last won it in 2003 when Serginho, Shevchenko, Rivaldo, Ambrozzini, Inzaghi scored for Milan in the 2 legged final as Totti scored for Roma in both legs - all great players (4-1, 2-2). 

Inter Milan haven't won it since 2011 and Juventus will be trying to defend the title if they reach the final.
