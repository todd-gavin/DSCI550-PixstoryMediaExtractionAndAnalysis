Annie Ernaux wins the Nobel Prize in Literature, 2022Ernaux, a French writer, won the 2022 Literature Nobel prize. Her most credited books are her memoirs, written in an observational and distant matter. They catalogue time and her past, from the perspective of a working-class French woman- rare in French literary circles. Her most notable work, "The Years" tells the story of one person over 6 decades, using their diaries to power the narrative. Her works focus on the passage of time and how it relates to age, looking at the facts of her life and what's happening around her rather than making judgements on it. Ernaux is a feminist, part of the far left of France, though not Communist. She is among the first to be given a Nobel Literature prize for memoirs, and people are gravitated towards her work for how engaging they are.
