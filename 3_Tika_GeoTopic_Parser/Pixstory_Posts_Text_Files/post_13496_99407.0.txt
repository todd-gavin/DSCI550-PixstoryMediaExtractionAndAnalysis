Taliban has issued a new law which requires women to cover themselves all over, including their faces. Burqa that you see the pictures below, according to Taliban is an ideal Hijab. 
If a woman violates this law, meaning she does not cover her body, head,face, etc. outside her home, her husband's home, or the home of her guardian will be marked, if repeated, those men, husband or guardian, will be given a warning/notice, in third time those men will be imprisoned for three days and in fourth time they will be sent to court. 
That means that according to this law women are not regarded as humans to be the subjects of law, they are addressed as something like pets or something like that, which always have an owner, husband/father/brother/uncle etc. Therefore, the owners are punished if women do wrong based on the said law.
