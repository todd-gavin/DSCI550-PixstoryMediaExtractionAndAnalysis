No matter how beneficial supplements are for our bodies, taking them is never justified.
For most people taking supplements seems easier than having a balanced diet; they can take the pills anytime and anywhere. But unfortunately, by doing this, they forget about the malignant effects of the supplements. 

Supplements can be beneficial for a short period, but they can adversely affect the later part of your life.
The claim these magical pills make for deceiving people and can affect the overall health of the person.
Research has found that depending on supplements for a long time can have adverse effects; it can even lead to causing diseases like cancer.


Taking more than you need costs more and might raise your risk of side effects. For example, too much vitamin A can cause headaches and liver damage, reduce bone strength, and cause congenital disabilities. Excess iron causes nausea and vomiting and may damage the liver and other organs.
Depending on supplements for all your life is not a good idea!!
