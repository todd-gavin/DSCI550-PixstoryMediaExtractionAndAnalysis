 As we honor our fallen heroes we are grateful for the future they made possible for us and rededicate ourselves to seeking enduring peace They gave their lives for our country and they live forever in our hearts forever proud forever honorable and forever American Our memorial to fallen heroes must not be just a day when we pause and pray It must be a daily commitment to act To come together To be worthy of the price that was paid
