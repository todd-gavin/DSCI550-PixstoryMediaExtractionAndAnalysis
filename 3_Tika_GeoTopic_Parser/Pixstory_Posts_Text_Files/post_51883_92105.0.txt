After studying the Climate Risk Index, it can be inferred that Japan, the Philippines and Germany are the most affected places by climate change today. 
The old age people are most vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change and weather extremes. Climate change disproportionately affects poor people in low-income communities and developing countries around the world. Those in poverty have a higher chance of experiencing the ill-effects of climate change due to the increased exposure. Countries with ineffective governments sometimes face the gravest risks from the changing climate, and are usually poorly equipped to find ways to prepare for and prevent environmental threats. This category includes countries such as Nigeria, Haiti, Yemen and UAE. On the other hand, developed nations can allocate their resources in a calculated manner to minimize the ill-effects of climate change. Strategic and well thought of plans can be put in place to be prepared to combat sudden climate fluctuations. Money power can prove to be the most beneficial asset for the rich countries in executing their intentions. Based on the 2022 Climate Change Performance Index, Denmark was ranked as the country with the highest achievement in climate protection, followed by Sweden. With the growing concern, we have seen young environmental activists like Greta Thunberg from Sweden working for this cause at a global level.  Developed and rich nations can provide aid to the poor countries in effectively dealing with the impacts of climate change by providing financial support and educational environmental programs. Special international committees can be set up with this primary objective. Advanced technology can be optimally utilized to detect alterations in the conditions thereby preventing further unwanted circumstances. A little more consciousness and alertness with an appropriate unanimous response is the key to win this battle against climate change.
