Real Madrid’s 21-year-old Brazilian ‘Starboy’ Rodrygo Silva de Goes has announced in a latest
interview that he is indeed signing a new contract with the Los Blancos after their UEFA
Champions League-winning campaign.

Rodrygo might not be a regular starter for Real Madrid, but he played a very crucial role in their
UCL winning campaign of 2021/22. Had it not been for him, the Los Blancos would not have
won their Quarterfinal and Semifinal ties against Chelsea and Manchester City respectively. His
80’ goal against Chelsea in the second leg of the Quarter final and his late brace against
Manchester City in the second leg of the semi-final (90’ and 90+1’) were what ultimately took
them to the final.

“Yes, I’m gonna extend the contract. Real Madrid is my dream” Rodrygo has said to ABC as
confirmed by Fabrizio Romano. Fabrizio added in his tweet that the youngster’s new contract
will keep him at the club until June 2028.

Apart from Rodrygo, the other two Brazilian players of Real Madrid, namely Vinicius Jr and Eder
Militao will also sign new contracts with Madrid (Militao till 2028 and Vinicius till 2027).

However,
among these three, only Rodrygo has confirmed it publicly so far. The release clause for all of
them is set to be €1 Billion.

Real Madrid signed Rodrygo at the young age of 18 from his boyhood club Santos back on 15th
June 2018. The rumoured fee was said to be around €45 Million which was shared between his
agent and Santos. Although he is yet to become a regular starter for Madrid, he has made quite
a name for himself as a Super-Sub.

Given the fact that he is still just 21 years old, Rodrygo still
has much time to improve himself and rise up the ranks at Madrid. After all, even Vinicius Jr had
his breakthrough season only in 2021/22.
