As saddening as it is, no voice is heard as much as that of a cisgendered heterosexual man. They are in the position of power, they are privileged and they gotta get up and actively participate in bringing some radical change. Marginalized genders are persecuted on a daily basis and it's just unfair to not do anything when you can.

This whole men's voices being heard business is not a joke at all. For example, when women turn down men, no matter how many times, they either think of it as a negotiation or make it a matter of ego, and just as a woman says something like "I have a boyfriend", they immediately back off in most cases. Do you understand just how messed up that is? But unfortunately it is true. And as long as this difference exists, it is men's responsibility to amplify voices of those who are marginalized.

Tell your boys off for sexism, it'll go a long way for us
