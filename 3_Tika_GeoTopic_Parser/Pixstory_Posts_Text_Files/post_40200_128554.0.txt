The drama The Worst Ones by Lise Akoka and Romane Gueret, which won the top prize in Cannes' Un Certain Regard section and will have its North American premiere at TIFF, has been acquired by Kino Lorber for all of the United States and anglophone Canada. 

Deadline reported that the movie, which is based in the northern French suburb of Boulogne-Sur-Mer, chronicles the making of a movie whose casting director uses the neighbourhood housing project. To the astonishment and dismay of the local community, who wonders why the filmmaker chose "the worst ones," the director chooses four working-class youths to act in the movie in an effort to capture performances that are gritty and authentic. 

During the casting process, rehearsals, filming, and interactions with their hand-picked cast, jealousies are stoked, lines are crossed, and ethical questions arise.
