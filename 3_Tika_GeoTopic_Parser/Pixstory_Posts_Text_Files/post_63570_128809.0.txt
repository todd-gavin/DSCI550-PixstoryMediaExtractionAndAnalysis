 One of the most diverse ever, Queen are one of the greatest rock bands of all time, this statement cannot be repeated enough. With their incredible musicianship and experimentation with various genres from heavy metal, hard rock, glam rock, progressive rock, art rock, arena rock, art pop, progressive pop, there songs were diverse complete with musical genius, capable of attracting listeners of both heavy music as well as lighter stuff. With all that said, it is simply weird how some of Queen’s most well known songs are in fact some of its most mediocre stuff. There is a lot more to Queen’s music besides the hits, and if you want to truly listen to them, then go past the radio hits.

Songs such as ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, ‘Another One Bites The Dust’, ‘We Are The Champions’, and ‘We Will Rock You’ are good, fun, anthemic fist pumping material, but damn have they been overplayed to death, honestly some of Queen’s biggest hits are not only mediocre, but outright bad. Even a non rock fan would be now know these songs when in fact there really is not much to them. These songs do not at all showcase their true skills, they simply had a mainstream element to them.

When compared to songs such as ‘I Am In Love With My Car’, ‘Stone Cold Crazy’, ‘My Fairy King’ or ‘The March Of The Black Queen’ their mainstream stuff for the most part did not fully reflect any of Queen’s true musical talents. If your favourite songs are either ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ or ‘We Will Rock You’, then you have a truly long long  road ahead of you before you get to the truly great stuff in the Queen catalogue.
