I want to bring a great story to light in order to brighten a bit these difficult times we are in. This filled my heart with Joy as a member of the NBA family and I hope it inspires us all to do more. 

Apart from this clever fundraising, the past two weeks have seen Airbnb.org, the business’s non-profit wing, receive more than $5.2 million in small-dollar, direct donations from a total of more than 59,000 individual donors across 92 countries.

Airbnb was also quick to announce it would be setting up temporary housing for 100,000 Ukrainian refugees across Europe and North America.

Airbnb hosts have answered this generosity with their own, and more than 21,000 individuals have signed up to open their Airbnb-listed properties to Ukrainians, including 14,000 across Europe and 4,000 in the U.S.

The Utah Jazz Foundation is also partnering with Airbnb.org to provide more than 32,200 nights of temporary housing to refugees fleeing Ukraine, a number representing exactly 200% of the capacity of their Vivint Arena home stadium. This is simply AMAZING 🙏🏽
