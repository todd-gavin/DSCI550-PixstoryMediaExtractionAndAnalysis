I always heard that " An Apple a day keeps the doctor away " ! But for me its " Chocolate Cake a day , Keeps all my tension and stress away "🍫🍰  

This picture has my heart ! Because i love chocolate cakes alot ! I have a different kind of obsession with them ! If im stressed , all i need is a chocolate cake 🤤

My hand and my mouth agreed many years ago that , as far as chocolate is concerned, there is no need to involve brain ! I can eat chocolate cake alone , No matter how big it is !  Afterall its my Love ❤️

I may sound like a Kid  but Trust me when it comes to chocolate cakes , yes Im a kid 🤍🤤 

" Dil to Bachaa Hai ji "🤍
