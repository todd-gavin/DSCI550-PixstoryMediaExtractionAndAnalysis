Thibaut Courtois had the last laugh in the Champions League final on Saturday. Not because he made nine spectacular saves to fashion Real Madrid’s 14th title triumph against Liverpool, but because he extracted a revenge against the British media about which he spoke once the final was over. After having played for Chelsea for four seasons and winning two Premier League titles, the Belgian custodian found himself strangely ignored by the media. 
He said: “There was a magazine in England that didn’t put me in the top 10 goalkeepers in the world. That is a lack of respect. I am not saying they have to put me number one but not to put me in the top 10 is strange. "I twice won the Premier League in England with Chelsea and don't think I ever get recognised, and in my first season in Madrid a lot of people laughed at me but now here I am as a winner and it's a nice feeling.”
Courtois’s frustrations is understandable. He hasn’t made the top in one day. He has been one of Europe’s front-ranking goalkeepers for almost 10 years now and won domestic titles for Atletico Madrid, Chelsea and Real. His Champions League final performance was of course a stunning one – Mahammed Salah and Sadio Mane fired series of shots at Real goal, but Courtois was simply unbeatable. That he was named the man of the match was the correct decision and was appreciated by one and all. Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp had a dig at the rivals when he said: “When a goalkeeper is man of the match you know something is going wrong for the other team.” But nothing can demean Courtois’s stand-out show. 
If Klopp is dejected, then Real coach Carlo Ancelotti should specially thank his goalkeeper for helping him to win his fourth Champions League title as a coach. The win at Stade de France was his fourth following his wins in 2014 with Madrid in his first spell and 2003 and 2007 with AC Milan. The Italian has also won the European Cup twice as a footballer in 1989 and 1990.
