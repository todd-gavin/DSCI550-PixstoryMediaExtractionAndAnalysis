Jennifer Walters has finally met her match in Matt Murdock While the character was teased earlier in the season he s finally reintroduced to audiences in Episode of Marvel Studios She Hulk and he s very much the same Matt Murdock audiences have come to know and love over the years once again played by Charlie Cox returning to the role Knowing that Charlie was taking this character on again and that we got to reintroduce him through this show the dynamic between him and Jen is so so special Star Tatiana Maslany explains to Marvel com Head writer Jessica Gao was thrilled to learn that the show could use both Matt Murdock and Daredevil It just made so much sense that he would be on this show because both he and Jen are lawyers by day Super Heroes outside of the office even though Jen is doing it reluctantly What better character to kind of show how this struggle she s having is possible
