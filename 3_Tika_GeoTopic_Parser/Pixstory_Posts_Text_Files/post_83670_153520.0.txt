The Double Standard Of Aging is a 1978 essay by Susan Sontag about the brutal double standard in which women are expected to always look young and men are expected to become more handsome and attractive as they age. 
When it comes to attractiveness and beauty standards, men have an inherent advantage over women, with men increasing their value or status as they age and women decreasing their value or status. This means that men are expected to mature from boys to men and that women are expected to remain eternally prepubescent, which is, of course, a horribly toxic idea that makes women feel invisible and impotent as soon as they reach a certain age and are otherwise capable of competing in society as equals. And this is what she refers to as the double standard of ageing men age up⬆️, while women age down⬇️.
