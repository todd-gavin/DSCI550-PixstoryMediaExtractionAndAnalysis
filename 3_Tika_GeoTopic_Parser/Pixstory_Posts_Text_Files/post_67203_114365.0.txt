MAY BE I'LL REACH THE GATE 

Loneliness wails,
Darkness whispers,
I'm trapped by silence,
I yearn to earn my space,
With my eyes closed
I start walking
May be I'll reach the gate,
I'm not too sure,
I maintain my pace.

Beyond the finishing line,
A ray of light glistens,
My thirsty soul is wearied
Yet fights back.
Why is it easier to stay hidden?
Why is it easier to lie than it is to talk?
Easier to forget than to remember?
Not to look but feel blinded?
Questions rush into my mind.

I look at a mirror in my room,
The image seems to be so different,
It's not me anymore.
I feel as if I'm sitting in a hole
And looking for a way out,
Can't get out of it,
I can see it but can't figure out
What's going on,
Where things are going wrong.

May be I'll reach the gate,
I'm not too sure,
I maintain my pace.
