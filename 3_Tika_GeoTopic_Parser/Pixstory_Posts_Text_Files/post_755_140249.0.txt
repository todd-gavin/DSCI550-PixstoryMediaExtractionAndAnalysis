The most endearing legacy of Queen Elizabeth is the fact that she was he most adaptive royal in modern times. 
Never in history the idea of hereditary monarchy faced such a test as it did during her seven decades in power. 
British colonies were voting for independence.  Democracies were hailed and kings and queens were being relegated either  to the dustbins of history or to the drainage of insignificance. 
But Queen Elizabeth, young, inexperienced was baptised by the worst of British parliamentary politics in the first decades of her rein. 
The Suez crisis was so overwhelming. 
But she had the staying power. And though never attended a formal school, she was willing to get schooled from each crisis. 
Many monarchs and Monarchies crumpled. But Queen Elizabeth found her relevance and significance.
