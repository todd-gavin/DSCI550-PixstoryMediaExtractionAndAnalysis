India observes National Doctor s Day on July The day is marked to honour the immense contribution that doctors make in our everyday lives The date of July was decided to mark the day as it is the birth and death anniversary of Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy We all know doctors played an important role during covid They worked day and night to save our life Initially when there was no clarity regarding the treatment of coronavirus many doctors used their experience and treated patients with medicines used for different diseases to cure them of the virus In fact there was a time when the doctors and people working in the hospitals did not even have sufficient personal protective equipment yet they did not step back from their duty and continued their service for the larger good of the society This pandemic has established a basis for the young doctors to develop a humanistic competent and patient centered approach Happy doctors day to every doctor out there
