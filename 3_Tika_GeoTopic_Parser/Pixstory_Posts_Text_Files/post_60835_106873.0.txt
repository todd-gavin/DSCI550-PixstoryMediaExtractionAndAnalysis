I visited the bookshop today and while browsing the books, I did what I always do. I Checked the price (Student on a budget here). I picked up the ones I thought I really needed and was within my budget. Then my cousin pulled out his phone and compared the prices with the ones sold on Amazon. The ones sold on Amazon were heavily discounted (at least 20-30% than its retail price). I naturally want to save money so I put back most of the books I picked up.

It's kind of sad that many many bookstores that I'd go to as a child are shutting down or moving online. I don't actually mind the online transition because it makes buying books/other products convenient and budget friendly.

The question is, If E-commerce is the future then will offline retail die? The answer is uncertain.

Online shopping definitely has more advantages. It delivers right to your doorstep and ensures convenience. It allows you to compare prices and offers you a variety of products which are not geographically limited. Also pay per click has made advertising easy for most online businesses.

In my opinion, online is definitely the future but I do not think offline would die. There are some products you mostly cannot find online and even if you do, it's not like they would necessarily be cheaper than the retail ones (like second hand books, indigenous crafts, etc.,) I also think some people treat offline shopping as recreational.

What do you think about this?
