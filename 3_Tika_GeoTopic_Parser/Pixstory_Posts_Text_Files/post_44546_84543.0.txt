Dr. Brij Tankha and Dr. Patricia Uberoi, a past and present Honorary Director respectively of the Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi, have been indulgent in allowing me to become a hanger-on at the Institute, and I am thankful for this privilege. The learned fellows, members, scholars, and everyone else there have been kind and patient, and I would particularly like to acknowledge my gratitude to Dr. Hemant Adlakha, Dr. Bhim Subba, Dr. M.V. Rappai, and Dr. Swaran Singh, for their friendly guidance.

I am indebted to Mr. Mohit Verma, my neighbour, whose grandfather, the late Brig. S.S. Malik, had been India’s Military Attache in China in the mid-1950’s, for arranging to have printed out for me from the Internet (Times of India) the ‘History of the Conflict with China, 1)62,’ the Indian Ministry of Defence’s own history of the Sino- Indian war. Brig. (later Lt. Gen.) Rakesh Sharma of my own regiment, the 11th Gorkha Rifles, has been forthcoming with research tips, as before, and I remain grateful to him for his interest.

Everyone at my publishers, Har-Anand Publications Pvt Ltd, New Delhi; Mr. Narendra Kumar and his entire team, have been most encouraging and helpful.

The staff at the library of the United Services Institution (USI) of India, New Delhi, have helped greatly by their cheerful cooperation in my researches; I am thankful to Mrs. Renu Gupta, Mr. Brajinder, Mr. Ved Prakash, Mr. Maurya, and Mr. Rajesh Pande for their assistance. I am also indebted to Sqn. Ldr. Rana T.S. Chhina (Retd.) of the USI’s Centre for Armed Forces Historical Research for his enthusiastic and immediate response to my SOS.
