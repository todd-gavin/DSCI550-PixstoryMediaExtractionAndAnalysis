Khushi Kapoor and Nysa Devgn get clicked as they party together in Mumbai. 
Khushi kapoor is most popular star kid in bollywood. Daughter of Sridevi and Boney Kapoor is gearing up to make her debut bollywood very soon with Zoya Akhtar The Archies. However, she has been in a limelight even before her first flim hits theaters. She is often photographed in the city and she is also quite popular on social media. Khushi was spotted in the city with Nysa Devgn and Orhan. Khushi looked absolutely stunning in her stunning black bodycon dress. Nysa looked breathtaking in her red dress and printed jacket. They both got down from their car and quickly headed in. The friend Orhan was in chirpy mood. He smiled into camera and acknowledged the paparazzi. This probably the first time that Khushi and Nysa were spotted together.
