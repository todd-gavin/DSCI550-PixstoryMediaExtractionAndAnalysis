Satyajit Ray, the greatest maestro of film making was born today 101 years ago.
 He directed only two Hindi movies. Sadgati and Shatranj ke Khiladi. Ray composed music for both though Sadgati did not have any songs. 
Sharing two numbers from Shatranj ke khiladi:
Kanha main tose hari sung by Birju Maharaj and 
Tadap Tadap Sagri Rain sung by Amjad Khan. 
Imagine the prowess of a director who made Amjad Khan sing a thumri!!!
 A third number, title music of bengali film Teen Kanya composed by Ray is mix of baul music, Rabindra Sangeet and  Hindustani classical music. 
Some of his quotes!!
1. There's always some room for improvisation. ...
2. The only solutions that are ever worth anything are the solutions that people find themselves. ...
3. The director is the only person who knows what the film is about.
