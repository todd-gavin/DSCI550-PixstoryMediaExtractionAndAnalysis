Jinling Xu Guangda Xiang Abstract Aims To investigate the atherogenic index of plasma AIP in relation to retinopathy and nephropathy in type diabetic mellitus T DM Methods inpatients with T DM were included in this cross sectional study and divided into four groups T DM without complications DM group T DM complicated with retinopathy alone and nephropathy alone DR alone and DN alone group and T DM complicated with both DR and DN DRN group AIP was calculated by the formula of log triglyceride high density lipoprotein cholesterol Results AIP in the DR alone DN alone and DRN groups were significantly higher than that in the DM group and DRN group had the highest AIP level Moreover patients with proliferative DR had higher AIP than patients with non proliferative DR in DR alone and DRN groups and patients with macroalbuminuria had higher AIP than patients with microalbuminuria in DN alone and DRN groups The highest AIP quartile group had the greatest proportion of DRN compared to the other quartile groups The DRN group had a maximal AUC for AIP by ROC curve AUC In the subgroup analyses by age the AUCs of patients aged years were all larger than those of patients aged years Logistic regression analysis showed that AIP had the highest correlation with aged years individuals with DRN and this association still remained significant after adjustment with three models Conclusions AIP is positively associated with the occurrence and severity of diabetic microvascular complications as well as can well predict their presence in T DM especially in aged years individuals with DRN Sources
