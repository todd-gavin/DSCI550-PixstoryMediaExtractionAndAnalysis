Normalizing divorce for all daughters. 

Not only is a divorced daughter better than a dead daughter but a divorced daughter is also better than a daughter who is unhappy and
constantly suffering. Do not force your girls to stay in toxic marriages for the sake of society. Start standing up for them.

Raise your daughters to be unafraid to leave
toxic and abusive relationships.
Teach them to do better, & be better.
Please don't pressure them to stay something that could result in their death or suffering.

It shouldn’t always be the women who have to settle into marriages especially at the sacrifice of their mental well-being. It’s okay to have failed marriages.
