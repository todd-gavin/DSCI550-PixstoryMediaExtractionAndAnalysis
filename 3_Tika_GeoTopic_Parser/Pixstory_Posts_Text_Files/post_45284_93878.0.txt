The action represents an increase in economic pressure on the Russian oligarch. The UK government has sanctioned two long time business associates of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, freezing up to Â£10 billion in assets.

The move towards Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich has been described by the government as the largest asset freeze in UK history. It's a continuation of the UK's targeting of those with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is overseeing an invasion of Ukraine that has earned the West's scorn.

"We are tightening the ratchet on Putin's war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine," UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. "Nothing and no one is off the table."

The Chelsea owner has already been sanctioned by the UK government, prompting him to put the club up for sale in a still ongoing process. For a time, the sanctions restricted ticket and merchandise sales, but those provisions have since been modified.

Abramovich has stepped down from all leadership roles as the Chelsea sale proceeds. There are still multiple potential buyers said to be in the running to purchase the Blues, with the transaction expected to be completed in the near future.

Despite the fact that he is still in the process of selling Chelsea, Abramovich has reportedly begun talks to purchase a new football club. According to the Turkish publication Fanatik, Abramovich was eager to stay in the football industry and had reportedly begun talks to purchase Goztepe, a club with a strong position in the Turkish football league, Super Lig.

The club is known for its large, passionate fanbase, and it has a fierce rivalry with Karsiyaka, which has been dubbed "one of the fiercest" in the world.
