Northern Ireland, like the hosts, were denied a dream start to their Nations League campaign last time out when they lost 1-0 to Greece.This came after a 1-0 loss to Hungary in a friendly match on March 29, ending their three-match undefeated streak.Northern Ireland will be confident of snapping their two-match losing run when they face a team they have beaten in each of their last three meetings.
