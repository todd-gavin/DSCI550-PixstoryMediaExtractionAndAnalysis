There has been speculation surrounding Thiago Alcantara's future. With Barcelona interested, it seems that the Reds management has made their decision regarding the player's future. 

As per Express UK, The Liverpool management is in unison with a decision. The Reds are unwilling to sell their midfield ace and this is down to two main reasons why they want to keep hold of the former Bayern Munich star. 

Firstly, Thiago Alcantara has become a permanent fixture on Jurgen Klopp's side. It looks like the Spaniard has put his injury concerns behind him as he looks set to lead the Reds to a possible treble. 

Secondly, The Liverpool management believes that Thiago's experience is very vital. The 31-year-old midfielder has played for Barcelona and Bayern Munich before moving to England. Hence, the Spaniard can provide a wealth of experience to the youngsters. 

Having signed with Liverpool in September 2020, Thiago has played out two seasons with the Reds. In this, the Spaniard has scored 3 goals and has made 65 appearances for Jurgen Klopp's side.

Owing to his incredible performance, Thiago Alcantara was applauded by the Liverpool faithful as he was substituted in the 4-0 win against Manchester United. Hence with the season nearing its end, Klopp would certainly be hoping that Thiago Alcantara will play a vital role in Liverpool's "Quadruple dreams".




Does the Spaniard want to stay?

Thiago Alcantara was asked about Barcelona's interest in him. To this, the Spaniard replied, "I Am not concerned with rumours. I'm focused on the duty I have to my team, the contract I have, and the new adventure I have here in the Premier League trying to win all the trophies I can.”

Hence the player made it clear that he would like to stay with Liverpool for now. It has to be seen if Jurgen Klopp will keep hold of Thiago or if Xavi Hernandez could pull out a major swoop for Barcelona.
