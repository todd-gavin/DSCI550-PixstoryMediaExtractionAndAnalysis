'Investment in knowledge pays the best interest'

Education is the prime factor which helps in transforming an individual. Through education an individual develops his /her character, personality, concern for others, etc.

But is our education system acceptable?
Each and everyone will have different opinions on this. Our education system is a mixture of events that has taken place before and even most of syllabus are not even corrected according to new findings. Technology is getting advanced day by day, with new -new discoveries.
But students are not been updated with present events rather than  they are mainly taught to study what the text book prescribed says.
This system will not be helpful because jobs we offer is purely based on skills and present knowledge. So, if a student is not updated then he /she can't reach a position they wish to.

Students are to be provided with skill development programs and classes. This can bring out educated individuals who can contribute a good part in our countries development. A country is termed developed when it shows progress in education sector, health sector, infrastructure etc.
