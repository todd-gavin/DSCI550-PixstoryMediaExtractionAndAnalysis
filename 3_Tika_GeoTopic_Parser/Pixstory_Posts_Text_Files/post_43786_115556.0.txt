After a slow start to the summer transfer window, the rumours are picking up across Europe. The clubs have identified their summer transfer targets and are working on finalizing the deals. However, the clubs have limited time left in the ongoing summer transfer window. The summer 2022 transfer window will close at 23:00 BST on 1 September 2022. This is in line with all the European leagues despite starting on different dates. 

The English Premier League will close at 11 PM GMT whereas the Spanish top-tier will close at 10:59 PM GMT. On the other hand, the German league, Bundesliga, will slam shut their doors at 5 PM GMT and is the earliest to close the transfer window. On the other hand, Ligue 1 are the latest to close the transfer activities as they have decided to close at 11:59 PM GMT.  

The ongoing transfer window is rare and one of the kinds as there are no major international tournaments happening in the summer as the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar will be held in winter. The clubs fighting for major honours will be happy as they will look to close out the deals for their required players.

Manchester City and Liverpool set the transfer window on fire with some shrewd and expensive signings like Erling Haaland and Darwin Nunez. On the other hand, Manchester United and Chelsea are still finalizing on the players under new manager and new owners respectively. In Spain, Barcelona have lifted some economic levers to have the transfers despite being in a critical financial condition. FC Bayern Munich signed Sadio Mane from Liverpool and are looking to complete a few more transfers. The notable Serie A transfer is Romelu Lukaku. Inter brought Romelu Lukaku on loan from Chelsea as the player was not fitting Tuchel’s plans.
