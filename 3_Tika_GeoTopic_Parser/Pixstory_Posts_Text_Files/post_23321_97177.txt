The rule that automatically assigns the father&#39;s surname is discriminatory and harmful to the identity of the child and establishes a sentence of the Constitutional Court in the light of which the rule becomes that the child assumes the surname of both parents in the order agreed by the same unless they decide to mutual agreement to attribute only the surname of one of the two In the absence of agreement on the order of attribution of the surname of both parents, the intervention of the judge remains in accordance with the provisions of the legal system Meeting in chambers, the Consulta examined the questions of constitutional legitimacy on the rules governing the attribution of the surname to children in the Italian legal system In particular, the Court ruled on the rule which does not allow parents by mutual agreement to attribute to the child only the surname of the mother and on the one which, in the absence of an agreement, imposes the surname of the father only instead of that of both parents Pending the filing of the sentence, the Communications and Press Office of the Constitutional Court announces that the contested provisions have been declared illegitimate due to conflict with the Constitution and also with the European Convention on Human Rights According to the Court, in the wake of the principle of equality and in the interest of the child, both parents must be able to share the choice of his surname which constitutes a fundamental element of personal identity. The Court therefore declared the constitutional illegitimacy of all the provisions which provide for the automatic attribution of the father&#39;s surname with reference to children born out of wedlock and adopted children task of the legislator to regulate all aspects connected to this decision The ruling will be filed in the next few weeks
