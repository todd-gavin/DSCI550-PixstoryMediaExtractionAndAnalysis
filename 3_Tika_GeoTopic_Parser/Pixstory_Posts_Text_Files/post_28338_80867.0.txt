Biribol, which originated in Brazil in the 1960s, is a type of volleyball played in a tiny hotel poolâ€”just don't call it water volleyball! Why? A few rule differences, including as the fact that players can block a serve but not break the plane of the net while spiking. Its game is played in a pool that is 8 metres long, 4 metres wide, and 1.30 metres deep (the depth must be the same throughout the pool), with a net in the middle of the pool that is 2.62 metres high for male practise and 2.40 metres high for female practise.
