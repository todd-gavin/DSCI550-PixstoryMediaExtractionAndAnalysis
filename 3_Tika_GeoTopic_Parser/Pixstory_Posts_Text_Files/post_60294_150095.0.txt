But imparting teachings would be enough if a radical organisation like PFI is continuously poisoning the minds of the youngsters who believe more on social media rather than scriptures? Although there is no replacement for righteous teachings, an immediate action is required.
 A ban on PFI is the first step towards stopping the spread of extremism by the organisation. 

Quran (2:193-194) declares that Muslims may only fight active combatants and even if during battle an enemy combatant asks for amnesty, you must grant it. The Indian Muslims must introspect if PFI is following the teachings of Islam or fulfilling its own agenda to gain power.
