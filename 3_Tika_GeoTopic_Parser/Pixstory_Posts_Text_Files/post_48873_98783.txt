Growing up with controlling and narcissistic parent s is a living nightmare A child who has toxic parents absorbs the negativity of their parents emotions and actions It s very difficult to build a healthy and autonomous concept of self in such a setting without kind guidance from outside the immediate family Children many times are unaware of their poisonous home environment They have so little world experience that it is all they know and they believe that what they are experiencing is normal Subconsciously they develop coping mechanisms which they grow up to realize don t really work in the outside world They re met with so much pain inside of what is supposed to be their safe place that they lose any sense of dealing with it healthily later in life Parents seek to control their kids and their decisions often not realizing what they re inflicting onto them They not only mess with their self worth but solidify the grounds that their children are never able to trust anyone with themselves again Every act of care and kindness towards them coming from a genuine place feels like a ploy to manipulate them into surrendering It feels like just another form of parenting but it isn t It is torturous to say the least They end up suffocating their children kill their dreams and most importantly ruin their belief in relationships and love It is pure evil to bring a person to life only to treat them like some toy that you think you re allowed to control It is absolutely mind boggling just how common it is The narcissism countless children face from their parents messes them up for life It gets worse when the defense mechanism opted by these children or a decision to get away from this toxicity is used to vilify them There is no forgiveness for taking advantage of the vulnerable life that you brought into this world the life that you re supposed to be protecting It needs to change and it must Parents should be respecting their children s boundaries and there s no other way to twist it Abuse is not opinion
