CBI story continues....

Besides, oral instructions have been issued to officers to stay away from the media.

“We were told that strict action, including dismissal from service, will be taken if we are found to be in unauthorised contact with media. There was no written order in this regard but we were told in uncertain terms to stay away from media,” said another officer.

CBI IS NOT AN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Old-timers say the CBI has a long-standing policy of disseminating information only through the designated information officer of the agency, who normally is an Indian Information Service officer and deputed to the agency from the Press Information Bureau (PIB).

But officials in the agency say it looks the Director wants to run the CBI, which is an investigation agency, like an intelligence agency.

Jaiswal has spent considerable time working in the external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) in his prior deputation tenure at the centre.

“Another plan that is still in the works is to initiate detailed background checks into the officials of the agency. First, detailed information on a prescribed form will be sought from the officials in order to verify it further. This kind of information is already sought when officials go on to work with sensitive organisations like the SPG [Special Protection Group] or intelligence agencies. The CBI, too, wants to initiate the process on the lines of such sensitive organisations,” said another officer.

At the moment, the antecedents of all officials are thoroughly checked when they come to join the agency on deputation.
