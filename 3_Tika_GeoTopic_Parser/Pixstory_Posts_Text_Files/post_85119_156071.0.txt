Liverpool inflicted a massive defeat on Manchester City to bag three beneficial points in the Matchday 11 of the Premier League. The reds registered a narrow 1-0 win against Guardiola's city. Thanks to this win, Liverpool have finally managed to register a win after being winless in each of the last three premier league matches. Manchester City on the other hand are no longer the only unbeaten side in this season's Premier League after their narrow loss to Liverpool. The team is second in the table after dropping points and have 23 points in 10 matches to their name. 
The match included several significant moments which shall perhaps not be depicted merely by the scoreline alone.
City started off in fine fashion as the forwards attacked the opposition goal with full might. The 15th minute saw Haaland, Foden and Gundogan try having shots at the goal with each of them being denied by blocks by the men in red. 
Haaland was denied twice towards the later stages of the first half. The Norwegian firstly failed to loft his shot over Allison which was gathered safely, which was followed by a header from the no.9 safely grabbed by Allison.
With just 5 minutes into the second half, Ederson came up with a fine save to deny salah when he managed to push the ball off target with a fingertip save. Salah however made up for the missed opportunity in the 76th minute when he slotted in the opener to break the visitors' hearts at last. A beautiful long ball from Allison found Salah alone in City's half of play along with Cancelo. 
The Egyptian turned Cancelo and managed to bamboozle him to be 1v1 against Ederson and send his shot past Ederson into the back of the net. This turned out to be the difference between the two sides as Liverpool went on to bag the three points. Thanks to this unthinkable win, Klopp's men are now placed 8th in the table with 13 points in 9 matches.
