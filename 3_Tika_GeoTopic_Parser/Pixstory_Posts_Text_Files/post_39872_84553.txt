 I m not going to kill you I want you to do me a favour I want you to tell all your friends about me I m Batman Over years ago Tim Burton s Batman hit cinemas and introduced the world to the definitive big screen version of the Caped Crusader played by none other than Michael Keaton True he wore Nike shoes he couldn t turn his head when he was in costume but when it comes to playing the Dark Knight nobody s done it better Many actors have taken on the mysterious character of Batman from Adam West to Christian Bale George Clooney to Ben Affleck Michael Keaton is the self proclaimed greatest of the eight Caped Crusaders However with his portrayal of Batman in one of the earliest dark gothic ish superhero film adaptations he outdid himself and exceeded all expectations To demonstrate the minor difference they never use a distinct voice or demeanour People never recognised the Caped Crusader as the millionaire himself Keaton thought even though they had the same voice Unlike Affleck and Bale who looked to be in a competition of rage melodrama and hostility Keaton was calm and composed as Batman Despite the fact that he was intimidating and terrifying it was his voice that made all the difference and he didn t have to focus his rage into the part As Bruce Wayne his emotional detachment and distance were palpable emphasising the conflict By giving his character an air of anonymity Keaton was able to make Bruce Wayne appear more nuanced as he sank in the wretched solitude of his wealth He want to be Batman and is fed up with being Bruce Wayne Despite the hundreds of critics he was able to overcome all of the negative comments and radically change public perceptions of himself Keaton will continue to revers his cape and cowl as the greatest Batman of all time Before Robert Pattinson takes up the cape to prove his mettle it s crucial to remember the man who gave a superhero shrouded in an amorphous haze of tragedy mystery melancholy and tiredness unimaginable depth and character
