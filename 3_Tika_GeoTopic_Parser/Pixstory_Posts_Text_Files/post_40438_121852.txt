Popping your pimples is disgustingly painfully satisfying thing to do I always suggest against doing it because of many reasons First and foremost is that your nails have many germs and it can lead to infections You don t want to have an outbreak on your face now do you The puss blood or water from your popped pimple can spread the bacteria and make your breakouts worse It can also leave long lasting scarring But this triangle on your face Never mess Major sinuses that link to the brain are located beneath the triangle An infection that starts with popping a pimple above these sinuses can spread to the brain And I mean just that easily It can cause many troubling problems and scarily enough death is one of them
