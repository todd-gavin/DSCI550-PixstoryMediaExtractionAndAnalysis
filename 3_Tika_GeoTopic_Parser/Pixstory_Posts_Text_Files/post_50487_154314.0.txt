In general, consider seeking help if your child’s behavior persists for a few weeks or longer; causes distress for your child or your family; or interferes with your child’s functioning at school, at home, or with friends. 
Young children may benefit from an evaluation and treatment if they:
👉Have frequent tantrums or are intensely irritable much of the time.
👉Often talk about fears or worries.
👉Complain about frequent stomachaches or headaches with no known medical cause.
👉Are in constant motion and cannot sit quietly (except when they are watching videos or playing video games).
👉Sleep too much or too little, have frequent nightmares, or seem sleepy during the day.
👉If they show no interest in playing with other children or have difficulty making friends.
👉Struggle academically or have experienced a recent decline in grades.
👉Repeated actions or check things many times out of fear that something bad may happen.
