Eknath Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra, the price of gasoline and diesel has decreased by Rs. 5 per litre and Rs. 3 per litre, respectively. The choice was made at the second cabinet meeting of the new administration, which was formed last month following the resignation of former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Following the cabinet meeting at Mantralaya, Shinde informed media that the decision to lower the price of gasoline and diesel in Maharashtra has been made.

Petrol in Mumbai would cost Rs 106.35 per litre after the price cut as opposed to the current Rs 111.35 per litre. Similar to that, Mumbai's diesel price would decrease by Rs 3 from the current Rs 97.28 per litre to Rs 94.28 per litre. Petrol will cost Rs 105.88 per litre in Pune, while diesel will cost Rs 92.37 per litre. After the revised prices are put in place, the cost of a litre of gasoline in Thane would drop to Rs 106.49. Thane's diesel cost would drop to Rs 94.42 a litre.

Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis reacted to the discussion by saying it was a promise upheld by BJP-Shiv Sena commitments to people welfare.
