Abstract Background and aims Oral semaglutide is the first glucagon like petide receptor agonist GLP RA approved for oral use in the treatment of type diabetes mellitus T DM We aim to conduct a comprehensive review of literature to find out the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in T DM to lay out a clinical consideration for its use in India Methods We searched the electronic database of PubMed and Google Scholar from inception until January using several MeSH keywords and retrieved all available granular details of phase and randomized controlled trials RCTs of oral semaglutide Subsequently we reviewed the results critically to lay down the clinical recommendation of its use Results Ten phase randomized placebo and or active controlled studies of oral semaglutide PIONEER programs are currently published Seven global trials of oral semaglutide PIONEER and that exclusively studied the efficacy lowering of HbA c and body weight achieving target of HbA c and other composites of HbA c and weight outcomes found mg oral semaglutide to be superior to placebo or active comparators empagliflozin sitagliptin and liraglutide Efficacy was similar in Asians although no separate data exists for Indians due to the low number of participants Expectedly gastrointestinal intolerance were the most commonly observed side effects with oral semaglutide and the main reason for drug discontinuation Conclusion Oral semaglutide mg is an effective agent in the treatment of T DM Real world studies of semaglutide are clearly needed in India in absence of meaningful data from RCTs in Indians
