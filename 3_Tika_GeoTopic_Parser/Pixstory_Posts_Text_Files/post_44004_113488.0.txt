Espirito Santo, a former manager of Wolves and Tottenham, has been named the new head coach of Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad. The club's official Twitter account sent a message on Monday night confirming the 48-year-old Portuguese's appointment.

“Nuno Santo is here. Welcome Coach.”

It's an honour for me to join the greatest club in Saudi Arabia, Ittihad, Nuno said in a quick video message to the team's supporters on the same platform. We'll talk soon. Jeddah-based After a 0-0 home draw with Al-Batin on the final day of the season allowed rivals Al-Hilal to win the Saudi Pro League for a third straight year with a 2-1 victory over Al-Faisaly, Al-Ittihad finished in second place.

Nuno, a former manager of Valencia and Porto, had a significant impact on Wolves during his 
four years at Molineux. Nuno guided Wolves into the Premier League and helped the team earn consecutive seventh-place finishes as well as European qualification.

He was chosen to succeed Jose Mourinho at Spurs in June of last year, but he only held the 
position for 17 games before being fired by Antonio Conte in November.

Duncan Ferguson has resigned from his position as Everton's head coach to pursue his managerial goals, the Premier League club has announced.

The former Toffees captain worked in the backroom at Goodison Park for a number of different managers.

The 50-year-old Scot also served twice as interim manager, the most recent time being when Rafael Benitez was fired during the 2017–18 campaign. After Frank Lampard was hired in January, he was reinstated as assistant manager. Prior to Carlo Ancelotti's appointment later that month, he assumed leadership of the team in December 2019 after Marco Silva left.
