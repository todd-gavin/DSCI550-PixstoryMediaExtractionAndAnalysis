New Delhi: Rajinder Raavanwala is a famous manufacturer of hand-made effigies of Raavana, Kumbh Karn, and Meghnaad. 58-years old Rajinder is both happy and sad. He was sitting cross-legged on a charpoy (bed) at a busy roadside of Najafgarh Road, near Subhash Nagar, supervising a team of some 20 craftsmen giving final shape to the 50 feet effigies of Raavana and others.
If one travels from Raja Garden to Uttam Nagar in West Delhi, one will find vast structures of bamboo and willow being manufactured and kept on footpaths on both sides. In the next ten days, they will need finishing, and the artists are praying that one week ahead of the Dusshera festival that falls on October 5, there should be no rain, as most of their structures are on the roadside, and showers can spoil all their hard work of months together.
Each model is weaved with thin bamboo sticks and knotted with tin wire and ropes. Then Skelton's structure is covered with old cotton clothes (mostly old saris), and then the brown paper is pasted with glue on the cloth. Final touches are brushed like papier-mâché work with bright paint and sparkling colourful paper sheets. The accessories are added towards the end.
Once ready, they are transported to different destinations in dismembered forms, like separate heads, torsos, limbs, faces, etc. The final stitch and standing of the effigies are done by experts a day earlier than their burning on Dusshera day. It is a feat to watch victory over evil Children love it and spend a good time watching these effigies and listening from elders to the stories behind the burning of these effigies.
