I m Ankit Devi I m a licensed football coach I m currently running my own Football Academy named Sportiqo The reason I started this academy was that I never got the proper guidance or even coaching when I was a player about which team to go to I ensure that my players have the proper knowledge and understanding of where they can go to achieve their dreams I want to grow the talent in Pune and send them outside to play football at a higher level I used to play as a striker and as I took up coaching while pursuing Chartered Accountancy I left the profession to focus fully on my passion With time I became a better player due to learning the game better while on my coaching journey My tactics are usually on the attacking side Just recently I ve completed my coaching C Licence In Pune during my playing days and even now to some extent there isn t a proper infrastructure related to football and I hope it changes as time goes on
