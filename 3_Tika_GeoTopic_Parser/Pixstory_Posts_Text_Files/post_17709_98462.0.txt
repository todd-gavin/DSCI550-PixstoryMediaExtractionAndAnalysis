CAMPAIGN:

Their group progress was never in doubt after the opening 4-1 defeat of Arsenal and their performances throughout matched the domination they showed in beating Chelsea 4-0 in last season's final. That continued against Madrid as they had to come from behind in both legs, doing so in style and thrilling the record 91,553 crowd at Camp Nou. That was improved when 91,648 was there as they beat Wolfsburg 5-1, though a 2-0 second-leg loss ended a 45-game competitive winning streak.

CAMPAIGN:

Came through a potentially tricky qualifying tie with Levante and, despite losing at Bayern, always looked on course for Group D top spot as they vied to bounce back from losing their champion status last season. Ada Hegerberg returned from long-term injury and was quickly back among the goals, including a vital strike to wipe out OL's first-leg deficit in the return against Juventus, a reminder of the French club's enduring strength. The topsy-turvey first leg against Paris ended 3-2, and Hegerberg and Wendie Renard struck to silence Parc des Princes.
