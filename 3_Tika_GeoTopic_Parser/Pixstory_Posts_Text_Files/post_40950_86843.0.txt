According to NDTV media, a new Hollywood film starring Tom Holland has been banned in Vietnam due to scenes with a map depicting Beijing's claims to the South China Sea. 

The map depicted in the action-adventure film "Uncharted" shows the so-called "nine-dash line," which delineates Beijing's vast claims to the disputed waters, where Hanoi has competing claims. 

Mark Walhberg, Antonio Banderas, and Tom Holland feature in Sony's film, which was supposed to be released worldwide on March 18.

â€œDuring the movie review, the National Evaluation and Classification Council discovered that the image of the nine-dashed line appeared in the movie," director of Vietnam's Department of Cinema Vi Kien Thanh told the state-controlled Zing news outlet.

"Therefore, this movie will be banned from screening."

Vietnamese users complained about the map on the film's official Facebook page. 
One said, "Hoang Sa Truong Sa belongs to Vietnam!" referring to the disputed Parcel and Spratly Islands. 

In the film industry, the long-running subject has been hotly debated. 

The animated DreamWorks feature "Abominable" was taken from theatres in Hanoi a year later over the same issue, while Netflix was ordered to remove episodes of its "Pine Gap" series last year over similar sequences.

In Vietnam, a scene featuring a designer bag with a map of the world showing the disputed South China Sea islands under Beijing's authority was deleted from the 2018 romance comedy "Crazy Rich Asians."
