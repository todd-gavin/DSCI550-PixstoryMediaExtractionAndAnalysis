Wayne Rooney's 12 year old son seems to be following his footsteps. Little Kai last caught the eye when he netted all four goals in his side's 5-4 defeat to Liverpool in October 2021. Fast forward 6 months, and Kai is still showing similar signs of promise for Manchester United's youth team.

He scored again at the weekend in his side's game against Manchester City, in what can only be described as a Rooney-esque finish. Very similar to what his father used to do over on the other flank, cutting In and shooting far post. Kai has some very big boots to fill, even within the club's youth teams. 

Given Wayne Rooney was and still is Manchester United's all-time top goalscorer, those in the academy will expect Kai to reach atleast a portion of his dad's feats at the club. During his final years as a player at United, the Englishman was often seen watching games alongside Kai at Old Trafford. It's been well over 5 years since his departure but his relationship with the club and It's hierarchy doesn't seem to have changed much.

One can only imagine the kind of pressure he faces when he rises through the ranks and makes it through to one of the club's senior teams in the future. The clip of Kai receiving the ball, taking a touch to keep the ball down and curling it over the keeper with his instep has since gone viral on instagram. Kai's own social media handle (managed by his parents) has a little over 47k followers. 

For now, the future is bright for Kai Rooney. That strike, along with a few other goals he's scored for the academy certainly weren't dumb luck!
