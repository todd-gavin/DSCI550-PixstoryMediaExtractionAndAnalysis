Be Nobody s Darling by Alice Walker Be nobody s darling Be an outcast Take the contradictions Of your life And wrap around You like a shawl To parry stones To keep you warm Watch the people succumb To madness With ample cheer Let them look askance at you And you askance reply Be an outcast Be pleased to walk alone Uncool Or line the crowded River beds With other impetuous Fools Make a merry gathering On the bank Where thousands perished For brave hurt words They said But be nobody s darling Be an outcast Qualified to live Among your dead Here Alice Walker emphasizes the word outcast something that is used to describe somebody who breaks the norms She wants us to do the same be outcasts and do whatever we want to do We are not here to be anybody s darlings but to live the life that we want Find happiness in chaos and contradictions
