Amy Lawrence Lowell was an American poet of the imagist school. She posthumously won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1926. The school was a source of considerable despair for the young Amy Lowell. She considered herself to be developing "masculine" and "ugly" features and she was a social outcast. She had a reputation among her classmates for being outspoken and opinionated.

In the post-World War I years, Lowell was largely forgotten, but the women's movement in the 1970s and women's studies brought her back to light. According to Heywood Broun, however, Lowell personally contented against feminism.

Additional sources of interest in Lowell today come from the anti-war sentiment of the oft-taught poem "Patterns"; her personification of inanimate objects, as in "The Green Bowl", and "The Red Lacquer Music Stand"; and her lesbian themes, including the love poems, addressed to Ada Dwyer Russell in "Two Speak Together" and her poem "The Sisters", which addresses her female poetic predecessors.
Lowell's correspondence with her friend Florence Ayscough, a writer and translator of Chinese literature, was compiled and published by Ayscough's husband Professor Harley Farnsworth MacNair in 1945.

In 1912, Lowell’s first collection of poetry was published. A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass was, in many ways, highly conventional for its era. After beginning a career as a poet when she was well into her 30s, Lowell became an enthusiastic student and disciple of the art. One day in 1913, after reading several poems signed “H.D., Imagist,” she realized that her poetry followed in much the same literary vein. The new style of poetry she had just encountered was termed “Imagism” by its main proponent, Ezra Pound.
