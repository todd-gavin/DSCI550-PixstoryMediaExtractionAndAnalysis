 Coming to the fold after six years since s The Tiara the Swedish masters of progressive power metal are back and going really strong Few bands are worth such a long wait but Seventh Wonder are one of them with The Testament kicking all sorts of ass Unlike the The Tiara which was a concept album The Testament seems to be written in a more traditional format but nonetheless it is overall superior to its predecessor The Testament by its name alone stands as a monument to the band s persistence and reliability as a forger of catchy progressive power metal outfit The Testament immediately opens up with a very strong opener The Warrior and from there it does not seem to let up The Light infuses heavy riffing with melodic almost AOR like elements I Carry The Blame goes a bit further on the emotional side playing in minor while pulling back a bit from the intensity Reflections is a wonderful instrumental track that really sticks out The Red River is one of the best tracks here packing a ton of emotion Mindkiller is wonderfully melodic featuring a darker tone than most while Invincible and Under a Clear Blue Sky are all catchy as hell with pleasant vocal harmonies and beefy instrumentals This all comes to a brilliant finish with Elegy Seventh Wonder really knows how to write hooks and melodies that really stick to your ear while simultaneously really shredding it up The musicianship is one of the most beautiful and technical that the band has ever produced The guitar work of Johan Liefvendahl is absolutely insane seriously this is Symphony X level crazy and if that was not crazy enough then the bassplay of Andreas Blomqvist ridiculously good while Stefan Norgren goes ham on the drums The keys of Andreas S derin here are just phenomenal being simply gorgeous serene and technical simultaneously The vocals of Tommy Karevik here need no mention they are as amazing as they can get bringing on full power and melody The Testament has been one of Seventh Wonder s best records yet rivalling even The Great Escape Score
