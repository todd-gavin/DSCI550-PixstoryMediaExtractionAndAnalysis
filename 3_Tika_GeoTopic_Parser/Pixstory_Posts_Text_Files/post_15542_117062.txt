Recent studies have shown that tornadoes in the Mediterranean area and in Italy in particular are not rare events. A work conducted by the Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the National Research Council Cnr Isac published in Atmospheric Research confirms the existence of specific areas affected by high intensity tornadoes One of these represented by the central regions bordering the Tyrrhenian Sea Lazio in particular other areas particularly affected in Italy are the south-eastern regions Puglia Calabria and the Po Valley as also highlighted by previous works by the same authors L intensification of these phenomena over the years also conditioned by the climate change in progress, it being confirmed that there are specific forcing factors such as the surface temperature of the sea with an important role in the development of these events comments Elenio Avolio of the Cnr Isac The central Italian Tyrrhenian regions can be defined as a hot spot for tornadoes in the Mediterranean area In this regard, years of data were analyzed by isolating a considerable number of high-intensity tornado events throughout Italy The statistical analyzes were conducted by analyzing both radiosounding measurements and outputs from large-scale models re-analysis in order to identify the dominant atmospheric conditions associated with the identified tornadoes it was therefore possible to define specific prevailing atmospheric configurations potentially favorable to their development in the study area
