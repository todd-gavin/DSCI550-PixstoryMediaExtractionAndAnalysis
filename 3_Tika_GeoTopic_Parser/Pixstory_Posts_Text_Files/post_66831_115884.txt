Respecting a legend of the game You cannot be serious Ronaldo has been alleged of sexual assault and sadly enough as a fan of the sport he even agreed to it and accepted it and then his legal team got him out of it through legal maneouvearing If your legend of the game is a sexual assaulter then I guess the game can do well without the legend Coz it doesn t matter how great he is any club in their right mind would want to distance themselves with such a man Hence my point stands that Ronaldo should feel lucky to play at Manchester United at this stage of his career
