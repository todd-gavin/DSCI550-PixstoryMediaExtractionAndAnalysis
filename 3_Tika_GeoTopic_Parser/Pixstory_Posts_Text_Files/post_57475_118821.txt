Objectifying women s bodies for pleasure is an age old phenomenon it has been done so often and relentlessly that there would be enough examples available to portray the existing stereotypes But women being used as objects is very well manifested by the male gaze which is defined as the way women are portrayed on screen from a perspective of a heterosexual male who is present in the art like a man in a movie it could be present as a spectator or it is the one making the art It is often linked with visuals and cinema For a long time cinema was fettered by the patriarchal society that chose to portray women as mere objects of male desire where women were mainly shown as less or barely dressed but men were clad adequately in their suits The discussion around the male gaze is necessary and relevant as it is a very well known fact that the human brain can understand and perceive things more easily when it is shown or portrayed through visuals than done in other ways So what is shown onscreen should not dehumanise or humiliate anyone or even promote an ideology that would damage the already damaged minds From advertising to even painting treatment of women is intimidating and harmful The power of the gaze is not hidden we all know how it could torment women s minds what is left for women to live with after such portrayals is low self esteem and self objectification This is more clearly explained and acknowledged by the scholar and filmmaker Laura Mulvey in her essay Visual Please and Narrative Cinema Her points tell how important it becomes to eradicate the underlying ideas of the male gaze
