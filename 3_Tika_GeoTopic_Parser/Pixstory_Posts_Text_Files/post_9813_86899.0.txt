Taliban rule has had a devastating impact on Afghan women and girls, according to several media reports.

Since taking control in August last year, the Taliban have imposed rights-violating policies that have created huge barriers to women's and girls' health and education, curtailed freedom of movement, and deprived many of earned income.


On Tuesday, the UN in Afghanistan expressed solidarity with Afghan women and girls as they face the consequences of multiple crises, combined with entrenched gender inequality and discrimination.

The UN Mission in a statement said that women in Afghanistan are disproportionately impacted by a legacy of conflict, in addition to drought and the collapsing economy, which has plunged millions in Afghanistan into debt and humanitarian need.


"What we are witnessing today in Afghanistan is a crisis of catastrophic proportions. Everyone in the country is affected by the current crises, but the situation for women and girls is particularly concerning as their rights and access to opportunities have become increasingly challenged," saidÂ Deborah Lyon, the Secretary-General's Special Representative (SRSG) for Afghanistan.

Condemning all forms of violence against women, she said they have the equal right to demonstrate peacefully without fear of reprisal.
