Tuco a crossbreed of a Belgian Shepherd and a Pitbull and the first animal that for justice is seen as a sentient being according to what has been defined by the new Madrid standard on the legal regime of animals that came into force last January His story became known for a lawsuit that opened between his original human companion and a person who has been taking care of him for three and a half years According to what we read in the Iberian newspaper El Mundo, the civil court of Oviedo ruled last October that Tuco should have returned from person who had it at the beginning but the appeal to the provincial court reconsidered everything according to the new law which in the meantime entered into force. The second level judges have in fact specified that the dog is not a thing but have established that it is necessary to start from the principle of caring for the animal seen as a living being with sensitivity His well-being advises not to make changes to the current situation changes that may not be definitive and that could cause unnecessary suffering to the animal that would be abruptly separated from the person who has been its keeper for at least the last three years they say The Judges
