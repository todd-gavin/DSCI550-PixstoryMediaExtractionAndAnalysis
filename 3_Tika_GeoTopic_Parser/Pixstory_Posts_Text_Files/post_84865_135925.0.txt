pchelelsea have agreed a deal with FC Barcelona for the transfer of striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, according to Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. Marcos Alonso is included in the deal and will join Barcelona. The 33-year-old made a good start at the Catalan club last season as he netted 13 goals in 24 appearances. A buyout clause of 100m euros was inserted in his contract but Aubameyang has only played eight minutes of football for Barcelona this season.
The striker was the former captain of Chelsea’s local rivals Arsenal therefore it will be interesting to see how he is welcomed by Chelsea supporters. Once this deal is completed, it would be Todd Boehly’s seventh signing of the summer since taking ownership of the London club. £268 million has been invested into the club by the American for transfers this summer and after a poor start to the league campaign, it became crystal clear the Blues needed a centre-forward.
Chelsea began the season short of options at centre-forward after loaning out Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan and selling Timo Werner to RB Leipzig. Raheem Sterling has filled in at centre-forward, but it is evident that Sterling would be more effective playing in a wider position. Thomas Tuchel will now have this option at his disposal with the acquisition of Aubameyang.
Tuchel has worked with the Gabon forward previously at Borussia Dortmund where Aubameyang scored 79 goals in the space of two seasons. The 33-year-old has been given permission to fly to the UK for his medical and to finalise the deal. The forward is expected to be out of action for three weeks after suffering a minor fracture of his jaw in an attack on his home over the weekend.
Chelsea hope he will be able to take part in non-action training next week.
