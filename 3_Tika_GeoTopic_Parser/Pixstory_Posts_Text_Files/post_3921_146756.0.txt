One roof of land and water 
Yet many differences 
Good ?
Perhaps, yes 
Perhaps, no 
Religion hits down people, politics transformed to burning riots, borders to destroy the other, colours chokes the other to what?
To be wrapped in satins of cloths 
Peace found too late,
It’s not too late now,
Peacefulness awaits to be accepted 
Accepted to? 
To our hearts 
Peacefully you may sleep to rise to the glee of  acceptance.
