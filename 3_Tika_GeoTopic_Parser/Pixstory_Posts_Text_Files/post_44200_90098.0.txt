Ronaldo

Unlike Figo, the Brazilian Ronaldo is universally adored by fans of both teams because he was simply so excellent.

Ronaldo only stayed at Barca for one season, but it was one of the most impressive single seasons in Spanish football history.

In 1996-97, he scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions, but a contract disagreement forced him to leave for Inter for a world-record sum, breaking the record he set when he joined Barca from PSV. He won the Ballon d'Or that year.

Returning to Spain in 2002, Ronaldo became one of the leading lights of the Galactico generation, winning a second Ballon d'Or and top-scoring in La Liga.

However, his time at the Santiago Bernabeu brought only one league title and no Champions Leagues, before injuries and weight issues marked the beginning of a long decline.

Michael Laudrup

The Dane was a major member of the 'Dream Team' that won four straight La Liga titles under Johan Cruyff in the early 1990s, and is often regarded as the best player ever to come out of Scandinavia.

Laudrup's vision and wit made him probably one of the all-time greats, making him one of the most complete playmakers of all time.

"Pele was the finest in the 1960s, Cruyff in the 1970s, Maradona in the 1980s, and Laudrup in the 1990s," stated Frank Beckenbauer.

But, after five brilliant years with Barcelona, he split with Cruyff in 1994 and moved to Madrid, bringing his winning touch with him. In his first season, Madrid won their first league trophy in five years.
Laudrup was a part of two 5-0 Clasico victories, one in his final season at Barcelona and the other in his first season at Real Madrid.

He only lasted two seasons with Madrid before going to Vissel Kobe in Japan, but he was voted the club's 12th greatest player ever in a poll conducted by Marca in 2002.
