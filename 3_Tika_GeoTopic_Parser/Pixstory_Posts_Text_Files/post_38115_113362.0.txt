A Premier League footballer has reportedly been arrested by the English Police on 4th July 2022. The player was arrested in North London and is playing for one of the clubs that would play in the 2022/23 Premier League season. 

As reported by BBC Sports, The Metropolitan Police said, "On 4 July, an allegation of rape of a woman in her 20s was reported to the police. It was reported the alleged rape happened in June 2022."

The news source also stated, "On 4 July, a 29-year-old man was arrested at an address in Barnet on suspicion of rape and taken into custody where he remains. Inquiries into the circumstances are ongoing."

The identity nor the club of the said player has been released to the public as of now. The nationality also has been kept under wraps however the report does indicate that the "Premier League star" could represent his nation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. More details are expected about the incident in the coming days. 

This could be a third major sexual assault case that would rock the Premier League in a year. Last year, Benjamin Mendy, the Manchester City left back had been sent behind bars. The French defender had reportedly raped a woman in England last year along with his friend. Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood is also suspended after he is said to have hit and sexually assaulted his girlfriend. 

A decision on their future is yet to be made by the court.
