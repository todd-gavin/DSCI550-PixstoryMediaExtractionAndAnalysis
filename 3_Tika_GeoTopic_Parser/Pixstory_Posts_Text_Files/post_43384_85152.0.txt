It’s never easy being an empath. You feel anything and everything. You can feel the happiness or sorrows of people, animals and sometimes regarding inanimate objects (though it sounds funny to others but not to empaths). You can sense lies and truth. You are an overthinker as well. It’s like a gift but sometimes works as a curse too. I feel sociopaths live a better life.

Empaths even feel pain when someone is sick. It means they not only feel the emotions but also the physical pain of others. This might sound funny to some but this is true in a sense. Feeling same kind of symptoms of a disease of the sufferer isn’t I’m talking about. An empath just feels the pain what a person having a disease is going through. They don’t feel “okay” whenever people are suffering.

Me being an empath feel so much pain that others won’t understand about, but other empaths will understand. And this is the biggest problem that empaths are rare. And if you are an empath, having an empath as a friend or a partner would be a great thing.
