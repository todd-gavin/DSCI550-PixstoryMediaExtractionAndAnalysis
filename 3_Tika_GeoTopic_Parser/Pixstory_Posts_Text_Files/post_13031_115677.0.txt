Sports competitions under the title of "Solidarity of Islamic Countries" are scheduled to be held in Turkey in a month. In the draw of this tournament, the name of the national women's volleyball team of Afghanistan is in Group B; But this team cannot participate due to the Taliban's obstruction.

On the other hand, instead of them, the team of Afghan immigrants from Iran is supposed to participate.

The women's national volleyball team protested this decision and said that they will not allow those who "abuse" their favorite people to send them to international competitions under the name of the national volleyball team.

The members of the women's national volleyball team have asked that the organizing body of this tournament should be accountable to them and not allow "our right to be lost, the right that we have suffered and worked hard to get for many years".
The director of the Afghanistan national volleyball team said that they tried for years and fought against all the obstacles in the traditional society of Afghanistan to play sports; But now, due to the recent developments and the restrictions of the Taliban, they have lost their destiny.

After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, a number of female athletes left the country or stopped playing sports. Taliban members have called women's sports haram.

The manager of Afghanistan women's national volleyball team said that most of the members of this team are currently in Afghanistan or have migrated to Pakistan.
