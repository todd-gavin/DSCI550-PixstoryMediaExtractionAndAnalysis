Twitter never leaves the conversation when the discussion on cyber security is going on.
This is not the first time its security principles have been questioned, and we shouldn't be startled.
In a recent claim by the whistleblower, Pieter Mudge Zatko, the question is posed on the company's numerous security flaws and how it cannot shield the platform from unwanted and misleading information and issues.
Pieter Mudge Zatko is an infamous yet respected hacker who has acted as a bridge between the hacking community and government for decades.
His complaint made some essential allegations, firstly bringing into the light the security incidents that included 20 breaches in 2020 alone, other that Twitter doesn't prioritise the "removal of spam or bot accounts to the effect that CEO Parag Agrawal has previously described."
There are also claims regarding the company's false agreement to protect users' personal information.
There were also claims that questioned the company's way of leaving the insider threats "unmonitored". 
Although many call his complaint a false narrative, there won't be a reason to believe so. Twitter has accurately demeaned and falsified its image by constantly coming into the trap of these cybersecurity issues.
Also, the complaint had come when there was already chaos around Twitter's ownership. Zatko's allegations appear to bolster Elon Musk's claims about spam on Twitter.
It's high time for Twitter to acknowledge the concerns like any major company would do.
