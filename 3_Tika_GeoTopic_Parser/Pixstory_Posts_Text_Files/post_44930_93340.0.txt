The 36-year-old Brazilian, who has played more than 370 games for City in all competitions, revealed to the press ahead of Man City's Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday that he is unlikely to extend his stay with the Premier League champions for a 10th season.

When asked if he wants to play more outside of the Etihad Stadium, he said:

"Yes, I want to play. I want to play regularly.

"I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important for me."

Since joining City from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, the former Brazil international has won four Premier League titles and six League Cups. He signed a one-year contract extension in June.

Pep Guardiola, who was facing the media immediately after his club captain, was unaware of Fernandinho's possible departure.

When asked about Fernandinho's possible departure, Guardiola said: "Oh! I didn't know.

"We will see what happens. I don't know what will happen. He is so important. I'll ask him."

The City boss added: "At the end of the season we talk, maybe it's because of his family. I 
would love it. We will talk."

Guardiola said his club captain, who he hailed as a "great player for Manchester City," had 
continued to play a significant part with the Premier League champions since his last start in early March in a home Champions League fixture against Sporting.

The role Fernandinho plays this season - Pep likes the people who behave behind the scenes.

Pep knows what he has done, behind him, Fernandinho handles many Man City players and stars for the benefit of the team. Pep knows him well from day one to now always here as he is an incredible player for Man City.
