Early trends show that the BJP is leading in Uttar Pradesh and has crossed the halfway mark.

At about 1.10 p.m the figures released by the Election Commission of India showed that out of the total 403 constituencies, the status was known for 401 seats in UP, with the BJP leading in 252 seats, Samajwadi Party in 116 seats, RLD in 9 seats, Apna dal (Soneylal) in 9 seats and the BSP in 3 seats.

The early trends showed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is most likely to retain power in Uttar Pradesh.

In over three decades, since 1985, the state of Uttar Pradesh has never returned the same government to power. The BJP has termed the UP lead as a ‘historic victory’ for its ‘double-engine’ government.

The exit polls had earlier predicted a victory for the BJP. Amongst the star contenders, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was seen leading in Gorakhpur urban and Akhilesh Yadav who is contesting from Karhal constituency was seen leading with 48379 votes with Prof S.P Baghel of the BJP securing 19243 votes.
