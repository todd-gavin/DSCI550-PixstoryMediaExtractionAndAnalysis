In a recent selfie posted online on Monday, Ariana Grande was as radiant as a daisy. The "Thank u, next" singer is no stranger to dressing up, but she was excited to flaunt her perfect skin while promoting her own R.E.M Beauty brand on Instagram. She included some adorable before-and-after pictures of herself getting dressed up in the postings.
The Florida-born singer looked adorable in the shot, which appeared to be a flashback to her Sam & Cat days on Nickelodeon. Ari went completely natural, showing flawless, dewy skin as she picked up her cup of coffee and smiled at the camera.
She sat in the makeup chair, dressed in a strapless black lace gown with a scalloped hem. Her hair was curled into a tidy bun and she was wearing a lovely gold necklace.
