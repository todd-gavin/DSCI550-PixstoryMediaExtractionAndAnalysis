Abstract Aims People with type diabetes have increased risk of cardiovascular CV and kidney disease A hour ambulatory blood pressure BP measurement ABPM examines diurnal variations in BP We aimed to determine the prognostic significance of blunted decrease in nocturnal systolic BP of non dipping of nocturnal BP for CV and kidney disease and all cause mortality in type diabetes Methods From to at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen participants with type diabetes had hour ABPM obtained with a tonometric wrist watch device BPro HealthStats Singapore In outcomes composite CV endpoint all cause mortality decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR end stage kidney disease ESKD and a composite kidney endpoint including decline in eGFR ESKD and all cause mortality were registered Hazard Ratios HR were calculated using Cox regressions Results Participants were mean SD years old and had median IQR years diabetes duration Mean daytime and nocturnal systolic BP were and mm Hg while participants demonstrated non dipping After CV risk factor adjustments non dipping was associated with all cause mortality HR p and the composite kidney endpoint HR p Conclusions Non dipping entailed increased risk of all cause mortality and kidney disease in type diabetes Sources
