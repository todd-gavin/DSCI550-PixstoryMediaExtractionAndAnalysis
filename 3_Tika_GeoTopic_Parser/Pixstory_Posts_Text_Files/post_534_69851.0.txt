Tried making hummus after avoiding that important first attempt for years . 
I love cooking food, more the kind of food my grandmother/ mother have cooked for years. The recipes I have learnt more by watching /observed more. The haak, dried veggies, mutton dishes, the mutton and veggies together and much much more. Even try a few wazwan ones which come out fine. 
As I moved out of home for work and travel experienced other cuisines and gradually tried some. 
I have picked up some fairly well, some continental salads and sandwiches,the grills with different sauces, some batter recipes basically the easy ones, some breakfast ones some bakes. 
Chinese here and there . Like stir fries, some rice recipes, some gravy chickens like the regular chilly chicken or manchurian. 
I am good with kebabs also in Indian cooking, some dals. 
But somehow I always felt hummus needed some perfection which came with practice. 
That grainy but creamy texture sure needed some culinary skills. Everyone told me “it’s easy u cook well u will get it”.
I was reluctant to try. Like I am reluctant to bake. That was however till the other day. 
Another lockdown and a friend insisted it’s easy, instead of looking up recipes on the net I prefer spoken words. She made it sound easy and guess what,  it was .
I soaked the chick pea, put in garlic and herbs, had a churn with hand blender , added some  olive oil and done. And some citrus fruit (lemon) and stored it in a container. 
Had it with a chicken malai kebab home made pickles and guess what I had some peri peri oil. Few drops were enough to give it that extra kick. 
So People like me who have put that first attempt on hold , making hummus is no rocket science . Try it at home .
