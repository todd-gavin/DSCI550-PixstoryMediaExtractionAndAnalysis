Chelsea forward Timo Werner has landed in Germany for his medical as he looks to complete his £25m switch to Rb Leipzig.

The German international rejoined his former club for a fee of £20m and £5m in add-ons having departed the club for a move to Chelsea in 2020 for a price tag of £56m. 

The 26-year-old return move to Rb Leipzig represents a loss for the Thomas Tuchel-managed side who purchased the striker for more than twice the value of his return sale. But the forward who has falling out of place in the Blues squad for this season following an erratic stint at the club triggered Rb Leipzig’s intention to resign him. 

Timo Werner made 89 appearances for the London club scoring 23 goals in the process and while he was pivotal to Chelsea’s triumph in the Champions League in 2021, his inability to deliver consistently summed up to his tumultuous reign at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea have now sought for his replacement in the person of Raheem Sterling from Manchester City and have also secured the recruitment of Kalidou Koulibaly, Marc Cucurella and Carney Chukwueze from Napoli, Brighton & Hove Albion and Aston Villa respectively. With Wesley Fofana, Denzel Dumfries & Aubameyang on their transfer radar this summer, Chelsea are determined to strengthen their squad to compete for laurels this season.
