Chelsea have completed the signing of Inter Milan youngster Cesare Casadei for a fee of €15million which could potentially rise to €20million in add-ons provided that certain criteria are met. 

The Blues continue in their pursuit of growing a world-class academy and have added the 19-year-old midfielder to the influx of young talent that have already joined the team. 

They have recently brought in promising talents including Carney Chukwuemeka, Omari Hutchinson, Gabriel Slonina, Eddie Beach among others to Stamford Bridge with the Italian sensation being the latest addition. 

Casadei is seen as part of a midfield succession plan in south-west London as N’Golo Kante and Jorginho both approach the end of their respective contracts. 

Thomas Tuchel speaking on his signing during his Press Conference ahead of Sunday clash with Leeds said the Italian starlet needs time to acclimatise to the environment in English football. As such, will be given the much-needed time. 

“We will give him time. Time to learn the language and access him.”
