Climate change was not the sole topic in Australia's election – it never is – but it was the most prominent policy issue, with all of the winners – Labor, the Greens (who won two additional seats in the lower house), and the teal independents - pushing for more action and higher targets. 

The Guardian reported that climate action had a successful election for the first time in a long time. The question of why is instructive. The "black summer's" long legacy was undoubtedly a factor. However, the emergence of the teal independents – and the tectonic upheaval in Australian politics that it signifies – must not be overlooked. 

The Labor Party government, led by Anthony Albanese, has pledged to cut emissions by 43% by 2030. As prime minister, one of the co-authors of this piece, Malcolm Turnbull, committed to a target of 26-28% at Paris in 2015, in the expectation that the target would be increased. His successor Scott Morrison’s refusal to do so at the 2020 Glasgow COP was bitterly resented by Australia’s closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom.

It’s good to see our leaders realising the urgency of the problem of climate change and it’s becoming an imperative issue in the elections.
