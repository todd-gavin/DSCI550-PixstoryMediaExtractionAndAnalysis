Paris Saint Germain signed Lionel Messi on a two-year deal in 2021. The deal was certainly not cheap for the French champions. However, Messi's arrival has certainly boosted the clubs' image and has helped generate revenues of up to £700m. 
As per reports, PSG secured up to ten new sponsors, with the sponsorship fees increasing from around 3m to 8m euros since Lionel Messi's arrival. Dior, Gorillas, Crypto.com, PlayBetR, GOAT, Snart Good Thins, Volt, Big Cola, Sports Water, and Autohero are a few brands that have signed up with the Parisians since the arrival of the Argentine. 
To add to this, PSG have sold more than one million jerseys since the arrival of their #30. Of these, around 60 percent of the shirts have Lionel Messi's name on the back. The club's social media presence also grew with the arrival of the 7-time Ballon d'Or winner. The increase in the number of followers has also helped PSG attract more sponsors on their social media platforms as well. 
Even though Lionel Messi failed to live up to his expectations on the pitch, the Argentine has certainly helped the club grow leaps and bounds. It has to be seen what the 22/23 season holds for the PSG #30.
