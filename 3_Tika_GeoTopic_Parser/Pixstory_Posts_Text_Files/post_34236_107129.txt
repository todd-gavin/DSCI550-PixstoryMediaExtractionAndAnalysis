Sunday May Manchester City comes from behind to win against Aston Villa and are crowned Champions of England At the final whistle, the Etihad Stadium is full of chaos with fans entering the pitch to celebrate the victory Among the supporters there is also Ollie Gordon, a year-old Citizens fan who suffers from autism Ollie has started running autistic and not aware of the dangers He often goes to the stadium with his father especially recently explained Lauren the little fan&#39;s mother I was watching the match on TV and saw my husband running on the pitch but not Ollie I was in a panic I tried to get in touch with his father but nothing When the City fans attacked Olsen he was nearby and got scared Then luckily Cancelo approached him hugged him and took him away from other people everything was very fast People were pushing and pushing My son was terrified Home then he told us I almost died It could have gone very differently Cancelo could have run around screaming and celebrating with his mates but instead he stopped and took care of a year old boy bringing him back to his father We have not had the opportunity to thank him but he must know how grateful we are for what he has done We always go to the papers to complain about everything never to highlight something good We must acknowledge actions like this thanks Jo o
