Romelu Lukaku's statements last year took the world of football by surprise. A video
emerged of him praising Inter, vowing for a future return and remarking that the Nerazzurri
will always be in his heart emerged shortly after the Belgian was part of a disagreement with
coach Thomas Tuchel.

A few months on from the incident, and 'big Rom' still cuts a lonely figure at Stamford Bridge.

His Â£97.5 million return to Chelsea last summer broke multiple records. For Internazionale, it
was just another transfer that made amends for the financial situation they'd been under.

Since the 28 year-old's departure, Simone Inzaghi's arrival has helped restore calm at the
San Siro. It isn't quite the same though. They remain in the race for this season's Serie A
title but aren't nearly as relentless or intriguing to watch as Antonio Conte's famous team
were.

Along with Argentine forward Lautaro Martinez, Lukaku formed one of Europe's most fierce
attacking partnerships. Lukaku too, has failed to recreate the same form in London.

Customarily, this sort of thing gets people talking and leaves Chelsea vulnerable to losing a
top striker in the summer.

Now, Italian news outlet Gazzetta dello Sport have claimed that the striker has been getting
in touch with staff and directors at the club, discussing a return. Furthermore, TuttoSport
confirms the backing of Lukaku's return at the end of the season. Although this time, the
club's financial situation means they can afford Lukaku only on a temporary basis.

Loan deal or not, this is a player who desperately needs a breath of fresh air. Even with
everything that's been going on around Chelsea's situation, Lukaku's position at the club is in
jeopardy and for good reason.

 Belgium national team coach Roberto Martinez publicly stated
Lukaku's need for a move away from London last week.
