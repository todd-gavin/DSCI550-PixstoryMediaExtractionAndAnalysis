On the th episode of tvN s Twenty Five Twenty One Nam Joo Hyuk who plays a years old man confessed his love to Kim Tae Ri who plays a years old high school student The scene ended with Kim Tae Ri accepting his confession But shortly after the broadcast netizens expressed their criticisms for showing a relationship with the minor and media publicly romanticizing it In Korea the age of majority is int l age not Korean age You re an adult once you turn You go to a high school and you graduate when you are years old years old and you become an adult when you are years old Why do Viewers feel uncomfortable watching a yrs old high schooler accepting an confession of a college guy Quite a lot of girls in schools who were yrs then were dating college dudes years older than them and no one batted an eyelid as it was quite common What s your thoughts on this Do let me know
