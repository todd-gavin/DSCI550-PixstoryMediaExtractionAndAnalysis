One of India's most exquisite, serene, and revered (for Ladakhis) high altitude lakes is Tso Moriri Lake, located near Changthang, Ladakh. It is actually the biggest high-altitude lake wholly within Indian territory. This stunning blue lake is around 19 KM long and 7 KM wide at its widest point. The Tsomoriri Wetland Conservation Reserve, which is a component of the Ramsar site's wetland reserve, is where you cannot build anything or pitch a tent close to the lake's edge. It is the world's highest Ramsar site. There are many different types of plants and animals in the area. As a result of its proximity to the Line of Actual Control, one need to get Inner Line Permit to visit Tso Moriri.
