On Saturday, an explosion in Kharkiv destroyed a communal kitchen as part of Russia's bombing of cities across Ukraine. 

It alarms me that we have gotten so used to this destruction caused by war that these kind of events have become a part of our daily life now. Reading about the loss of life and property in Ukraine does not surprise us anymore. We read about it, feel sad for a minute and then move on with our day. Is it because we have become insensitive towards these things or because we have exhausted ourselves and no longer have the emotional capability to deal with it? It is for you to decide.

This time the attack was in a kitchen, selflessly providing food to people affected by war. But alas, even this was not spared. 

US News reported that the immediate aftermath of the alleged missile attack was captured by Associated Press journalists on the spot. Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, said three people were killed and 34 others were injured by missile strikes in his city alone on Saturday. 

World Central Kitchen, led by celebrity chef José Andrés, established the kitchen to develop feeding networks in disaster and war zones. Andrés tweeted that the personnel of the non-governmental organisation was shaken but safe.

The organization says it has now reached 30 cities across the country, providing nearly 300,000 meals a day. Andrés said the attack in Kharkiv shows that “to give food in the middle of a senseless war is an act of courage, resilience and resistance" and that his group’s chefs will keep cooking for Ukraine.
