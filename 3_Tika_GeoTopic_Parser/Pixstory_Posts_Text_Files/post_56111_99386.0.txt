A poem or song of lament written in honour of a deceased person.

The poem “In Memoriam A.H.H.” is an elegy written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in honour of his late friend Arthur Henry Hallam.

It also notes the poems with a pessimistic tone. In English literature, the more modern and limited meaning, of a lament for a departed beloved or tragic event, has been current only since the sixteenth century; the broader theory was still employed by John Donne for his elegies, written in the early seventeenth century. 

A distinct kind of elegy is the pastoral elegy, which uses the classical convention of representing its subject as an idealized shepherd in an idealized pastoral background and follows a rather formal pattern. It begins with an expression of grief and an invocation to the Muse to aid the poet in expressing his suffering. 

Some of the elegies are 

“Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” by Thomas Gray–inspired by the death of the poet Richard West

“In Memory of W.B. Yeats” by W.H. Auden–honouring the passing of Irish poet William Butler Yeats

“Adonaïs: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats” by Percy Bysshe Shelley–ma memorial poem for poet John Keat

Thyrsis” by Matthew Arnold–commemoration of the death of the poet Arthur Hugh Clough
