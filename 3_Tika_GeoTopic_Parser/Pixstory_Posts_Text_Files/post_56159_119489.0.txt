Volodymyr Zelensky has acclaimed Boris Johnson for his backing of Ukraine during the past six months, adding that he did not want him to “disappear” from politics. 

Mr. Johnson has overseen £3.8 billion of military and economic support to Ukraine and has visited its president since the Russian invasion in February.

Mr. Zelensky was asked whether he would support a campaign to put back Mr. Johnson, who leaves office at the end of September, after a petition for a vote on his future among disaffected Tory members earned more than 10,000 signatures.

“I have no right to play in politics inside the UK,” he said. “What I can say is he is a big friend of Ukraine.

“I want him to be somewhere in politics in a position to be someone. I don’t want him to disappear, but the decision is in the hands of the British people.

“But I am sure that whatever position he is going to take, he is always going to be with Ukraine. This is from the heart.” Speaking to Talk TV’s Piers Morgan Uncensored, he was also questioned about his message to Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, the Conservative leadership contenders competing to replace Mr. Johnson.

“What can I say? I would be happy to cooperate very closely like we used to have with Boris,” he replied. “The same close relationship with the UK and Ukraine.
