The older I'm getting the more I realise how much I love traveling, especially exploring hidden places. 

I recently witnessed these snow covered mountains in Jobari which is located in Himachal Pradesh. 

Jobari is the first base for the Hampta Pass trek, a 5-6 day trek. After trekking one reaches the Spiti Valley, and is one of the most beautiful treks in India giving glorious views of mountains and river, along with having extreme terrains and harsh weather conditions. 

Witnessing snow in Jobari was such a treat to my eyes. The village before Jobari is called Sethan which only consists of 200 houses and from Sethan the signal stops coming. 

There are so many off beat places like these spread across the country, although there are no wifi or signal in these places but you'll find better connection and connect with the nature at its best.
