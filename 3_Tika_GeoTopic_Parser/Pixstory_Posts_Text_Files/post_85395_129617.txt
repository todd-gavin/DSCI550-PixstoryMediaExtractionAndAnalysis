Has any one supposed it lucky to be born I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die and I know it I pass death with the dying and birth with the new wash d babe and am not contain d between my hat and boots And peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good The earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth I am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and fathomless as myself They do not know how immortal but I know Every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female For me those that have been boys and that love women For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted For me the sweet heart and the old maid for me mothers and the mothers of mothers For me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears For me children and the begetters of children Walt Whitman
