I love denim👖🔥.
If you’re anything like me, you like your legs to be free. Free to dance, free to move, free to lounge...you get it😉💕. Fitted styles are great and all, but they leave much to be desired when it comes to living in the peak comfort of your jeans♥️. Not to mention, wide-leg jeans just look cool—and who wouldn’t want that🤔😉💕?
Those of you who have yet to take a walk on the wider side may find the look intimidating🧐. Fear not, there are wide-leg jeans for everyone! I wore this wide legged black jeans and paired it up with a yellow crop top💛.
Tell me how's the fit💕??
