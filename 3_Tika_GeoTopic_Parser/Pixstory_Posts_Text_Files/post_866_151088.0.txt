Thus spoke Xhaka and Jesus after the Arsenal match.....
Granit Xhaka: “We saw yesterday in training that we were ready. 
He then said...."From the first second, we were the better team. In the second half, we were much better. It was my first derby goal in England, I am happy, but the most important is the team.”
Gabriel Jesus adds: “I think we deserved to win. We wanted to play the game, make chances. I feel at home. I’m really happy here and think we are in a good way.”
