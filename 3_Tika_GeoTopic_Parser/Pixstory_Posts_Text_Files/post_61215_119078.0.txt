This saffola oodles is really a great choice, It is the best choice for kidsâ€™ tiffin boxes, even a hasty breakfast and quick light dinner can be accomplished with Oddles. I basically love noodles but am worried about their ingredients, but this oodles is the best choice for health-conscious people as well, as it contains oats flour, semolina, dehydrated veggies, some spices, and its good to go.
