A day before the conclusion of their terms in the Rajya Sabha, central ministers Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and RCP Singh announced their resignations today.
As they attended the final cabinet meeting of the day this morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked both Mr. Naqvi and Mr. Singh.

Tomorrow marks the end of the Rajya Sabha mandates for Steel Minister RCP Singh and Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. Mr. Singh, the party's No. 2 candidate and a former confidant of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, was not renominated by the BJP because, according to rumours, his party boss was not pleased with his closeness to the party's senior partner.

It has been suggested that Mr. Naqvi, 64, could be the BJP's choice for vice president of India. Before submitting his resignation to PM Modi, Mr. Naqvi met with BJP president JP Nadda, igniting more discussion.

Mr. Naqvi was the only other minister in the BJP administration led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee who was not also the Union Defense Minister Rajnath Singh.
