Al Jazeera reported that the White House's increasingly ominous warnings about a Russian invasion of Ukraine are nothing more than a political ruse to help Democrats win Senate seats this year. 

This is not the opinion of a Capitol Hill political pundit, but rather what a Ukrainian woman who fled the rebel-controlled Donetsk region has to say about statements made by US President Joe Biden in recent weeks – ostensibly to gain political brownie points by deescalating the crisis ahead of the election.

Biden will resemble a super hero, a superman, by the autumn. Because he - think about it – avoided World War III," Oksana Afenkina, who left Donetsk in 2020 and now lives in Kyiv, Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. 

Despite the fact that some on Capitol Hill disagree, Afenkina is among the majority of Ukrainians who do not believe Russia will invade. 

Despite the fact that over 150,000 Russian troops are stationed along the border in occupied Crimea and neighbouring Belarus, only one in every five Ukrainians believes a full-scale confrontation is inevitable.

Only 20.4 percent of Ukrainians believe that a “full-scale invasion” will happen soon, and only 4.4 percent are adamant it is “definitely” taking place, according to a survey by the Gorshenin Institute, an independent pollster, conducted between February 2 and 14.
