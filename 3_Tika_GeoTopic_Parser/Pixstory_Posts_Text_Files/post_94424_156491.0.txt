       Capturing emotive moments when an elite professional golfer  hits classy shorts off the Tee or into the green during competitive rounds is a  photographers delight. Further seeing his  interactive moments through the lens is  even more special
You are seeing Yuvraj Singh Sandhu,  a leading professional golfer playing on his home course during the fifth edition of Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational by Take Sports. He is currently second on the Professional Golf Tour of India Order of Merit with four wins in 2022 season. With his ongoing hot streak, he is a strong contender for winning the PGTI Order of Merit.
We wish Yuvraj good luck for all his forthcoming tournaments.
