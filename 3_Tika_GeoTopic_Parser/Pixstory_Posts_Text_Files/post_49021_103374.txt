Sure you can But I believe that striking that balance is nearly difficult People have an incredible ability to justify things especially if their psychosis is shared by society as a whole therefore it s not hard for people to persuade themselves that they are animal lovers while condemning animals to horrific fates in the food industry But no that s a near impossibility It s not uncommon to witness someone snuggle and pamper a beloved dog before sitting down to a feast prepared by an animal fully as sensate and capable of fear pain and loyalty as the beloved dog This animal on the other hand will have never experienced a day of cuddling they d have known only terror and torment before being mercilessly slaughtered Unfortunately animals must be squeezed into tight spaces deprived of their independence mistreated tormented inseminated and ultimately killed in horrible ways in order to acquire meat Purchasing meat entails personally funding this You can proclaim yourself an animal lover and eat meat at the same time but that would be hypocrisy Would you call yourself a dog lover and be okay with eating dog meat Cat meat perhaps Somewhere the conditioning of our society makes us like cute animals more which is weird because that is so subjective We cannot make a simple connect between ourselves and the reality We find excuses over excuses to justify the murder of those innocent beings in those horrific conditions More excuses and more But that wouldn t change the fact no matter how much we try to overlook it that they suffer at our hands and we are in fact the villain of their story The worst villain someone could expect merciless cruel and non caring
