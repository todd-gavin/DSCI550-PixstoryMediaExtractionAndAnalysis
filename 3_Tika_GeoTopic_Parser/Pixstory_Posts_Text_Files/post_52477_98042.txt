So Yesterday applied for a Creative Writing intership in a Start up using Hirect We had a chat with ceo they called me for interview Today in the morning I made a Resume using Mind Map that s all I can think to be different from others I had no time so I decided keep it minimal In the way to the office I had different thoughts about the interview working in the company salary etc etc None of them came in the interview they asked me to write a Caption and in nervous I made Grammatical mistakes And in a conversation I said that I m not that professional I m just starting out and then I realised that I m not going to get selected I have no bad feelings abut this I don t know why usually I get angry inside my head thinking about becoming successful showing them that they rejected a useful resource But my thoughts are nothing like this instead I realised that I need to work really hard I need to be Professional Anyways got rejected but I m positive Rejection are important and they teach you that you need to upgrade yourself you need to improve youself you need to really work hard for yourself I think Rejection should be celebrated as giving us another opportunity that would never come if got Selected And I think Rejections are important That s all for today Thanks Stay khush
