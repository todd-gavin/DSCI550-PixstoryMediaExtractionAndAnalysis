People who have witnessed the incident are dismayed and intimidated by the horror of the violence.
Shawn Cortreauz, who visited Highland Park to see his in-laws, is saddened by the incident.
He came with his children to see the parade, and after a band passed by, he heard sounds that looked like firecrackers. 

"And my wife looks up and screams, 'Get up, run. Get up, run.' So I turned around, and I could see the shooter," Mr Cotreau, 47, said in an interview. His family was sitting around 20 feet away from the gunman on the roof of a cosmetics store firing down.

"I can't even get the image of the guy out of my head," he said, describing a man with a large weapon, "He was opening up the fire. And I saw the bullets hitting the tree in front of us."

Although the family was rescued, the incident has traumatised Mr Cotreau.
He cannot forget the sounds of the gunshots and people screaming around.

Witness Larry Bloom said it appeared to him that the sounds were a part of the parade.
 "I was screaming, and people were screaming," Bloom added. "They were panicking, and they were just scattering and I, you know, we didn't know. You know, it was right on top of us."
 
Another witness of the scene, Alexander Sandoval, expressed his horror feelings.
When the tragic shooting began, he was ready to enjoy the parade with his wife and children.
"When it started happening, I thought it was the Navy saluting the flag," Mr Sandoval said. "Then I grabbed my kid, and we ran and tried to break a store window to get away from it."
Trying to get his family to a safe place, he witnessed two to three people who had been shot. 
The unfortunate event horrified many people who were present to see the parade.
Sounds and images would always haunt them, as it could be even their lives in those six that got killed.
