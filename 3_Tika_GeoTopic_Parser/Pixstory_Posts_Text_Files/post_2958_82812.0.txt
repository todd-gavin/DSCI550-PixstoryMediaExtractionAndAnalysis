The Yaghan language in Chile had only one survivor who could speak in the native tongue, but with the death of Cristina Calderón, 93, that has come to an end.

Living on the southern tip of the South American continent, the language that survived for 6000 years has no living speakers. According to experts, Calderón was the last of the Yaghan people to speak the language, although some people from the tribe are there but have merged with other tribes.

Calderón's daughter is a lawmaker in Chile, but even she doesn't speak the Yaghan language. Her other six siblings also don't speak Yaghan. But it doesn't mean that Calderón didn't do anything to preserve the language. Along with her granddaughter, Cristina Zárraga, she created a Yaghan-Spanish dictionary.

Calderón, before her death, lived in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago near Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America. She had been the only speaker after the death of her sister Úrsula. Because of her efforts to preserve the language, she was recognised as the "living human treasure" by the Chilean government and UNESCO.
