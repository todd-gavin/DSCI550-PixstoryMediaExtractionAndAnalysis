One can t deny the part of religion in propagating hatred towards the LGBTQ community This worse is truly disturbing because of the violence it portrays we have a not so long history of books being banned for talking against religion So what about the religious books that stand against humanity Which openly promotes violence People while messing up with war destructions and morale forgot to think about themselves forgot to empathise They couldn t realise that sexuality is fluid even if they realise it they have been caught up about what will others think Rather than accepting who you are people tend to pretend to be someone they are not For those being queer might be a crime Loving must be a crime too Please understand all the religious books written are books The interpretations of the Bible we have now is being born out of discussions between various members upon each and every aspect and hence we might not find the incestual relationship between that brought the next generation after Abel and Cain in any Bible We might not find this in any books If there is a God who is an omnipresent being he would definitely understand that sexual orientation differs from human to human Hence he would also figure out that it isn t anything unnatural After all the construct of Jesus being a white man have also been the cause of oppression of black people as they considered themselves oppressed as the God was a white man whom they have to fear We see black people worshipping Jesus a black man today If you believe in God as Alice Walker said in Color Purple God is not a he she but an It This would make your life much easier And an omnipresent all knowing being could not discriminate against humans based on gender money or colour
