Approximately thirteen million people approximately of the U S population are victims of crime every year Approximately one and a half million are victims of violent crime source Federal Bureau of Investigation Self defence is the need of the hour While I understand the vehement protest against carrying of firearms because it has extreme ramifications what is the problem with stun guns Stun guns have been demonstrated to be non lethal self defense products that are both safe and effective They do not harm an attacker in any way that is permanent Adults will not be permanently injured or killed by stun guns due to the voltage it is the amps that will cause harm One amp is enough to kill a person The majority of stun guns only deliver milliamps or less That is well below the amperage that could cause long term harm to a person Moreover stun guns can be a game changer when it comes to safety of women Women walk streets everyday with a constant fear of getting assaulted The legal and all or nothing aspect of firearms makes it tough to use them but a stun gun is a game changer It gives any women that small window of opportunity without killing anyone to get away or get help from a potential situation of assault There are a thousand things that can go wrong with even a knife or pepper spray carried for self defence but I don t see people advocating against it If you ban all things and police only acts AFTER the crime has taken place what I am supposed to defend myself with A straw So if people get a sense of protection with carrying a stun gun what is wrong with it
