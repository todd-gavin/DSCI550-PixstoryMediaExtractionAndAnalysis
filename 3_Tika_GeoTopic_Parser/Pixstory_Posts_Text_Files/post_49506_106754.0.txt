In all honestly, I am fascinated by this genre. Every books I see have always the same goal but different path. Now that's what attracts me to these books. I love reading about how different people think of the same thing. How every perspective is different from the other. I don't read those books for the purpose of getting help. People's perspectives on life intrigue me. I admire how they use their heads to come up with new ideas, and I'd like to see how it works on me first. It's all about learning and trying new things for me.

Like you said, books are only words. The most they can do is motivate you, not get the task done. And this is something people don't understand while reading these books. They tend to have higher expectations â€“ expectations of some miracle. I've always believed reading is always good. You always learn something new. There's never a harm in making reading your habit. Even if you read about the most bizarre things, you're still learning something new.

What goes wrong is thinking they're the only solution to all your problems.
