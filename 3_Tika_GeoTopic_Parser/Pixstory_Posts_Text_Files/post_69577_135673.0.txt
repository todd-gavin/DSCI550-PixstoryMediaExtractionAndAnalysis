It is roughly 60 kilometres from Srinagar city and 8 kilometres from Anantnag. Achabal is one of the finest examples of Mughal style gardens that were created in Kashmir. Due to a historic spring that is encircled by a terrace garden that was created by the Mughals, this location is well-known around the world. The visitor is in awe of this location's historical significance. The gorgeously designed Achabal Garden in Kashmir, which served as the Mughal Empress Noor Jahan's refuge for leisure, has its own distinct attraction and personality. One of the best Mughal gardens in the Indian subcontinent due to its beautiful charm. The spellbinding splendour of this Mughal-style garden is difficult to put into words. Malika Noor Jehan Begum created the upper area of the garden, which is referred to as "Bag-e-Begum Abad," in 1620. Later, it gained notoriety as Sahib Abad, where there was a "Hamam" or water treasure that was heated by a tosing or logical lamp. A strong spring that enters the garden as a cascade inspired the creation of the landscape. The loving wife of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir is credited with designing this exquisite garden.
