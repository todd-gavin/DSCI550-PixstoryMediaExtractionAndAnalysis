In the process of thinking about Salary discussion I had a thought of Risk & Comfort.

Comfort is like Salary that will give you security in the sence of money, and you'll get money even if you are underperforming.

‚öñÔ∏èOn the other hand Risk is like Share, share in the company, org (ESOP). When you take risk you tend to work hard to get the reward worth of taking that risk.

If you're going to work for a well known/ successful company then you may consider salary.

If you're going to work for a Start-up or low level organisation where you could be at a managerial position then try to bear Risk.

When you go out of your comfort zone you take risk of uncertainties. And that risk will return you highest reward.

üí°Risk & comfort are not limited to Salary and ESOP, it can be applied to every field of your life.
Get out of your comfort zone of not exercise you will be rewarded with fitness.
Get out of your comfort zone & take a risk of trying something new in your work.
Take risk of failure when starting a new thing.
Take risk of rejection by getting out of your comfort zone and applying for something.

Hope you got an idea about Risk & Comfort. Note it!

Thanks
Stay Khush!
