The Houston Rockets would be interested in trading John Wall for Russell Westbrook if they were incentivized, sources tell Marc Stein of Substack.

The Rockets traded for Westbrook during the 2019 offseason and then traded him for Wall in 2020 in which they received a first round pick.

With Wall not currently playing and no buyout on the horizon, the Rockets are unlikely to find another trade option before his contract expires in 2023. Houston would seek "sufficient draft compensation" for taking on Westbrook, who has struggled with his first on the Lakers' roster. The Lakers could offer their 2027 first round pick or multiple second rounders. Westbrook wouldn't play for the Rockets, just as Wall hasn't played since last season.

The scenario is described by Stein as unlikely between now and Feb. 10th.

The Lakers gave up a first round pick plus three rotation players in Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Montrezl Harrell in order to acquire Westbrook from the Washington Wizards.
