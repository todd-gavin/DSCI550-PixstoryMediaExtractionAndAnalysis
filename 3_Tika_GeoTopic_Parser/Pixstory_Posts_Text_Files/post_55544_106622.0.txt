Starring and executive produced by Thomas Jane , Troppo is based on the first of Candice Fox’s best-selling Crimson Lake thrillers. Jane plays ex-cop and American ex-pat Ted Conkaffey who, after being falsely accused of committing a horrendous crime, escapes the fallout by hiding out in the tropics of Far North Queensland. 

While there he is sucked into a missing person-turned-murder investigation along with convicted murderer Amanda Pharrell who has her own dark secrets.

The setting is uniquely Australian, complete with snakes, crocodiles, sugar cane fields, and mangroves; the hazy tropical heat literally oozes from the TV screen. As per collider, while the plotting may be sluggish at times — like a Far North Queensland summer day — Troppo’s complex storyline and diversity of supporting characters make for a compelling crime drama about second chances.
