That one minute you have till mom comes and opens the door for you to get up and get ready so that she doesn't get to know you hadn't woken up till then feels like an even shorter amount of time when you're running all over your room trying to do everything😂
Even the way you wake up is so effective and immediate in that moment of realisation😂🤦‍♀️
