Turin conquers the Bentegodi of Verona and reaches points in the standings A record for its coach Ivan Juric who until today had not gone beyond the points in a championship coincidentally just when he was coaching Verona and in addition there is still a game missing on Friday next against Roma who will have to play in the Conference League final a few days later. From the away match in Veneto, the grenades come back with the three points thanks to a move signed by Brekalo in the twentieth of the first half, the points in the table less than the ninth place occupied by Verona I&#39;m happy this goal but they are even more so for the boys who have worked very hard since the start of the training camp it was not easy to score points excellent result Juric said at the end of the game deserved victory in the second half we could have finished it we had goals for the we hit the post The team played a serious game just tough against a team that looks good Congratulations to the guys they gave me a good answer Winning in this environment was super difficult The applause from the Veronese I left a piece of my heart here the place where I found myself best in my whole life i had two great years for my family too
