Unlucky day for Berrettini and elimination in the first round of the Montreal tournament Instead, everything went wrong in Montreal The Italian&#39;s legs were tired and this cost him not only the match but also precious points for entry to the Finals in Turin The defeat will not give him the opportunity to see the blue derby in the second round against Fognini Playing Pablo Carreno Envelope There are good days and less good days and today was really a bad day There was no problem in particular I just didn&#39;t find any aspect of my game that I could stick to Berrettini told Ubitennis Luckily there will be other matches other tournaments now I definitely need one or two days off and then we&#39;ll decide with my team whether to stay here to train or go straight to Cincinnati
