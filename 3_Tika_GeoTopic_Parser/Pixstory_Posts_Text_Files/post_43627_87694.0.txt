These two steal every scene in the Netflix and HBO Max series, respectively. Now, there are talks that Jung Ho Yeon could join Zendaya as a co-star for Euphoria. Squid Game was recently nominated for three awards at the 27th Critics’ Choice Awards and won two. Lee Jung Jae won “Best Actor,” and the Korean thriller series won “Best Foreign Language Series.” The stars attended the event and were interviewed ahead of the ceremony. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Jung Ho Yeon was asked about her iconic meeting with Zendaya back at the 2021 CDFA Fashion Awards. So, it was suggested that perhaps Jung Ho Yeon could appear on Euphoria next season. Jung Ho Yeon responded positively, expressing that she would agree if asked. She also revealed that she had recently visited the TV series’ set and felt welcomed.

I would love to! Once I visited the set of Euphoria, and it was so nice to see the set because it’s been a while after Squid Game. It was weird because I felt so comfortable. I’m not a team of Euphoria, but I felt more safe and comfortable. So, yeah.

Zendaya is not the only Euphoria star Jung Ho Yeon has met with. Last year, she met Angus Cloud at Louis Vuitton‘s event in Malibu, California. The two also became mutuals on Instagram. They frequently interact, liking each other’s posts. Considering Jung Ho Yeon is great friends with Zendaya, who is not only a lead actress but an executive producer of Euphoria, it seems likely we could see her on Euphoria in the future. She certainly has the acting chops for the heavy drama, and she can totally pull off the concept, as is evident in previous photoshoots. Fans agree that she would be an asset to Euphoria, too, as there are little to no Asian characters. Euphoria would benefit from more diversity.
