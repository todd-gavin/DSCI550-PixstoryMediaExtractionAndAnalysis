Alina MS housewife Alappuzha In Kerala it s not safe to travel around as a couple without a marriage certificate The first time I realised this was when my husband and I went for a vacation three months after my marriage We had booked a room at a resort in Thenmala which is a popular eco tourism destination in the state We were so excited that we got into checked into one of the best rooms at the hotel Later that evening as I went out for a stroll outside the resort a few guys from nowhere began to stalk me As I quickened my pace one of them over took me and started enquiring about my whereabouts Another wanted to know about the male friend I am staying with I ignored their questions and somehow managed to reach the hotel I was so afraid that I didn t even tell my husband about it Later that night as I was beginning to feel a little relaxed the hotel manager came and knocked on our door He began to look at us searchingly and started asking all sorts of pointed queries From my room I could see some of those guys who stalked me standing outside The manager insisted that we produce our marriage certificate We vacated the room that very same night I have never felt so humiliated in my life Even today whenever I think about Thenmala I get panic attacks As told to thapasya The series is a part of a VVOX initiative against moral policing
