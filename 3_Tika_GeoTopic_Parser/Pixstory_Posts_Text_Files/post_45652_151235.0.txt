Covid restrictions will continue in Hollywood. This protocol was adopted on September 21, 2020, and was initially scheduled to expire on April 30, 2021, but was extended without significant changes.ET reports that there are strict testing regimes, physical distancing, Covid-suited staff, careful use of personal protective equipment and a 'zone' system that ensures different production areas are tightly controlled on the basis of cast members, who often cannot wear masks and maintain social distancing. Zone A, where actors work without masks, is most restrictive of safe work zones on the sets.The restrictions were renewed on June 30, 2021, and amended to allow producers to implement mandatory cast and crew immunisation policies on a Zone A production base after three weeks. Additional extensions were granted on November 11, 2021, January 24, 2022, February 16, April 29 and May 6, 2022.
