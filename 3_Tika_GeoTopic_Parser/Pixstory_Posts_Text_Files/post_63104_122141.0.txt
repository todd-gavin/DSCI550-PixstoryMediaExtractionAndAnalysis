According to Flag Code of India 2002, Khadi or hand-spun cloth is the only material allowed to be used for the flag to be hoisted. Flying a flag made of any other material is punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, besides a fine. Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool.

It takes six steps to make a flag:

Hand spinning

Hand weaving

Bleaching and dyeing

Chakra printing

Stitching and toggling.

Nine different sizes of national flag are made. The National Flag, says the Flag Code of India, should be rectangular and with a ratio of 3:2. 

The Tricolour is made in nine different sizes, each meant for different displays. For example, the 450X300 mm size flag is to be used by aircraft on VVIP flights, the 225X150 mm flag is meant for motor-cars and 150X100 mm size is for table flags.

The biggest one (14x21 feet in size ) is hoisted at Gwalior Fort, Kolhapur Raigad Fort and Nalgonda Fort.

The flags hoisted at the Rampart of the Red Fort measure 8x12 feet, while the flags fly high at Parliament House and state assembly buildings lengths up 6x9 feet. Flags with dimensions of 3x4 feet or 2x3 feet are hoisted on government and public service buildings. 

The Ashok Chakra printed in the centre of the flag is printed in navy blue ink on a white base using the screen printing technique. Every day 20 pieces of Ashok Chakra are printed and left to dry for two days before being stitched together with the other two parts (saffron and green bands) of the flag.
