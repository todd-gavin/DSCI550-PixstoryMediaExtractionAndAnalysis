Lee Zeldin a Republican candidate for governor of New York State and current House Representative was recently attacked with a knife during a campaign stop while delivering a speech The man wrestled Zeldin to the ground as security pounced from above and Zeldin escaped unscathed There are too many individuals who feel empowered to assault and who seek to maim or murder others in the name of their political ideals Countless people have been misled by the media and influential politicians into believing that the opposition is not only a group of individuals with opposing viewpoints but that they are the enemy and want to bring about the end of the world and the destruction of individual liberties Political violence whether directed against a leader or an ordinary citizen is abhorrent and must always be condemned Thankfully Lee Zeldin got away unscathed But what will occur the following time if nothing is done
