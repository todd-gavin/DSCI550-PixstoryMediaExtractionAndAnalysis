The president of Fiorentina Rocco Commisso returned to talk about the transfer of Dusan Vlahovic to Fiorentina, once again using very harsh words towards his ex With Dusan we were seventh without we finished seventh With Juventus he scored the same number of goals as Piatek and Cabral together We didn&#39;t lose much by selling Vlahovic even if those who think they know the future say that with him we would have gone to the Champions League the Italian-American made his debut The allegations against the prosecutors also confirmed I repeat his prosecutors and he weren&#39;t honest with me Before Ristic told me he only wanted to talk to me then pretended to go to the bathroom during the summit to talk to two friends The next day he told me we could work out a net million deal going from to as request in hours AND asking first then for them more a percentage on the transfer of the player and a percentage on the future team Negotiations ended and I learned a great lesson by not accepting all this and telling my parents to get another center forward The young gentleman ruined us by saying he was staying when we signed Piatek and Cabral understood that he we would have put him on the bench and he too learned his lesson Arsenal Real and Atletico didn&#39;t want him Juve yes and we sold
