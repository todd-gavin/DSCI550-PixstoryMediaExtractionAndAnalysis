Matteo Guendouzi

The midfielder joined Arsenal in the summer of 2018/19 and was known for his passion and aggression. The player featured over two seasons for the Gunners and had just one assist to his name. Mikel Arteta was not happy with the player’s attitude and was sent on loan to Hertha Berlin which was largely unsuccessful. Guendouzi was again sent on loan in the 2021/22 season to Marseille and the player starred in Marseille’s campaign. He had four goals and six assists in Ligue 1 alone. 

Stephan Lichtsteiner

Stephan Lichsteiner was a stop-gap solution for Arsenal’s leaky defense. The Switzerland veteran joined Arsenal on a free transfer from Juventus. The player left even before Arteta came in. The player featured for Augsburg for a while before hanging his boots from professional football. 

Bernd Leno

After the departure of Petr Cech, Arsenal were looking to sign a shot-stopper. Unai Emery signed Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen. After being a first-choice shot-stopper for the Emirates outfit, the player lost his spot to Aaron Ramsdale in the 2021/22 season. The German player featured only four times in the EPL and might lose out the spot in the World Cup 2022 squad.
