In previous years, these days, the happy atmosphere of Nowruz prevailed in different cities of Afghanistan. People and officials were preparing for Nowruz, spring and solar New Year, especially in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif.

Nowruz and the beginning of the new year are also one of the few occasions when women in Afghanistan go to nature in groups, have fun and have fun.

 This year, such an atmosphere and atmosphere of Nowruz is not seen in Afghanistan.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the BBC that the Taliban government would not prevent people from celebrating Nowruz, but that the Taliban would not officially celebrate Nowruz: "We do not celebrate any ceremony that is not in Islam."

 When the Taliban were in power between 1996 and 2001, they prevented Nowruz celebrations.

But the ancient celebration of Nowruz in Afghanistan and neighboring countries and the region, including Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iraq, has been going on for centuries.
