‌Have you heard of Lewis and Clark Expedition? It was an expedition to cross the newly acquired western portion of the country after the Louisiana Purchase. There was a woman who did the most part in the expedition 
‌
‌Sacagawea was a woman from the Lemhi Shoshone tribe who at age 16, helped the Lewis and Clark Expedition in accomplishing their chartered mission objectives by exploring the Louisiana Territory. 
‌
‌Sacagawea travelled through the expedition of thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean, helping to create cultural contacts with Native Americans and contributing to the expedition's knowledge of natural history in different regions.
‌
At the age of  12, she was captured, enslaved and finally bought by a fur trader who forcefully married her. She did make lemonade with the lemons life gave her! She ended up being a communicator and guide which her husband was supposed to be; to the Lewis expedition team. She played much more than her role: searching for edible plants, making moccasins and clothing, as well as allaying suspicions of approaching Indian tribes through her presence; a woman and child (she was pregnant during that time) accompanying a party of men indicated peaceful intentions.
‌
‌She was indeed an important part of the expedition. The National American Woman Suffrage Association of the early 20th century adopted her as a symbol of women's worth and independence, erecting several statues and plaques in her memory, and doing much to spread the story of her achievements.
