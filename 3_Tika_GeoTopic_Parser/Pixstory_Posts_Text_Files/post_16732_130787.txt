I personally believe this Hindi remake would be a flop I don t think Hrithik Roshan is the perfect cast for Vijay Sethupathy His looks or voice are never perfect for a Villain material Casting should be the opposite way Saif can do both characters with ease Saif is a perfect Villain AntiHero material His looks voice and acting perfectly match or even can exceed VJS Hrithik should have been cast for Madhavan s role But I don t think Hrithik can do justice to VJS s role So I strongly believe this version would backfire A perfect cast is needed for a successful remake Some successful recent examples are DRISHYAM OF AJEY DEVGAN AND KABIR SINGH OF SHAHID KAPOOR THESE BOTH MOVIE WAS A FOOD REMAKE OF THERI ORIGINAL VERSION
