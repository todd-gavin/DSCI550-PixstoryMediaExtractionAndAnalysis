In August 1947, nearly 12,00,000 Sindhis left their homes one fateful night, leaving their keys with their neighbours. They thought they would come back when things became quiet, but they left never to return. And when they left, they also left their culture behind.
'Doorway to Sindh', a new festival slated to be held on 4 September and organised by the Sindhi Culture Foundation, is now taking Sindhis back to their homeland through a series of talks hosted by scholars, historians, archaeologists and anthropologists. The event curated by Madnani, who has had the opportunity to visit Sindh in 2018, will revolve around oral history, art, craft, language and more over a series of six sessions.
The first session, titled ‘Sindh—Real and Imagined’ delves into the dissipation of the language and occupations of the Sindhi diaspora. 
Another session will explore Marui, a folktale based on a girl who was born in a community of nomads in the Thar desert in Sindh and whose legend is immortalised in the works of poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai.
One of the talks will examines the third millennium B.C. civilisations of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa near the Indus River in Sindh (modern-day Pakistan). 
The last talk hosted by Dr Jürgen Schaflechner, a researcher and filmmaker who has documented the lives of refugees in India, will discuss spaces sacred to the Sindhi community, including the Hindu pilgrimage site Hinglaj, along trading routes, from the coastal regions of Sindh all the way to Maharashtra.
