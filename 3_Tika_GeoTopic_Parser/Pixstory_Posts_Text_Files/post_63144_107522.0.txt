Streaming news updates: The TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called a meeting of the opposition on Wednesday to forge a consensus on fielding a joint candidate against the NDA in the presidential election. The TRS, BJD, AAP, and SAD are likely to skip the meeting. Banerjee summoned representatives from 19 political parties, including seven chief ministers, to a meeting in the national capital last week in an effort to unite the opposition ahead of the July 18 election.
