‌What would be the intention behind Zelenskyy's virtual address? The reason is almost obvious as there have been only words but no action from the side of the US. Ukraine requires help as situations aren't improving. 
‌
‌Zelenskyy will talk to the members of the US House of Representatives and US Senate on Wednesday. 
‌
‌The US, even though extends support to Ukraine, they have not stopped the supply of weapons to Russia. (The US is still delivering Javelin anti-tank rockets and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Russia.)
‌
‌Yet, Congress recently endorsed $13.6 billion in the emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. This could still not be a solution for the havoc caused.
‌
‌Zelenskyy had pushed European Union and NATO for military hardware and more support to stop the military invasion in Ukraine, he had further asked to establish a no-fly zone over Russia. US and NATO however are in a dilemma as this could affect the neighbouring countries. 
‌
‌As per CBS News, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the "Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face Putin's cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine."
‌
‌War is always a tyranny and here the US certainly has the power to stop it. It's a shame if not interfere now as it has become a situation wherein a US citizen is involved too namely, Elon Musk who challenged Putin for single combat putting Ukraine at Stake.
