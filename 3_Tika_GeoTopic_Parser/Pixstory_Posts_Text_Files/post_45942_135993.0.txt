Parenting is the one occupation that genuinely requires a full-time commitment. The labour of a parent is never over, as any mom will attest to. You run the risk of burning out if you do not take some much-needed "me time," though. Everyone must remember to periodically recharge their batteries, after all. 

However often, moms are shamed for relaxing and are termed as “lazy” or “bad moms” for doing so. Owing to this societal pressure, moms find it hard to relax! 

And this is exactly what leads to mom burnout. A situation where moms are exhausted: physically, mentally and emotionally! 

For moms, it takes expertise to be able to unwind. Some people will find it easier to do than others, just like with any skill. Many people believe that being lazy is a personality attribute, yet this is untrue.  

The importance of relaxation cannot be overstated, and it has several advantages. Regularly unwinding can improve both your memory and your sleep. Along with reducing anxiety and increasing energy, it also benefits those who struggle with depression or are frequently stressed out.

Afterall, moms are humans too!
