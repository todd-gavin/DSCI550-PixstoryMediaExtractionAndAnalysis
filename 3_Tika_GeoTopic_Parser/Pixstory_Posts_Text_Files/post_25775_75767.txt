Environment which provides us n number of benefits we are harming it day by day This is the post of the only left Male Northern white Rhino named sudan which died at the age of on March Now we are only left with female rhinos named fatu and najin but both of them are not able to reproduce because they have the reproductive problems Now the status of this white rhino is critically endangered They are on the verge of extinction African Government found some solutions like cloning and IVF technique to preserve them But its too late now we face the consequences of our own actions These rhinos are killed by poachers for their horns we should take stand and should avoid to buy the products made up from animal products We should keep in mind that we have borrowed this land from our future generations not from our ancestors
