The early returns on the Kings flurry of trades before the deadline look very promising. Unloading Haliburton for Sabonis has balanced out the team and has allowed Fox to flourish back in his natural position at PG averaging 28 points and 7 assists a game since the trade. Sabonis has also been an amazing presence averaging nearly 20 points, 12 rebounds and 6 assists a game. Harrison Barnes has also played very well as the 3rd best player averaging 20 points and 6 boards a game. 

Unfortunately and fortunately, the trades haven’t translated quickly into wins meaning the Kings will have a good draft position and need to prepare for the NBA draft. The good news is they now have solid pieces in place. 

So who should the Kings pick? Their biggest needs are now at power forward and shooting guard. Donte DiVincenzo and Justin Holiday who were both acquired before the deadline, have looked serviceable alongside rookie Davion Mitchell. The biggest need is clearly a power forward which is why the Kings should focus on drafting Keegan Murray from Iowa.

Averaging 23 points and 8.5 boards a game, Murray has a special knack for finding different ways to score using his tools, motor, instincts and improving shot-making. Best of all, Keegan is not the type of player who regularly needs plays run for him which will make him a perfect fit playing alongside the Kings current big 3. Keegan is also versatile defender who shows a lot of smarts and awareness on that end of the floor which will be very helpful Play along side their weakest defender, Sabonis. Sabonis is tough but not mobile enough to guard athletic bigs. Murray has enough mobility to step out and guard in space and is a committed rebounder who works hard on the glass. He’s got plenty of length, with a reported 6-11 wingspan and has all the size and physical tools to be a big time NBA player.
