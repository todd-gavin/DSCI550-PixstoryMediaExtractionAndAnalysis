The saga regarding Erling Haaland is finally over for now as Manchester City have successfully negotiated the transfer of the Norwegian from Borussia Dortmund The deal was done in a interesting way and no doubt Manchester City got the better part of it Dortmund set a price of M last season to wander off interest from other European clubs and buy themselves enough time to find a replacement This season there was the opportunity of activating his release clause of around million and signing him on a permanent transfer While this season only Real Madrid were in the race along with Manchester City for the signature of the young superstar but still the Norwegian chose Man City over the historic Real Madrid We take a look at three reasons why Erling Haaland chose the sky blues instead of Los Blancos WAGE DEMANDS Due to Erling Haaland s enormous wage demands and exorbitant commission rates to his agent and father Alfe Ing Haaland Real Madrid backed out even after sending in a bid to buy him Although the transfer fee of M seems a bargain for the upcoming superstar but the costs that he will bring will surely become a burden for a club like Real Madrid INCOMING MBAPP The second reason is the pretty obvious one With Mbapp s probable transfer to Real Madrid from PSG also forced Los Blancos to pull out of the race for Haaland s signature Real are confident that they will be better off with Mbapp as too many superstars in a single team doesn t guarantee trophies learning this from the Galactico era this goes with the saying Too many cooks spoil the broth INJURY PRONE Haaland is a injury prone player and after dealing with Hazard for the past few years Real Madrid will not bet in a player who has a chance of spending more time in the hospital than he is playing These were some of the reasons that I mentioned surrounding Haaland s transfer to City instead of Real Madrid Feel free to drop yours in the notes section
