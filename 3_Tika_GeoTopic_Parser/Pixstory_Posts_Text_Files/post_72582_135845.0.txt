I don't know why love has connection with rain...
May be because of it's melodious tone dripping from clouds
Or
Rhythmic intonation or silence when it slices the soul of soil...
Like love, rain shades away beyond prediction...
Like love, rain captures memories from the folders of our life..........
But sometimes the relation between love and rain will be death....
As both will leads us to the world of hidden darkness!!!
