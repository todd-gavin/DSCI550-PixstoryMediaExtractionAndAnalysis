Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift of God which is why we call it the present You may say I m a dreamer but I m not the only one I hope someday you ll join us And the world will live as one Hold fast to dreams For if dreams die Life is a broken winged bird That cannot fly Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all
