On July 10, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated LuLu Mall in Lucknow. The grand opening witnessed a footfall of over one lakh people. Two days later, on July 12, an unidentified group of men offered namaz inside the shopping arcade. A footage of the incident was widely circulated online. Shortly after, an FIR was filed by the mall’s public relations manager Sibtain Hussain at the Sushant Golf City police station.

Subsequently, members of Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha staged a protest outside the mall and sought permission from the local authorities to recite Hanuman chalisa. On July 15, four people attempted to carry out religious prayers inside the mall premise. On July 16, two youths recited Hanuman chalisa while sitting right below a mall notice forbidding religious prayers. All of them were soon arrested. Those who seek to follow key events related to this controversy can read this report by The Quint.

On July 18, National Herald, a national newspaper linked to the Indian National Congress (INC), reported, “Even as Lucknow Police claim to have launched a manhunt for miscreants who offered Namaz at the mall on Wednesday, CCTV footage exposes they were novices and probably non-Muslims.”

On the same day, journalist Rohini Singh tweeted, “So it turns out that those offering the namaaz at Lulu mall in Lucknow were actors who probably wanted to create social unrest.” This tweet gained over 2,000 retweets.
