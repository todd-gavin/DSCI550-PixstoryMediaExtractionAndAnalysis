Coach Mike Budenholzer had no new information on Khris Middleton's availability for the Milwaukee Bucks' Eastern Conference semifinal clash against the Boston Celtics on Friday. 

US News reported that Middleton indicated a week ago that he planned to be back in two weeks after suffering a knee injury. That means he'll be out for at least the first two games of the Celtics series, which begins in Boston on Sunday. 

It's unclear whether he'll be able to return that quickly. The three-time All-Star hasn't played since spraining his left knee's medial collateral ligament in Game 2 of the Bucks' first-round series against the Chicago Bulls on April 20.

“There’s nothing new on his timeline,” Budenholzer said. “When we have something to update you with, we will. There’s nothing new.”

While Budenholzer expressed optimism that George Hill may return at some point during the Celtics series, the 35-year-old guard isn't anticipated to play on Sunday. With an abdominal strain, Hill was forced to miss the whole Bulls series.
