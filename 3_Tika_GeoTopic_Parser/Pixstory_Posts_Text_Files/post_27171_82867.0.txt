In 2017, Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola referred to Tottenham Hotspurs as the “Harry Kane Team” for which he was rightly criticised. 5 years on and his comments have come to bite him back. Harry Kane ended City’s 15 game unbeaten run by scoring a last minute winner to earn Tottenham all 3 points. Not only did it ‘spur’ Tottenham’s challenge for the Champions League spots but also the Premier League title race. 

Expectedly so, the Citizens dominated 78% possession and had 21 shots on Spurs’ goal but they quickly realized that a deep lying and narrow back 5 would be hard to penetrate. In his post match press conference, Antonio Conte mentioned that he coached his team to transition quickly for an effective counter. And the plan worked to perfection with all 3 goals coming as a result of the defence to attack transition. Kane and Heun-Ming Son's telepathic connection was evident from Spurs’ second goal - pinpoint cross and precision finish. Had Kane taken all his chances, Sonny would have finished the game with a hat-trick of assists. 

What seemed to be a one-horse race, Man City’s loss has now handed Liverpool their future in their hands. The two teams are six points apart with Liverpool having a game in hand and the teams yet to play each other at the Etihad. And Spurs themselves are now only 4 points off the top 4 with 2 games in hand to current 4th place Manchester United.

The last leg of the Premier League is proving to be an exciting one with the possibility of the title race going down right to the wire!
