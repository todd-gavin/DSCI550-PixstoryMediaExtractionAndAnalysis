Gameweek 1 against FC Zurich will see a number of first team players rested, with our squad being tested as we take on more games this season. Key injuries to Partey, Elneny and ESR may see some key players starting the game so it’s essential we manage everyone’s fitness. It’s seems to be a bit of a taboo to play our best players in the group stages in the UEL, but if we are aiming to be in the Champions League, we have to be prepared to have a squad that can handle multiple competitions. In our case, for the time being, we just need to be extra cautious as we are down to Sambi Lokonga for the #6 role.

I imagine a fairly strong team to start the match, so if we can aim to have the game wrapped up by the 70th minute, then we can manage the minutes of any players returning to fitness or needing a rest. Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and William Saliba may be players to take a rest. Tomiyasu, Marquinhos and Eddie Nketiah are in contention to get 90 minutes.

I’m very excited to see Fabio Vieira and Eddie Nketiah start, two players who will look to add quality whether they start the first minute or come on as a substitute. Eddie in particular looks sharp, and physically developed so he’ll be one to take his chance. Vieira will look to add to his 15-minute cameo against Manchester United, and show us the ball quality he possesses.

As for our aims for the competition, many pundits and fans are predicting a strong cup run. Personally, reaching the final would be a superb achievement - as long as we can win it of course!

The competition also acts as another channel to qualify for the Champions League next season. Hopefully, we can maintain a strong, consistent run throughout the league season so we’re not relying on a huge cup win.
