We have had such a fun night, here in Doha. Members of some of the teams of the Street Child World Cup kept us entertained with some vibrant, fun, and energetic performances, each telling the stories of their cultures through song and dance. The ‘Late Show’ is a great opportunity for the young people to express themselves, and learn more about the traditions and customs of their peers. We are looking forward to another night like this, later this week! #SCWC2022
