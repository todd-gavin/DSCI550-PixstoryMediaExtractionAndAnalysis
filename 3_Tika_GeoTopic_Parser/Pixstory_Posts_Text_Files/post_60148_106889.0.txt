Squid Game, the hit Korean survival drama series, has been officially renewed for a second season on Netflix, with writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk telling viewers "a whole new round is coming."

Song Gi-hun aka Player No. 456, played by Lee Jung-jae, and The Front Man, a mysterious character portrayed by Lee Byung-hun, will both return in season 2 of Squid Game, according to Hwang.

He also hinted at the return of Gong Yoo, who played an anonymous figure in the Squid Game, a series of Korean children's games with a fatal twist in which the last surviving contestant will be awarded KRW 45.6 billion (approximately Rs. 277 crore) in cash.

The acclaimed director thanked viewers for loving the show, which was only released 12 years after it was conceived, in a letter posted to Netflix's social media platforms late Sunday night.

Last year, the first season of Squid Game took 12 years to complete. Squid Game, on the other hand, just needed 12 days to become the most popular Netflix series ever. A great shout-out to fans all over the world from the writer, director, and producer of Squid Game. Thank you for taking the time to watch and enjoy our show.
Gi-hun has now returned.

The Front Man is back. Season 2 is on the way. "The man in the outfit with ddakji," Hwang speculated.
