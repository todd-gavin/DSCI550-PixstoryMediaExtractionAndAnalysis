World Heart Day is observed on September 29 .
When it comes to heart diseases, we are so less informed that sometimes it deprives us from the right information and even the right medical assessment and treatment. Adequate knowledge on major diseases, will give you enough scopes to look out for help.
Here we will discuss the 10 crucial tests which are extremely essential in determining the heart health:
1 ​Electrocardiogram (ECG) ; 
In this test the heart's electrical activity is recorded. It generates a graph of the voltage versus the electrical activity of the heart. In this test electrodes are placed on the skin. The sensors attached to the skin detect the electric signals produced by the heart every time it beats. 
2 ​Coronary angiogram ; 
In Coronary angiogram X ray imaging is used to see the blood vessels of the heart. This is usually done to check for a blockage which might be restricting the flow of blood to the heart. 
3 ​Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ;
This is an imaging technology mostly done to image the non-bony parts or soft tissues of the body. In this a strong magnetic field is used to image the heart. The magnetic field lines up the hydrogen protons in the body. The radio waves then knock the protons out of position. As they realign back into proper position, they send out radio signals. A computer receives the signals and converts them into images of the body. Doctors use this to monitor cardiac disease.
4 ​Exercise stress test ; 
Also known as treadmill test, this test helps to figure out how well your heart works. "In a stress test, you walk on a treadmill that makes your heart work progressively harder. An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors your heart's electrical rhythms. The doctor also measures your blood pressure and monitors whether you have symptoms like chest discomfort or fatigue.
