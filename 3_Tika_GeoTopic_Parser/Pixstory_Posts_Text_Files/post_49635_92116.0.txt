‌The Medical Marijuana Research Act passed the House with a high majority. The marijuana research bill would remove complications in researching and allow scientists to access cannabis from dispensaries in legal cannabis states. 
‌
‌Marijuana is known for its medical capabilities its ban had limited its research in the medical field. This would improve the medical attention me. The bill would ensure the supply of cannabis at the right time for the researchers. Furthermore, it would also permit scientists to access flowers and other products manufactured according to state-approved marijuana programs and shelved in dispensaries.
‌
According to Forbes, ‌NORML's Deputy Director Paul Armentano said in a press statement: "These common-sense regulatory changes are necessary and long overdue. Currently, the limited variety of cannabis cultivars accessible to federally licensed researchers does not represent the type or quality of cannabis products currently available in legal, statewide markets. The reality that nearly one-half of U.S. adults have legal access to this multitude of cannabis products, but our nation's top scientists do not, is the height of absurdity and it is an indictment of the current system."
‌
‌This bill comes after the House passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act on Friday, April 1, a bill that would end the federal prohibition on cannabis. The illegality of marijuana had been a limitation for the researchers.
‌
‌As a result, research on the health effects of cannabis and its cannabinoids left patients, doctors, and policymakers without the proof they need to make sound decisions regarding cannabis and cannabinoids. 
‌
‌The law would help in the research and regulation of the use of marijuana.
