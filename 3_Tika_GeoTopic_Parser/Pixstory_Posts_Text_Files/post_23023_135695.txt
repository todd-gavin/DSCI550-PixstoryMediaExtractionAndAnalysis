Last season Marc Skinner was handed a reality check Injuries weren t kind to United as they missed out on a top three spot for a third consecutive year The lack of defensive depth was intensely felt when United lost Millie Turner to an injury in September Maria Thorisdottir and Aoife Mannion were the only fit centre backs but eventually fatigue caught up and United started dropping points Turner became available in mid December but was later sidelined indefinitely after getting diagnosed with carotid artery dissection Mannion also picked up an injury to her knee which turned out to be an ACL tear January CB recruit Diane Caldwell also struggled with fitness Thorisdottir scuffled to carry the defence alone and was often partnered with either captain Katie Zelem or Hayley Ladd who plays in defence for the Wales national team in the heart of the defence which was just a temporary fix Full backs Kirsty Smith and Martha Harris also missed a good chunk of the season due to knocks every now and then But the arrival of talented defender Maya Le Tissier shows ambition to improve the quality of the defence The full back who can also operate as a centre back brings a much needed versatility into the side United have also signed CB Aissatou Tounkara who reached the semi finals of the European Championship with the French national team Tounkara has CL experience and can help in instilling that winning mentality into this side Turner has also made a full recovery and was involved in United s pre season against Everton last weekend Skinner has the likes of Turner Thorisdottir Mannion Tounkara and Le Tissier who can operate in the centre back role He can also count on Ladd and Zelem to fill that role in case of any emergencies Ona Batlle and Hannah Blundell are established as the full backs but Skinner can also play Le Tissier and Thorisdottir in that role Leah Galton also has experience of playing as a left back Marc Skinner might have solved the issue of defensive depth but he ll surely be scratching his head and thinking What will be my back four against Tottenham in the first game of the season
