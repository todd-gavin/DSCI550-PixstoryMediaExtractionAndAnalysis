Built in the 12th century, Jagannath temple is situated in Puri, Orissa and is popularly called Jagannath Puri. Dedicated to Lord Krishna, the temple is one of the Char Dhams of India.

Inside the main temple, with the idol of Lord Krishna (Jagannath) in between, the idols of Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra are placed. Non-Hindus cannot enter the premises of the temple.

They can get a good view of this magnificent temple from the roof-top of the Raghunandan Library located just opposite to the temple. The annual and world famous Rath Yatra conducted at Puri gives a chance to get a good glimpse of the Lord Jagannath along with Balabhadra and Subhadra riding on the chariots.

Thousands of people pulling the sacred chariot makes the yatra a worthy spectacle.
