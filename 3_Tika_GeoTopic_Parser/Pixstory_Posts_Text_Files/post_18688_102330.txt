A year ago he risked returning to Brescia because he didn&#39;t convince in his first AC Milan season He wanted to take a risk and reduced his salary significantly to try and get a second chance and to say that Tonali will take it is an understatement The Milan midfielder played a season almost perfect seasoned with heavy goals that it is good to say that they are not his specialty Now that the first Italian flag is on the bulletin board it is time to think about the future And he, a true Milan fan, sees himself not only in the Rossoneri for life but would like to bring the team back to lift a Champions League I would like trying to win the Champions League with this shirt It would be indescribable On the other hand, on the party When you win, everything changes if possible attachment to the shirt increases I was a child on the street in Sant Angelo Lodigiano, a Milan fan town for the fan party in In Reggio Emilia it was crazy but I realized what we have only done once back at Casa Milan I read the emotion in the eyes of the people around us hallucinatory I told myself not to pick up the phone for videos or photos I have to live these moments and always keep them with me Finally interviewed by Gazzetta he spoke of Ibra Zlatan gives security as long as he is there Seeing him follow the game standing on the bench is worth more than a thousand gestures He decides for us if he could stay in his and instead a champion who thinks of others first took us by the hand like children I hope he continues raises his decisive level on and off the pitch
