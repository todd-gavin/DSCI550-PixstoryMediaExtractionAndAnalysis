The FBI discovered records pertaining to national defence material in those boxes, which had been kept at Mar-a-Lago in an unsafe position and carried classified marks.
According to the statement, the 15 boxes contained 184 particular papers that were classified, 67 of which were marked "confidential," 92 of which were tagged "secret," and 25 of which were marked "top secret." The affidavit's 32 pages are blacked out on 21 of them almost entirely or partially.
Less than a week after the operation on August 8, the DOJ voluntarily disclosed the search warrant in its entirety. According to the warrant, FBI agents were looking for evidence of transgressions of the U.S. Espionage Act as well as laws prohibiting the removal of official records and obstruction of justice.
The government argued last week against releasing the affidavit, even in a redacted form.
