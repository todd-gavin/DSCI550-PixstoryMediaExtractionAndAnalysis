Abstract 

Background 

Although culturally-tailored diabetes treatment is recommended, there is a lack of relevant dietary resources for Chinese in Canada. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of culturally-tailored menu plan combined with nutrition education on clinical outcomes, diet quality and qualitative outcomes among Chinese immigrants with type 2 diabetes. 

Method 

Participants were 17 Chinese immigrants living with type 2 diabetes in Edmonton, Alberta. The design was a 12-wk single-arm intervention that included weekly nutrition education supported by a culturally-tailored menu plan with mixed methods evaluation. Diet quality, clinical and other outcomes were assessed pre- and post-intervention. One-on-one interviews were conducted post-intervention to learn about program feasibility and obstacles to adherence. 

Results 

Waist circumference (mean difference ± SD) (-2.0±2.5 cm; P=0.004), total cholesterol (-21.4±28.2 mg/dl; P=0.007), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-18.4±24.6 mg/dl, P=0.007) were decreased compared with baseline. No significant change was detected in A1C. Post-intervention, the Healthy Eating Index (P=0.01) and diabetes knowledge score (P=0.009) also increased. Participants reported that the program was culturally acceptable, easily understood and feasible to implement. Participants indicated the program helped improve their diabetes knowledge, adherence to the dietary guidelines, choose low Glycemic Index food, and read food labels when shopping. 

Conclusion 

A flexible, culturally-tailored menu plan was a feasible and effective tool for improving diabetes knowledge, diet quality, and metabolic outcomes among Chinese immigrants with type 2 diabetes.
