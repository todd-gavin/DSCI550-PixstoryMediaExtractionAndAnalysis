Inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1939, the temple was built by the industrialist Baldeo Das Birla in Delhi and can be visited by people of all caste and creed. Laxminarayan is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu when he is with his consort, Goddess Lakshmi.

The primary shrine is devoted to Laxminarayan and the other smaller shrines are dedicated to other Indian Gods like Lord Shiva, Lord Hanuman, Lord Krishna, Lord Ganesh and Lord Buddha.

Spread over an area of 7.5 acres the temple is one of the top tourist attractions in Delhi and has a huge garden, fountains and a large hall called Geeta Bhawan.
