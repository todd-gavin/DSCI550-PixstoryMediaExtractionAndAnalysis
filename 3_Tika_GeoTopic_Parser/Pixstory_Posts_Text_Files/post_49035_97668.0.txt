Silk is frequently referred to as one of the most natural textiles available. While this is true, it is only because it is created from real insects: silkworms. To produce 2.2 pounds of silk, more than 6,500 silkworms, or Bombyx mori, are slaughtered.

To make the silk we know and love, most mass market fabric firms use immoral and harsh procedures.

Instead, consider the following fabrics:

1) Bamboo Lyocell
Bamboo Lyocell is a type of lyocell.
This material, which is similar to Tencel but created from bamboo, can be produced in a closed-loop system. Bamboo rayon is not the same as rayon made from bamboo, and it is not produced in a sustainable manner.
Bamboo is a fast-growing plant that may be picked without having to remove it out of the ground and replant it.

2) Cupro
Cotton linter fiber, the fuzz that surrounds cotton seeds, is used to make Cupro. This smooth, biodegradable material is made from cotton waste and is a perfect alternative to brushed silk. Some Cupro is produced in a closed-loop system, in which nearly all of the water and chemicals used in the manufacturing process are recycled.

3) Orange Silk Fiber
Citrus juice byproducts are used to make orange fiber silk, which is a new and developing material. It is 100% biodegradable because it is made entirely of citrus cellulose. The fabric is silky, light, and soft. It can be opaque or lustrous, and it can be combined with various materials.

4) Micro-Silk
This novel silky substance begins as a protein created through fermentation utilizing yeast, sugar, and water, mimicking the cleverness of spiders.
The protein is extracted, spun into fiber, and transformed into a biodegradable substance.
