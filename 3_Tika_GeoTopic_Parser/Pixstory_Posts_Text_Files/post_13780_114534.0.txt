Australia’s win over Peru in the inter-continental play-off guaranteed an unprecedented six teams from Asia at the 2022 World Cup, raising hopes of repeating the success of 2002 when South Korea reached the semi-finals and Japan made it to the Round of 16 as the co-hosts. Qatar’s hosting of the November 21-December 18 tournament has added to Asia’s usual automatic four qualification spots filled by Saudi Arabia, Japan, Iran and South Korea.
The first ever Asian team took part in the World Cup was in 1938 in France. That should come as little surprise as the country in question is Dutch East Indies, now known as Indonesia. Not many people know that India could have been the second nation from Asia to play the World Cup in 1950 in Brazil, but they allowed the opportunity to go despite qualifying for the meet. After agreeing to play the World Cup, All India Football Federation (AIFF) backed away at the last moment leaving the group 3 with only three teams – Sweden, Italy and Paraguay.
When FIFA began preparations to restart the World Cup after two editions of 1942 and 1944 were not played because of war, India sent their entry and were clubbed with the Philippines and Burma (now Myanmar) in the Asian qualifiers. Luckily for India, both teams withdrew leaving India automatically qualify for the Brazil World Cup.
The drama began thereafter. The AIFF held a series of meetings over the next 15 months to discuss on India’s participation but failed to reach a decision. While initially it worried over losing the amateur status by playing with professional teams, later the AIFF said it didn’t have enough money to send the team. The money was arranged, the FIFA promised to help and even Brazil football association (CBF) extended all facilities, but the AIFF dillydallied till the last moment. The World Cup was to start on June 24 and till the last week of May 1950, the AIFF said it was raising the team to be send to Brazil via Egypt. But in the end, it never happened.
