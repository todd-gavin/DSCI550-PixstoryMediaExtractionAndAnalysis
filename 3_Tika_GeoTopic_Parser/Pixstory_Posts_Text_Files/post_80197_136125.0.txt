All the errands in my house go haywire in my domestic help’s absence. I remember a Netflix series, in which one of the scenes glorified their work and showed how these women are an exemplar for other women in terms of their financial independence and equality. I loved it.

The not so isolated case: 

A former political party leader Seema Patra was recently arrested for torturing her domestic help. Patra, believed to be in her mid-60s, had kept the victim namely Sunita captive for eight years. Videos showing a scrawny Sunita, lying on a bed, and sharing details of her abuse before a magistrate has sparked massive uproar. The victim said Patra locked her in a room for days without food or water, assaulted her daily and burned her body with hot utensils such as a pan. Sunita also alleged the suspended BJP leader broke her teeth, and made her lick urine off the floor.

Workers engaged in informal domestic sector work often suffer from their employer’s unequal, discriminatory, atrocious and exploitative behaviour. They are often not allowed to use the same washrooms ;utensils for them are segregated and thus I believe that - Domestic Helps also need a help centre to address such grave issues. We do have police stations yet I believe a separate help centres must be established near their shelters or their workplaces. Just a thought. 
What do you think?
