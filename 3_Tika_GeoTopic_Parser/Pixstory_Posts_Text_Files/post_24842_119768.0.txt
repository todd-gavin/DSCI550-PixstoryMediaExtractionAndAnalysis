Liverpool is having a mixed pre-season this year. With the signing of Nunez and leaving of Sadio Mane, they are yet to find the rhythm of the game. Liverpool had a big loss against Manchester United at the start of the month. They failed to score a single goal and the match ended with a thrashing of 4-0 from Manchester United.

The latest loss was against Salzburg which was the second loss in 4 games for Kloopâ€™s men. They played Salzburg in Austria this week. Liverpool had 16 shots in the whole game as compared to just 7 shots by the host. They also had nearly 70% of the possession but failed to find the net even once in the whole game.

Benjamin found the back of the net in the 31st minute for Salzburg. There was no other goal in the game as it ended 1-0 at the full-time whistle. The starting 11 of both the teams were substituted in the game except the goalkeeper of both teams. Liverpool will now focus on the Community Shield game against Manchester City which will happen at the end of the month.
