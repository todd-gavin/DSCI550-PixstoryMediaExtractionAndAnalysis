In the twenty-first century, Spain has been one of the most dominant forces in football. Between 2008 and 2012, La Roja dominated international football, winning the World Cup and two European titles.

Spain has continuously produced some of the best players in the game's history. La Liga, the Spanish top flight, is famed for its visually appealing type of football.

#5 Pedri (Barcelona)

Young Player of the Tournament at Euro 2020 Over the last year, Pedri has been incredible. The small centre midfielder has already been compared to Barcelona legends Xavi and Andres Iniesta, and he has more than lived up to the comparisons.

Pedri possesses all of the characteristics of a consistent starter for the Catalans in centre midfield. He is good with the ball at his feet and can squirm his way out of cul-de-sacs. Because of his low centre of gravity, he can make fast turns and is a very nimble midfielder.

#4 Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea)

Cesar Azpilicueta has been one of the Premier League's most consistent performers over the last decade. He's been a stalwart in Chelsea's defence and constantly gives everything he's got. Azpilicueta began his career as a right-back but has now transitioned to a right-sided centre-back, where he has performed admirably for the Blues.

Last season, Azpilicueta was instrumental in Chelsea's Champions League success. He was instrumental in Thomas Tuchel's transformation of Chelsea into one of Europe's most formidable defensive groups.
