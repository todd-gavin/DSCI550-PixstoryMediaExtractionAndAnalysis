Republican Party in the thrall of former President Donald Trump censured two moderate lawmakers on Friday even as his vice president Mike Pence publicly parted ways with him and hinted at a White House challenge in The twin developments revealed fractures and a potential split in the Grand Old Party despite it being under Trump s spell and stranglehold even as Democrats face their own inner party turmoil with two of their lawmakers more aligned with the right than with their party In rebuking GOP House members Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for participating in the Democrat led investigation into the January Capitol Hill attack by Trump supporting mobs the Republican Party also described the event as legitimate political discourse in line with the former President s effort to de stigmatize the violence and suggest his supporters were simply upset by the rigged results He has spoken of pardoning those convicted for rioting But Trump s effort to claim victory in the elections and argue that his then vice president Mike Trump could have overturned it on January when electoral votes were to be certified suffered a setback when Pence himself asserted on Friday that it was not his remit to do that President Trump is wrong I had no right to overturn the election The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone And frankly there is no idea more un American than the notion that anyone person could choose the American president he said remarks at a Federalist Society conference endorsing the results that have made Joe Biden the President The remarks were greeted with applause as some GOP leading lights began to stand up to the former President who has established almost total sway on the party Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience who seek truth in the face of vitriol Honor attaches to Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for seeking truth even when doing so comes at great personal cost former Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said following a party conclave at which Trump loyalists tore into the dissidents
