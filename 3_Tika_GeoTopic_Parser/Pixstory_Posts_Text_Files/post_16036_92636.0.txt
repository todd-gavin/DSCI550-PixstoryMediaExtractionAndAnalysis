Abstract 

Background and aims 

Over the past few years, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are increasingly being linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but their relevance for metabolic dyslipidaemia in T2DM is unclear. This study aims to determine the plasma and urinary BCAAs and their association with insulin resistance, lipid profile and glycated haemoglobin in patients with T2DM among Indian adults. 

Methods 

In this analytical cross-sectional study, a total of eighty subjects were recruited, 40 T2DM cases and 40 healthy controls. Blood samples collected were subjected to fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipid profile, HbA1c, insulin and BCAAs analysis and urine samples were assessed for BCAAs. All associations were assessed using Spearman Rank Correlation. 

Results 

The plasma levels of BCAAs were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in subjects with T2DM than in control subjects. Spearman Rank Correlation analyses revealed a non-significant (p = 0.21) but positive association between BCAAs and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients with T2DM (Rho: 0.27). Among lipid profile parameters, only triglycerides had a significant positive correlation to plasma BCAAs in cases (Rho: 0.5971) but not in control subjects. Findings also revealed a significant positive (p < 0.05) association between plasma BCAAs and HbA1c in patients with T2DM (Rho: 0.5325). Urinary BCAAs levels had a non-significant increase in T2DM subjects and did not show any significant correlation with other parameters assessed. 

Conclusion 

Elevated levels of plasma BCAAs are positively associated with triglyceride and HbA1c. They could serve as an effective marker for the assessment of metabolic dyslipidaemia in subjects with T2DM. Further, large scale studies are needed for confirmation of the same.
