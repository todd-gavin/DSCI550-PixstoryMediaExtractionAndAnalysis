The interim government has never banned girls from going to school and has reopened 60% of schools so far,” Mutttaqi claimed.

China’s special envoy for Afghanistan Yue Xiaoyong will host the so-called Extended Troika meeting on the country: China, Russia, the US plus Pakistan.

On November 11, 2021, Islamabad hosted the first meeting of the extended Troika, to discuss the latest situation in Afghanistan. Representatives of the four countries had then met with senior Taliban representatives on the sidelines of the meeting.

The two-day long talks on Afghanistan come against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and as Kabul suffers an economic and humanitarian crisis worsened by a financial aid cutoff following the Taliban takeover last August.

They also come amid widespread condemnation of the Taliban’s U-turn last week on allowing girls to attend public high schools, which has sparked consternation among funders ahead of a key aid donors’ conference, a UN official said on Tuesday, Reuters reported.
