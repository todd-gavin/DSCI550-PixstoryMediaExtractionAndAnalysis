In Pakistan, the gloves are off and knives are out. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has fallen out with the army at a time when the opposition has built a strong movement for his ouster has warned that “if I am forcibly removed, I would be more dangerous to you.”

But to whom has he issued this “threat”?  Is it to the political opposition or the military establishment headed by army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa?

“I warn you if I am out of the government, I will be more dangerous to you. Till now I was watching the situation. If I come out on the street then you would not have any place to hide because people have seen your true colours,” Imran Khan said in a live television TV show on Sunday.

(Main aap ko Khabardar Karna Chahata hoon, agar main government se bahar nikal gaya main aap ke liye zayada khatarnak hoon. Abhi tak toh main tamasha dekh raha hoon, Main agar sadakon pe nikal aaya toh aap ke liye chupane ki jagah nahi hogi kyonki log aap ko pehchan chuke hain).
