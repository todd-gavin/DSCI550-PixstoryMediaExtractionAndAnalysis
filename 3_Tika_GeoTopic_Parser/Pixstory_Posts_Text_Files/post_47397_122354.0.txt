After a poor performance in the summer transfer window, Leicester City will host Brentford in their backyard. Leicester City will face Brentford at King Power Stadium and will look to start their campaign on high in front of their fanbase. 

Leicester City have sold their long serving shot-stopper Kasper Schmeichel to a French club. They have not added players to their midfield which might look weak at the end of the summer transfer window with Youri Tielemans and James Maddisson touted with a move away from King Power Stadium.

Brentford had a great Premier League season in 2021/22 and will look to replicate the same or make it better. Brentford has made a few high profile signings that make them more favorable to stay in the top-flight.
