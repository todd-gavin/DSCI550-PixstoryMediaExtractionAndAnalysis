They shut me up in Prose 

BY EMILY DICKINSON

They shut me up in Prose –
As when a little Girl
They put me in the Closet –
Because they liked me “still”   –


Still! Could themself have peeped –
And seen my Brain – go round –
They might as wise have lodged a Bird
For Treason – in the Pound –


Himself has but to will
And easy as a Star
Look down opon Captivity –
And laugh – No more have I –

They shut me up in Prose’. If prose is male, poetry is female – at least, in the rather reductive and old-fashioned binary that Emily Dickinson clearly would have been aware of, growing up. And one of the triumphs of this poem about the restrictions placed upon young girls growing up in an overwhelmingly patriarchal society is how Dickinson says one thing while using her verse to undermine it.Prose’ and ‘Closet’ can hardly be called rhymes, and so fail to snap together with the satisfaction of a lock, although they are so near.
