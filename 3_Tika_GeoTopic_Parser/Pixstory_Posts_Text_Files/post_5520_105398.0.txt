Over the last few months, Meera Chitrakoot has been talking and listening to women in Chitrakoot - what is worrying them, what do they feel about their own health, who are they able to talk to about their tensions, and what are the reactions. The general sense is that society does not want to hear women talk about their health. In the absence of robust support systems, women have few coping mechanisms. Women are starving themselves, paying even lesser attention to their bodies, and are being forced to take up precarious work for peanuts. 

In this conversation, Meera talks to Dhuniya, an old friend and supplier of dung cakes for fuel, who is struggling to cope with increasing weakness and loneliness. Having cared for her husband and children most of her adult life, Dhuniya now finds herself alone, as neighbours and family have shunned her with the fear of Covid. She often goes to bed hungry, due to the lack of money and work. Feeling the desire to leave her loneliness for a little while, she paid a visit to Meera, to remember old times and feel a bit lighter.
