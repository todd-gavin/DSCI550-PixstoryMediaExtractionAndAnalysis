Chelsea have a tall order ahead of them as they have to find first team players for almost every position available for playing With the departure of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen and rumoured departure of Cesar Azpillicueta Chelsea will have to boost their defence to make sure that it retains the defensive depth that ensured them the Champions League and Club World Cup Apart from defense Chelsea also needs to fix it s midfield as it has been a weaklink in the last year With contracts coming up for Kante and Jorginho with no extension talks being opened until now one has to assume that Chelsea are looking for replacements with their goals being future oriented The forwards have enjoyed their down time as well Werner Ziyech and Pulisic all failed to secure a guaranteed first team spot during the last season with mediocre performances all throughout the season The club will be looking to replace them with available candidates in Dembele and Gabriel Jesus who are more reliable Lukaku has had a strained relationship with the gaffer so it wouldn t be a surprise if he is on his way out as well In short everyone other than Kai Havertz will be fighting for their places in the upcoming season Here s to hoping Chelsea gets it right this time unlike with Lukaku who they spent million on for a string pf mediocre performances and his heart already pining to return to Inter Milan
