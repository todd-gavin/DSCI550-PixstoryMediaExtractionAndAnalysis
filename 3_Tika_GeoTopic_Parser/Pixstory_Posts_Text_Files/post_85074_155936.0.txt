Chelsea have confirmed that Reece James will be out of action for around eight weeks due to a knee injury.
James suffered an injury in their clash against AC Milan in the Champions League just a few days back. He had to be subbed off, which raised concerns over his fitness for the Qatar World Cup.
However, the Blues have confirmed that the right-back will require around eight weeks to be fully fit. This means that James will not be available for the showpiece event, which is scheduled to get underway next month.
A statement from Chelsea read: "Following the knee injury sustained in our away match against AC Milan, Reece has received treatment from the Chelsea medical department and visited a specialist this weekend. After consultation between all parties, Reece will now undergo a rehabilitation programme and is expected to be out for eight weeks."
It’s a big blow to England as their camp has already been hit by several injuries. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kyle Walker are also battling to regain fitness and rhyme ahead of the World Cup.
Gareth Southgate predicted injuries
England boss Gareth Southgate was already expecting multiple injuries due to a tight schedule. To accommodate the World Cup, club football is having a match every 3-4 days, making them vulnerable to injuries.
"What I see is a really packed schedule now, a lot of players playing a lot of minutes, and realistically we will lose more. I just think it's so intense and the players have had so much football."
England’s recent form has been nothing short of a roller-coaster. Some days they show magnificent work while some days they drop below-average performance. It remains to be seen how the three Lions will perform as they look to take the trophy home.
Southgate’s side will kick-off their campaign against Iran on November 21.
