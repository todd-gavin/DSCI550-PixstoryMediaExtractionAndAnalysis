What Gokulam Kerala FC achieved in Bhubaneshwar in the Indian Women’s League is unique in Indian football history. By winning the IWL after registering a resounding 3-1 comeback win over Tamil Nadu’s Sethu FC, the Kerala side proved they are equally competent in both men’s and women’s football. By lifting the titles in both I-league and IWL in a span of few days, Gokulam have set a record that would be difficult to match in near future.
In India, clubs are mostly interested in men’s football and hardly concentrate in raising women’s team. In fact, in an All India Football Federation (AIFF) meeting a couple of years ago, its Supreme Court ousted president Praful Patel urged the Indian Super League (ISL) teams to raise women’s teams along with their men’s squad. In fact, in the 12-team IWL, there were only two teams, Gokulam and Indian Arrows, who have men’s team, too, in the I-League. While there are talks about developing women’s football in India, no established club side have ever given a thought about doing so. Two Kolkata sides, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, are century-old clubs – they never made an effort to raise women’s teams. Same applies with the mentality of ISL franchises too.
The match between Gokulam and Sethu FC was truly exciting. Former India captain Bhaskar Ganguly, who was the chief guest and distributed prizes, said: “Previously, most of the women’s matches in India lacked direction and purpose. But this match was definitely different. I liked Gokulam because their girls knew what they were looking for. They kept their cool and won even after conceding an early goal. Indian women’s football is really on the rise.” Some of the Gokulam girls caught the attention of the spectators with their intelligent display. One of them was Grace Dangmei, who was adjudged the hero of the match. Dangmei, who comes from Manipur, is a seasoned campaigner and a regular with the national team. Her dominant display against Sethu FC helped Gokulam to clinch the title.
