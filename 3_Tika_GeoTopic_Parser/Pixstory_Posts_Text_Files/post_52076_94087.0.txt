Anxiety can come on suddenly and unpredictably. You might be preparing for a big job interview or you might just wake up in the morning and, without warning, the dread hits.

Anxiety is the most common mental health condition, affecting roughly one in four Australians in their lifetime. Young people described their experiences of anxiety for an episode of Enough, The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald’s youth mental health podcast.

There is a big difference between the disorder – which is a serious mental illness characterised by an excessive sense of worry or fear – and simply feeling stressed or worried, however everyone can feel anxious from time to time.

1. List out your anxiety as specifically as possible. For example: I’m anxious about posting my art online.

2. Then, list a simple strategy (or two) to get around some of the potentially negative consequences of this anxiety. For example, when I’m over-committed I find getting organised with calendars and to-do-lists enough to provide mild relief.

3. From here, you write out the likely outcome of your situation. If you’re anxious that you’ll die in a plane crash, the likely outcome is that you won’t. While we rationally know this, it’s sometimes nice just to spell it out.

4. Next, you ask: what anxiety does this anxiety replace? It’s good to recognise that your current worries might be better than the alternatives their presence rules out. If you’re worried about whether or not your kids will grow up in a house you own, one anxiety this displaces is the anxiety that you might never have children at all.

5. Finally, ask: how is this anxiety trying to protect you? If you’re anxious about losing your job, the anxiety might be trying to protect you from the looming (very real) problems that come with a lack of cash. If you’re anxious about having too much work, the anxiety might be trying to protect you from stress. The purpose of this is that it frames anxiety as a protective coping mechanism. Whether this is true or not, it can provide a bit of relief.
