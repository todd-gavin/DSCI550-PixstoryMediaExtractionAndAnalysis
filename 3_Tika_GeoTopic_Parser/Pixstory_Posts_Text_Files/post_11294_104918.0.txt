The environment in which we live is a major determinant of our health and wellbeing . We depend on the environment for energy and the materials needed to sustain life , such as : clean air , safe drinking water . As humans , we are interconnected with our environment . Our natural and built environment is more than just a place for us to live . The state of our world affects our physical and mental health .

Its 5 June , World Environment Day today  ! ☘️🌎

And it's Very important for all of us to know that Environment is so much important for our health ! Come let's Talk About it ! ✅☘️

This vital relationship between humans and our surroundings is called environmental health . 🌎☘️

A clean environment is essential for human health and well-being . At the same time , the local environment can also be a source of stressors - for example air pollution , noise , hazardous chemicals - that negatively affect health . The health of the population is also adversely affected by climate change , through heatwaves , floods and changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases . At a broader level , loss of biodiversity , and land degradation can also impact on human well-being by threatening the delivery of ecosystem services , such as access to freshwater and food production . 

Human health and well-being are intimately linked to the state of the environment . Good quality natural environments provide basic needs , in terms of clean air and water , fertile land for food production , and energy and material inputs for production . Green infrastructure also serves to regulate climate and prevent flooding . Access to green and blue spaces also provides important opportunities for recreation and supports well-being .

Just like You and Me The Environment Also needs Plants and Trees to live ! 🌎☘️
