The decision of supreme court to overturn Roe Vs Wade has shook everyone to their core and the sports world is not untouched by it.

Megan Rapinoe, a star for the U.S. national soccer team, expressed her outrage with the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the country's constitutional protections for abortion on Friday, bemoaning the erosion of liberties that women have enjoyed for a decade. 

“I think the cruelty is the point because this is not pro life by any means,” said Rapinoe, who was close to tears at times as she expressed her outrage.

US News reported that some of the most prominent sports figures in the nation joined the outspoken Rapinoe in publicly expressing their shock, rage, and anxiety following the Supreme Court's decision to reverse Roe v. Wade, which upheld a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James tweeted that the ruling was about “ power and control,” and he retweeted a couple posts about the effect of the decision on Black women.

In a joint statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the leagues “believe that women should be able to make their own decisions concerning their health and future, and we believe that freedom should be protected.”

“We will continue to advocate for gender and health equity, including ensuring our employees have access to reproductive health care, regardless of their location,” they said.
