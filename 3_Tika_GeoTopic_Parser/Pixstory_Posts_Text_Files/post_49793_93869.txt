 Many federal agencies have warned of a dangerous cyber tool that can gain full access to multiple industrial control systems According to the Guardian even though the proponents were not named the private sector cybersecurity partners said the information suggests Russia is behind the tools and that they were configured to initially target North American energy concerns The tools are said to be exceptionally dangerous and rare However they were ahead of a step of the adversary The CEO of another government partner Robert M Lee of Dragos agreed that a state actor almost certainly crafted the malware which he said was configured to initially target liquified natural gas and electric power sites in North America The government had already warned the business agencies and the citizens about this huge cyber threat from Russia as a retaliation for the sanctions imposed on them It said the malware could be used to shut down critical machinery sabotage industrial processes and disable safety controllers leading to the physical destruction of machinery that could lead to the loss of human lives Understand the threat is real and this has to stop for real We cannot live in the constant fear of a cyberwar that actually could cause major physical destruction These infiltrations should be apprehended Russia has to stop its hate and crime Source The Guardian
