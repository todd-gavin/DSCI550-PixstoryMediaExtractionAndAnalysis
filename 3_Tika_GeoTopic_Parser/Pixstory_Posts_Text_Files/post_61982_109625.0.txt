Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian Avenger has become the first superhero to headline a fourth solo movie, also known as Thor: Love and Thunder. Well, sort of, coz he is co-headlining it with Natalie Portman as she has returned to her role as Jane Foster. 

She will be sharing the spotlight, this time with a pieced-together Mjolnir, after it was brutally broken to pieces by Hela, Goddess of death. What makes the dynamic more interesting is that Jane will be on the same pedestal as Thor in the franchise for the first time. 

Jane will be battling her own demons, as she is in a fight for her life against cancer. While Thor will be going up against Gorr, the God butcher, played by Christian Bale. 

Both the Thors, are facing the possibility of death in the movie and that's what makes the movie so interesting, it's lighthearted, funny, and happening movie with an existing Looming threat that threatens everything. 

That's what binds the movie so perfectly and makes it stand out
