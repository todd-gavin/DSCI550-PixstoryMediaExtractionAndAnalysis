Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker will be unavailable for Manchester City's FA Cup semi-final
against Liverpool.

De Bruyne left Wednesday's tense 0-0 draw with Atletico Madrid with 25 minutes remaining
after seeming to damage his ankle, 10 minutes before Walker had a similar injury.

According to The Times, Pep Guardiola is preparing for the encounter without both De Bruyne
and Walker, with a trip to Wembley to play arch rivals Liverpool just around the corner.

The Belgian midfielder was photographed with an ice pack around his right ankle, which he
injured following a kick from Atletico Madrid's Felipe early in the game but attempted to play
through.

Walker walked out with a similar issue to De Bruyne's, while Phil Foden played much of the
second game with a bandage on his head. The defender expressed hope that his injury was not
serious, although he was spotted wearing a protective boot.

The match was a "learning curve for us," according to John Stones. "Knowing that we have
conquered this and can adjust to various scenarios will be a tremendous experience for us in
important games."

"It will undoubtedly aid our development as a team, and I am really pleased with the guys, how
they performed, and the outcome after two legs."

Guardiola's chances of reaching the Wembley semi-final are limited, with Wednesday proving to
be a physical and emotional strain on his players.

"We have the team to go all the way to the end and win everything," Aymeric Laporte, the defender, said. We know it'll be difficult, but I believe we'll be able to pull it off. "

Fortunately for City, none of the players pose a long-term threat. De Bruyne was walking alone
when he returned to the United Kingdom, and he does not feel he has sustained any serious
injuries, but the timing of the Liverpool game has not been in his favor.
