Thus spoke Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wikramasinge


*The next couple of months will be the most difficult ones of our lives. I have no desire to hide the truth and to lie to the public. Although these facts are unpleasant and terrifying, this is the true situation. 

• Govt. Revenue: SLR 1.6 Trillion. 

• Govt. Expenditure: SLR 2.4 Trillion. 

• Budget Deficit: SLR 2.4 Trillion (13% of GDP) 



• Debt Ceiling: SLR 1950 Billion out of the approved debt ceiling of SLR 3200 Billion by the 2nd week of May 

• Foreign Reserves: They were at USD 7.5 Billion in Nov. 2019. However, today it is a challenge for the treasury to find USD 1 Million. 

4. Fuel Stocks: 

• Problem: In order ease the queues, we need approx. USD 75 million. We only have petrol stocks for a single day. 


• Solution: We managed to bring in a diesel shipment yesterday. Two more diesel shipments under the Indian credit line due on 18/5 and 1/6. Two petrol shipments due on 18/5 and 29/5. We are working to obtain dollars in the open market to pay for these shipments
