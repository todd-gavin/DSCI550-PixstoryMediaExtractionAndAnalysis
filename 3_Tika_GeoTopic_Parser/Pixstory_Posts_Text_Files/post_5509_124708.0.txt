In a recent press conference, Joe Biden praised the news that the economy had zero percent inflation in July. This comment follows a year in which the United States had some of the highest inflation in decades, at roughly 8.5% this year. This is far above the 2%-3% inflation rate that economists consider to be healthy.

Biden is working overtime to make himself appear as if he is doing some good.  He is constantly striving to reverse course on the problems he caused, and he cites data indicating a decline in the problem like he expects to be praised for fixing the problems he caused.

Inflation has had a disastrous effect on our country, as it has been accompanied by steep price increases for basic products and services, stagnant salaries, and rising gas costs. The wallets of every American are being drained as Biden and his administration watch from ivory towers, searching for glitter in a heap of dirt.
