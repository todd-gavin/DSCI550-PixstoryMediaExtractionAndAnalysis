Suppose you re walking through the corridor of your school and this person just casually punches you Next day it happens again And again And again Soon after you start to develop a dislike towards that person They hate you You hate them You re both the same Or are you That s it That s the difference between misogyny and misandry Misandry irritates men misogyny kills women They re NOT the same It s natural to hate your oppressors It s natural to hate those who threaten your being Not to mention misogyny is a prevalent system It exists Almost every person especially men you ll meet is misogynist I never see people calling out them all the time even though it s more common dangerous and criminal but one woman saying she hates men which is only something she says not act upon becomes problematic Now THAT is hypocrisy
