Vice President Kamala Harris says that congress needs to act and pass a law safeguarding abortion rights for American women In an interview with CBS News Robert Costa Harris said that women have been stripped of a constitutional right after Supreme Court decides to overturn Roe v Wade Harris said I think all of us share a deep sense of outrage that the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right that was recognized took it from the women of America The vice president continued We are now looking at a case where the government can interfere in what is one of the most intimate and private decisions that someone can make Harris said We also need Congress to act because that branch of government is where we codify which means put into law the rights that again we took for granted but have now been taken from the women of America When asked if she felt as though past Democratic leaders had waned in not writing Roe v Wade into law Harris dodged the question I think that to be very honest with you I I do believe that we should have rightly believed but we certainly believed that certain issues are just settled Certain issues are just settled Harris avoided reverberating calls from other Democrats for conservative Supreme Court judges should be indicted Source Daily Mail
