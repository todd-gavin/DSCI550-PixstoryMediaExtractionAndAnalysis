Did you watch season 3 of Brooklyn 99? I was in denial for the longest time ever, I just didn’t want my favourite show to end and thus decided not to watch it. But as they say, all good things come to an end. With this realisation, I recently watched it. Tbh, I didn’t find it as funny as the previous seasons. Views?
