From past recent days I was indulge on Twitter and I so many tweets with #boycot Bollywood firstly I was very surprise that why this bycott culture is increasing rapidly I knew there should be an exact reason but mainly the focus was given on the two thing the firstly was the content which is not a satisfying and second one is that the image which is reflected through the movies hurts the sentiments of others so it is a question for you all that do we relate ideology, religion and cinema or cinema is just different one which focus more on the debunks and the hidden truth that never come from a ground reality.
