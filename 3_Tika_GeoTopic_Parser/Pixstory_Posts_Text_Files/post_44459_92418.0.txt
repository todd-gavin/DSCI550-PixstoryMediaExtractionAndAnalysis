Ex-Manchester United and Everton midfielder Wayne Rooney caught attention for his comments on Cristiano Ronaldo's return to Old Trafford this week. The 36 year old remarked at United's blatant need to invest in younger, hungrier footballers and that Ronaldo is "getting on a bit."


When he was questioned about whether or not the move last summer has worked out, Rooney said “You’d have to say no, at the minute.

 I think he’s scored goals, he’s scored important goals in the Champions League early on in the season. He scored the hat-trick against Tottenham."


Cristiano Ronaldo is surely destined to finish the season trophyless, his first in a very long time. While his importance in the team does go under the radar a bit, age has caught onto the five time Ballon'dor. 


“But I think if you look to the future of the club you would have to go with younger, hungry players to do the best to lift Manchester United over these next two, three years.


“And obviously Cristiano is getting on a bit. He certainly isn’t the player he was when he was in his 20s. And that happens, that’s football. He’s a goal threat but I think the rest of the game they need more, they need young, hungry players.


Ronaldo slashed back at Rooney, by leaving a comment on the Englishman's Instagram. Surely there is no bad blood between the two ex-colleagues but this isn't the first time Rooney's made controversial statements about the Portuguese. Surely is the first time Ronaldo has come out to respond though.


CR7 typed "two jealous 👀" under Rooney's latest Instagram Post, suggesting that the Englishman was jealous of his accolades at what is roughly the same age (Rooney is younger). 

Ronaldo's "Factos 👍🏿👀" comment a few months ago also became a viral social media sensation.
