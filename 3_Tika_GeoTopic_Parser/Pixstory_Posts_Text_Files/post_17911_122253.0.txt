It wouldn't be inaccurate to suggest that viewers are unsatisfied with DC League of Super Pets now that it has finally arrived. The majority of reviews labelled The Secret Life of Pets and Toy Story-inspired DC League of Super Pet as shoddy imitations. The League of Super Pets was billed as a humorous film about pets obtaining superpowers, however it has since been said that it just features ridiculous characters and tired gags.

Dwayne Johnson, John Krasinski, Kate McKinnon, Natasha Lyonne and more lend their voices to the characters in the new DC League of Super Pet film.

It has a number of terrible jokes, according to the majority of reviews. Parents of young children may find it difficult to choose this film because of phrases like "I can't put my paw on that" and animals being bleeped out for swearing. Also there is a violent super cat with the ability to shoot lasers from her whiskers and utter phrases like "what's up dog?"
