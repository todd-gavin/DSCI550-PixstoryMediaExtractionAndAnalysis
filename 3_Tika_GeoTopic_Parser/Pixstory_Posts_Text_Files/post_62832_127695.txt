Australian cricket great Ian Chappell has retired from commentary after almost half a century behind the microphone After a legendary Test career as a player including as captain Chappell quickly moved into the media landscape Chappell was the last member still in the chair from Channel Nine s famous commentary team including Richie Benaud Bill Lawry and Tony Greig Greig and Benaud have died and year old Lawry left the commentary box some years back Now Chappell who spent most of his career with Nine s Wide World of Sports before stints with Macquarie and ABC radio coverage in recent summers is also hanging up the headset Chappell told the Sydney Morning Herald he had been thinking about retiring for a while I had a minor stroke a few years back and I got off lucky But it just makes everything harder the year old said And I just thought with all the travel and walking up stairs and things like that it s all just going to get harder Then I read what Rabbits recently retired rugby league commentator Ray Warren said with retirement and it really struck home when I read the bit where he said you re always one sentence closer to making a mistake Chappell commentated with a laconic tone but he became known for his forthright opinions on everything from batting technique to the way the sport was governed formed over decades in the game It s up to other people to decide what they think of me and some will think I ve been all right he said of his reputation as something of a curmudgeon in his later years Some will think I ve been a prick That doesn t bother me one bit Cricket identities from around the world paid tribute to one of the elder statesmen of Australian cricket
