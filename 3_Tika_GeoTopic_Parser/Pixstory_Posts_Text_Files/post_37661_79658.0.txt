India Win Under 19 world cup 

Indian u19 team won their final against England u19 by 4 wickets to clinch their fifth u19 world cup. India is the first team to win the competition five times having won it in 2000, 2008, 2012, 2018 and 2022 respectively. 

The u19 final was held at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, West Indies.
The English captain Tom Prest won the toss and opted to bat first.
The Indian bowlers managed to take all the 10 wickets in 44.5 overs as England scored a mere 189 giving India a target of 190 with Raj Bawa and Ravi Kumar picking up 5 and 4 wickets respectively. The five wickets haul and a knock of 35 runs from Raj Bawa earned him the Man of match award. 

Losing two important wickets in quick succession the Indian team was in a tough spot but Nishant Sindhu and Raj Bawa's 50 run partnership paved a way through for the rest to finish in style. 

Dinesh Bana scored a six to seal the victory when India required 1 of 15 balls. The spectacular six reminded cricket fans of M.S Dhoni's six in 2019 which also saw the senior team winning the world cup.
