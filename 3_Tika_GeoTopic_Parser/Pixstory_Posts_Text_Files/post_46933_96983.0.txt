We know Harriet Jacob as an African American writer who wrote 'Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl' an American classic. 'Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl' is arguably the most comprehensive slave narrative written by a woman.

 She like her book is a victim of slavery. Born into slavery in Edenton, North Carolina, she was sexually harassed by her enslaver. When he endangered to sell her children if she did not submit to his intention, she hid in a tiny crawl space under the roof of her grandmother's house, so low she could not stand up in it. After staying there for seven years, she finally survived and escaped to the free North, where she was reunited with her children.

She found work as a nanny and got into contact with abolitionist and feminist reformers. Even in New York, her freedom was in threat until her employer was able to pay off her legal owner.
During and immediately after the Civil War, she went to the Union-occupied parts of the South together with her daughter, organizing help and founding two schools for fugitive and freed slaves. She freed so many women and children from slavery. She remains as a hope in the chaos for many through her book.
