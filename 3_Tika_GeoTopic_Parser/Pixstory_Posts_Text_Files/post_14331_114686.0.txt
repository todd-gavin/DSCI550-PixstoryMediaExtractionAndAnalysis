A player that needs little introduction.

A world-class forward, capable of scoring exceptional goals, but also able to coordinate the entire frontline, often sending his teammates through on goal.

In recent years in the Champions League, with 22 goals and 32 assists, he has taken part in more goals than any other player.

A champion with winner medals to prove it, won first at Benfica, then Real Madrid, and most recently at PSG.

A mainstay of the Argentine national team, he won an Olympic gold in Beijing in 2008 and a Copa America in 2021 with the Albiceleste.

He is one of the players to have set up most goals in Europe’s top five leagues since the beginning of the decade. His 131 assists put him behind only Thomas Müller on 149 and Lionel Messi on 174.

Sprinting down the wing he makes the ball sing, turning defenders inside-out with his lightning speed and turn of foot, elevating the quality level on the left flank to that of pure poetry, enchanting every time he lights up the game with a spell-binding flash of skill.

Never known to hold back, he gives it everything he’s got: talent, acceleration, toil, commitment, class, charisma - and, of course, heart, as he shows the world every time he celebrates.

He is Angel Di Maria. And he is a Juventus player.
