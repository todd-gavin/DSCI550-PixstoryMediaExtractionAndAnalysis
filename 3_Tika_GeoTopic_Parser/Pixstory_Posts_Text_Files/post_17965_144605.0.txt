‘Let’s Just Call It What It Was’. - Chrissy Teigen 
Chrissy Teigen has revealed that she had an abortion. She and her husband, John Legend, lost their son, Jack, at 20 weeks. In Sept. 2020, the couple called the loss of their son a pregnancy loss. Teigen says she had to make "heartbreaking decisions" during that time. One of those decisions was choosing to save her life after discovering her pregnancy was no longer viable.
She said she came to the realization after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. "I told the world we had a miscarriage, the world agreed we had a miscarriage, all the headlines said it was a miscarriage.  Teigen, who is expecting her fourth child with Legend, said she came to the realization not long after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.  Teigen's baby No. 4 announcement came nearly two years after she and Legend announced the loss of Jack.  An abortion to save my life for a baby that had absolutely no chance. 
"The last few years have been a blur of emotions to say the least, but joy has filled our home and hearts again.1 billion shots later (in the leg lately, as u can see!) we have another on the way," she wrote alongside a pic showing off her bare bump. "Every appointment I’ve said to myself, 'ok if it’s healthy today I’ll announce' but then I breathe a sigh of relief to hear a heartbeat and decide I’m just too nervous still. I don’t think I’ll ever walk out of an appointment with more excitement than nerves but so far, everything is perfect and beautiful and I’m feeling hopeful and amazing."
"Ok phew it’s been very hard keeping this in for so long!" she concluded her post.
