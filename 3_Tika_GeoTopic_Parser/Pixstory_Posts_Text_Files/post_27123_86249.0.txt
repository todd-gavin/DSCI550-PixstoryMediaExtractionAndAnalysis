During an interview on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Matt Reeves was asked whether or not Robin could appear in a Batman sequel, to which he said
the following:

"Maybe. We'll just say maybe. I don't know. Here's the
thing, I have a lot of ideas about what I want to do. I'm not sure what the next story is. For me, whatever that story's going to be, it's going to be to take these characters and specifically Batman's character - and put them in some kind of emotional jeopardy. So when you talk about what you're talking about, there may be a really interesting story.

There'd have to be emotional stakes to get drawn into that character's story." "I don't want that character to become a cypher. I don't want to be like, 'Okay, so we saw it wasn't an origin tale, but you know what, that was kind of [Batman's] origins and now he's just perfect.' No, you need to test the character again and again and again. And for me, yeah, there might be something in that. I don't know. There's a deep-dive
that already happened at the beginning and now I'm gonna have to deep-dive again if we have the chance to make another one and so we shall see.
