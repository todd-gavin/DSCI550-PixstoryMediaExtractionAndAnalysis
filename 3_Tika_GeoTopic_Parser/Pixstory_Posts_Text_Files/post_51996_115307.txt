It s tough to play against one of the greatest tennis champions of all time It s even tougher when it s an event they have loved since they were a child and at which they have now won straight matches Nick Kyrgios found that out firsthand on Wimbledon s Centre Court on Sunday as Novak Djokovic broke his serve for the first time in their three meetings and then Kyrgios s psyche as the Australian recorded a loss in the men s singles final Kyrgios later said one of the key differences was facing one of tennis s all time greats over five sets instead of three In a best of three match you know you have no room to breathe Kyrgios said In best of five against these guys Novak and Nadal in general even Federer you feel like you win the first set you still have to climb up Mount Everest to get it done Whereas best of three those two previous times I won the first set I was right on top of him and I kept pressing and pressing While Djokovic defeated Kyrgios and claimed a seventh Wimbledon and st grand slam singles title one thing Djokovic did not break was Kyrgios s resolve Years ago when Kyrgios was in a darker place and less focused on his tennis that might have cracked too but to his credit he fought this match all the way to the end and pushed Djokovic to play some of his best tennis On court Kyrgios described Djokovic as a bit of a god after the Serbian great put up a wall making just unforced errors for the match in a metronomical performance that signalled after the nightmare that was the back end of and start of Djokovic was back Still Kyrgios pushed him hard and was left to lament letting key chances slip chief among them missing out on triple break back point as Djokovic served for the second set I felt like the trophy was definitely attainable today I played a hell of a first set and put myself in a position to you know obviously take a stranglehold of the match
