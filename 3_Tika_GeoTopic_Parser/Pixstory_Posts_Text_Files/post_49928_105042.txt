We already are at threat of natural disasters so we must avoid something that is man made and nuclear reactors pose a high risk There have been many incidents and we know the power of nuclear reactors as well as weapons Do we need to build more or look after a plant that could wipe out a whole area when it is at risk With its uses we have to think about the radioactive wastes it releases such as plutonium This is a very ethical issue because this waste would affect the sustainability factor in the future The inherent risk in the use of nuclear energy as well as the related expansion of nuclear technologies can and does have fatal consequences The only certain way to abolish this potentially devastating risk is to phase out nuclear power altogether Should we wait for another disaster to give up on nuclear power when there are much safer and cleaner ways
