Kashmir's copperware is under threat from machine-made products, which not only discredits the ancient trade but also robs hundreds of workers of their means of subsistence. 

Traditional Kashmiri copperware is eroding due to the use of machinery, which is eliminating thousands of jobs for artisans. 

The machine-made copper objects, in the opinion of coppersmiths and copper dealers, not only hurt employment development but also denigrate the traditional trade. 

According to Umer Mushtaq Lanker, owner of Tram Ghar (Lanker Metals) in downtown, "A single machine used for carving copper items will render 20 workers jobless. Such is an impact of these machines which have been by the Jammu and Kashmir government. In addition, machine made copper utensils have less durability which is a loss for customers as well."

Aziz Ahmad Misger, a coppersmith, claims that Kashmiri-made copper utensils were well-liked outside of the region due to their exquisite, handcrafted designs. "From dawn till dusk, artisans would create, design, and polish copper kitchenware. In addition to locals, many tourists would visit us to buy these tools, "He claims. 

The Kashmir Copper Workers Trade Union has called for a ban on machine-made copper products and action against individuals who manufacture copper utensils, which they claimed denigrated the centuries-old craft of copper handicraft. 

They requested that the police investigate the flagrant breach of the 2016 Copper Act and that they take action against individuals responsible for its production and trade.
