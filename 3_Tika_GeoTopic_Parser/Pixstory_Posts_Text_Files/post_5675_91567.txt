The things I Iove about the LOTR movie adaptations is the way Peter Jackson has used the resources at hand to make the trilogy enticing and grand Its tough to adapt such a commendable book as LOTR and to make it to absolute perfection is an art itself While a movie cannot showcase everything which a reader will find in a book but LOTR with its length of almost hours does justice to the book There are scenes in the movie which were not part of the story in the book but were merely refered to but Peter Jackson protrayed them For instance the arrival of the army of the dead in Minas Tirith on the call of Aregon isn t in the books but Jackson brought it to the big screen because in a movie it looks fabulous on screen a scene where an army of ghosts is is fighting for the hero against the villians Now who won t like such a story a scene In my opinion LOTR is the perfect example of a good movie adaptation where the makers not only show the most important part of the story but even go beyond the original text to entertain the audience
