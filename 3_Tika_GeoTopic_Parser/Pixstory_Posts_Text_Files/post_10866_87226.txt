In her years playing the game Luana says football has taught her a lot in life how to work with other people how to be responsible how to find strength and trust within oneself in tough moments The midfielder s resilience and grit through adversity reflect how strength is imparted beyond the field an injury from last year kept Luana out of the game for days requiring her to spend a lot of time alone without the group but the player s now returned stronger than ever It was a tough moment you re always working alone with the physio and it requires a lot of concentration and focus on what you re doing and what you have to do It s a long process and I think it made me more patient too Luana says Luana s approach to life shows that a commitment to football is also a commitment to oneself where one creates a balance on and off the field by taking the time to rest and living life the best way one can My family is not here but I ve met a lot of people and the girls from the team so I try to go out as much as possible to have a good time good energy and good laughs and then when we go back to the pitch we re a percent focused Luana says Luana s antidote to decompress before a game is to just be chill with the help of Brazilian music and to keep things simple
