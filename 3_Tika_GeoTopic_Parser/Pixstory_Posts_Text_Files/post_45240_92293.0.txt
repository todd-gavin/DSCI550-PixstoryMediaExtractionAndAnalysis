According to reports, referees for the event may be given unprecedented powers to add
stoppage time. FIFA has denied that it is considering changing the way it calculates game and
stoppage times in the run-up to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

According to widespread media reports, the regulatory body may make measures to ensure that
fans see the ball in action more frequently. However, if such a decision is in the works, FIFA has
stated that it will not be implemented before the finals begin.

What exactly was said?

"Following some reports and rumours spread today, FIFA would like to clarify that there will be
no changes to the rules regarding the length of football matches for the FIFA World Cup Qatar
2022 or any other competition," the organisation indicated on its official Twitter account.

The overall picture:

According to a report in Corriere dello Sport, FIFA President Gianni Infantino was considering
making games last up to 100 minutes or more to induce more action.

The rumoured additional measures include giving referees more authority to impose extended
stoppage time, which is now limited to injuries, VAR checks, and other severe delays. While a
football game lasts 90 minutes, studies show that the ball spends far less time in play.

According to the CIES Football Observatory, the average time in play for a Champions League
match is just 60.2 percent, and it is not uncommon for a game to go only 45 minutes, or half of
the full 90 minutes.
