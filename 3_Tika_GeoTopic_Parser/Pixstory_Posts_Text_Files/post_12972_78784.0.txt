Rihanna is expecting her first baby, and her fans just can not keep calm. While there had been rumours before, RiRi managed to keep the world guessing until she decided to tell the world herself. 

Over the weekend, Rihanna and boyfriend A$AP Rocky  were seen in New York City, where Rihanna flaunted her baby belly while wearing a long pink jacket. Her jacket was unbuttoned at the bottom, revealing her baby  bump, along with a gold cross and sparkling jewels.
