Tej Narayan Pandey, alias Pawan Pandey is the Samajwadi Party's candidate for the Ayodhya assembly constituency in the 2022 elections. Pandey, was a minister in the SP government led by Akhilesh Yadav from 2012 to 2017, having won the Ayodhya assembly constituency. In the 2017 assembly elections, he was defeated by BJP's Vedprakash Gupta from the same seat. Pandey has also served as the minister of state for entertainment tax in the Akhilesh Yadav government from 2013 to 14.

By all accounts Pandey has made election from Ayodhya seat very difficult for BJP and thatâ€™s why he is a candidate to watch out for.
