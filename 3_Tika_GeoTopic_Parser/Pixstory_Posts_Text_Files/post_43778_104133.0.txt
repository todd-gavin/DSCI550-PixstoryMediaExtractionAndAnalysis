Manchester United announced the departure of Frenchman Paul Pogba earlier today. The club wrote in a statement on their website "The club can announce that Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United at the end of June, upon the expiry of his contract."

Pogba, who has long been down this path at the club will not continue after a season of absences. Ole Gunnar Solksjær's continued trust in his abilities never paid off as he only showed glimpses of his past levels. His season started off on a high as he bagged four assists and was the leading assist-maker in the Premier League charts. 

Although he finished the campaign with 9 assists and a singular goal to count, this was still one of his worst seasons all things considered. He rarely ever made the final lineup under interim coach Ralf Ragnick and will now look for other options to pick from.

"It was a low-key end to a United career that brought so many individual high moments," the club continued.

"So many beautiful goals, assists and pieces of skill.

"For a boy that joined the academy at 16 to make over 200 United appearances and lift the Youth Cup, along with two major pieces of silverware, is something that should be applauded and celebrated. Unconditional support from the fans" in a message on social media following the club's announcement that he is leaving."

Pogba, now a free agent is linked to a move back to Turin. Max Allegri may be interested in his signature, as the World cup winner once thrived under the Italian's management. 

"I feel privileged to have played for this club," he wrote on Twitter

Real Madrid may also be interested in Pogba, although seeing how his world record €100M transfer ended up at United, his salary and agent bonuses might leave the Merengues rather sceptical.
