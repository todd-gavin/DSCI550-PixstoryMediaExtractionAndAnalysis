As much the education is considered the source of enlightenment, so are the ones providing it. But now it is a thing of the past because nothing has remained the same as how people used to respect teachers earlier.

For someone providing knowledge is akin to God itself because apparently, knowledge is our most precious possession.
But there is something different about how the parents and students used to keep their educators on a pedestal and respect them in contrast to what they do now.

For the past two years, covid created much chaos, and no one was left out of its trap; it was a difficult timeline for teachers who had to change their teaching ways and then endure the hostilities of both the parents and children.

If we see two sides of this narrative, one where the children lie and the other hand where the parents lie, there is a deep connection.
Earlier it was the parents who used to teach their children the importance of respecting their tutors. Fortunately, even the child knew about the decorum and considered their teachers as idols.
But the whole outlook has turned into vitriol where parents are most often seen talking about teachers in a deplorable manner which eventually impacts their children's minds, and they develop this unlikeliness for their teachers.

As a result, the stressed teachers leave their field of work because the treatment is unfair, and they have to deal with a lot.
