NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Roscosmos cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov returned to Earth on March 30 after extending the record for the longest solo mission by an American to 355 days. 

NASA TV reported that the trio left the International Space Station at 3:21 a.m. EDT and landed safely southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, at 7:28 a.m. (5:28 p.m. Kazakhstan time). 

"Mark's mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond," said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. "Our astronauts make incredible sacrifices in the name of science, exploration, and cutting-edge technology development, not least among them time away from loved ones. NASA and the nation are proud to welcome Mark home and grateful for his incredible contributions throughout his year-long stay on the International Space Station."

As the ESA intends to return to the Moon under the Artemis programme and prepare for Mars exploration, Vande Hei's prolonged trip will allow researchers to investigate the consequences of long-duration spaceflight on humans.

Vande Hei made approximately 5,680 orbits of the Earth and a voyage of more than 150 million miles, nearly the equivalent of 312 visits to the Moon and back, in support of NASA's aims for future human landings on the Moon. He saw the entrance of 15 new modules and visiting spacecraft, as well as the departure of 14 visiting spacecraft.
