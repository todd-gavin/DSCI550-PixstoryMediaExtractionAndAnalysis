On Sunday Shah Rukh and his manager Poonam Dadlani paid their final respects to the late singer at her funeral in Mumbai s Shivaji Park Shah Rukh not only paid her a floral tribute but also raised his hands in a Muslim prayer for her after touching her feet The gesture is being hailed as a great symbol of secularism by some The superstar who has stayed away from public eye since the arrest of his son was also trolled by some people on social media who said he was spitting in the mortal remains Unfortunately those people didn t realise that he did a Muslim prayer with his hands open and blow on the remains as according to Islam it brings blessings for the person the prayer is made for We have seen it happen everyday at homes where the elder would say a prayer for us and dry blow after wards The simple reason they gave was to keep the evil away and pass on blessings SRK did the same The hate mongers want to find wrong in everything better not to pay attention to them
