Is artificial intelligence (AI) on the horizon? Definitely!

As hackr io tells us, by 2021, AI funding forecasts show a $46 billion expenditure splurge. Hundreds of billions of dollars, together with rapid technological advancements, seem to point to a future in which AI is a possibility. 

Depending on whatever expert you consult, superintelligence may or may not exist. Today, we use artificial intelligence to help us with our daily duties. Smartphones have artificial intelligence (AI) that assists with routines, searches, and photo capturing. Vehicles also have artificial intelligence (AI) that helps with parking, collisions, pedestrians, and cruise control. 

For instance, Artificial intelligence can assist in the evolution of work, which can benefit the economy. Robots and artificial intelligence will assist people in performing their responsibilities more effectively, not replace them. Man and machine working together will be unstoppable. 

AI can become smarter over time via deep learning and machine learning, enhancing a company's productivity. AI will also lower the likelihood of human error and analyse past data to save money. 

The importance of facial recognition, pattern recognition, and digital content analysis will be enormous. Academic research, health sciences, and technology industries will all benefit.

Regardless of whether or not artificial intelligence will take over humanity, there is one takeaway from all of this: the technology has numerous advantages and nearly limitless applications.
