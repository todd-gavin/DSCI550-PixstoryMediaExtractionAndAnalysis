Diwali.....It's the day of diyas and sparkles!!!!
Festival is that moment of life when we tend to create lovely memories with family!!!!
Out of all other festivals, Diwali has a special place in my heart. I feel like all the negativity around me is being burnt and I feel all the pure positive vibes around me.
 The decorations, dazzling illumination are erected at several places in cities and also in rural areas on this day. The festival lights in the streets bring in a glory.
