Gutte or Gitte is a traditional game of India, which is played both by children and elders. The game involves five small stones or pebbles that each player needs to spin in the air. The game begins with a player spinning a stone in the air while gathering the remaining stones, lying on the floor with one hand, without allowing the one in the air to fall on the ground. Next, the player needs to throw two stones in the air and collect the remaining stones, and so on. Gutte is an interesting game to play centred around hand-eye coordination and reflexes, best enjoyed with a small group of friends.
