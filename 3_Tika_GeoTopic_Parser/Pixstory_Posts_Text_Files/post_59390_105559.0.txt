If someone gives you an option to choose between  truckloads of money but a depressed living OR to be underprivileged but have a really happy life, what would you choose?
I'm pretty sure it's the latter. Why is that so?
This is because even though many authors say that â€œRich people and nations are happier than their poor counterparts" but to be honest the impact of money isn't as large as you think.
If you have clothes to wear, food to eat, and a roof over your head, increased disposable income has just a small influence on your sense of well-being.
