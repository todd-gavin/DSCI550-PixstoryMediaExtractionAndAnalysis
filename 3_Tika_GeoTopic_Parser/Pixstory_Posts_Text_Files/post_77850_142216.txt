Kerala Cuisine Ate Kerala food after loooooong weeks Missed this even at Onam But now I feel a great satisfaction The pothichoru was nice had a flavour of banana leaves as the rice was packed in it and was hot Eating boiled red rice after ages really felt like feeding my soul Especially the omelette
