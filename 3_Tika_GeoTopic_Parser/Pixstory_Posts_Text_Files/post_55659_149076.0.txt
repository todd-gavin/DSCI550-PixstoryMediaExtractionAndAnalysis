Australia is still having trouble procuring submarines. However, 12 more sub-hunters are joining it. Kind of. News.com.au reported that the Royal Australian Navy has received approval from the US State Department for a $1.48 billion contract to purchase more Lockheed Martin MH-60R Seahawk combat helicopters. There's a catch, though. They will be prepared for its main weapon system but not with it. These powerful and massive Black Hawk helicopters were designed to hunt down hostile submarines. To accomplish this, they can send out up to 25 disposable sonobuoys. But a "dipping sonar," a sensor bundle at the end of a winch line lowered deep into the water, is their best tool for focusing on a target. The fixed-price package offer for the 12 new helicopters will be available. Bundled with spare engines, electronic defence, and communication equipment will be transported with them. For the Low-Frequency Sonars (ALFS), which are typically included as standard equipment, they will only have "aircraft provisions." The cause is directly related to Australia's history of defence procurement failures and a sudden change in our country's strategic environment.
