Part of Pâté sucrée dishes only  Here’s Strawberry Short Cake 
Now if you google the you will find only recipes with actually layered sponge cakes but it’s not actually there are 3 layers of biscuit/ pastry cakes then layers of whipped cream and strawberry filling.

Take Sugar, Fat( In this case butter ), Flour or Maida in 1 : 2 : 3 ratio. So the ingredients list is as follows -

Flour - 75gms
Butter - 50gms
Sugar - 25gms
Vanilla Essence - 5ml
Strawberry Essence - 5ml
Strawberry Filling - 50gms
Whipped Cream - 100ml 

Cream the sugar first with butter, use your fingertips not palm as the butter will melt, then add flour, vanilla & strawberry  essence to  form into a dough. Give rest 30 mins in fridge.

Roll out and cut in circles and bake for around 30mins at 180 C till swollen and done. Take 3 discs, apply whipped cream at bottom then place one disc and use a star nozzle because that was quite beautiful outcome which I wanted, put a circle of whipped cream around, pour strawberry filling on the middle around one spoon. Place the disc and repeat till the last disc in on top. 

After that design the very top accordingly, as you can see I have designed with another circle only and topped with fresh strawberry. 

Hopefully you will try this at home. 
Enjoy.
