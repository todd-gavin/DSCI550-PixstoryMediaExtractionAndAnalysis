Game developers 343 Industries are delaying the arrival of Season 3 of Halo Infinite to 2023, pushing it till March 7. While Halo Infinite players are desperate for fresh content, the long-awaited Forge beta has also now been delayed and will launch on November 8th alongside the co-op mode.
Coming with the Winter Update, the Forge Beta was originally planned for September, and it will allow Halo Infinite players to edit multiplayer levels and build new maps to share with fellow players.
As compensation for the Season 3 delay, Halo Infinite is set to receive a free 30 tier Battle Pass and two additional new maps, called Argyle and Detachment, both created by 343 Studios to show off the power of the Forge creative mode.
The developer promised that even though Forge will be in beta, it will be “fully featured” in the November release. Furthermore, the attached image mentions a new game mode called Covert One Flag and quality-of-life improvements.
The upcoming Season 3 of Halo Infinite is called Echoes Within, and it comes with a larger 100-tier battle pass, although it is unlikely to be free. It adds new maps to the Arena and Big Team Battle game modes and gives players access to a new weapon called the M392 Bandit.
Season 3 will introduce two game modes called VIP and Escalation, as well as a narrative event. Finally, Echoes Within adds a custom game browser to Halo Infinite, along with more quality-of-life enhancements.
