Life is better in a peaceful world , and today we look to those who have worked to maintain that peace and let's learn what what we can all do individually ! ✨
It's " World Peace Day Today " ! Every year on September 21, the World Peace Day is dedicated to develop the values of peace within and among all nations and peoples ! The International Day of Peace serves as a powerful reminder of what we can accomplish as a human race at a time when conflict and violence frequently dominate our news cycles .  Peace . Give it a chance ! 🤍
The theme this year is - End Racism .
Today , people are fighting , wars are going on and It is more important than ever today to promote peace and open-mindedness for acceptance across gender , race , and territories .🤍✨
Not a minute , not and hour . Let's promise ourselves to be in peace during our whole life . Let's feel it and offer it to our world . 
Happy peace Day everyone🤍✨
