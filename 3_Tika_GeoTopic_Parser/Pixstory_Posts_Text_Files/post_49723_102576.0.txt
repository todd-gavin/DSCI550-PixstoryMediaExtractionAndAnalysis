â€ŒJoe Biden will sign an executive order meant to enhance police accountability on 25th May. The signing will mark the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd.

The order, drafted in the absence of legislative action, directs federal agencies to modify use-of-force policies, prohibiting tactics such as chokeholds and constraining practices like no-knock warrants.

It also calls for a new national standard for accrediting police departments; founds a national database to track police misconduct; further prohibits the transfer of military equipment to police departments; and requires agencies to enforce new tools to screen for inherent prejudice among officers as well as recruits, including those who facilitate unlawful violence or harbour white supremacist views.

Officials said the order was the effort of many officials and lawmakers and civil rights groups and families of victims for more than 100 hours.

The order applies only to federal agencies as Biden does not have direct authority over state and local agencies. But White House officials said the order incentivizes all law enforcement agencies to contribute to the police registry and to approve the new accountability standards and de-escalation policies.

After the death of George, Floyd people had a lot of hope for Joe Biden as we know the attitude of Republican Counterparts. He keeps up his hope in the mind of Black People as he does excellent work for their safety.
