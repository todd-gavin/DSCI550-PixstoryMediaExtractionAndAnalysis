Every heart has suffererd 🥺❤️
Let me pick up those scattered pieces of mine or there is any way to play my life rewind
Let me heal my heart which is broken recently because it's shouting in pain terribly
Let me wipe my tears from swollen eyes
Let the sun come from dark skies 
Now should I comb my hairs and put the shining pins aside
Or should I leave them in mess and stay calm and quiet.
-Rhythm Singh ❤️
