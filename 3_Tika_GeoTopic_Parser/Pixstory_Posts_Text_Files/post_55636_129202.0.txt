More often than not, people discredit potatoes because of uneducated myths and not facts!

As per NDTV Health, Macrobiotic Nutritionist and Health Practitioner says that a 100 grams of potatoes contains about a 100 calories. 

The real problem here is the way they are prepared and not the potato in itself. Potato itself is healthy, but the way it’s often cooked may not be. “Fried potato chips, french fries, twizzlers and patties are loaded with calories especially because these are deep-fried. However, when steamed or baked potatoes can be as healthy as your veggies. The bad rep is due to the additional calories it assumes after frying in refined and fat-laden oils”  

Yes potatoes should be avoided but only by diabetic people!

Sweet potatoes earn a score of 70, while cooked white potatoes are given an 82 rating under the category of High Glycemic Foods. When consuming any potato preparation, diabetics are recommended to exercise caution. 

However, non-diabetics can prevent the sugar increase by mixing potatoes with low GI foods that are high in fibre, such as lentils, beans, nuts, or other high-fiber vegetables.

With every disease, there comes certain lifestyle changes but that doesn’t mean we start blaming potatoes for lack of nutrition!
