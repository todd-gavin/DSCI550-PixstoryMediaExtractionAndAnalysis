Dickinson Season 3
The final season of the critically acclaimed show of Apple Tv+ came out recently, if you have read my previous two reviews of the previous two seasons of Dickinson, you understand my love for this show and how well it blends the two narratives, it blends a modern element into the lives of  Emily and her family in the best possible way, their lives may have been sad but the way this show handles it is brilliant. 

One thing that comes foremost in my brain about the show is the treatment it has of the characters, there is plenty growth shown for the characters in the seasons of Dickinson, Emily and her sister Vinnie according to me go through the best amount of growth, there is plenty experimentation as well. 

The third season of Dickinson well and truly dreams, it dreams into the world of cinema, it is true cinema and peak Tv. Without a doubt, the third season is the best season of the show, it is written brilliantly with jokes and anecdotes that you will love. More than that, the third season of Dickinson has the most influential hard-hitting moments, especially with the scenes between Emily and her father Edward. 

As a fan of the show, it was tough to say goodbye to the show, but I feel grateful to have watched something of this calibre. 

If you remotely liked the first two seasons of the show, this season will blow you away over the level of acting, character development and writing. It is well and truly the best thing yet by Apple TV+.
