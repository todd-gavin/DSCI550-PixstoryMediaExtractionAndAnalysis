Grief is a natural experience which helps the person to process the pain of the loss and go ahead with the healing period. 
The stages of grief is not necessary to be in the chronological order, and it differs for each one. But in general there are seven stages. 
1. Shock
It is a stage where it is a state of numb and disbelief in response to the news of loss. It could be an emotional buffer to prevent someone from feeling overwhelmed. 
Denial
Denial could be refusing the reality of the loss or any associated feelings. As an individual accepts their reality, they move towards an healing process. 
3. Anger
At this stage, an individual could direct their anger towards a person who have died, doctors or to others. 
4. Bargaining
By bargaining it involves thoughts like “I will do anything if you take away the pain.” It is a stage where it comes to a point within the grieving process. It is accompanied along with guilt. 
5. Depression
During this stage a person would experience feelings like emptiness and intense sadness. It could be a stage where the person withdraws from daily activities and things they also once enjoyed. 
Testing
By testing it is a process where one is trying to find solutions which offers a means of dealing with loss.  
7. Acceptance
It is the final stage of the grieving process, where acceptance doesn't mean that people feel okay about the loss. But rather it means that they accept the reality of their loss and they go on with their life.
