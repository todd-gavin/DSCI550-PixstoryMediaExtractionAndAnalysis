Phenomena is the best watch of the year! 

I agree with Luke Buckmaster when he said that Man, I can even hear the colours! I hear the noises! In this bizarre and visually stunning short-form YouTube series, science and art collide. 

As the Guardian says, an additional 28-minute compilation episode is also available on ABC iView. By mixing chemical compounds, it transforms a lab into a set for a movie, producing spectacular effects that are accompanied by Kim Moyes of the Presets' enormous electro music. 

Director Josef Gatti embraces the magic of chemistry rather than the magic of motion pictures, dividing the series into episodes focused on various scientific disciplines (electricity, energy, matter, and magnetism). 

Or, to put it another way, he shows that they can be the same thing by discovering the ultimate effects in characteristics that connect the known cosmos together - aspects that are, in the words of Phenomena’s narrator, “written in the patterns of nature”.
