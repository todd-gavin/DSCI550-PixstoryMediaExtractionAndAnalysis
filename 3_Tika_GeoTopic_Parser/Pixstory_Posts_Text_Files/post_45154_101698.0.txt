Kylian Mbappe has opted to extend his contract with Paris Saint-Germain for another three years.

The 23-year-old France international's contract with the Ligue 1 champions is scheduled to expire on June 30, and it was widely expected that he would leave at the end of the season.


Real Madrid, the La Liga champions and Champions League finalists, were reportedly on the verge of sealing a deal for Mbappe before his abrupt change of heart.
When his contract ended, the World Cup winner, who joined PSG from Monaco for €180 million in 2017, was scheduled to go on a free transfer.

Real, who were willing to spend €230 million on Mbappe on Deadline Day last summer, were prepared to offer him a £110 million signing fee and a salary of £20 million per year after tax. Their overall investment would have been in the region of £300 million.

Mbappe grew up loving Real and claims that playing for them has always been his goal. He still hopes to play for them in the future.


His signing is a triumph for PSG's Qatari owners, who believe he will be one of the faces of the country's hosting of the World Cup this winter.


PSG is said to have offered Mbappe a £4 million per month salary contract, which would make him the highest-paid player in the league.


A contract extension would also ensure a massive signing-on fee in the region of £100 million, as well as concessions on image rights and bonuses for goals, Ballon d'Or honours, and Champions League victory.
Mbappe has yet to sign his new deal with PSG, which is expected to keep him at the Parc des Princes until 2025.


The futures of PSG head coach Mauricio Pochettino and sports director Leonardo remain quite uncertain. This summer, PSG want Zinedine Zidane to replace Pochettino.
