The Los Angeles Lakers may have had a terrible season but they had an unexpected bright spot in undrafted guard Austin Reaves Reaves went from a relative unknown to a pivotal player by season s end and looks like a long term piece for the Lakers moving forward The year old showed off a versatile skillset and ended his rookie year with a bang when he led Los Angeles to a thrilling overtime win against the Denver Nuggets in their regular season finale The Lakers are currently in the final stages of hiring their next head coach and Reaves discussed the qualities he would like to see in them Just someone that s gonna put in the work every single day like all of us players do Reaves said in an interview with Lakers Nation That s really all you can ask for in a coach and then just being a guy that can do a little bit of both Holding guys accountable and then on the other endif say you miss a couple of shots this is our one instead of saying you re done but you encourage them But there s a fine line in between that and I m definitely not a coach so I wouldn t know how to do those things together Someone that can really control situations and make good situations on the fly As far as whether or not NBA playing experience mattered Reaves believes that the most important thing for a coach is having a feel for the team Honestly I ve never thought about that I think guys that have played have probably a different feel than those that don t cause they ve been through it But I m not saying that a guy that hasn t played can t come in and be successful and do the right things I just think that it really depends on the personnel you have and how you manage those guys It s not really all about having a feel for the game but having a feel for who you have on your team and what s best for your team because everybody s different
