Seems like CW just can t have enough of the Supernatural boys Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki once again showed up together to CW upfront along with their Supernatural co actor Misha Collins to have some fun on there along with promoting their respective shows Ackles who is producing the Supernatural prequel The Winchesters on CW Padalecki who s in the lead role in CW show Walker which he is producing along with its prequel Walker Independence and Collins who is back at CW to star in the upcoming superhero series Gotham Knights took to stage to pitch their ideas for the movies and specials Mark Pedowitz was talking about It s safe to say the Supernatural alumni had great fun with him and this reunion The trailers to The Winchesters which is the story of Sam and Dean s parents John and Mary Winchester before the boys were born and Walker Independence which is set in late s that follows the story of an affluent and tough minded Bostonian whose husband is murdered before her eyes while on their journey out West dropped on the CW s offcial YouTube channel Personally it was nice seeing Dean Winchester on my screen again but it s still too early to comment on what I feel about the show Walker Independence s trailer was intriguing but I wonder if it ll manage to match the standard of its parent show Seems like I gotta wait to find out about both these things lol
