From taking brisk showers to giving up almonds, it seems like the world has united in search for the most effective way to save water in the face of increasing droughts.

Adopting a vegan diet, however, is the most efficient way of saving water, as plant foods require way less water to produce compared to animal products.

In fact, agricultural production as a whole accounts for 93% of the worldâ€™s water supply, with meat and dairy production being the biggest culprit: one quarter of our freshwater is used for this industry alone!

On the other hand, research shows that one person going vegan can save over 200,000 gallons of water a year (and you're not supporting factory farms in the process!).
