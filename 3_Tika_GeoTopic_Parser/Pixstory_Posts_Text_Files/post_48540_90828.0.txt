For Christians in Christ, forgiveness is very vital. This is due to the fact that believers are forgiven. The apostle Paul states in these Ephesians passages that believers should forgive as God has forgiven us. But, isn't it true that forgiveness isn't always easy? It's especially difficult when the pain is severe or when the person who caused the pain refuses to accept responsibility. We sometimes try to cram so much into the concept of forgiveness that we end up burdening ourselves and others with an impossible burden to bear. That is why we must distinguish between what forgiveness is and what it is not. Even more essential, we must comprehend why forgiveness is so necessary. When we do, we'll find that forgiveness is not only feasible for Christians, but also extremely beneficial to our lives and relationships.

—All bitterness and rage and anger and shouting and slander should be put away from you, along with all malice. Become kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another as God also forgave you in Christ.

[ Ephesians 4:31–32 ]

The term Paul uses to characterise forgiveness in this context is grace. It's all about helping others. We are to gladly give to others by forgiving them because God has graciously given us forgiveness, life, and salvation. According to Paul, what is forgiveness? It's the gift we provide when we forgive someone else's wrongdoing against us and remove it from our personal wrongdoings list. What Paul writes about forgiveness here helps us understand what it means in practise and why it is so important.
