Enjoying Anzac biscuits has become an integral part of one of the most important days on the Australian calendar.

Since the Anzac biscuit became widely popular after being cooked and consumed by the diggers in World War I, it has also evolved into an integral part of commemorating one of the most significant dates on the Australian calendar.

The Morning Show was visited by Annie Keifer and Cath Sloan from the Country Women’s Association of NSW, who shared their expertise when it comes to creating the traditional recipe that first appeared in the CWA’s Calendar Cookbook in 1933.
