The day of Sampdoria-Juve has arrived. The first away match of the season sees the Bianconeri visit Sampdoria. Another three points against the Blucerchiati would set a record for Juve. Let's discover a few facts from the past to the present.


RECORD BID - Juventus have won all their last six Serie A matches against Sampdoria in Serie A - another win would set a record of consecutive successes against the Blucerchiati in the league.

DISTANT DRAW - The last Serie A stalemate between Sampdoria and Juventus dates back to 14 December 2014, a 1-1 draw through goals from Patrice Evra and Manolo Gabbiadini. Juventus have won 13 of the 15 matches played since.

GOAL GRABBERS - Juventus have won by scoring at least two goals in each of their last three away games at Sampdoria in the top flight - only between 1973 and 1977 did they record a longer streak of successes at Marassi when they collected four wins with at least two goals to their credit.

YOUTH SYSTEM - Juventus fielded four players born from 1/1/2000 onwards in Matchday 1 with Dusan Vlahovic, Nicolò Rovella, Matias Soulé and Fabio Miretti - only Lecce counted more on the inaugural day of Serie A 22/23.

LOCA JOY - Manuel Locatelli's first goal with the shirt of Juventus came against Sampdoria, in the 3-2 win on 26 September 2021, one of only two Serie A matches in which the midfielder has both scored and served an assist.
