World stocks closed higher on Friday, bouncing back from a sharp fall after Russia invaded Ukraine.

So, why did the markets bounce back?

The sanctions announced by the Western countries have been largely against individuals of the Russian government, some banks and a few others like the U.K., banning the official aircraft carrier of Russia, Aeroflot from its skies. Since energy-related companies have been spared from any sanctions, the belief is that the world wouldn't face oil or gas shortage because of the Russian invasion and ensuing sanctions against it. It as to be pointed that Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas and one of the world's largest oil-producing nations and an important member of the cartel of oil-producing nations, the OPEC.

International crude oil prices dropped sharply after more than 10% spike in two days. 

The U.S. added four Russian banks to the sanctions list on Thursday, including Russia's second-largest financial institution VTB Bank. Russia's largest bank, Sberbank cannot open accounts at US-based banks. But these are considered relatively mild sanctions.

But after Friday, there has been talk of Russia being thrown out of the SWIFT international payments system, also called the Gmail of international financial transactions. This could adversely affect the markets. There is also speculation about a possible move to ban Russia's oil and gas exports. These could again have a detrimental effect on the world stock markets. 

Experts have warned that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could change the world forever, very much like the Cold War did between the West and Soviet Russia. But it is not necessary that the conflict had a detrimental effect on the world stock markets. For instance, the Cold War may have pushed many countries on the brink of destroying their economies, but stock markets, especially in the U.S., U.K, and others did well.

It has to be seen how the world markets will react once the full force of sanctions is in place.
