In the space of a few months, Italy coached by Roberto Mancini went from joy at winning the European Championship to disappointment at the unexpected elimination in the playoffs leading up to the World Cup in Qatar at the hands of little Macedonia. After the final whistle, the manager did not hide his bitterness Last July I experienced the greatest joy of my career at the European Championship Now I experienced the greatest disappointment In football this is incredible things happen We did everything to win then we conceded a goal in the 90th minute It seemed made on purpose it seemed written We shouldn&#39;t have gone as far as this point but I love my players more than at the European Championship My future I don&#39;t know now the disappointment is too big
