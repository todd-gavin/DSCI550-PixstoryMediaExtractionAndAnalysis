Why do flocks of birds swoop and swirl together in the sky Artie W age Astoria New York A shape shifting flock of thousands of starlings called a murmuration is amazing to see As many as birds join together in flight The birds spread out and come together The flock splits apart and fuses together again Murmurations constantly change direction flying up a few hundred meters then zooming down to almost crash to the ground They look like swirling blobs making teardrops figure eights columns and other shapes A murmuration can move fast starlings fly up to miles per hour kilometers per hour The European or common starling like many birds forms groups called flocks when foraging for food or migrating But a murmuration is different This special kind of flock is named for the sound of a low murmur it makes from thousands of wingbeats and soft flight calls Murmurations form about an hour before sunset in fall winter and early spring when the birds are near where they ll sleep After maybe minutes of this spectacular aerial display the birds all at once drop down into their roost for the night Why do starlings form murmurations Unlike the V formations of migrating geese murmurations provide no aerodynamic advantage Scientists think a murmuration is a visual invitation to attract other starlings to join a group night roost One theory is that spending the night together keeps the starlings warmer as they share their body heat It might also reduce the chance an individual bird would be eaten overnight by a predator such as an owl or marten This dilution effect might be part of the reason murmurations happen The more starlings in the flock the lower the risk to any one bird of being the one that gets snagged by a predator Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages If you have a question you d like an expert to answer send it to curiouskidsus theconversation com a Read more at The Conversation Image Credits
