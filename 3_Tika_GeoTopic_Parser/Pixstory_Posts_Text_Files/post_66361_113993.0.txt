You know I kinda can draw.. Not an expert at it but the one on this post is drawn by me on paper. So I can draw. 

When I was thinking how would I have advised a person who is getting into drawing at maturity like I did at 19 years of age (I'm 23 now BTW), I kind of wondered if I should really talk about the technical aspects because those can be learnt nowadays anywhere for free especially since YouTube is there. 

So I won't be talking precisely about how to draw but what should your mentality be to draw.

See I was a person with little skill sets in life when I started drawing by myself because I loved and still now love anime. I just wanted to imitate my favourite drawings hoping to get as close as I could get and that's basically how we human beings start learning anything not only drawing. We imitate what we like, are bad at it but don't realize, we keep on imitating day after day sometimes noticing some extra bits and pieces of information and implementing those to make something a little different of our own. Slowly time and experience provides us confidence. We start perceiving everything with clarity and incorporate our own new ideas along the way to get even further. 

Basically what I wanted to say is that bringing confidence is the key. Start holding that pen confidently. That's all you have to do. Though easier said than done, this can be done at any age and it will be a much easier and faster process with your mature brain than a child holding a pencil. Just don't get distracted by what people around you are capable of. If you see a child drawing better than you, remember he has been drawing years longer than you and is your senior in the field.

There's nothing called a prodigy. Information is everything. Just keep the inquisitive human mind awake and learn through experience. That's how I got this far and will keep on moving further.
