Prakriti and Purusha are the two different aspects of the manifest Brahman, known as Isvara. They participate, regulate and implement the universal creative process. Prakriti means that which is found in its natural, unaltered form. Its opposite is vikriti, which means, that which is deformed or altered from its natural state. Prakriti also means "that which gives shapes or forms" signifying Nature or pure energy. 
Both Purusha and Prakriti are eternal, indestructible realities. The formed is considered the essential cause and the latter the material cause of creation.
Prakriti operates at two levels. Its lower nature, which consists of the eight-fold nature namely, earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, reason and the ego , while its higher nature consists of that (life force) by which all the living entities are upheld. All the beings in the universe originate from this two fold Prakriti, the Adhibhuta aspect of God 
At the end of every cycle of creation, all the entities dissolve in the Universal Prakriti and at the beginning of every cycle of creation. ðŸ•‰
At the physical level, Prakriti is the body and the mind (kshetra or the field) with all their constituent parts, while Purusha is the indwelling witness Spirit, (kshetragna or the knower of the body), the pure, egoless consciousness that exists beyond the senses and the mind.Â
