 The upcoming bundle was revealed with a new ‘Next Gen Immersion’ trailer for the Sony Interactive action adventure game God Of War: Ragnarok.
The bundle will include a PS5 disc console with a standard white controller and a digital copy of God of War Ragnarök. In addition, it will launch on the same day as the game, though Sony has yet to reveal a price for it.
 Also, a short new story trailer has also been revealed for God of War Ragnarok, which touts its next-gen features on the PS5, including implementation of the Dual Sense haptic feedback, native 4K visual, support for 3D audio, and more.
 As of now, God Of War: Ragnarok has gone gold  meaning that the folks at developer Sony Santa Monica have a launch build ready for discs and thus prepared for physical production, thus effectively cementing the game’s November 9 release date.
