Alcohol consumption is harmful in one way or another. People gullibly to alcohol and drugs are moving into escapism. They don't want to face the happiness and sadness of the whole potion of life! Instead, they escape from these harmful toxins. Don't say alcohol isn't harmful it is the number one cause of Liver cirrhosis liver cancer and many deadly diseases. Due to the fast-food life, we are living, many might have fat deposits on the liver causing fatty liver. Fatty liver can be controlled through proper food intake it becomes worse with alcohol consumption to a stage wherein your liver will be partially damaged. 

I don't see any positive impacts on lowering MLDA it will only make the youths drunkards. It is medically irresponsible. Now if youths drink under supervision lowering will irresponsibly allow a bigger segment of the population to drink alcohol in bars and nightclubs, which are not safe environments. Many start drinking due to peer pressure at a very young age. That doesn't count as a choice. It will be too late to realise it due to immaturity and they would have become addicts. We already have many cases of abuse being drunk, drinking and driving cases lowering MLDA will only increase its rate. The rate of drinking among US teenagers is lower than in most European countries. Lowering MLDA 21 would give high schoolers and even middle schoolers easier access to alcohol.
MLDA 21 helps deter underage binge drinking.  It exerts valuable social pressure on potential underage drinkers and those who may serve them. Lowering the drinking age will invite more use of illicit drugs among 18-21-year-olds. Hence I strongly stand against lowering MLDA.
