Do you guys think it's a wardrobe malfunction? Or is it a wise choice?? This time I decided to go all green and the trial room lighting did justice to the combination. 

Halter neck crop tops are always a Yess with loose track pants given a particular colour choice, isn't it?
So I tried this combination for the first time and this is how my trial room selfie came out to be!
