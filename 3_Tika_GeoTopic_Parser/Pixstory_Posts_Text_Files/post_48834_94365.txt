Lions and humans are not comparable Having said that the logic does not apply here even if we excuse eating other animals A lion does not artificially inseminate or forcibly breed millions of animals A lion does not put its prey through what humans put animals used as livestock through Traditions and customs have long been used to justify exploitation And it does not stop at justifying animal exploitation traditions have been used to justify misogyny homophobia transphobia ableism and whatnot Culture is never an excuse enough to carry out something exploitative and cruel People can have fun in a hundred different ways There are alternatives to meat that taste the same have similar nutrition quotient and even are many times healthier I don t understand why exactly do we need to harm innocent beings for our fun when we have the option not to It s excusable when people cannot do that but when you can why not Like you said people gather and spend time with their loved ones That is fun Not paying for death and gore People can enjoy this family time without putting someone through such horrific fate It is a few minutes maybe a few hours of joy for you but for all those animals all those little lambs it costed them their entire life They lived a short terrible painful life Celebrating humanity by separating a mother and her child by torturing and killing a literal baby doesn t sound ironic to you
