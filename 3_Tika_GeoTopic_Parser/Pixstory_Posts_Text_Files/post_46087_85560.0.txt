On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Alabama to commemorate a watershed event in the fight for voting rights in the United States, a trip that comes as congressional efforts to reinstate the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act have stalled. 

TOI reported that the 57th anniversary of "Bloody Sunday," when white state troopers attacked Black voting rights demonstrators attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, is being commemorated by Harris' visit to Selma, Alabama. The nation's first female Vice President, as well as the first African American and Indian American to hold the position, will speak at the place known as "hallowed ground" in the fight for minority people' voting rights.

On March 7, 1965, state troopers assaulted and tear-gassed peaceful marchers, including teenage activist John Lewis, who would later become a long-serving Georgia Congressman. The images of the violence horrified the country and fueled public support for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 

Her visit to the birthplace of the Voting Rights Act comes as Democrats have failed to amend the landmark legislation and adopt additional measures to make voting more simple for citizens.

The bill, which is named after Lewis, who died in 2020, is part of a larger election package that failed to pass the US Senate in February. 

House majority leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said he believed a compromise could still be reached to rescue the voting rights law named after Lewis while visiting Alabama as part of a legislative pilgrimage that coincided with the anniversary.
