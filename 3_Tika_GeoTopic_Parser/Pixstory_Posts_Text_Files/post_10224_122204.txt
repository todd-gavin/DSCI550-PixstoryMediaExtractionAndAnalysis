Chief Justice of India continues As soon as the counsel had exhausted himself he would open his eyes and in a sweet manner deliver his judgment dismissed I tried towards the last part of my career to imitate him but with no success You have very nicely put it that I possess a good physique and have still great capacity to work I have plenty of hobbies apart from my agricultural and horticultural interests there are educational and social interests I also wish now at this age to assume the role of an agitator because it seems to me that nothing succeeds in this country more than agitation During my short career as Chief Justice of India I have tried but without success to see that there is an all India judicial cadre of services an all India cadre of High Court Judges and an all India Bar There are hurdles and handicaps constitutional and otherwise in the way Now that I am a free person and I have achieved my freedom from official trappings I want to assume the role of an agitator to see that these reforms are brought about and I hope to collect around me some people who will go about the country and agitate on these matters so that the official wheels move I do feel most strongly that in this country for the purity of the administration of justice it is necessary that the High Courts are not manned purely by local people During British period recruitments to High Courts were never made purely from local people This is a recent development The sooner our leaders give thought to it the better will it be for the administration of justice To be continued
