Since the pandemic began there have been several documented cases of humans transmitting SARS CoV the virus that causes COVID to their pets But the reverse has been rarer until recently hamsters mink and white tailed deer were the only animals reported to have spread SARS CoV to people Now for the first time a group of researchers in Thailand has demonstrated a likely case of transmission from a cat back to a human So should we be worried about the possibility of catching COVID from our pets Probably not on the basis of this study But there are areas where pet to human transmission could be a concern in the future The study reports that a father and his adult son who caught COVID in Bangkok were transported km to a hospital in the Hatyai district of Thailand because there were no hospital beds available in Bangkok The patients travelled by ambulance together with their pet cat There is no mention in the study as to why the cat was with them On arrival the cat was examined by three local veterinarians and was swabbed for SARS CoV While the nasal swab was being taken the cat sneezed in the face of one of the veterinarians The test on the cat was positive and this veterinarian also became positive a few days later Careful sequencing of the virus from the father and son from the cat and from the veterinarian showed that they were identical and importantly different from the strains circulating in the area around Hatyai The very strong inference is that the father son and cat had caught COVID in Bangkok while the cat infected the veterinarian during the examination SARS CoV is already known to infect a range of domestic and wild animals including bats cats dogs mink and deer Based on comparing the receptors on the surface of the virus and on a range of animal cells scientists predict that it could infect many more species if the opportunity arose Read more
