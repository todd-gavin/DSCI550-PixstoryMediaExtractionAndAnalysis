The Saudi royal family plans to spend $ 1 billion a year supporting basic research to find ways to rejuvenate and extend the life of its citizens.
Saudi Arabia is paying for a non-profit organization whose researchers have discovered the root cause of human aging in its physiology and are looking for a drug that slows down aging.

With this investment, Saudi Arabia will become one of the largest sponsors of researchers seeking the elixir of youth.

The legal provisions of the Evolution Foundation were prepared by a royal decree in 2018. The foundation is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, and is made up of American billionaires, Russian and British businessmen.

Although the foundation has not yet been officially launched, scientific meetings are being held.
Felipe Sierra, former director of the Department of Aging Biology at the National Institutes of Health, serves as the Foundation's Senior Director.
