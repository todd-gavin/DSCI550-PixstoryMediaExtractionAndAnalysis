tvN’s “You Quiz on the Block” will be taking some time to reorganize!

On July 12, tvN released the following statement:

tvN’s “You Quiz on the Block” will go on summer vacation after the broadcast on July 20 (Wednesday) and return on October 5 (Wednesday).

So far, “You Quiz on the Block” has undergone two periods or reorganization since its first broadcast in 2018.

This time, in an unusual situation of a pandemic, the broadcast has been continuing nonstop since March 2020, thanks to all your passionate love.

We will have a fruitful reorganization time during the given vacation.

Please give lots of attention to “You Quiz on the Block” that will come back on October 5.

Hosted by Yoo Jae Suk and Jo Se Ho, the show revolves around talking with celebrities and ordinary people and giving them surprise quizzes.
