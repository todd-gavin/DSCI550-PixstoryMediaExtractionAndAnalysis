Chup The film releases today, that is, on September 23 across the country. Starring Sunny Deol, Dulquer Salmaan, Pooja Bhatt and Shreya Dhanwanthary. âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…The film was initially being targetted for a limited 600 screen release but the screens are over 800 now, since the the demand on the first day, in terms of ticketing receipts, is higher than all films released this year in Hindi, barring Brahmastra, which was a much bigger film. ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯The benefit of low ticket prices can be seen for mid and low budget films, since in an ideal scenario, it would have an opening, less than the advances, and footfalls, even lesser. ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜±The film has sold over 1.3L tickets in advance across multiplex chains in India and it is an excellent result for the film. It shows the willingness of the audience to go to theatres for films that don't have exhorbirantly high ticket rates.âœ… The film will get a good foundation for the word of mouth to travel, but the problem is that the footfalls are concentrated for day 1 and there is little to no advance for Saturday and Sunday because a good chunk of the prospective viewers are watching it on the very first day, courtesy the subsidised ticket rates. Regardless, talking purely based on the first day ticketing receipts, we are in for a good day in terms of potential viewers.âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…
