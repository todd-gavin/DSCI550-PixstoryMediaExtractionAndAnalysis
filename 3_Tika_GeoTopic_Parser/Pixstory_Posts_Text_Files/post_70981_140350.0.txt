Sinking Bollywood’s biggest hope, Brahmastra, is going to be released in a few hours, and the hype has touched its peaked, and it is reflecting in the advance bookings.
If Brahmastra gets a thumbs up from the critics and audience on its first day, then no agenda-driven Boycott is going to affect its BO run.
There is an undercurrent of excitement for this film amongst the audience. The film has recorded the best advance bookings since 2019’s WAR for a Bollywood film.
The film has grossed around 13 crores already for the weekend.
Recently, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt visited Lord Shiva’s temple in Ujjain, but some Hindutva group goons created a ruckus, and the couple wasn’t allowed inside the temple due to safety concerns.
Many years ago, during an interview, Ranbir said that he is a big beef guy and loves eating beef. This statement has hurt some Hindutva groups who are calling for the film’s boycott.
 
Some members of the group tried creating tension by stopping Ranbir and Alia from entering the temple. The police came into the picture and thrashed those goons. But Alia and Ranbir had to return without having Shiva’s darshan.
When Ayan Mukerji was asked about this issue, he said that he was extremely upset and hurt about such incidents.
Let’s hope Brahmastra delivers big at the box office and revives Bollywood, which is facing its worst crisis ever post-pandemic.
