Inflation is a real issue in the US.In March consumer prices were 8.5% higher than a year earlier, the fastest annual rise since 1981. Inflation is the greatest problem faced by America and the countries under NATO. President Joe Biden has released oil from strategic reserves to try to deter petrol prices. We can obviously blame Putin but isn't the government also responsible for not controlling or preventing inflation at the right time.

‌This roaring price of commodities since the war disrupts life all over the world. But the rate in the US has been higher than in other European states. We can blame the pandemic, the ascending demand since the introduction of coronavirus vaccines, along with supply chain issues. Conservatives, and some liberals, also argue the administration’s American Rescue Plan added to the problem.
Democrats, who hold the presidency and narrow control of both chambers of Congress, are set to pay more of a political price unless Biden and party leadership can rapidly stifle inflation or change the dynamic of the economy. 
We know when people struggle to leave they do forget about the Abortion laws and all the major issues fall out of the limelight and inflation becomes the central issue because it affects each and everyone directly. 

Polls do show voters do accept some of the Democratic narratives about inflation, including the White House’s label of “Putin’s price hike” and efforts to pin the high prices on selfish oil companies eager to hike prices when the price of crude rises, but who won’t cut prices when it drops but the end of the day one only hopes for the result. This must be the priority of democrats.
