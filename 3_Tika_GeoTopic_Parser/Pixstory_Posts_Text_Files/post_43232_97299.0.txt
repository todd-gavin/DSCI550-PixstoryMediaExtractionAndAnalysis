Manoj went on to explain why a Hindi-dubbed KGF 2 or RRR can gross over Rs. 300 crores in India, whereas high-budget Hindi films like Sooryavanshi struggle to gross even Rs. 200 crores. The actor said that the success of these films is a lesson for Bollywood that they must learn quickly. "They are unabashedly passionate, and they treat every shot as if it were the best photo in the world. They shoot a film exactly as they envision it; they do not dumb it down for the audience because they cherish their audience and their zeal is unrivaled,” he said to Delhi Times.
