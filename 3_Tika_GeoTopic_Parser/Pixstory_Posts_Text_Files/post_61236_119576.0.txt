When you’re stressed, it can be hard to know where to start, so i have crowdsourced a list of affirmations. 
Here are positive affirmations:
1. Delegation isn’t failure. It’s okay to ask for help. 
2. My worth is not defined by my to-do list. 
3. This job is what I do and I do it well. But it does not define who I am. 
4. I can do anything, but I can’t do everything. 
5. My well-being is my top priority. 
6. Taking an hour to unplug and recharge my batteries will help me go 12 more.
7. Rest is work, too. It’s a job that needs to be done. 
8. It’s okay to work hard, but it’s not okay to work so hard that my work is no longer effective. 
9. It’s okay to pause and take a break… but don’t give up. 
10. This is not the end of the world. Start again tomorrow. 

Inhale and exhale when you’re stressed it really works
