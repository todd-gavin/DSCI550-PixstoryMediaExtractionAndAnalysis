The French winger could leave the club for free at the end of the season, but constructive conversations with the club have taken place this week. 

Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde says he would sign Ousmane Dembele's new deal if he could, and that he might be the best winger in the world.

Dembele has the option to leave the club for free at the conclusion of the season, 
but the Camp Nou side is attempting to persuade him to sign a new contract. Xavi is keen for the France international to extend his stay at the Catalan club, praising his dedication and professionalism.

"I hope he can stay with us," he told reporters. "I have already said it and I have no problem repeating it again.

"He can be the best in the world in his position. The club is working for the present and the future.

"Ousmane is an important footballer and I hope he decides to stay. I'd sign his new contract immediately.

"I can only speak since I took charge and he is being exemplary in how he trains, his attitude, commitment and his involvement.

"I don't know how he was before but I see him motivated, happy and with a very winning character. It's not a surprise that he'd come to training on his day off. He's a great professional."

Barcelona spoke with the 24-year-representatives and had a "really positive" meeting.

However, no agreement has been reached as of yet, and negotiations over the club's financial â€˜red lines' are expected to continue.

Since Xavi's appointment as coach in November, Dembele has had a comeback at Barca. Injuries kept Dembele out of the lineup for much of the first half of the season, but he has scored one goal and assisted on another ten in 13 La Liga matches since his return.
