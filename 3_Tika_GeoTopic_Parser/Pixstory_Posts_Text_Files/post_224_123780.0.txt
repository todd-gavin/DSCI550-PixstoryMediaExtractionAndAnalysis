Nothing materializes the past the way a film photo does, but nothing gets forgotten as easily — photo albums camouflage with the ridges of pantry cabinets, lost in the mundane movements of reaching for the same snack everyday.

The phone album is a paradox within itself: an overwhelming mosaic of our lives in grids packed in like sardines — too claustrophobic to navigate, and too overwhelming to satisfy a present that wants to be grounded with its past.

We’re living with the past everywhere, but the concept of remembering it becomes fuzzier, with parts crumpled out from each other rather than waiting to be unfolded through a timeline of logistical memory — not that that concept can ever be a possibility. 

Snapchat is the memory of a lost youth stuck in a creaky attic because nostalgia is too priceless to discard but too dissociative to live with in the everyday. Twitter is a moment that gets lost once the likes and retweets reach their capacity to care. I can hardly see my friends on Instagram and I have no recollection of most of the people on my Facebook friend list.

They all have exclusive aspects to some moment in my life, but no way to intersect. It’s so jarring to have parts of a self stored in this disarray while simultaneously not caring enough to string these selves together.

Anyway, thank you for reading my melodramatic longing for a past that I can’t care enough to remember — all this was prompted by a snapchat notification, that almost had me deleting the app before I went down its memory lane to the address of the first photo I took after my life-bringing gender-affirming buzzcut.
