Asbestos a natural mineral has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in the past few decades Because of its flexible and heat and fire resistant fibres it was used in thousands of consumer products such as roofing shingles and textile until it was revealed that exposure to it can cause lung cancer called mesothelioma along with several other types of cancer Most recently it hit the headlines when healthcare company Johnson Johnson was accused of selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos Two years ago the company withdrew its talc based baby powder from sale in the US and Canada But the carcinogenic substance now could stage a comeback in certain places as a carbon sink Scientists have somewhat serendipitously discovered how closed mines of asbestos might have behaved as default carbon sinks According to a report in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s MIT Technology Review certain types of fibrous asbestos are capable of holding massive amounts of carbon dioxide molecules dissolved in rainwater or floating through air And this includes the most common type of asbestos called chrysotile which reacts with carbon dioxide producing magnesium carbonate minerals such as magnesite It s a stable material that can keep gases responsible for global warming trapped for thousands of years This possibility of being a carbon sink is inspiring scientists working on carbon removal from mining wastes to use chrysolite to capture carbon from by products of nickel copper diamond and platinum mining Scientists are now carrying out pilot projects in the mines of British Columbia Canada and Montana US to test the feasibility of asbestos as a carbon neutralising agent The climate panel of the UN has set a target of cutting down carbon emissions by so that the planet doesn t warm beyond C To meet that target billions of tons of carbon dioxide needs to be eliminated from the Earth s atmosphere by the mid century Asbestos can certainly come handy to meet the gigantic target But scientists must ensure that turning asbestos into a carbon sink should not come at human cost READ MORE
