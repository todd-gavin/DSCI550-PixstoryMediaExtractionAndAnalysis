A leader need not be the most talented and skillfull person but a person who continues to always bring out the best in everyone around him.
Being a leader is not only a privilege but a great responsibility. 
MS Dhoni for example was always the first to take criticism and back his teammates when they were at their worst and always gave the youngsters the opportunity to raise the trophy whenever we won a tournament. MS Dhoni, Barack Obama and Narendra Modi are all great leaders and an inspiration for all of us to emulate.
