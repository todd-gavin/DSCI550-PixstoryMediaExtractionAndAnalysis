Women still face disadvantages in the workplace. We do not receive the same pay as our male counterparts. Sponsorship, high-profile assignments, and promotions are not available to us in the same way. However, we may be unaware of the dangers of gendered ageism, which arises from the junction of gender bias and ageism.

Gendered ageism impacts women at all stages of their careers, according to a recent study of 729 professional women aged 18 to 70. Gendered ageism affects 80 percent of women polled, including 77 percent of those under 35, who are presumably seen as being too young.

"Feeling like my thoughts were ignored" (47%), "seeing younger colleagues get all the attention" (42%), and "not being invited to critical meetings" were the most common experiences (35% ). Surprisingly, 33% said they didn't think they'd be able to receive an interview due to their age.

Women are affected by gendered ageism at all phases of their careers, but especially when they are under 35 and over 50. The emphasis on 'lookism' puts pressure on women to appear young, and their performance is frequently overlooked when they are evaluated. As a result, many women in their 50s are pushed to the sidelines or fired to make way for younger staff. Though this is true for men as well, women are more affected. Women find it considerably more difficult to rehire after being fired, especially if they are nearing retirement age.

Ageism based on gender is certainly a problem that has to be addressed. Managers and HR officials need to be better prepared to talk to women who are suffering ageism, and their employers need to provide a safe climate in which these talks may take place.
