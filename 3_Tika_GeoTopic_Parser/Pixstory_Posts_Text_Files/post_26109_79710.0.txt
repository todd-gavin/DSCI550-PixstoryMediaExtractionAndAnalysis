Ronan was a 4 year old boy who sadly died because of neuroblastoma , a type of cancer in May , 2011. Maya Thompsom , his mother wrote a blog about him ' Rockstar Ronan' which inspired Taylor Swift to write a song about him " Ronan". Ronan was a really strong boy who fought really bravely.
A few lines from the song
I remember your bare feet down the hallway 
I remember your little laugh 
Race cars on the kitchen floor, Plastic dinosaurs 
I love you to the moon and back 
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine 
Like we had our own secret club 
I remember you dancing before bedtime 
Then jumping on me , waking me up 

I can still feel you hold my hand , little man 
And even the moment I knew 
You fought it hard like an army guy 
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you 

Come on baby , with me we're gonna fly away from here 
You were my best four years.
