The Formula world championship was decided by a choice of race director Michael Masi who in the final GP of Abu Dhabi allowed only a few cars to split behind the Safety Car so that the last lap of the Abu Dhabi race could be played Dhabi Last lap which was viaticum for overtaking Verstappen with fresh tires on Hamilton This can no longer happen because the FIA has changed a word that made vague the rule that provided for the number of cars that should double before the return of the safety car by replacing any each but also some with all all With this rule, Hamilton would have won the world championship because he would not have had time to restart the race by splitting all the cars instead of only those between him and Verstappen at that moment
