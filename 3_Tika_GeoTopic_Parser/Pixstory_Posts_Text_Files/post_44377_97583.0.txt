Marcel Desailly

Desailly, one of the best defenders of his generation, played a key role for Chelsea as they
moved from enigmatic entertainers to Premier League powerhouses.

The former France international has worked as a commentator for both the BBC and ITV since
retiring in 2006. He is well-known for his charitable endeavours and serves as Ghana's UNICEF
Goodwill Ambassador. Overall, Desailly is a nice guy who is fondly regarded by Chelsea fans.

Graeme Le Saux

Although his stint at Chelsea is primarily remembered for Robbie Fowler's homophobic taunting
of him at Anfield, Le Saux was a valuable component of the team.

Le Saux, a well-known broadsheet newspaper reader, was a source of amusement among his
teammates. Regrettably, his second spell at Chelsea was plagued by injuries. In 2003, he
moved to Southampton before retiring two years later.

Le Saux began his post-retirement career as a BBC commentator, appearing on both radio and
television. He presently works for NBC's Premier League coverage as a match analyst and
commentator.

Bjarne Goldbaek

Goldbaek scored five goals in his first season at Chelsea, but he was released in 2000 after a
goalless second season. After three years with Fulham, he finished his career with Rot-Weiss
Essen of the Regionalliga.The former midfielder now works for Eurosport as a pundit.

Roberto Di Matteo

At Stamford Bridge, his replacement at Boundary Park made a much bigger impression. Di
Matteo made 175 appearances for Chelsea during his six years there, winning two FA Cups, a
League Cup, a Cup Winners' Cup, and a UEFA Super Cup.

Di Matteo was a key figure in Chelsea's legendary late-90s squad, and he notably won the
Champions League as interim manager in May 2012.
