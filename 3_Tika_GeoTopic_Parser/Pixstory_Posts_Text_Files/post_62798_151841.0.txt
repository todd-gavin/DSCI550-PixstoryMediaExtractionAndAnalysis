While she's at it, Taylor Swift may be getting ready to drop a secret diss track with Drake aimed at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.
According to The U.S. Sun, Taylor Swift and Drake allegedly recorded a scathing song together in 2017 that sees the unlikely duo taking disrespectful shots at both Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Now, Swift reportedly intends to let the track loose. With Taylor currently in the process of rerecording her multiplatinum, award-winning 2017 album, Reputation, The Sun reports that the new version of the LP will include the never-before-heard collab with Drake.
Apparently, an unnamed source close to Taylor Swift says that even though the pop music superstar omitted the "secret" diss track featuring Drizzy from the original version of Reputation, the time has come for the world to finally hear it.
“Taylor has pivoted her focus to re-recording Reputation and she has come across this song she made with Drake, which never saw the light of day," the source allegedly told The U.S. Sun. “She knows that everyone is going to think it is about Kimye because it was her row with them which inspired a lot of Reputation. But this one is far more direct than the other songs, which was why they didn’t decide to release it in the first place. It’s no secret that both Taylor and Drake have had tumultuous relationships with Kanye, so they didn’t hold back when it came to recording. Obviously, she is totally over the whole thing now but this is one which fans will want to hear.”
