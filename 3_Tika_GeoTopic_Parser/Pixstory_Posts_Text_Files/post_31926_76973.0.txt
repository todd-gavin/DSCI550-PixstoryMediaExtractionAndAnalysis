David Ornstein has revealed that Tottenham Hotspur's hopes of signing Adama Traore are "all-but-over".

The Athletic journalist revealed on his personal Twitter account on the 27th of January that Barcelona are now in discussions to sign the Spanish international.

Barca are progressing with talks to take Traore on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers until the end of the season.

There will be an option to buy included at 35million Euros, which works out as roughly Â£29.18million.

This means that Wolves are set to make a tidy profit, but it is awful news for Antonio Conte and Spurs as it looks like they will miss out on their top target.

It appears as if Traore was told that he was going to be playing as a right-wing-back, and he wasn't keen on that.

This is rather embarrassing for me as I produced a piece on here last week about Traore becoming a fantastic RWB under Conte.

At least the Italian shared my vision! It is just a shame for Spurs that the 26-year-old winger didn't.

Tottenham don't have long left in this transfer window to strengthen but after appearing to miss out on their top target, who do they now turn to?

Conte is already frustrated at Spurs, according to Jamie Redknapp (Sky Sports 23rd January 2022).

So, if Tottenham end the transfer window without improving their squad or shipping out any of the deadwood, it is hard to see the Italian sticking around for too long.

Therefore, it is vital that Spurs are active in the last four days of the window, and they end January with an improved squad.

They look to have missed out on Traore, and now they must move on.
