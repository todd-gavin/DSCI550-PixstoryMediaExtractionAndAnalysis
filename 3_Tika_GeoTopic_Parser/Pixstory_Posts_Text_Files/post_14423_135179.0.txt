The Common Cold
Adults on average get two to five colds per year, but children can get them seven to 10 times per year. Teenagers fall into the adult range on this one.
Strep Throat
It is most common in school-aged children between the ages of 5 and 15.
Symptoms of strep throat include a sore throat, fever, headache, swollen glands in the neck, and sometimes white patches in the throat. 
Influenza (the Flu)
Instead of a gradual worsening of symptoms over several days (which is how cold symptoms progress), flu symptoms hit you suddenly and all at once. 
Gastroenteritis (Stomach Flu)
It is highly contagious, especially when someone who is infected doesn't wash their hands well. The virus can be spread to surfaces and then picked up by another person who unknowingly infects themselves when they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Diarrhea
When you have diarrhea, your bowel movements (or stools) are loose and watery. Itâ€™s common and usually not serio.
Signs of dehydration include dark urine, rapid heart rate, crankiness and headaches
