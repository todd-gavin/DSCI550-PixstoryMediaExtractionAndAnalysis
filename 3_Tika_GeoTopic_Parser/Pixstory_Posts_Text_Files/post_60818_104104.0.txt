I feel that the biggest obstacle for people pursuing their dreams is the belief that things won't work out. Before we even try, most of us somewhere make up our mind that the odds are against us and that fear sits in.
What we need to understand is that dreams remain dreams until we decide they are something more. We've to patient and motivated even when we feel nothing is working out. Don't ever leave things wondering what might have been. What matters the most is our willingness to try and never give up on our dreams. 
It's going to be a long ride, just believe in yourself.
