As seen by the "Wordle 270 X" trend, today's Wordle is another hard one. The New York Times' popular word puzzle offered enthusiasts with another head scratcher of a conundrum just days after a difficult Wordle puzzle ended a number of streaks. Today's Wordle puzzle, like the previous difficult puzzle, has a term that ends with a reasonably common series of letters, giving players only a few chances to figure out the proper solution. Even if players successfully predict the puzzle's final four letters, there are a total of 12 English language terms that fit the clues in Wordle 270, with seven "frequently" used words that should exist in most people's vernaculars.

If you're a regular Twitter user, you've probably already noticed Wordle 270 trending today. While Wordle is still a popular pastime, it seems to gain traction these days only when a problem proves to be more difficult than imagined.

That's exactly what happened today, with many participants becoming stressed after failing or almost failing to predict the correct answer. Many people have lost their winning streaks as a result of it, and they are understandably disappointed.

Many users were able to discern all but the initial letter of the word from a fast scout through shared results, leaving them fumbling at what it might possibly be. Wordle had over 2 million active players at its peak. Since the New York Times bought it, that figure is expected to change, especially since the game prompts players to develop a string of successful solutions. When a player's streak is broken, they may forfeit the game or at the very least cease playing it on a daily basis, which implies that streak-breakers like today's puzzle could be harmful in the long run, say players.
