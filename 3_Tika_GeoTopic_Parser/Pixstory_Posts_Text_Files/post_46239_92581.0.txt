So here I'm , 20 and I'm single ! Yes I'm single and i feel very Normal and happy about it . Well its wasn't that i was forever single but yeah im single from last 2-3 years . For Someone like me who believed in the magic of love since i was a kid , Growing up and coming to peace with the fact that love can also happen to oneself was pretty complex and difficult to process .

Lemme share my own thing ! I was in a relationship but it was a bit different because it was toxic . It was so hard for me to accept the fact that the Person i love is completely toxic ! That Relationship exhausted me ! Drained me Mentally and Emotionally . And then i said to myself " Stop ! And i stepped out of that relationship . 
After being in a toxic relationship , i realised is it way better to be single and happy ! Being Single is the most beautiful time to explore your own self , to love yourself ! I fall in love with my own self after thatü§ç

To all the girls Single out there , let's work on our body we want to have , let's Get that dress we have been pinteresting since years to get into . Let's Make new friends , Go to parties , Explore different places , in short let's Love our own company , Let's love yourself , let's be kind to ourselves ! All this will never cost you your happiness and Peace !It's okay if we couldn‚Äôt live upto the expectations of people around us , Calm down ladies ! It‚Äôs okay. Let's Accept our own self ! 

I may sounds like Self happiness and mental peace is everything , more than any relationship ! But yes , It is really Important . Be with someone when you are ready and when you want to. Trust me , nothing is more important than Self- Happiness !

So everyone , Lets Normalise being single and happy !
