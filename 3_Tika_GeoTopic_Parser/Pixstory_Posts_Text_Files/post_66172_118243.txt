Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has described his predecessor Scott Morrison s instruction to a Perth church not to trust government as astonishing Morrison was speaking to the Victory Life Centre when he urged congregants to put their faith in God rather than government We trust in Him Morrison told the church We don t trust in governments We don t trust in the United Nations thank goodness He added there was value in the role of government We don t trust in all these things fine as they may be and as important as the role that they play Morrison said Believe me I ve worked in it and they are important Albanese expressed his astonishment at the address in an interview this morning I just thought wow this guy was the prime minister he told the ABC It provides some explanation perhaps as to why clearly he didn t lead a government that was worthy of the Australian people Albanese was especially irritated at his predecessor taking a jab at the United Nations I ve spent two months trying to repair our international relations Albanese said And that sort of nonsense throwaway conspiracy line about the United Nations isn t worthy of someone who led Australia Morrison remains the member for Cook in Parliament but has not sought a frontbench position in the opposition
