Only 1% of household consumers intend to purchase an e-scooter in the next six months due to safety and performance concerns, a new report showed on Monday. This is despite the government investigating numerous fires in electric two-wheelers.
According to data given by local social media platform LocalCircles, approximately 32% of respondents in August and 17% in March of this year were not satisfied about the performance and safety of electric scooters, since more than two dozen electric two-wheelers caught fire in March and April.
Electric scooter manufacturers like Ola, Pure EV, and Okinawa "voluntarily" recalled almost 7,000 units after over two dozen electric two-wheelers caught fire in March and April.
The government formed a committee of experts from the Indian Institute of Science and the Centre for Fire, Explosive and Environmental Safety (CFEES) to conduct a thorough investigation and create "quality-centric" guidelines for EV manufacturers. These guidelines are anticipated to be made public soon.
Due of EV fires, only 1% of more than 11,000 respondents said they intended to purchase an e-scooter in the upcoming six months.
Nearly 5% said they were interested in purchasing but "weren't sure about the infrastructure available for e-scooters where I live/work," while 7% stated they lacked the money to do so.
The poll also showed that there is not much demand for e-scooters, since only 31% of households own one, while an additional 9% said they already had enough cars at home and had no ambitions to get a two-wheeler.
According to the survey, "the fire occurrences, which led to some people being hurt as well as the loss of a vehicle, significantly influenced customer attitudes, resulting to a fall in electric vehicle two-wheeler sales for two months."
