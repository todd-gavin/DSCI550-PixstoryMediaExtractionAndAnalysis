The Johnny Depp Amber Heard verdict is out and Johnny won the defamation case against Amber It has gotten mixed reactions but the only reaction it did not get was anything that is validating for an abuse victim People have used this case especially Amber Heard as a poster child for all women who ve accused any man of domestic abuse which is not surprising but disappointing nevertheless I m not going to lie everything I ve gotten to know about this case has been against my will Through Memes and funny tiktoks Which is absurd Regardless of who the victim is treating a domestic violence situation as some kind of sports event is crazy People s pain is just not something you trivialize and meme about A number of domestic violence victims that are women have come out to have been compared to Amber Heard And this is what it has come to From demanding justice for a man to invalidating victims for being women No matter how many men are perpetrators of violence they re still seen through the lens of innocent until proven guilty and one woman apparently abusing a man where he has admitted to be abusive too is being used to trivialized the experiences of all women who are speaking about their experience successfully silencing Lord knows how many victims Not to mention the absolute dehumanization of so many victims because Amber Heard was posing as one How absolute nobodies on the internet have become trauma experts is fascinating This is not how a victim acts um actually every victim copes differently there s not a blueprint for them all And in the end some questions are still hanging Has a trial won by any female victim ever had such celebration Has any case where women were victims of men ever gotten this amount of attention Has a male abuser ever been ridiculed to this extent the idolizing of Ronaldo is SICKENING Honestly a domestic abuse case is NOT for fun and laughs Let s read the room instead of making a joke out of it
