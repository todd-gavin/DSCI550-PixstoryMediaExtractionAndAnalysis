There is so much work in finding the source of disconnections within oneself formed by severed ties. Unraveling the costumes of straightjackets masquerading as normalcy means unraveling each thread that wants to stitch you back into someone you never were.Iâ€™ve always brushed over the aftertaste of intense self-consciousness I felt after the thrill from my gender affirming buzzcut. While the buzzcut was lifesaving, it came from a life-ending thought spiral that remains exhausting to confront. Becoming visible to yourself sometimes means bracing for the knee-jerk invisibilization that wants to suffocate any trace of self-determination.Visibility is violence till its meaning loses form.
