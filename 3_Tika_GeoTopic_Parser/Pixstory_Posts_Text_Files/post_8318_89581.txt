New York based performers and athletes who play for New York s home teams will be exempt from the city s vaccination mandate for private businesses New York City mayor Eric Adams announced in a press conference at Citi Field on Thursday This means that unvaccinated Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving will be eligible to play in home games starting with Sunday s game against the Charlotte Hornets at Barclays Center Adams who had previously stated that it would send the wrong message to give Irving an exemption when virtually everyone who works in the city is subject to the same mandate and unvaccinated city workers had lost their jobs framed the issue as an expansion of a previous exemption This decision will also affect unvaccinated members of the New York Yankees and New York Mets who are two weeks away from Major League Baseball s Opening Day This is about putting New York city based performers on a level playing field Adams said Day when I was mayor I looked at the rule that stated hometown players had an unfair disadvantage for those who were coming to visit And immediately I felt we needed to look at that but my medical professionals said Eric we re at a different place We have to wait until we re at a place where we re at a low area and we can reexamine some of the mandates We re here today Leading up to this Adams had called it unfair and ridiculous that there were different standards for players on home and visiting teams On Thursday he called it unimaginable We were treating our performers differently because they lived and played for home teams Adams said It s not acceptable This exemption has been putting our sports teams at a self imposed competitive disadvantage But this new order will help boost our economy The NBA and NBA Players Association released a joint statement shortly after Adams announcement Credit CBS
