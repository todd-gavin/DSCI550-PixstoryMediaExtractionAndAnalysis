Napoli falls at home against Fiorentina A misstep that can cost the Neapolitans a lot especially in terms of the Scudetto Luciano Spalletti says so himself This defeat is a bit like a sentence it becomes difficult to recover points in a few games We have no other choice but to continue to train correctly and try to score as many points as possible We had tried to take advantage of Osimhen&#39;s one-on-one but we weren&#39;t precise and we stretched out a bit In the second half we came back well we were managing the match after the draw then on a ball that we played many times in the first half they built the goal Then everything was more difficult we had rough management on their third goal On we had the game in hand We weren&#39;t able to clean up some situations but we were at the edge of the box in the final match We had so many offensive men and it is normal that you struggle when you lose the ball There have been matches that we attacked for and then we conceded goals Even today we lost when we tried to overturn the match and it was this action in which Mario Rui was unbalanced Ikon&#39;s ball passed between Zanoli&#39;s legs and went into the corner so I don&#39;t think we can say that the team conceded because they didn&#39;t have balance The situations that led us to these defeats are of various origins
