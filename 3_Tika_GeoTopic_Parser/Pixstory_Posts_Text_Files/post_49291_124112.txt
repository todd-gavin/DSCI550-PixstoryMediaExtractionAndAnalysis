 I can swear I can joke I say what s on my mind If I drink if I smoke I keep up with the guys And you see me holding up my middle finger to the world F ck your ribbons and your pearls Cause I m not just a pretty girl I m more than just a picture I m a daughter and a sister Sometimes it s hard for me to show That I m more than just a rumor Or a song on your computer There s more to me than people know Some days I m broke some days I m rich Some days I m nice some days I can be a bitch Some days I m strong some days I quit I don t let it show but I ve been through some shit I can swear I can joke I say what s on my mind If I drink if I smoke I keep up with the guys And you see me holding up my middlefinger to the world F ck your ribbons and your pearls Cause I m not just a pretty girl I remember listening to this song years ago and loving it It was my anthem in high school I just think this song s lyrics are so powerful and its visuals too It s just a very empowering piece I like to listen to when I m having a feminist rage The way it celebrates different kinds of women women facing sexism women struggling mentally the different women queer women women of color Just a celebration of all kinds of women I love almost every word and every song that comes from Maggie Lindemann She s so apologetic about herself and her art it s amazing
