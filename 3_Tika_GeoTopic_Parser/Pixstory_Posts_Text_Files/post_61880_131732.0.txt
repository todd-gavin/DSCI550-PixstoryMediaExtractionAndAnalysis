Louis Tomlinson recently became an uncle for the first time and now he’s finally been able to meet his newly born nephew, Lucky.  The former One Direction singer, 30, who also embarked on a solo career of his own after the group’s split in 2016, became an uncle two weeks ago.  Louis’ sister, Lottie Tomlinson, 24, announced the news on Instagram earlier this month and called it ‘dream come true’.  And now Louis has been able to make a visit to the new mum and dad to spend some quality time with his favourite nephew..
Pictures posted on social media show Louis cradling Lucky in his arms while wearing a soft grey hoodie – perfect clothes for visiting your nephew.
Louis’ face is out of shot in the photo because he’s looking down at his new best mate, but fans were quick to spot him and share the photo around.
‘Imagine having Louis Tomlinson as an uncle,’ one fan said on Twitter. Another said: ‘Louis Tomlinson is all the uncle we need.’
Some fans took the celebrations one stop further, declaring the Just Hold On singer to be the best uncle in the world.
