Australia is a hugely diversified country with a wide range of fascinating cultures and communities. But there is something truly special that binds everyone here â€” the Australian way of life, with its one-of-a-kind shared spirit and attitude. 

As official archives tells us, one thing that Aussies are recognised for around the world is their laid-back, easygoing demeanour. Of course, food, events, art, and history are all important aspects of Australian culture, but an Aussie's laid-back attitude is what truly differentiates him or her. It's when buddies show up unexpectedly for a catch-up (but always with a six-pack of beer in hand). It's why you'll hear strangers on the street saying "no worries, mate."

Moreover, for Australians, a stranger is simply a friend they haven't met yet. Mateship is the lifeblood of the Australian spirit; it's practically a national characteristic. Not only do Australians take pride in being good friends and neighbours to those they know, but they also take pride in being good neighbours to those they don't know. They usually say "g'day" or "how ya doing?" to everyone from the mail carrier to the cab driver. This emphasis on mateship instils in Australians a positive, welcoming mindset that says everyone may be a mate. 

What's more, who says friends have to be human? Animals make terrific friends, especially with neighbours like fairy penguins, koalas, and wallabies, and our distinctive fauna is part of what motivates Australians to care about the environment and sustainability.
