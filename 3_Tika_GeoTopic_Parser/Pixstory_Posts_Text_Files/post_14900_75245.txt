The weight of suspended time Stefano Bombardieri&#39;s installation inaugurated in December in the heart of Brescia in the Quadriportico of Piazza Vittoria in the very center close to Piaggia della Loggia I have seen it dozens of times but only now have I felt the need to photograph it Because perhaps only now I feel exactly in line with what the work expresses The sculpture a large fiberglass rhinoceros four meters long suspended in the air speaks of a human condition the author said during the inauguration life on earth Here&#39;s me, since the pandemic started, I have felt so suspended There is waiting, there is hope, but there is also the weight of not knowing what tomorrow will bring us and the awareness that everything can change in an instant and that our certainties can crumble like the world we have known up to the moment before The rhinoceros is a metaphor for the concept of weight and suspended, as our lives often are, in particular moments of extreme joy or great pain, explained Bombardieri and I believe that this concept is still very current
