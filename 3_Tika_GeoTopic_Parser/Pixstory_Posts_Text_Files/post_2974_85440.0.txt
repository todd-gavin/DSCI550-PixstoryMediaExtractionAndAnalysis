With several world economies plumbing the depths due to the pandemic and extended lockdowns across the world, many had thought that the luxury industry, including premium personal care products, would take years to recover. That was not the case.

Despite soaring prices, the pandemic hardly affected premium perfume brands. In fact, luxury products by brands like Cartier, Gucci and Louis Vuitton and others are doing roaring business. One great advantage for the luxury brands is that with the rise in demand, they can afford to pass on the burden of rising prices. In fact, according to UBS analysts, the LVMH, which owns several luxury brands, has raised the prices two-and-a-half times higher than the inflation rate over the past 20 years.

Take the case of fragrance in particular. CNN, quoting a research firm, says that the average retail price for fragrances rose by 15% in 2021 compared to 2020, triple the average 5% increase during the prior two-year period. What is also helping the luxury perfume makers is the industry is finding more and more people willing to pay for perfumes that interest them.

According to experts, as the pandemic started easing, people were willing to indulge in some top-of-the-line luxury. The boom has been in the higher-priced eau de parfums, which have greater use of fragrance oils and more refined notes as compared to others.

Russia has been one of the hottest markets for luxury products. But with the sanctions coming into effect and many companies including the luxury brands withdrawing from the country, demand could likely see a slump and the boom in prices may also see some cooling down.
