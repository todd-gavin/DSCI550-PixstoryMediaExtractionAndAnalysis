It doesn't matter what kind of 'joke' was made. Yes, that was deplorable. Silly Will, on the other hand, had the global microphone and could have taken a statement without resorting to violence, becoming a terrific role model for guys everywhere. Instead, he acts in this manner. Violence should never be used to solve a problem. 

During Chris Rock's award presentation at the Oscars, Will Smith rushed up on stage and slapped Rock in the face.

Rock was noticeably taken aback and responded by revealing the veracity of what many had assumed was a stunt: "Wow." Rock added, "Will Smith just knocked the sâ€” out of me." 

"Don't say anything about my wife!" Smith responded with two shouts.

When Rock saw Jada Pinkett Smith in the audience, he joked that he hoped she would star in a sequel to "G. I. Jane," a 1997 film in which Demi Moore's character enters the military and has to shave her head. 

Pinkett Smith suffers from alopecia, and her bald head and green gown were regularly visible on camera during the ceremony. (Source- KTLA)
