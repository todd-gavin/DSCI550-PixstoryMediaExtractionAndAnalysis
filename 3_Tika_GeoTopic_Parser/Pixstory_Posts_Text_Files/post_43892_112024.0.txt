Every football fan is waiting on their toes for the upcoming quadrennial event. The FIFA World
Cup 2022 will be held in Qatar in the winter and the preparations are in full swing after the
finalization of the teams participating in the tournament. All 32 teams are set for the FIFA World
Cup and are figuring out the final team for the campaign by removing the chinks in the armory.

On the other hand, FIFA has released a technology that has taken the football world in awe.

Ahead of the tournament, the footballing body has released a Semi-Automated Offside Technology. In this article, we shall look at how the technology will work and what are its
nuances?

In the assumed extraordinary technology, there are 12 dedicated cameras mounted under the
stadium roof to track the ball. These cameras will collect the 29 data points (read as coordinates) of an individual player at a rate of 50 Hz. The data points collected will help the
referees to take the relevant calls on offside. This technology was previously used in Arab Cup
2021 and FIFA Club World Cup 2021.

The FIFA World Cup ball, Al Rihla, will also play a huge role in helping the referees to call the
tight offsides. The centre of the ball will have a inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor that
would send the ball data to the operation room at the rate of 500 Hz. This helps to know the
precise kick point of the ball.

Combining the data of the player and the ball, the offside image will be formed using the
technology. Whenever, the player in offside position receives the ball, the operation room will be
notified on the same. This offside call will be verified manually and the decision will be shown on
the screen. These decisions will happen in a few seconds and provide the most accurate data.
