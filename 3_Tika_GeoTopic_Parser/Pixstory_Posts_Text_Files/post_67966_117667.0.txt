As the Exam season is finally here for the students of Pune University, here with some classic exam memes.

Also our first proper OFFLINE University Exams after 2 whole years,and even though Pune University has been kind enough to extend the exams timings for our convenience they've instead banned wrist watches in the exam hall.Hope all colleges arrange atleast one wallclock per classroom or else bless my anxiety with no track of time while writing the paper.

All the best to everyone with upcoming exams also to those in the midst of their exams!!
