Dal Makhani is one of the most popular lentil recipes from the North Indian Punjabi cuisine made with Whole Black Lentils (known as Urad dal or Kaali Dal in Hindi) and Kidney Beans (known as Rajma in Hindi).
The richness in the dish comes from the fats in the butter and cream. The amount of butter and cream added is not copious and just enough to lift the dish in its richness.
The more slow cooked dal makhani is the better it tastes.
The lentils are slow cooked in a tandoor. The tandoor is a cylindrical shaped oven made of clay. The fire in the tandoor comes from lit charcoal or wood.

Overnight simmering of the dal makhani gives some smokiness in the dish from the charcoal or wood.
The consistency of Punjabi dal makhani is neither too thick or too thin. It has a medium consistency with a viscosity coming from the thoroughly cooked lentils.
