While your tongue posture might not seem incredibly relevant to your overall health and well-being, there are a few benefits to learning the correct tongue resting position.
“The potential benefits of good tongue posture include a likelihood to have better aligned teeth as poor tongue posture can put your tongue in the way of growing teeth. This can negatively affect the way they grow by blocking the space that they grow into.”
Plus, improper tongue posture can lead to a narrower palate over time. Studies suggest that simply widening the palate can have a positive effect on the upper airway, especially in children and young adults, improved tongue posture, and even reduced nasal obstruction in children with sleep apnea.
