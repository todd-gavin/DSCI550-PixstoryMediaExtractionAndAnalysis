Dried quince apples, also known as Bamchoont Hache in the region, are among the most valued and adored of the Kashmiri Hokh Syun. The highest quality quince apples are carefully chosen before being meticulously sun dried in hygienic circumstances. The texture and flavour are more intense when the water content is dried out. You won't want to miss out on this mouthwatering Kashmiri dish made by pouring some yoghurt over fried dried quince.
