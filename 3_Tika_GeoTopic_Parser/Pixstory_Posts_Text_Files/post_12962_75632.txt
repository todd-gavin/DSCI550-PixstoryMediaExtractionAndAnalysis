Expressing his feeling as a father Aparshakti Khurana wrote a heart melting letter to his daughter Arzoie He wrote Dear Arzoie Life feels like a feel good Bollywood movie since the day you were born Because of you I know what it feels like to have your dream come true Because of you I understand the word Family a little better Arzoie you are too little to understand this right now but Paapoo promises to be with you through thick and thin Through successes and failures Through I should get a haircut and Oh no Why did I get a haircut Zuzu no matter how much you grow and who you grow up to be you will always be my little one You see it s only now that I understand what your grandparents mean when they say maa baap ke liye bacche humesha bacche hi rehte hain P S It feels amazing to see you sleep in my arms when I sing Arziyan Saari Mai Chehre Pe Likh Ke Laya Hoon Is it the power of music Or is it my voice that makes you go lid rather be asleep than listen to this So you legit go Z With love and only love Your Paapoo
