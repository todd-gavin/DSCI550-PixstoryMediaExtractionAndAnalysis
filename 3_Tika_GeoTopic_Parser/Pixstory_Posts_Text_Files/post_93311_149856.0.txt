Wealth. Wealthy. And Humble. 
I have viewed wealth in monetary terms. And I will be using the word in the same meaning as stated. I always have a quiet and sad giggle whenever there are headlines which read that a particular person has donated 50 crores in the relief fund for natural disaster in an underdeveloped country. And the anchor reads from the teleprompter that this person has the net worth of millions and billions. Everybody is speaking highly of him (writing"him" with a heavy heart because the world at large in not that progressive, egalitarian or conducive yet to feel as "her" should be used when talking of a billionaire as there exist few). Nonetheless, he becomes a benevolent, charitable and kind person. 
In incidents like these, I am taken back toÂ  an amazing story which I heard when I was very young. It goes, a person is kind when the person gives you 2 rupees when they had 10 with them. But a person who is most likely doing it from an altruistic place of heart and mind will give 2 rupees when they had 3 with them. 
I completely agree that altruism as a virtue is practically not possible and is a utopian concept to achieve but I am pointing out to the message it conveys, that a person's purity of their intent and heart should not be judged through how much they give out but with an emphasis on despite their own possession, how much they are willing to share.
