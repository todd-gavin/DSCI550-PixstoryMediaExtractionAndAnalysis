A season which promised so much ended in nothing but despair for Manchester United Buoyed by the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane the Red Devils could finish just sixth in the Premier League Their search for silverware continues as they ended the season without any success Cristiano Ronaldo was one of the best if not the best player for Manchester United in the last campaign The Portuguese striker scored goals in all competitions last season comfortably finishing as the top scorer for the Red Devils There have been contrasting opinions in regards to his contribution to the side A few are critical of Ronaldo s limited involvement in the game whereas a few acknowledge the Portuguese star for being a proven goalscorer Boxing legend Tyson Fury certainly recognizes Cristiano Ronaldo as not a bad asset to have However the Manchester United fan believes that the year old striker overshadows the younger players given the aura he carries with him When you have a superstar like Ronaldo everybody relies on him to score goals and if he wasn t there they d be scoring the goals themselves like they did the season before last I m not saying he s a bad asset he s a great asset but sometimes with a star player he carries the team and the young people are overshadowed by it all they don t get their chance to shine because the great Ronaldo is on the pitch Fury said Tyson Fury also commented as to how Manchester United finished higher on the Premier League table in the season when Ronaldo was not even a part of the set up The Red Devils finished second on the points table finishing below cross town rivals Manchester City
