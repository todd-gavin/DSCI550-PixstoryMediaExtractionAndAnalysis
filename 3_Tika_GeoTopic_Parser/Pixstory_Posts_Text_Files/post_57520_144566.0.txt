People wonder as to what can be the reason for such occurrences. They can cause phobia, but there's no clear clue to justify that.
The exact cause of agoraphobia isn't known. However, several factors are known to increase your risk of developing agoraphobia. These include depression, and other phobias, such as claustrophobia and social phobia.
Another type of anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, can cause agoraphobia.
Since the thought of panic is evoked by thinking of an uncertain situation or something that has already happened, it could be possible that the person experiencing agoraphobia has a history of physical or sexual abuse.
The harsh indelible memories can result in panic attacks.
Other reasons could be substance abuse or a family history of agoraphobia.
It is also more common in women than in men. It usually begins in young adulthood, with 20 years being the average age of onset. However, symptoms of the condition can emerge at any age.
