Nothing will be accomplished by gathering in a circle and singing songs It s not the same as having a meeting about Jesus as it is to have an actual meeting with Jesus Because they are gathered in the safety of a home some people turn inward believing that they are essentially different or better than the rest of us They ve lost sight of the need of being connected and functioning locally in the city and have morphed into a social club for those who are tired of traditional church whether intentionally or unintentionally If you re not bringing in new blood you re not going to make any new disciples Then you just have got a group of people that s dressed up as a home church but is really just a collection of folks who ve abandoned the institutional church and are doing things their own way Traditional Church is the way All of this new dogma is not going to take Christians anywhere other than away from God Let s stop changing established systems
