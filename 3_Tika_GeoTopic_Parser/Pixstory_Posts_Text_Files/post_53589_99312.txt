Urbanisation and the destruction of habitat it entails is a major threat to native bird populations But as our new research shows restored urban forests can return native birds to our cities and improve species richness A path through a forested urban park The older the restored forest the more native bird species it can support Shutterstock Dmitry Naumov We define restored urban forests as green areas within a city dominated by native vegetation that has been planted intentionally To evaluate restoration success we tracked changes in native bird communities in restored forests in two of New Zealand s cities Hamilton and New Plymouth The forests we used in our study ranged widely in their ages including one where initial restoration efforts began years ago We also compared these restored forests to remnant patches of native mature forest both within and beyond the city that had never been clear felled Our findings show older restored forests support more species of native birds and some are close to the species richness of untouched remnants of native forest The abundance of birds increased as the forest canopy became denser Older restorations are better We found the younger forests supported small bodied insect eating and omnivorous birds such as fantails silvereyes and grey warblers Older plantings were also home to nectar and fruit feeding species such as t This increase in native species richness suggests older sites provide a greater variety of food and other resources meeting the needs of more species over time We also found greater overall numbers of fantails and t in older restored forests To monitor these native bird communities we counted all terrestrial birds seen and heard along m transects It appears native bird diversity in restored forests is becoming increasingly similar to what we find in urban forest remnants but there is still a noticeable gap between the oldest restored areas and both urban and rural remnants Read more
