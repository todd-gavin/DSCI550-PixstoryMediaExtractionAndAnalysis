As she promoted their forthcoming single, "Hold Me Closer," Britney Spears posted an eye-catching new photo of herself wearing Elton John's renowned glittery Los Angeles Dodgers baseball outfit.

On August 12, Britney Spears, 40, gave her fans a reason to cheer when she formally teased her upcoming song. The singer shared a black-and-white and colour photo of what appears to be fan art for the next single on Instagram. The singer is working with legendary musician Elton John, 75, on a new song that she said is called "Hold Me Closer." In addition, she added a caption that not only confirmed the song's title—a cover of Elton John's hit "Tiny Dancer"—but also appeared to defend the naked selfies she had previously shared on social media after her ex had stated in public that the images were "tough" for her teenage sons, Sean, 16, and Jayden, 15, who are in the photos.

In it, Elton is wearing his LA Dodgers uniform and holding a bat. Britney is cropped in to be standing beside him as she wears a sparkly bodysuit made to look like the Dodgers uniform.
