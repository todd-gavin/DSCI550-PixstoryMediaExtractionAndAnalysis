In the light of the recent Depp vs Heard case, let’s talk about domestic violence against men. 

Domestic violence against women is a long debated topic but the same against men is not discussed as often as it should be. I have rarely seen any social campaigns or movements for this cause. 

It is not because men don’t face domestic violence, it is because they are not given a proper platform to talk about it. 

Domestic violence against men is more common than you may think and can pose a serious threat to its victims. This is because generally, these cases go unreported. The idea of toxic masculinity makes it hard for the society to believe that a man can be a victim too. Even when the victim comes forward, they are dismissed with statements like “You’re a man, how can a woman overpower you?” Or “You’re not man enough if you get beaten in a relationship.” Reports also tell us that part of the reason for the disparity in reported victims might also be because men who call police to report domestic violence against them fear that they will end up being the ones getting arrested. 

These statements cause the victims to stay in the abusive environment and results in long term mental health issues too. 

I am glad that Johnny Depp case is in the limelight and I sincerely hope that it will give the courage to more victims of domestic violence to come forward and get the justice they deserve.
