Okay here s something to avoid if you want to be in a happy relationship And believe me this does happen especially to people who are truly in love That s what makes it so painful It is the Achilles heel of a good relationship and it begins with doubt It s a question of whether you re still worthy of their love because it s easy to show your best side when you re first in love But being in love also means being able to show your worst side and you begin to wonder if the other person is just putting up with you or if they truly love you the way they used to This is absurd because love is not a sport Love is a cycle Love is finding new and diverse ways to demonstrate how much you care every day rather than having to prove how much you love As a result you begin to lay traps You begin by posing challenges small tests in which they are supposed to demonstrate their love for you You claim that if they don t do this they don t love me And because you ve decided you re unworthy of their love you begin looking for ways to prove to yourself that you are indeed unlovable Even if they pass your tests you simply conclude that they are insane Why would they care about someone like me And you ve taken something perfectly good genuine authentic love and turned it into something Add a loyalty test rather than a daily practise of fidelity
