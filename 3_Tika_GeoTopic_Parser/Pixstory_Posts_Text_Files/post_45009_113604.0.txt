On Monday morning, Tyrell Malacia arrived at Carrington for the second phase of his 
Manchester United physical. Early this week, a deal for the 22-year-old player with Feyenoord 
was reached that was estimated to be worth an initial £13 million, with an additional £1.7 million in add-ons and a possible sell-on clause.

In an effort to outbid Lyon for the services of left-back Malacia, United intensified their pursuit of the player, and the Dutch club recently announced that a fee had been settled.

Malacia shares an agency with Frenkie de Jong, the club's top target this summer, and matches the mould of the player Erik ten Hag wants at Old Trafford.

Malacia's transfer is almost finished, thus United may now look at offers for left-back Alex Telles.

United has the option to extend Telles' contract for an additional year, and he has two years left 
on it and United will also talk about Brandon Williams' near-term plans. All parties will discuss whether staying at the club or moving out on loan to get regular play is ideal for his 
development. Williams spent last season on loan with Norwich City, where he made 26 Premier League appearances.

Meanwhile, Manchester United and Ajax are having constructive discussions over the defender Lisandro Martinez's transfer. United is optimistic that they can agree on a price.

Martinez is rumoured to be interested in moving to Old Trafford to reteam with Erik ten Hag.

Martinez is also a target for Arsenal, who were anticipated to make an offer for him.

On the first Super Sunday of the 2022–23 season, Erik ten Hag will coach Manchester United versus Brighton at Old Trafford and on October 1, United will travel to the Etihad Stadium for the first Manchester derby of the season, starting a challenging month that also includes away games against Everton and Chelsea as well as home games against Tottenham, Newcastle, and West Ham.
