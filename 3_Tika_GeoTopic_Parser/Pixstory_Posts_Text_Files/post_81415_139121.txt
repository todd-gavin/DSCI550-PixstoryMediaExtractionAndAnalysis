What would you say is better having sex or watching football Nick Hornby in his book Fever Pitch has some interesting thoughts on this dispute when describing Michael Thomas nd minute league deciding goal for Arsenal vs Liverpool Even though there is no question that sex is a nicer activity than watching football no nil nils no offside no cup upsets and you re warm in the normal run of things the feelings it engenders are simply not as intense as those brought about by a once in a lifetime last minute Championship winner It is one of several witty quips in this autobiographical piece of art written by a lifelong Arsenal fan Hornby charts the events of his life that are somehow at every turn interwoven with the fortunes of the football club he supports His teenage years of being asocial and repressed coincide with the uninspiring Arsenal team of the late s and early s Hornby is convinced that if Arsenal do well he does well and the arrival of George Graham comes with an uptick in his personal life He paints pictures of hope and despair that every football fan has seen Indeed if one word was to be used to describe the book it would be relatable There have been other attempts at documenting the life of a fan Kevin Sampson s Away Days is a good attempt catering to the subsection of fans who were engaged in hooliganism in the s and s But none of these attempts manage to put into words what we have all felt as well as Hornby does There is an underlying criticism of the maturing process of the male gender as well especially those who tend to follow football Hornby is reflective and self critical with a sense of humour about it He understands the emotions of a fan unsurprisingly since he has been one all his life The greatest praise for the book was perhaps given by Pete Davies in his review for The Independent It explains one of the great mysteries of life in our time namely why does anyone become an Arsenal fan
