Adapted from a 2013 film of the same name, Mystery Road is, aside from being a taut longform mystery anchored by a handful of truly exceptional performances, one of the most visually striking television series to be made anywhere in the last few years. 

As per vulture, starring Aaron Pedersen as Indigenous Australian Detective Jay Swan, the series uses desolate rural crimes — at a cattle station on disputed land in the outback in the first season, in the mangroves and on a coastal archaeological dig site in the second — to investigate the tensions, both generational and interpersonal, between white beneficiaries of settler colonialism and the descendants of the Aboriginal communities that same settler colonialism exploited and dispossessed. 

As per critics, it is heavy stuff, but writers Michaeley O’Brien, Steven McGregor, Kodie Bedford and Tim Lee and Indigenous Australian directors Rachel Perkins (series one) and Warwick Thornton and Wayne Blair (series two) handle each story with expert precision, while Pedersen ties it all together onscreen. News of a third season hasn’t yet come down either way, but with the first two seasons working as well as they do as stand-alones, there’s no reason that should stop anyone who’s interested from giving this utterly arresting series a shot.
