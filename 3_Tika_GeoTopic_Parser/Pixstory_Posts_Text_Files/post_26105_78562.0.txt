We all make friends when we are kids. Some are with us and some are don't . Friendship is a beautiful thing that many people don't want because they can't handle it . Maybe something that happened in the past.But some people are meant to leave so don't stop giving other people chances.Friends are people who laugh at your fails. Irritate you till your so frustated. Makes fun of you every minute. And give you the love you deserve.Lets see the friendship of one direction the biggest boyband on the planet . Niall , Louis , Zayn , Liam and Harry. 5 boys who didn't know each other were put together on X- Factor. Soon they became best mates and brothers for each other. Always there to help. Teaching how important it is to live your life and stay happy to the fullest. Had each other's back no matter what. Whatever they did they did together. They're going to be ups and downs but it's going to fine. Give your friends love that they deserve feel free to give love. Be the most excited monkey on their success.
