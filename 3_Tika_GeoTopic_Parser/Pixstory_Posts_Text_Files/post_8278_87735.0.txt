Irving's first-ever 60-point game, breaking his previous career-high of 57 against San Antonio in 2015, featured 20 made field goals on 31 attempts. He also went 8-for-12 from beyond the arc and 12-for-13 at the foul line en route to his sixth career performance with 50-plus points.

Kevin Durant, coming off a 53-point performance against the New York Knicks on Sunday, had 19 points and seven assists in the Nets' wire-to-wire victory. Irving's final three points came on a triple off the left wing with 8:32 left, sending him to the bench for the remainder of the game, while Brooklyn put seven total players in double figures.
