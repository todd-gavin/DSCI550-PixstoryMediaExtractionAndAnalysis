According to a report published by the Government Accountability Office, nearly 19 million students in the U.S., or more than a third, attended a public school in the 2020-21 school year where at least 75% of students were of the same race or ethnicity.

 Although the diversity of the total student population had surged in recent years, inequity persists, the report says
“Ensuring equal access to educational opportunity — a key component of the Department of Education’s mission — remains a persistent challenge,” Jackie Nowicki, lead author and the director of K-12 education at the GAO, said in the report. 

The new data also shows that 14% of students — about 7 million — attended schools where at least 90% of their peers were all of one race or ethnicity. 

Of the students attending schools where at least three-fourths of their peers were of their own racial or ethnic background, nearly half were white — related to 31% Hispanic, 23% Black, 19% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 4% Asian students.
