Its all about maps, politics and China.  

The Philippines has pulled the plug on all domestic screenings of a Hollywood film called "Uncharted," over a scene showing a disputed map of theÂ South China Sea, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday

The move comes shortly after Vietnam, another claimant in the South China Sea, also banned the Sony Pictures action movie, which stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. It was released in the Philippines on February 23.

A two-second frame in the movie contains an image of the so-called nine-dash line, which marks China's claims in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway. The scene "is contrary to national interest," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
