Sitting on the golden sand watching the beautiful red, orange sun set into the crystal clear blue sky. Just to the left of me I can see a few fluffy pink clouds that look just like freshly made fairy floss. As I lie back onto the sand a small mosquito lands on my nose, I quickly flick it off before it bites me. I can hear the sound of the birds tweeting and the water gently lapping against my feet. 

As I rise to my feet and slowly walk to the edge of the salty, foamy sea, it sends a shiver up my spine which makes me look straight into the sky then at the sun which meets the horizon it is slowly sinking further and further out of sight. I walk back to my spot and sit down again. The golden sand has stuck to my feet. I lay down and watch the moon arise and the stars pop out into the sky making it the most beautiful sight that I have ever seen. 

The sun has gone down from the sky and it is no longer in sight the moon is however and it is more beautiful than ever, itâ€™s fullness is amazing I have never seen it so beautiful the light gently massages my face and the craters make me wonder what it would be like to live on the moon. The stars surrounding the moon are more wonderful than I can remember and they sparkle so beautifully shining in the sky like a beautiful diamond necklace making the moon stand out more than ever, this is the most amazing sight that I have ever seen I has been set in my mind forever. This is why I love the sunset because it is an amazing sight and then what follows afterwards is another breathtaking sight. Everything is so peaceful at night everything is calm and still.
