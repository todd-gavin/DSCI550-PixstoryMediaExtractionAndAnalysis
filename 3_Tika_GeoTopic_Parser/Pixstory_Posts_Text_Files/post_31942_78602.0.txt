Manchester United 

Grade - E

Where to even start?

Manchester United failed to bring in a single player to reinforce Ralf Rangnick's side.

However, they also failed to show any loyalty to academy graduate Jesse Lingard who was desperate to leave and play first-team football.

Overall, the Red Devils were a total shambles.

I haven't handed out a lower grade because they managed to offload Anthony Martial and Donny van de Beek.

Van de Beek was finally allowed to leave Old Trafford to show everyone what he could do in the Premier League, and Martial now has the chance to resurrect his career in Spain with Sevilla.

In terms of incomings, it is pretty clear that the Red Devils need another central midfielder.

I wrote a piece in January about Amadou Haidara, but they didn't make a move.

Another player heavily linked was Denis Zakaria, but they again didn't make an offer, and he has joined Juventus (Christian Falk 12th January).

So, Rangnick will have to make do with what he has and try and seal a place in the top four.

Manchester United also deserve intense criticism for their treatment of Lingard.

The 29-year-old had been told he could leave by Rangnick only for the board to refuse to sanction his departure on deadline day with Newcastle United and West Ham United poised to take him on loan (David Ornstein 31st of January).

Lingard wanted to join Newcastle, but the Red Devils asked for a ridiculous survival bonus, and then on deadline day, they told the England man that he wasn't going anywhere.

Given Lingard's loyalty to the club, the way he has been treated is nothing short of a disgrace, and you just have to hope that they decide to use Lingard in the remaining games.

In my opinion, the Red Devils failed in this window on two fronts, and they will have to be better in the summer.
