Many breastfeeding mothers wonder if the foods they eat will affect their breast milk.

Perhaps youâ€™ve wondered if it is necessary to avoid certain foods to prevent digestive problems or allergies in your baby. Or maybe you wonder if you need to eat special foods to make the right amount of milk or the best quality milk for your baby.

The good news is that your milk will probably be just right for your baby regardless of what you eat. Your body knows exactly what nutrition your baby needs at every stage of development.

Use the following tips to help plan your diet

What to eat

1 Include protein foods 2-3 times per day such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, nuts and seeds.

2 Eat three servings of vegetables, including dark green and yellow vegetables per day.

3 Eat two servings of fruit per day.
Include whole grains such as whole wheat breads, pasta, cereal and oatmeal in your daily diet.

4 Drink water to satisfy your thirst. Many women find they are thirsty while breastfeeding; however, forcing yourself to drink fluids does not increase your supply.

5 Dietary restrictions from pregnancy do not apply to breastfeeding moms.

6 Vegetarian diets can be compatible with breastfeeding. If you avoid meat, make sure you eat other sources of iron and zinc such as dried beans, dried fruit, nuts, seeds and dairy. If you avoid all animal products (vegan diet) you will need to take a B12 supplement to make sure your baby does not develop a B12 deficiency.

How much to eat

Breastfeeding requires extra calories. If you still have baby weight from your pregnancy, these extra calories will naturally be used for your milk. If you have lost all your baby weight, you may need to eat an extra 500-600 calories per day. After your baby starts eating other foods at 6 months, you will be making less milk and you can cut back on your calorie intake.
