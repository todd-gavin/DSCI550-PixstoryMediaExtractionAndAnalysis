The government must resolutely prevent deforestation in all parts of the country and cut off the hands of local powerful people from committing these crimes If we consider the truth of the matter the shortcomings and inadequacies of the above mentioned officials namely the Ministry of Agriculture the Ministry of Public Works the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing municipalities and the Environment Department are the real culprits of the shocking environmental situation in the country Because over the past several years not only in the provinces but even in Kabul they have not been able to make positive and constructive changes as an example of their ability and function If these shortcomings and negligence continue we can definitely say that when the people of the provinces and remote areas turn to the cities and the capital due to the problems caused by the drought and the lack of drinking water A few mornings later the crowded cities drowning in vast and dangerous pollution will sometimes turn into horrible massacres It is now estimated that the majority of the thousands of patients in Kabul are due to environmental pollution Therefore the negative changes in the nature of the country especially the continuous drought and lack of access to necessary and healthy drinking water in the provinces especially Kabul are all rooted in the indiscriminate destruction of the environment and the negligence of the relevant authorities and institutions
