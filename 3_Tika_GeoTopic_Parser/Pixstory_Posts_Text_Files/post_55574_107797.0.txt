Bluey is a favourite among families (and adults!) all over the world, and it's one of the few shows — designed for kids or not — that can legitimately be dubbed an Instant Classic. 

As per vulture, Bluey, which follows 6-year-old Bluey Heeler*, her younger sister Bingo, and their parents Bandit (David McCormack) and Chilli (Melanie Zanetti) on primarily domestic adventures, focuses on the inherent significance of imaginative play. 

Bluey presents its viewers with a world in which no game is too far outside the imaginative bounds, from a magical xylophone that renders its targets utterly motionless to a home "surgery" that follows literal cat-and-mouse procedural logic to a cross-cultural camping experience where the language of play transcends every linguistic barrier.

More importantly, it presents a world in which no adult is ever too grown-up to set aside their Grown-Up Worries and join in. Truly: a joy.
