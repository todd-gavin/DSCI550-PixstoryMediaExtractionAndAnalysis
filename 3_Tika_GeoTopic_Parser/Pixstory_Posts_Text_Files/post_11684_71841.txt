Most of the health concerns involving energy drinks center on their caffeine content Importantly it is generally recommended that adults consume no more than mg of caffeine per day Energy drinks typically only contain around mg of caffeine per ounces ml which is pretty close to an average cup of coffee The problem is that many energy drinks are sold in containers larger than ounces ml On top of that several energy drinks also contain herbal extracts like guarana a natural source of caffeine that contains around mg of caffeine per gram Energy drink manufacturers are not required to include this in the caffeine content listed on the product label which means the total caffeine content of many beverages can be drastically underestimated Depending on the type and size of the energy drink you consume it is not hard to exceed the recommended amount of caffeine if you consume multiple energy drinks in one day Although occasionally drinking one energy drink is unlikely to cause any harm it is probably wise to avoid consuming energy drinks as a part of your daily routine If you decide to consume energy drinks limit them to no more than ounces ml of a standard energy drink per day and try to limit all other caffeinated beverages to avoid excessive intake of caffeine Pregnant and nursing women children and teenagers should avoid energy drinks altogether
