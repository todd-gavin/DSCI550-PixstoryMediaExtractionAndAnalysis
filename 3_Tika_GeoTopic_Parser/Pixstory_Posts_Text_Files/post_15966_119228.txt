Jia Liu Mengzhao Wang Abstract Objective To better understand immune checkpoint inhibitor ICI induced diabetes mellitus DM in cancer patients Design and method We present a case of ICI induced diabetic ketoacidosis DKA and conduct a systematic review of the PubMed and Web of Science databases up to September to identify all published cases of ICI induced diabetes Results In addition to our case a total of published cases were identified during the literature search Summary and statistical analyzes were conducted for all cases The median onset time from ICI initiation to DM diagnosis was weeks range DKA was present in of the cases and low C peptide levels were detected in indicating an acute onset of diabetes Patients with positive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies GADA had an earlier onset of ICI induced diabetes median time weeks vs weeks for GADA negative patients p and a higher frequency of DKA development vs p All but two patients developed insulin dependent diabetes permanently Immunotherapy rechallenge was reported in cases after glycemia was well controlled Conclusion ICI induced DM is a serious adverse event that often presents with life threatening ketoacidosis GADA positivity is related to an earlier onset of ICI induced diabetes and a higher frequency of DKA development Close monitoring of glucose levels is needed in patients receiving ICI treatment ICI induced DM is usually insulin dependent since damage to cells is irreversible On the premise of well controlled glycemia immunotherapy rechallenge is feasible Sources
