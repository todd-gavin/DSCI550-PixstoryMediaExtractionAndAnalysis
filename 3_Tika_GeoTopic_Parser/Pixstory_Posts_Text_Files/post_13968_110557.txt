This is only a part of my playlist and I know it doesn t cover even of my usual go to songs From old to new of any genre I love to listen music hum to it and get onto it completely I love music probably beacuse it s a combination of factors in my opinion The musical talent involved is one of the main factors for me Since I lack any exceptional abilities or capabilities I have always been in awe of those who do I find it impressive when someone can sing or play an instrument well If you enjoy music as much as those of us do I believe you were probably born with it I didn t grow up around music as some music fans do because neither of my parents is a huge fan Simply put I ve always liked it
