Change is the only constant and the world has a problem with accepting changes If you aren t ready to embrace your changes you are stuck You got no mental growth Gender itself is a social construct so are gender roles Humans are so different that they love different things even identical twins have different preferences Then how can you make rules so common for them Cyclic Oppression should be discussed here Some going through oppression sub consciously tend to oppress others so that they are not alone in the oppression they face Sorry Jeffery the world is changing embrace it The days of women s subjugation are over Sensitive men women are normal strong men women are normal It s best for the families when men and women share the load and cooking is a life skill that everyone should learn Men are not helping their wives when cooking it s normal for men to cook Women are capable of finances it s not the th century to keep women in the household we have women entrepreneurs and finance experts all over the world They are no lesser than men but equal to them Gender roles destroy the mental peace of a person Imagine being stuck in a game where you have to follow all kinds of rules for the rest of your life Well games end at one point or other but what if the gender game you play ends with your life What is the point of acting pretending to be something you are not for the rest of your life just to please society Sadly this is the vicious loop in which many are stuck Once you realise it when you embrace your true self you would fall in love with yourself
