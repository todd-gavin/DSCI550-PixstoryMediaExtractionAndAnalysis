A video has surfaced online in which, Manoj Kumar, a police constable in the Firozabad District of Uttar Pradesh can be seen crying and complaining with a plate in his hand about the quality of food that is being served in the police mess.

Widely-shared footage on Twitter shows him weeping with a plate of dal, roti, and rice in hand even as a huge crowd looks. 

"This is what we get after working long hours. How will cops work if we won't get a proper diet?" he asks in the video. He says, that even dogs won't eat this food, ''even after working 12 hours shift, this is what we get to eat". 

He even speaks about the harassment he is facing after his repeated complaint and being threatened by the mess manager that he will be suspended.

He further says that even after repeated complaints to the SSP & DIG office, no action has been taken, "they don't do anything despite repeated complaints, just keep on oppressing us" he adds. 

The video was tweeted by the former DGP of J&K Police Shesh Paul Vaid.

"The state of affairs this Constable is indicating is not only true of UP but many parts of India where working conditions of lower constabulary are very poor. Ration allowance is provided, then why is there such a situation? Mismanagement by police mess is not a political issue." Vaid tweeted.

Kumar was later whisked away by seniors, as per several news reports.

Firozabad Police acknowledged his protest and said the Circle Officer would investigate his complaint about mess food. The department also pointed out that Kumar has a history of absenteeism and other disciplinary issues.
