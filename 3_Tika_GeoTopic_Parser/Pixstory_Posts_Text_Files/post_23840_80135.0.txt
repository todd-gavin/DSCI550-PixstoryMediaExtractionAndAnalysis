I went to the Big Chill Cakery just before the first lockdown in 2020 with 2 friends from college. The 3 of us split this little piece of cake together and it’s one my favourite memories from college. I want to go back with them and relive this fun little memory. I just wish I could remember the damn dessert’s name!
