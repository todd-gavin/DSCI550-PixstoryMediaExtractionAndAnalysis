Our elders often advise us to not take a bath after meals. Turns out, Ayurveda also strongly recommends against it. But, there’s more — it is not just taking a bath, experts say that certain other bathing habits, which are extremely common, have the potential to affect the digestive system and overall health. “Our body works in complex ways and all our actions have potential consequences; bathing rituals are certainly one of those,” Dr Garima Goyal, a dietician, told indianexpress.com.
1 Ensure to drink a glass of water before taking a shower: The expert suggested that a glass of warm or room temperature water before a shower can help lower blood pressure-related issues in the body. She explained, “drinking warm water warms your body from the inside” which results in the widening of blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow through them; thus lowering the blood pressure. “This results in a similar circulatory system dilation on the skin’s surface,” she added.
2 Never take a shower after having a full meal: “It weakens the digestive fire, which is a warm energy in your stomach and gut, that aids digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients,” the expert said. She explained that after eating, the body rushes blood to the digestive system to help in the digestion process. As such, taking a shower “distracts this blood flow from the stomach and rushes it instead to the surface of the skin,” she added.
3 Avoid taking a shower after sunset: Our body starts to cool down after sunset, which is a signal that it’s time for bed. The expert explained that taking a shower before bed can block the skin pores trapping the body heat within. This can cause a “rise in body temperature which can actually disrupt this signal and your night’s sleep in the process,” she added.
