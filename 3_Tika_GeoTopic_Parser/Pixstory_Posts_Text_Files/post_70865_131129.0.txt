I did once try to get into coaching back in 2003, I appeared for an introductory course but couldn't make it and just after that I got a normal job. I had to take up the job as otherwise there wouldn't have been any source of income for me. Many of my friends from football still try to convince me to go to coaching but I think that ship has sailed now. I can't leave my job now after coming this far up.

Technically football has changed a lot in India but I believe that it's still not up to the international standards yet. In that regard we have a long way to go. It'll talk a lot of time but the associations and clubs should start developing players from the grassroot levels themselves and try to find hidden talents that might not get an opportunity otherwise. I think more Indian players should play in the starting eleven of the ISL clubs so that they can get exposure at the highest level in India.
