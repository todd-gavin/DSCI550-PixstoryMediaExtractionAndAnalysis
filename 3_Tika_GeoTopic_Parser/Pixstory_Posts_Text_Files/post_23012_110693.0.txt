Two-time Champions League winner Ellie Carpenter has signed a new deal which extends her contract with Olympique Lyonnais until 2026. The Matildas defender joined Lyon in 2020 and has already won two Champions League titles, one Division 1 title  and one Coupe de France title at the age of 22 with Les Lyonnaises. 

Born in New South Wales, the defender has played for Western Sydney Wanderers and Canberra United in the A-League Women (formerly the W-League). Ellie made her league debut when she was only 15 years old with Western Sydney Wanderers. 

She joined NWSL side Portland Thorns in 2018 and scored a goal in her first season as Portland finished second in the regular season and later lost to the North Carolina Courage in the final. Ellie joined Melboune City on loan for the 2019/20 W-League season and helped them win the league and the grand final. Carpenter also won the W-League Young Player of the Month award in January. 

The 22-year old defender has represented Australia in the 2016 Rio Olympics, the 2017 and 2018 editions of the Algarve Cup, the 2019 FIFA World Cup and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. She has won 57 caps with Matildas and scored a brace against Indonesia in the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup held in India. 

She sustained a ligament injury in the 2022 UEFA Women’s Champions League Final against Barcelona and was subbed off in the 14th minute when Lyon were leading 1-0. 

Lyon have already renewed captain Wendie Renanrd’s contract until 2026.
