Frenkie De Jong is being rumoured as one of the chief targets for United in the summer. Hence the Red Devils are even ready to give two of their players for the midfielder. 

As per reports, The Manchester-based club is ready to offer Marcus Rashford and Alex Telles on a swap deal. The Red Devils are hoping that this would help them in enticing Barcelona to get the midfielder

Barcelona are not very keen on losing their midfielder as he has been a constant part of the starting XI since 2019. The Blaugrana's manager Xavi Hernandez has also touted the midfielder as "the future" of the club. 

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola had reportedly asked for Frenkie De Jong in a "swap plus cash" deal for Ferran Torres in January. But Barcelona didn't want to let him go. 

The incoming Manchester United manager is no stranger to Frenkie De Jong. The 24-year-old midfielder was part of Erik Ten Hag's historic Ajax side that reached the UEFA Champions League semi-final in the 2018/19 season.

Hence even if Ten Hag convinces De Jong for a move, Barcelona could ask anywhere between €60-80m for the player. Owing to this, Manchester United are hoping that the swap offer could help them in reducing the transfer fees.





Why would Barcelona want Marcus Rashford and Alex Telles?

Manchester United Transfer News: Barcelona had been linked with Marcus Rashford last month. Ousmane Dembele is reportedly set to leave the club in the summer. Hence, the Spanish giants are reportedly monitoring Rashford as a possible replacement.

The Blaugrana are also in search of a left-back. Hence the 29-year-old Alex Telles could be a good option for the club. It has to be seen if Rashford or Telles help influence Barcelona's decision and convinces them to let Frenkie De Jong go in the summer transfer window.
