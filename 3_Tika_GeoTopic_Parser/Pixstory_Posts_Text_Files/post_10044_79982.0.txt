There is hatred in our throats that screams despair and sorrows are connected in our hearts;  The hearts of all of us are rainy.  Our suffering has gotten bigger, as if all our bones are broken.  Even our pains hurt.  Afghanistan is my homeland, a land that always speaks of the pain of the martyrdom of its soldiers, the orphanage of the children of my land, displacement and misery!  The people of my country have been suffering from this pain and sorrow for many years.  Immigration has been haunting our homes for years.  For many years, we have been hoping for ourselves that one day we will return and build you, but it did not become my homeland ... O Golshan Mardafarin!  Forgive me for not being able to make you happy.  We lost you before our very eyes and witnessed your fragmentation.  How easily they sold the particles of existence to the tribe of suicide and explosion, in order to deprive us of every bit of dust.  Now that we are away from you, our hearts are burning in the fire of your separation.

 Afghanistan;  It means suicide, explosion, shouting, grief, revenge, crying, wandering, fear and anxiety, the peak of despair, the bitter regret of the times, this is the bitter end of my homeland.
