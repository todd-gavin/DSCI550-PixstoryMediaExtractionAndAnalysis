India's first indigenous aircraft carrier(named after its first aircraft carrier commissioned in 1961) which also happens to be the largest and the most complex warship ever built in Indian Maritime history, "INS Vikrant" has been commissioned in Kochi today with a new Navy 'ensign' dropping the St.George's cross that used to be the constant feature of Indian Navy flags since independence barring a short period during PM Vajpayee's term.
With the commissioning of what is reckoned to be the largest force on the high seas, India has entered into the elite list of nations operating more than one aircraft carrier in their naval fleet, the addition will certainly strengthen India's standing as a "Blue water Navy".
"BRAVO ZULU" to the Indian Navy!!
Welcome back, the legend. 
"With fair winds, following seas, fathoms beneath your keel, may you touch glories always"
Happy Hunting, Vikrant!! ⚓
