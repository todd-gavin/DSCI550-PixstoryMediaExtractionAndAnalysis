Joyce Carol Vincent ( 1965 - 2003 ) was born in London. Her father was of African descent and her mother was of Indian descent .When Joyce was 11 her mother died and Joyce's four sisters looked after her . 
She worked at Ernst & Young for four years , but resigned in March 2001 for unknown reasons .During this period she isolated herself from her family and friends . She didn't have an understanding relationship with her father , whom she averred dead in 2001 but actually her father died in 2003 . She was in a relationship and was also a victim of domestic violence and this was presumed to be one of the reasons for her sudden seclusion .
In 2003, Joyce moved into the bedsit flat in London . The flat was owned by the Metropolitan Housing Trust and was used to shelter victims of abuse.
In 2006, officials from the housing association repossessing a bedsit in Wood Green owing to rent arrears found Joyce in her bedsit in a skeletonized state , after three years of being dead with the television üì∫ still running.
Till date the reasons behind her death , her choice of isolating herself , etc remain unanswered and unresolved. The television in her bedsit continously operating for more than three years also left the investigators in puzzlement !!
