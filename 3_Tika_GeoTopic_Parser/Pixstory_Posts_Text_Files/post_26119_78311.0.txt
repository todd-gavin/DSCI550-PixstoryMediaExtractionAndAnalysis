These corridors remind of the fun we used to have in the school. Those moments were so precious and memorable that each one of us now crave for those days to come back . Unfortunately I belong to the batch whose last year of school was overcasted by the shadow of Covid and we had to spend our last year sitting in front of our laptops with even our farewell held virtually! I really wish those days could come back and i get to relive those days with my friends sometimes bunking the classes while the other times  just dancing in the classroom.
