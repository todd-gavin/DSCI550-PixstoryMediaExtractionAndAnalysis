There is no single cause that is responsible for the development of this phobia It happens that people with critical upbringing adapt to the fear of failure People who grow up in highly critical or unsupportive households may be more likely to experience a fear of failure Because they felt they could never live up to their family s expectations during childhood they may continue to fear making mistakes as adults People often have different definitions of what failure means For some people it means not achieving something exactly as they planned This can create a set of expectations that is very difficult to live up to People who experienced a difficult or even traumatic failure may also be afraid to repeat that experience in the future For example having a panic attack during a presentation or being ridiculed for your performance could contribute to feelings of fear In addition negative consequences resulting from failure such as losing a job or not getting into a college can also be risk factors that contribute to the fear of failure Sometimes phobias occur together For example a child with scolionophobia fear of school may also have atychiphobia Or someone with mysophobia fear of dirt and germs may develop atychiphobia if they feel they constantly fail at staying clean
