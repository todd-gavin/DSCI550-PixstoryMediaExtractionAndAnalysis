A lot of anecdotes and beliefs revolve around the thought that there exists a person who is exactly a copy of you A double walker or doppelganger whatever you wish to call it But the question is do we really have a lookalike Folks tell that everyone has a doppelganger somewhere in the chaos of billion people on the planet there is someone who looks exactly like you a duplicate of you who can have your parent s resemblance like you have Although science has a different narrative and it is also interesting According to the studies chances of sharing just eight dimensions with someone else is one in a trillion even with so many people on the planet there is only one in chance of finding a single pair of doppelgangers Despite this with her ability to perceive and recognise things by looking at them we try to see familiarity in people like someone s eyes looking exactly the same as others or it could be any other facial features This is how we go according to this understanding we all have somehow found someone looking alike But looking alike is not justified when just a few features match It s a copy that cannot be even slightly different from you Furthermore and interestingly there s one more interesting narrative to the doppelganger story Even though our features vary our genes do not It is found that we are somewhere or else genetically similar So there are chances that certain features resembling yours do combine randomly but that still would not make someone exactly the same as you
