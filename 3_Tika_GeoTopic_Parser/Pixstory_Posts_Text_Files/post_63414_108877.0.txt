Myself Mohith P M. I belong to Kerala, so usually we are called mallus. Everyone will explain about their studies and institutions when we reach the introduction, but not that kind I would like to share with you to explain who I am not to talk about my studies and academics. Before that i would like to say something about my family. My family consists of Father who is a farmer, Mother who is a homemaker, a twin Brother and Grandma , This is my small family. I’m highly interested in Cricket. As an Indian our national cricket team is my favorite, also I’m a great IPL fan. Among IPL teams I would support CSK, because  the main reason is MS Dhoni and also it’s a nice franchise, also I’m very interested on playing cricket. One of my other interested part is current politics in India, i don’t like any political parties till now, that only because every party have it’s on political ideologies but the problem in India is like the parties are not working belongs to their ideologies, that’s why i personally don't like political parties. I would like to know more about current affairs, especially about politics, finance, economics and science, also these are my favorite subjects. 
                                 These words are not all about me, but it’s my small introduction about myself, so I'm wrapping my words here 
                                                                                                                     Thankyou.
