The Fifa World Cup is undoubtedly the biggest sporting event on the planet. Nations from all continents fight tooth and nail to just gain the right to participate in the quadrennial event.
The 2018 tournament attracted a combined global viewership of 3.572 billion viewers – that is half the planet's population. According to Fifa, the final between France and Croatia alone attracted a combined global audience of 1.12 billion.
This year, 32 teams will once again fight for the ultimate prize. The venue is Qatar – the first time the finals has been staged in the Middle East.
Hosts Qatar will kick off the tournament at the Al Bayt Stadium on November 20 against Ecuador, with the final on December 18.
Fifa has set aside a total prize pool of $440 million for the World Cup 2022. The breakdown is as follows:
Champions: $42 million
Runners-up: $30 million
Third place: $27 million
Fourth place: $25 million
Fifth-eighth place: $68 million ($17 million per team)
Ninth-16th place: $104 million ($13 million per team)
17th-32nd place: $144 million ($9 million per team)
In addition, each team that has qualified will receive $1.5m ahead of the competition to cover preparation costs. In the 2018 edition, winners France took home a cheque of $38m.
