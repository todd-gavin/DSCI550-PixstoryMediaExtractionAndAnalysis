Have you ever broken your mom's teacup? Have you ever said sorry for that? Did that stem from fear? Or are you suggesting that we collectively just abandon the idea of forgiveness and let people hurt others without any consequences of it? I am confused as to why you think the urge to want to be forgiven is fear. That feeling you're talking about, that surrounds the need for forgiveness, is far from fear. We make mistakes, we seek forgiveness because we realize that we did something wrong.

We are a society, we need rules. We need to set a bar for ethics and morals. We can't just roam around like dogs in the wild doing anything and everything. It's one thing to challenge those rules but completely another to question the very idea of morality and presenting it as some sort of vile practice. Religion or no religion, people have personal morals. They seek forgiveness even without any fear of being punished by some higher entity. The atheists of the biggest kinds say sorry when they do something they think was wrong. Forgiveness is not a religious idea even though it is very strongly present there. So probably if you're against the idea of forgiveness, being against religion is not enough. You're gonna have to be against the entirety of mankind.

Religion will exist, you like it or not. It has become a necessity at this point. No matter how good your neighbour is or how close your friend is, they're not going to be there for you all the time. They have their own problems, they have their own lives. They're gonna need you some days. What's wrong in people holding on to the idea of someone up there who will always be there for them? Faith is a personal possession. People keep it close, people hold onto it. Those people should not be frowned upon because there is some evil out there. Because if that should be the case, I can present to you a list of atheists who've done horrible things to others. However, some people don't speak for all.
