This societal issue is directly linked to the French and European policies related to the energy transition. One has to define the future energy mix which will lead to a lower environmental footprint and a better quality of life. Problems link to energy production (resources, environmental im- pact) will be minimized if the energy consumption is limited. Thus, the challenge for Research is to propose solutions allowing to produce clean energy but also to reduce the energy needs. This energy transition requires basic research which is the source of technological developments (e.g. combustion engines, steam engines at the beginning of the industrial era, nuclear energy, hydroelectricity, solar energy, wind energy, green fuel…) and economic development. INSA’s laboratories contribute to this energy transition through research work to meet those needs.
