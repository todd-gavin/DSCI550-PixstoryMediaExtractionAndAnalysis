Vice Presient Kamala Harris stated recently made a claim that the border was secure. Yet, despite the nearly 2 million border crossings that have occurred since this time last year, and with seemingly no end in sight, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre doubled down on the claim.Who is this administration convincing? And who would be dumb enough to believe it? The border is clearly not under control. Drugs, guns, and humans are trafficked by traffickers into our country every day, and thousands of illegal immigrants with faux-asylum claims pour over the border.These failed border policies are harming southern border states like Texas, where they are seeing an abundance of illegal immigrants crossing over. The border is out of control, not secure, and if the vice president believes that lying is a better policy than speaking the truth, then she will continue to fail this nation.
