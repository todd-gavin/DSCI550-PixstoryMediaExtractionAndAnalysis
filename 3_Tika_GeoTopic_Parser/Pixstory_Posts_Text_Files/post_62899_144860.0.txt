Before you jump out of an airplane, there are a few things you should keep in mind. Here are some tips to help make your skydive as safe and fun as possible: 
- Make sure you have the required insurance coverage. Your policy may cover accidents while skydiving, including jumps from high altitudes.
- Get plenty of rest the night before your jump. You'll be more alert and able to enjoy the experience if you're well rested.
- Dress comfortably for the weather conditions. Weather can change rapidly during a sky dive, so dress accordingly (in layers if necessary). Try not to wear heavy or restrictive clothing that could restrict movement or cause discomfort during flight or landing.
- Bring along any medications you may require, such as asthma medication or heart medication . Not all airlines allow medical emergencies on board their planes, so it's important to know what is permitted beforehand.
- Be familiar with basic safety procedures , such as how to deploy and use your parachute equipment correctly in case of emergency situations . Familiarity will also give you peace of mind in case something goes wrong during your jump..
- Before heading out on your adventure, make sure to read through the safety information provided by our staff members at the check-in desk...and don't forget those goggles!
