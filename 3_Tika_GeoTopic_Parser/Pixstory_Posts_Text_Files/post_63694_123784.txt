 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a museum located in Ohio Cleveland USA Dedicated to preserving the history of rock and those figures which have influenced it Well that is what it is supposed to do but in reality it simply ought to rename itself as the Hall of Shame and burn itself down for few things are a bigger sham For its very name RRHOF is one of the most disrespectful organizations towards rock The committee that inducts artists into the RRHOF is more like a cabal that has zero knowledge of rock music inducting just whoever the hell they fancy reflecting their own tastes while routinely ignoring the thousands of petitioners who write to them to nominate induct or ignore an artist Genres like heavy metal and progressive rock are frequently ignored Hell it took them almost years to induct Deep Purple one of the most important and influential rock bands of all time but they put KISS and Bon Jovi in no time at all They are rock bands true and even good ones but come on inducting them before Deep Purple is stupid Not to mention RRHOF even inducted non rock artists like Dolly Parton Janet Jackson Maddona and Tupac before Deep Purple Seriously At this point this place is little more than a medium for music industry people to pat each other on the back while basically insulting rock music in its entirety How many great deserving artists have since then been ignored Iron Maiden Judas Priest Scorpions Alice In Chains Soundgarden Melvins Misfits Suicidal Tendencies Magnum Black Flag King Crimson Fates Warning Motorhead and the list goes on and on So in the great words of Iron Maiden vocalist and heavy metal legend Bruce Dickinson who so aptly described RRHOF I think the Rock Roll Hall of Fame is an utter and complete load of bollocks to be honest with you It s run by a bunch of sanctimonious bloody Americans who wouldn t know rock roll if it hit them in the face They need to stop taking Prozac and start drinking f beer
