The Devil All the Time Personally I have never had more conflicting opinions about a film than this this is just a very lukewarm film It falls flat on some of its hottest moments and makes your body shiver with the coldness of narrative at times The Devil all the time is not for everyone if you don t like brute violence blood death and just poor depiction of life this isn t for you better look away The Devil all the time makes you feel sick to your stomach it makes you feel horrible with what is going on in the world of its characters the trailer itself was iconic but the movie does not land onto the expectations that it brought You will love Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson they really are tour de forces they own every scene they are a part of Robert playing a evil character might not have been what you needed but after this performance yes maybe we did need it The movie is poor in its narrative and very slow and tedious at times a tad too tedious it goes on to show the grimness of life by being grim itself but there is a limit to which a movie can go at one point it becomes evident that the director is trying to hard to make the audience feel sick from the events and it is very evident in The Devil All the time All in all I would say The Devil all the time may not necessarily be for the mainstream audiences and for the audiences it made for it has proven to be a disappointment for them So for me you might want to skip this one
