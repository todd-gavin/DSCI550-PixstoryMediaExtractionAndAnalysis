To preserve the oceans and guarantee their role in the fight against climate change, much more investment is needed in research and in the dissemination of knowledge on the subject. This was stated in Lisbon, where the second UN conference on oceans kicked off, by the director general of Unesco Audrey Azoulay The Paris organization Azoulay explained has raised millions of dollars which will allow a hundred initiatives in the next few years but that is not enough. only a fifth of the seabed has been mapped to reach the goal of mapping the seabed by an acceleration in data collection and research quality will be needed It is an opportunity to launch new expeditions that explore the unsolved mysteries of the oceans and not to close the eyes on the world&#39;s knowledge, especially that accumulated through culture and indigenous peoples, said the secretary general.
