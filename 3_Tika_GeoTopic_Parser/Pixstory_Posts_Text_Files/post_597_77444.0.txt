In a yet to be peer reviewed study, scientists from China have warned about a type of coronavirus, NeoCov, that spreads among bats in South Africa . It may pose a threat to humans in future if it mutates further and jumps the species . 
So far the spread is just among the bats and the virus has not jump to humans. The researchers from Wuhan university said that if mutated and transmitted to humans the virus can cause get harm . And more deaths than coronavirus. 
The study by Chinese researchers.
recently posted on the preprint repository BioRxiv, shows that NeoCov is closely related to the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a viral disease first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 

According to researchers from Wuhan University and the Chinese Academy of Sciencesâ€™ Institute of Biophysics, only one mutation is required for the virus to infiltrate human cells. The research findings stated that the novel coronavirus poses a risk because it binds to the ACE2 receptor differently than the coronavirus pathogen. As a result, neither antibodies nor protein molecules produced by people with respiratory diseases or who have been immunised can protect against NeoCoV.

The mutation has not happened so there is no need to be alarmed so far . 
What we so far know is the virus is only found in bat population and has not entered human race.
