Almost years old Vincenzo Nibali chose the stage of the Giro d Italia which ended in his native Messina to announce his retirement from competitive sport at the end of this season The winner of two Tours, a Tour de France and a Vuelta to the microphones of Rai confessed Right in land where I was born and started pedaling I wanted to announce that this will be my last Giro I have collected so much in my career I have tried to do the best so far I am excited here my story began with the first races in Sicily which I then left for years I have given so much to cycling and perhaps the time has come to be able to give back a little of what I stole from family and friends and everything I sacrificed for two wheels In his career, in addition to victories in the three Grand Tours, Nibali also boasts two tours of Lombardy and a Milano Sanremo results that make him one of the few cyclists able to achieve success in both three-week races and one-day Classics
