Peer pressure, its causes, and the best ways to deal with them are all defined by a number of key features. There are many forms of it and it is triggered by a variety of reasons.

Peer pressure is the effect that a person or group of people has on you to take a particular action that you might not otherwise think to take. Nearly everyone has encountered peer pressure at some point, whether favourable or unfavourable. Because everyone wants to fit in and be liked, it is very simple to give in to peer pressure. The worry factor, together with the desire to be liked or respected, are two characteristics of peer pressure. Therefore, one is on their way to reducing peer pressure when they acknowledge that they do not need to care about impressing individuals in their peer group.

There are six types of peer pressure. Namely,

Spoken Peer Pressure. 
Unspoken Peer Pressure.
Direct Peer Pressure.
Indirect Peer Pressure. 
Negative Peer Pressure.
Positive Peer Pressure.

Peer pressure has a significant impact on how kids and teenagers develop socially and emotionally. It begins at a young age and becomes more pronounced throughout adolescence. As kids grow and mature, having friends is normal, healthy, and essential.
