Rekindled love stories abound in films and the majority of them end happily According to a survey out of films about rekindled love ended happily which is an overwhelming majority Is this however also true in real life Surprisingly this is the case Second chance at love with the same person can be much more than a reigniting of passion and nostalgia Given the history and intricacy of these relationships the intensity and emotion felt while reconciling with an old love may seem unfathomable These rekindled romances appeared to be even more passionate than romantic movies would suggest percent of those in the study said that their reunion was the most intense romance they d ever had This was proven in their percent success rate in staying together And like they say sometimes two people have to fall apart to realize just how badly they need to fall back together People can change and evolve through going through dark moments of loss and heartbreak People who have worked through severe relationship sorrow understand that going to a deeper better place takes a lot of self reflection professional counselling and meditation or prayer However if a relationship is designed to be repaired after a breakup it can only be done if both partners are prepared to undergo the work of introspection And that s a lesson that every lover can learn from regardless of their individual circumstances or whether they ve formally ended a relationship It s sometimes because you realise after a while that the person you ve broken up with is YOUR person It s sometimes because their love for one another was greater and more vital than everything else Sometimes it s just because you ve grown accustomed to having that person around you and in your life and you think it d be a good idea to start again
