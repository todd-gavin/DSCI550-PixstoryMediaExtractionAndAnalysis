This year India will be celebrating its 73rd 
Republic Day
. The day is celebrated to mark India’s complete independence or Poorna Swaraj that took a long time to finally achieve. Freedom fighters like Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh and a plethora more, fought courageously for the country to attain autonomy. Complete and absolute autonomy, however, remained a distant dream that the British government was not ready to fulfil. It was on January 26, 1950 that the Constitution designed by the drafting committee headed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. The Congress Session at Lahore on December 29, 1929, had passed a resolution declaring Purna Swaraj or complete, absolute autonomy as India’s goal. It was also decided that the 26th of January should be observed all over India as Purna Swaraj Day.

Republic Day was since declared a national holiday and has been celebrated throughout the country with great fervour and enthusiasm. As a part of it, a grand parade marches from Rashtrapti Bhawan along Rajpath to India Gate and from there to the Red Fort in the National capital, Delhi on January 26. The Delhi Republic Day parade is the largest and most important parade that marks the cultural, social and regional diversity of the country The festival is also celebrated in educational institutions categorically where special assemblies that include plays, performances and processions are held. In some schools, essay writing competitions, quizzes, fancy dress competitions and cultural events are held to mark the day. Resident Welfare Associations and societies hold events and competitions to mark the day and celebrate the day. The entire country unites to celebrate the occasion.
