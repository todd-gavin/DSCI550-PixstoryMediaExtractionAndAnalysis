I am a big fan of MasterChef Australia. I have been watching all seasons and this is one of my favourite shows as it is not just about classic Australian indigenous produce but it is about all kinds of cuisines and classics around the world and from there my journey started about knowing French cuisine. Now I am a huge fan of French cuisine and will love to try to make it classical , refinery French.

French cooking is considered by many to be the most prestigious and respectable cuisine in the world. With its formal techniques, emphasis on fresh ingredients and simple flavors, pride in presentation, and rich and colorful history, French cuisine truly has come to rule the world, laying the foundations for many other styles and specialties.

Well, if any by chance you have to make French cuisine , just remember it is all about elevating simple elements to finesse, it's all about outshining the simple produce yet with sophisticated techniques.
