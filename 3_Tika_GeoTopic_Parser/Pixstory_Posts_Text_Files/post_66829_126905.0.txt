I know Triple H has been doing a great job of running WWE, but it's still early to speculate on whether CM Punk's prophetic words were true or not. 

In the last few weeks, wrestling had been good, there have been numerous returns to the company, and the rosters are trying to swell up, it really seems like WWE is coming back together. 

But Vince McMahon did this for 40 years, there are a few things that come with experience and we will have to see if it works out the same with Triple H. Once the novelty period ends and the new stuff wears out, if HHH can still hold the same attention of viewers, then it might be fair to say that he is better than his predecessor and that CM Punk was wrong
