Abhineet Agarwal is a lost soul who is trying to find his own peace. He likes to think he can play the guitar, but doesn’t tell people that: he’s afraid they’ll make him sing. On a rainy day, you can find him in a corner, listening to lofi music – hot chocolate is a bonus. If you want to become his friend, just say that you like Shutter Island.

He likes reading poetry, playing video games, and listening to Indie music.

If there’s one thing he firmly believes in, it’s that art can save the world. His favourite colour is blue, and he has a thing for minimalist drawings. He is fascinated by the fact that there’s a planet in outer space where it rains diamonds, and can’t get over the fact that butterflies drink tortoise tears. He will argue at length for marijuana legalization.
He likes psychology, Russian art house films, and ukuleles.

Some more facts: one day, he dreams of writing his own novel. He believes that you should never pluck flowers. He often forgets to put his phone on charging. He has a penchant for fountain pens. He loves picking seashells from the beach. Lizards, social media activists, and broken appliances annoy him.

He likes oranges, magical realism, and cheese.
