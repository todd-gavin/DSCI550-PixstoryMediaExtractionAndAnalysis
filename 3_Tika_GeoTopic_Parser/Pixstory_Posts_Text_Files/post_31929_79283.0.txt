Fabrizio Romano has revealed the details behind Dejan Kuluveski's transfer from Juventus to Tottenham Hotspur.

The 21-year-old has swapped Turin for north London, and he is ready to help Antonio Conte's side for the rest of the season.

However, it appears as if Tottenham could end up splashing out a huge amount of money on a player who has only scored nine goals for Juventus (transfermarkt).

Speaking on his personal Twitter account on February the 3rd, Romano revealed that Spurs have paid 10million Euros (£8.46million) to take Kuluveski on loan until the end of the 2022/2023 season.

They will be forced to buy the Swede if he makes 15 starts from now until the end of the season or if Conte's side qualify for the Champions League.

If this happens, Spurs will pay Juve 40million Euros (£33.83million).

Now, if neither of these things happen, there is also an option to buy included in the deal, and that is also set at 40million Euros for next summer and 35million Euros (£29.6million) for this summer.

So, if things go to plan, this could be an expensive transfer for Spurs.

However, if he helps Tottenham qualify for the Champions League, you would think Daniel Levy would be very happy to pay Juve.

The clause that worries me is the 15 starts one because what if Conte starts Kuluveski 15 times and he fails to do anything?

Spurs would have no way out, and they would have to fork out a huge sum of money.

So, that clause concerns me, but ultimately, it is up to Kuluveski to prove to Tottenham and Conte that he can be a key man in the future.

Let's see how this all pans out, but this deal represents a huge risk to Spurs.
