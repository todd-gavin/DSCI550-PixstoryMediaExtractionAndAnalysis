Brahmastra starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt has finally released in theatres all across. As expected, the film has opened to an excellent response. The initial box office momentum is definitely there ✔️✔️✔️

Made on a budget of over 400 crores, the film has been promoted as a visual treat with never-seen-before VFX work. 3D and 3D IMAX versions are showing superb responses all across the country. 🥳😍

Thankfully, it justifies every single penny as the visuals are stunning and it’s a whole new experience in Indian cinema. It’s an answer to all who have been asking for a film matching Hollywood standards. It has hit the bull’s eye in attracting its target audience and that’s youth in the range of 10-30 years. 👍👍👍Even though it’s an experience for all, the aforementioned age group will make for the majority of footfalls. ✔️

After talking about the positives, let’s discuss some minuses. After initial positive reactions, mixed word-of-mouth has now started flowing in. No one is calling it a bad film but many are pointing out too much attention on grandeur and romance, rather than the screenplay. ✅Shah Rukh Khan’s cameo is doing its job of attracting the audience, while some feel that he has been wasted. Also, the content will not appeal to all age groups and all centres, impacting the span of the theatrical run. 😱🙏

On the whole, Brahmastra has things working in favour and things not working in favour as well. However, the hype and the cinematic experience definitely have an edge over shortcomings.👍👍

So, it’s clear ground to score for Brahmastra at the box office and it is eyeing to make anywhere between 190-220 crores. Expect 100 crores in the first weekend itself, bringing back the good old days for Bollywood!✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️
