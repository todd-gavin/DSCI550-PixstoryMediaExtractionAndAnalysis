This ad, featuring Mithun Chakraborty, dates back to a time when the VCR fever had reached its peak. The 1982 Asian Games in Delhi had introduced colour broadcast and video libraries and parlours had mushroomed across the country. 

The middle-class was in the middle of a deep romance with VCRs, Colour TVs & popular Hindi cinema. Very often, families rented out the VCR and TV, plus 3-4 Hindi films and spent the whole night watching them. 

While there were some Indian colour TV brands like Uptron, Weston & Beltek in the market, the holy grail was the acquisition of "Original Made in Japan" brands. It was Sony Trinitron in Colour TVs and Panasonic (or National or National Panasonic) in VCRs that were top of the tops. 

If you possessed a Sony Trinitron Colour TV and Panasonic VCR, your place at the top of the social hierarchy was confirmed. People looked upto you (I remember we having a Sony TV and an Akai VCR). You could endlessly boast about it. 

We had a Delhiite connection, who would gaze lovingly at his Sony TV all day, gushing "Oreeznal Sony da TV haiga. Koi mazaak nee hai". One would suspect he loved his Sony TV more than his 'misej' or kids. 

But then, that is how things were in those days.

Those days.
