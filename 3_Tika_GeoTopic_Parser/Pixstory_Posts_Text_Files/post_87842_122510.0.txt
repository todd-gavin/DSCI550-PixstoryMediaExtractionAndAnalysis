For moms who work out of the home, pumping is LIFE!

For moms who exclusively breastfeed and stay (or work) from home……. pumping isn't necessary (but can be helpful).
Bottom line - you don't have to pump if you don't want to! 

I see pics all over the internet of freezers full of breastmilk which makes moms feel like they 
need a freezer full, too. That's just not true!
- A small stash of breastmilk is nice to have. Don't forget that frozen breastmilk is good for up to a year!

If you want to build a small stash - try adding a
pumping session in the morning, when you usually have a little extra.

Only pump when you need it - when you pump, you're telling your body that you need more breastmilk. So when you stop pumping and only nurse, you may experience engorgement or other issues. If you need to stop pumping,
be sure to slowly lower your pumping sessions.

Having a little milk in the freezer can give you a bit more freedom. For example, you could be away from baby for more than a couple hours.

Many couples like to have dad take over a night feeding for mom - you'll need to pump (or use formula) to do this.
Try not to introduce a bottle until breastfeeding is Well established (earliest would be 3-4 weeks old...) but if you want baby to take a bottle, try to introduce it earlier rather
than later. Don't wait until baby is 7 months old and spring it on them. they may not take it well!
