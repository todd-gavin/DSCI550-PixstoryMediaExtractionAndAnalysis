Hi everyone, I’m Vidhi Moondra. I’m a really extrovert person, i must say selectively extrovert. There are times when I don’t feel like talking to anyone, i become a complete introvert but this is a sign that something is messing up with my mind. Honestly since I’ve come to college, it has changed me in infinite ways. You know, there are times when you are all alone in this entire world feeling the lowest in your lives, but you have to learn to handle yourself. All these experiences have shaped me who I’m today. I feel i was always a very self- motivated person and the positive energy girl. I am that girl I believe around whom nobody around can ever feel low. I’m really strong by my mind, which all the things in my life had taught me. But sometimes i lose this energy in me. Nobody can ever get to know while being in front me that there’s a storm going inside me. But the fact that i get up more stronger is what gets me going. I can say, I’m my motivation. Apart from all the material facts about my college, my qualifications, this is who I’m.
