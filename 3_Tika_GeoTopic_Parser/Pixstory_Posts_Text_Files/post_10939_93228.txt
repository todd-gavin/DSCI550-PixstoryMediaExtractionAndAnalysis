Amid allegations that Kerala s Left government is pandering to fundamentalist Hindu groups our investigation into social media surveillance by the Kerala police shows a double standard and considerable leeway for Hindu extremists calling for violence against Muslims Kozhikode On January when the local media in the northern Kerala district of Kannur reported that the police had booked a man named Javid E P for instigating a riot The Welfare Party of India s WPI local leader Javid did not immediately realise that it was him Three days later he received a phone call summoning him to the Sreekandapuram Police Station His crime Javid had shared a Facebook post criticising the obliviousness towards a press conference held by Kerala Muslim activists subjected to the Bulli Bai online auction written by Malayalam film actress Lali P M in a WhatsApp group named Sreekandapuram Nagara Visheshangal Sreekandapuram City Special populated with local officials and politicians as well as members of the public The first information report FIR registered at Sreekandapuram police station under section of the Indian Penal Code IPC provocation with an intent to riot said The accused has shared this post with a malicious intention to create riot and law and order issue in the locality A bailable offence Javid was released in two hours of furnishing two bail bonds There is nothing harmful against any community a political group or even the police Lali P M told Article I was criticising the media for not paying enough heed to the issue The police action seems like an attempt to intimidate a particular community to silence them Although the ruling parties in the state including the Communist Party of India Marxist CPI M and Communist Party of India CPI are nationally known for their position for secularism and against the right wing movement in the country there is growing criticism here and here that the ruling alliance of the Left in Kerala led by CPI M s Pinarayi Vijayan is pandering to Hindu right wing forces and Hindu sentiments Source
