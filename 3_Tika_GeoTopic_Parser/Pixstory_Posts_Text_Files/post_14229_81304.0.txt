COMMON DENOMINATOR - Juventus extended their unbeaten run in Serie A to 11 matches as Atalanta and Juventus drew the seventh of their last 11 Serie A games.

HEADS UP - Danilo’s goal was only the second scored from a header against Atalanta this campaign. Meanwhile, Juventus conceded a Serie A goal 383 minutes of play after the previous one (Roma’s Lorenzo Pellegrini in January, also from a free kick).

TWIST OF FATE - Danilo’s goal scored after 91 minutes and 37 seconds of play, thanks to a Paulo Dybala assist, is the latest netted in Serie A by Juve since Dybala's goal against Udinese in January 2021 (92'50"), when Danilo delivered the assist.

DOUBLE CENTURY - Paulo Dybala has now played 200 Serie A games with Juventus, more than any other Bianconeri player since he joined the team in season 2015/2016.

FIRST IN THE CLASS - Dusan Vlahovic is the first forward born since 1 January 2000 to have played 100 games in Serie A. His seven shots against Atalanta was his joint-most in a Serie A game (seven also against Salernitana last December).
