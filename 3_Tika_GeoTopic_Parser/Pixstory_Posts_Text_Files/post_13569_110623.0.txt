A poll by the Gallup Institute shows that the concern and sadness of the Afghan people reached an unprecedented level in year 6.

According to the poll, 5 % of Afghans were concerned and the other 5 percent were mental stress.
Gallup says no other country has been so worried about the institute's polls during the five years of polls.

Gallup said that 5 percent of the Afghan people felt sadness during the year of Taliban power.
According to the report, the people of Afghanistan had the highest negative in the negative experience index in the year 2, with a score of 2.

The institution said that Afghan citizens have had the least positive feeling since the beginning of the year.
The Gallup survey found that the positive experiences of Afghans before the Taliban's domination of Afghanistan were limited, but that feeling disappeared in year 6.

The percentage of Afghans who said they feel fun, laugh, learn something interesting, or feel good about the day before, all declined.
In a poll of the year, the institution, which has been conducted in five countries, was asked whether they had five different negative experiences before the poll.

Studying this institution in the negative experience index shows that the people of the world feel less positive than the previous year.
Four in every ten people were concerned about the year.Â In Afghanistan, eight out of every ten people had this feeling.
