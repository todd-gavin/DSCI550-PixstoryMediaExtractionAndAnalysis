Are you worried about weight gain in pregnancy ?? 

Weight gain in pregnancy is both normal and unavoidable ! READ THAT AGAIN ! âœ¨ðŸ¤°

If you think that you are the only woman to fasten her jeans with a hair bobble or to cry on your bedroom floor because nothing fots anymore , then think again ! I think we need to be really pragmatic when it comes to weight gain in pregnancy , because whilst it is normal it is not an excuse to eat for 2 ! In fact energy needs do not massively change in the first 6 months of pregnancy and increase only slightly in the last 3 months ( and then only by around 200/300 calories per day ) ! âœ…

There are many factors that affect the weight you gain during pregnancy . Let's discuss some ; 

1 Pre - pregnancy weight 
2 nutrition 
3 Physical activities
4 Medical conditions

We also need to remember that this weight gain is not exclusively fat gain . Do you know ? Your circulating volume increases by nearly 50 percent . All these factors contribute to Weight gain ! Unfortunately there is no recognised normal value for weight gain in pregnancy . 

Always bear in mind that excessive weight loss or weight gain in pregnancy can cause complications and as such should be discussed with your doctor .
