Ustad Bismillah Khan was indeed a gem that India is proud of. This shehnai maestro of India earned the Bharat Ratna in 2001. He had earlier been awarded the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan. He was thus the recipient of all the top-four civilian awards.

Bismillah Khan (born Qamaruddin Khan, 21 March 1916 â€“ 21 August 2006), often referred to by the title Ustad, was an Indian musician credited with popularizing the shehnai, a reeded woodwind instrument. 

The shehnai had long held importance as a folk instrument played mainly schooled in traditional ceremonies, Khan is credited with elevating its status and bringing it to the concert stage.
