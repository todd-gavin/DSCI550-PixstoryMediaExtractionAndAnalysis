Rennes will be hosting their guest Nantes at Roazhon Park on Sunday afternoon. 
Rennes endured a shaky start in the season but they have come back strongly in the past few games.
A shrewd approach in defence has certainly carried Rennes so far this season. There are only three teams in the division who have conceded fewer goals than Rennes so far. Rennes beat Strasbourg in their last league outing by 3-1 after which they carried on their form and beat Dynamo Kyiv by 2-1 in the UEFA Europa league in midweek. 
Meanwhile Nantes have just one win from their opening nine games in the league this season. This form has seen Nantes fall down the table, with only one point restricting them from the relegation zone.
Their only win of the season so far came against Toulouse which came in late August and five matches have been played in the league since Nantes last took three points by winning. They lost 4-1 to Monaco in their last game and were already four goals down when they scored their first goal of the match.

Match prediction - Rennes 2-1 Nantes
