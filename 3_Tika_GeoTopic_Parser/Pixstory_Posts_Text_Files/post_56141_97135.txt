 Animal rights are not a joke This applies to all animals There shouldn t be a distinction between certain animals we care about For example most people don t care if a pig is used for animal testing but care if a dog or a rabbit is used It was estimated in that the annual use of vertebrate animals from zebrafish to non human primates ranges from tens to over million In the European Union vertebrate species represent of animals used in research and million animals were used there in By one estimate the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in was million In it was reported that mammals mice and rats fish amphibians and reptiles together accounted for over of research animals Many animals are caught by dealers it is a business for many to sell animals in auctions for research PETA and BUAV questioned the need for and legitimacy of animal testing They argued that it is cruel and poorly regulated that some of the tests are outdated that the costs outweigh the benefits or that animals have the basic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation Organ chips are an alternative here The chips can be used instead of animals in vitro disease research drug testing and toxicity testing Researchers have also begun using D bioprinters to create human tissues for in vitro testing Mostly euthanasia is done for the animals tested in labs Trust me the suffering pain and death of animals are not worth the possible human benefits This test is intensely painful for the animal and blindness scarring and death are generally the results
