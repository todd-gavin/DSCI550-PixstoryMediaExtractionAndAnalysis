I would agree with the point that some games still target or discriminate against women but despite this the video gaming platform is changing There are wide varieties in video gaming that portray a strong woman character who is the game s protagonist Female game designers are getting opportunities to create a positive image of a woman that eradicates the stereotypes associated with gaming characters Some games avoid the cliches of showing a male protagonist who would protect or shield his princess and become a so called hero of the game Instead like the match Lola Afterparty portrays Lola as a sharp witted woman who fights for justice and showcases a strong female gaming character With the changing time and new opportunities given to women game creators and designers females fair representation and inclusion can be seen They take care of what they design and bring to life There s a vast body of work primarily by independent creators including positive complex and exciting depictions of women games by developers and designers such as Christine Love Lea Sch nfelder Bahiyya Khan and Jenny Jiao Hsia for example For people interested in supporting work by and about women who do not adhere to sexist stereotypes
