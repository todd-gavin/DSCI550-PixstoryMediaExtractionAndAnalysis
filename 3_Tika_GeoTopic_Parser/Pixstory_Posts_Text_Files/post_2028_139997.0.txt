Myles and Damien Sanderson, two Canadian brothers, are now dead following a stabbing spree that they caused which left 10 people dead. Damien Sanderson reportedly killer himself while Myles Sanderson died from “medical distress.” In a country with relatively few mass killings, this came to a surprise to many and has since made the round across the globe.

In addition to the 10 that were killed, approximately 18 were injured. The stabbings occurred across a total of 13 different crime scenes.  According to reports, Myles was recently granted parole by a parole board for a sentence of assault and robbery. In fact, the assault charge included a stabbing of a woman who he killed during his stabbing spree.

This is a tragic story yet hopefully the actions of these two insane brothers will not because for Canadian politicians to restrict freedoms like weapon ownership from private individuals. This was clearly an isolated incident and obviously it’s not indicative of the bloodthirsty nature of Canadians which, based on their homicide rates, does not seem to be the case at all.
