I hate small talk...

I wanna talk about good,evil,aliens,sex,magic,intellect,music, the meaning of life,far away galaxies,the lies you've told,your flaws,your favorite scents,your childhood,what keeps you up at night,your insecurity and fears...

I like people with depth,who speak with emotion from a twisted mind... 

The ability to just sit and talk, a deeper conversation, where words are not scarce, not intermingled, not hidden... Where talks are in paragraphs - honest, vulnerable and weird...It's a different kind of intimacy... 

I don't care about the weather and you don't care how my job is going... 

Getting into meaningful conversation is an investment and it's priceless...

I don't want to know " what's up"..
It is what it is.
