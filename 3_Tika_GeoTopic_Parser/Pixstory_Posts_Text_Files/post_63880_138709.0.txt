Developer Naughty Dog are bringing their acclaimed 2013 post-apocalyptic action adventure game The Last Of Us- Part 1 to PS5. A remake, the game will be built from the ground up using PS5 engine technology.  With this, players can expect more advanced lighting, atmosphere, a more detailed presentation of environment with a creative reimagining of various familiar places.
 
From the much-improved lighting and physics systems, the 3D audio that simply makes the world come alive with every blood-curdling scream of the infected, to the tremendous facial animations of each and every character, it becomes clearer why Naughty Dog was adamant about going down this route instead of an intensive overhaul of its systems or general gameplay.
 
 Subtle changes in body language and facial expressions will added to the graphical rendering to make it a more immersive experience. Additionally companion AI has been greatly improved.
 Co-President Neil Druckman of developers Naughty Dog stated that the gameplay and presentation enhancements will bring the remake closer to their original vision, with The Last of US Part I having render options of 4K at targeted 30 FPS or dynamic 4K at targeted 60 FPS. The elephant in the room is its price tag going up to $70 USD.
Rebuilt from the ground up, the remake has seen improvements to character models, visual fidelity, textures, denser physics that show environmental bullet damage, better animations and cinematic transitions, as well as better AI on enemies and NPCs. Released on September 2 The Last of US Part I will also include some new modes, including a permadeath mode and a speedrun-focused mode, as well as the inclusion of original DLC Left Behind.
