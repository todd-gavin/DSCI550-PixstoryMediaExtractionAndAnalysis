Divock Origi has told Liverpool that he believes it is time for him to leave, and 90min knows that he is in talks with both AC Milan and Inter about a free transfer.

Origi is a vital squad player under Jurgen Klopp, but he has only played 71 minutes of Premier League action in five substitute appearances this season, with Luis Diaz's January arrival moving him further down the forwards pecking order.

With his contract expiring at the end of the season, sources told 90min that Liverpool were willing to offer Origi a new deal, but the Belgian has stated that he is ready to go on and pursue more first-team opportunities.

Origi has not started a league game for Liverpool since the 2016/17 season, starting just two last year and seven this season.

With a place in Belgium's World Cup team up for grabs in 2022, Origi is well aware that he needs to be playing more regularly, and a number of clubs from across Europe have approached him about a possible transfer.

As things stand, AC Milan appears to be the frontrunners, but Inter Milan and teams from Spain and Germany have also contacted Origi's representation.

Origi has also piqued the curiosity of a number of other Premier League clubs, but it appears that he will seek a fresh challenge and work abroad.

The 26-year-old has become something of a cult legend at Liverpool after scoring a number of crucial goals from the bench during his stint with the club. Origi scored the fourth and deciding goal in the Champions League semi-finals against Barcelona in 2019, before going on to score the second goal in the final against Tottenham in Madrid.

Origi also benefited from a glaring Jordan Pickford blunder in stoppage time to give Liverpool the Merseyside derby victory over Everton, which triggered wild celebrations around Anfield and memorably led to Jurgen Klopp storming onto the pitch to embrace goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
