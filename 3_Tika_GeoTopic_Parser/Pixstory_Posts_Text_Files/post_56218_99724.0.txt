As a reaction to the raging war UK has announced numerous sanctions on Russia and Belarus- targeting £1.7bn of trade.

New import tariffs will apply to goods including platinum and palladium, said the Department of International Trade. Export bans will aim at chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. It takes the value of products subject to UK sanctions to more than £4bn.

The new import tariffs will cover £1.4bn of goods while the calculated export bans are intended to impact products worth more than £250m in sectors of the Russian economy most dependent on UK goods.

As per BBC News, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: "We are determined to do our utmost to thwart Putin's aims in Ukraine and undermine his illegal invasion, which has seen barbaric acts perpetrated against the Ukrainian people.

"This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine."

Most of the goods excluding gold and energy have been put on the full or partial ban by the UK. The UK has also excluded key Russian banks from the UK financial system, frozen the assets of all Russian banks, blocked Russian firms from borrowing money, and placed limits on deposits Russians can make at UK banks. Other sanctions have been enforced by the US and the EU.

And more than 1,000 international companies have either suspended trading in Russi, or withdrawn altogether - including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.
