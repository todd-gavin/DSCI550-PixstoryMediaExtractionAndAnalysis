The majestic Camp Nou in Barcelona has the slogan "More than a Club" emblazoned over the sides in sizable yellow writing.
The football squad La Blaugrana is not your typical football team. They are aware of this, as are their adversaries and everyone else on earth. The feeling of belonging and family that permeates the stadium can be partially 
attributable to the huge proportion of La Masia grads who have helmed Bar√ßa teams throughout the years.
Since its inception in 1979, La Masia, or "The Farmhouse," has produced several players who have gone on to play for Barcelona's first team. We celebrate it with a list of the top 5 players to emerge from their legendary youth system.
1 Carlos Puyol
Carles Puyol, the contemporary Barcelona team's club captain, joined La Masia when he was just 17 years old and went on to become one of the best central defenders in club history. Although the defender stood out on the field due to his stringy hair and even scruffier playing style, it was his heroic efforts that won the most praise.
The now-35-year-old has won six La Liga championships, three European Cups, two European Championships, and a World Cup for Spain during his 15 years with the first squad. The Spanish national was a rare variety from plenty of everyone around him, but his skill set was just as crucial as Xavi and company's deft passing. He was known for his unwavering dedication and daring attitude.
