THE CLAIM: Because of Jimmy Page's obsession with Aleister Crowley, rumours circulated that he and Satan were close; another myth stated that the members of Led Zeppelin had formed a Faustian deal in exchange for fame. Spooky! But, how much of this claim holds the truth?

THE FACT: The first significant insight into Page's integration of Satanism and music came in Led Zeppelin's renowned 1970 track, 'Stairway To Heaven,' which borrowed a hidden satanic message, according to sum. When played backwards, the song is said to feature the verse, “Oh, here’s to my sweet Satan, The one whose little path made me sad, Whose power is Satan. He’ll give those with him 666, There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, Sad Satan.”
Although Page believed in Crowley's notion of personal emancipation, there is no indication that he was a Satanist. (In the run-off groove of the initial vinyl releases of Led Zeppelin III, he had Crowley's dictum "Do what thou wilt" engraved.) Throughout Zeppelin's history, Page did little to dispel the claims, presumably recognising that they were good for business. "I don't really want to go on about my personal beliefs or my involvement in magic," he told a media outlet. "I'm not interested in turning
anybody on to anybody that I'm turned on to. If people want to find things, they find them themselves."
