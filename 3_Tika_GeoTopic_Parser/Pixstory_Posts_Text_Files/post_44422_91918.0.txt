The Premier league ladder intensifies as we move into the final few weeks of the season. As
is always the case, our eyes remain glued onto the Top 4. Liverpool-Man City this week will
in all likelihood decide the winner, but the race for 4th position will be decided by a stand-off
between two North London rivals with Chelsea essentially in the clear at 3rd.

The weekend more or less confirmed that Man United's dreams for Top 4 were more or less
over. West Ham too, were left heartbroken by Spurs last weekend. Antonio Conte's team
have been in excellent form lately, winning 5 of their last 6 premier league fixtures and
scoring an impressive 21 goals in the process. Their last defeat of course, coming at the
hands of Manchester United.

Arsenal have been in fine form too, winning 6 in 7 going down only to Liverpool. Now Mikel
Arteta's side haven't been all that free-scoring on the other side of town but they do tend to
be very economical, manage games with maturity and tenderness relatively well for a team
as young as theirs. The Gunners were up a slippery slope back in the middle of January,
when the actual fixture was supposed to be played.

The Premier league website this evening announced the renewed timings for the game.
Antonio Conte's men will welcome the Reds at 1945 hrs UK next Thursday. By then, both
teams will have played more games. Arteta's side face Crystal Palace and Brighton. Spurs
on the other hand play just Aston Villa, their date with Brighton comes right after the Derby.

By all means, this game will turn out to be a major deciding factor in how things end up come
the end of the season. As things stand, both Arsenal and Tottenham remain on the brink of
playing Champions League football next year. In doing so, both clubs will bridge huge gaps
between their last UCL outings and the next. But only one can do so.
