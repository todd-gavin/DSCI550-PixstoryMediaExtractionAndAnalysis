It is difficult to balance my job, personal life and work as the General Secretary of the All Assam Football Players’ Welfare Association. However, these challenges make my work more fulfilling.

As part of my work for the association, I have organised several fundraising charity matches with the help of professional and local football players. The funds raised contribute to local developmental causes and sports initiatives. I also guide budding footballers and mentor them to become successful professional players with my work at the association. I love seeing local talent thrive by giving them opportunities to grow in this field. 

Furthermore, the association’s charity work also helps me support the families of players who have passed. My duty as a footballer is to honour other players and value the work we do in this profession. It adds purpose to my cause to support those who need it the most. 

The image of football in this country is not as hyped as other sports like cricket. Every sports field deserves equal recognition and support from the country's people because we all collectively represent our country internationally regardless of the sports we play. I am hopeful for the future of football in India, and I am grateful to those who unconditionally support our profession. 

I am deeply humbled by the love and support I have received from my fans and the people of my country. I wish to grow more as a person and a football player to continue inspiring young footballers to engage in sports and never give up on their dreams. Since I have become a professional footballer, I plan to coach young talents into becoming professional players as well. 

This is my message to all young and aspiring footballers-

“We have come a long way and have made football a loved game in India. The country is working to develop the game of football. You have to actively seek out opportunities and work hard to continue the legacy we have built. Keep playing and keep winning.”
