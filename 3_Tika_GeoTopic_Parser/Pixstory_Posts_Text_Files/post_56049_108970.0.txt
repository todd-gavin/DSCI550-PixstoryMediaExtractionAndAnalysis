When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,
Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

– William Shakespeare


The poem is famous for its themes of hopelessness and love. The poem speaks about an unfortunate man, disheartened with the present state of his life. It also exemplifies the power and impact of true love. This poem is about a speaker, initially pessimistic about fate, but becomes delighted when he recalls his beloved. The poem begins with the portrayal of the speaker’s dissatisfaction and his lament over the miserable hardship of life. He curses his poor fate for his catastrophic condition. He feels abandoned and useless. He feels that even God is not replying to his calls. Also, he is envious of the successful and talented people around him. He wishes to be rich, satisfied, and fortunate like them but meets only failures and disappointments. After cursing his present sad state, he suddenly talks about a special person and his mood changes in a dramatic way. This thought of love provides him immense pleasure and removes his negative feelings. What, however, stays in the minds of the readers is the magical effect of love that eradicates his sadness and makes him feel special.
