There is a phobia emerging against Hindus Sikhs and Buddhists that the world must address India s UN envoy T S Tirumurti has said There are instances of followers of the three Indic faiths being targeted in the west But is the phenomenon comparable to Islamophobia Or is it just an expression of misplaced victimhood The envoy s remarks After people of Indian origin especially Sikhs had faced attacks in the US when they were mistaken for Muslims Indian students too have faced violence on campus Some Hindu groups have of late started campaigning against what they call Hinduphobia The FBI in its hate crime report gave a breakup of the attacks The ones against Hindus stand are paltry though incidents against Sikhs were higher at Compare that to incidents targeting Jews and against Muslims Meanwhile anti Black hate crimes numbered and anti Asian Within India on the other hand the attacks against religious minorities and lower castes have been on the rise arguably since the BJP came to power in If that is the case why does India want its majority faith to feel victimized One reason could be the international backlash against the fiery speeches and even a call for genocide of India s Muslims by a self styled Hindu leader last month That prompted among others Human Rights Watch president Dr Gregory Stanton to tell a Congressional briefing at Washington DC on January that India could witness something like the Rwandan genocide something he had predicted if its government did not take stern action against those seeking to incite attacks on religious minorities Critics of the Hindutva ideology would argue that the advocates of ethnic nationalism in India would on one hand like to take pride in the assumption that Indians and Indian culture are hugely respected around the world and on the other hand out of a sort of envy they would also like to claim Hindus and Hinduism are under danger However Tirumurti s caution against new terminologies and false priorities that can dilute our focus deserves serious attention
