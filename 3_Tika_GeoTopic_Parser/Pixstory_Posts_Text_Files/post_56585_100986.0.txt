The Cannes Film Festival 2022 officially kicks off today. Held in Cannes, France, the annual event produces one of the glitziest red carpets in the world . A-list stars will travel over from Hollywood to climb the eventâ€™s signature red steps, rocking their best suits and gowns, which are often custom, haute couture, or fresh off the runway. After being canceled in 2020 due to the pandemic, Cannes came roaring back in full swing last year, and stars are clearly once again ready to channel some extremely-glamorous energy this year.
