A group of researchers from the IEO in collaboration with researchers from the IRCCS Foundation Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza of San Giovanni Rotondo has identified a succession of molecular mutations that appear to cause the progression of the most common ovarian cancer The biological data obtained from the strong therapeutic potential have recently been published in the International Journal of Cancer The study supported by the AIRC Foundation was coordinated by Ugo Cavallaro Director of the Oncological Gynecology Research Unit of the IEO To identify the trajectory of ovarian cancer we have thought of an innovative approach explains Cavallaro From the ovarian tumor of a single patient we have generated a series of experimental tumor models that each recapitulate a different step in the progression of the disease We have thus obtained the genomic profile of the DNA and transcriptomic profile of the RNA of the various models in order to obtain molecular signatures, i.e. sets of mutations or genes specifically associated with the different models Using this key we therefore interrogated the worldwide databases that contain the genetic data of numerous cohorts of patients with ovarian cancer By comparing our models with the data contained in these databases we discovered that the identified molecular signatures have prognostic power or they give indications on the biological process of evolution of the disease Not only do they also seem to have predictive capacity, i.e. they can give indications on the efficacy of treatments In other words, the molecular signatures obtained through different experimental models but deriving from a single tumor and therefore a single patient have provided clinical information also extendable to other patients that include the prognosis and the prediction of the response to chemotherapy We have also obtained very interesting data at least potentially from a therapeutic point of view, discovering a vulnerable point of ovarian cancer In summary we have outlined a workflow that through DNA analysis and RNA obtained models of molecular alterations important for the treatment of ovarian cancer as exemplified by the PIK R mutation and the consequent modified regulation of PI K. The alterations thus identified with our approach could become targets of targeted drugs to offer new therapeutic options also for this female tumor is so fearsome and insidious concludes Cavallaro
