How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning was one of the most outstanding poets of the Victorian era. She was born in County Durham, England in 1806 and spent much of her childhood in Herefordshire, and although she obtained no formal education, she browse widely at home and was well-versed in the classics. She was afflicted by health problems and spent much of her life inside the family home, with her father unwilling to let her see many people.

 In the poem, the speaker is declaring her unending fascination for her beloved. She tells her lover just how deeply her love goes, and she also tells him how she loves him. She loves him with all of her beings, and she wishes God will grant her the ability to love him even after she has passed. Browning engages with themes of love/devotion and relationships. Death comes into the poem at the end as the speaker talks about the length and durability of their relationship. She wishes that God will allow her to love her partner even in death. It becomes clear at the end that her love is a spiritual one as much as it is a romantic one.
