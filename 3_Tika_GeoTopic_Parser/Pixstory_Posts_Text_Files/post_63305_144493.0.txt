If you're not hungry, should you eat?

5 questions to ask yourself!

1. Have I eaten enough today
(any skipped meals or snacks)?

Most people need 3 main meals and 1-3 snacks depending on individual needs. Sometimes it can be helpful to eat for practical reasons despite hunger cues not showing up.

2. Do I have reliable hunger and fullness cues?

If you often ignore sensations of hunger and
fullness, we can lose trust with body cues. In
times of stress, low mood or illness, these cues
may be less obvious. You may need to practice
reqular eating to re-establish these cues.

3. Am I feeling any strong emotions, and need to cope with these first before eating?

Emotional eating is 100% okay. However, it can
be an issue if food is the only way to cope with
difficult emotions.

4. Do I need to practice giving myself permission to eat and enjoy this food?

During the process of healing your relationship
with food, you may need to practice breaking
"food rules' or challenging 'good food, bad food' mentality.

5. What would I recommend to a friend?

This is a helpful question to determine whether
not eating comes from a place of restriction. If
we spoke to ourselves as we would a friend, our inner voice would be much kinder.
