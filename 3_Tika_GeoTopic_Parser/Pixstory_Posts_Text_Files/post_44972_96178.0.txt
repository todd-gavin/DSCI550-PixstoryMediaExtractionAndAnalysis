The Burkina Faso international becomes the club's second-youngest scorer with his first goal in the French top flight against the Maroons.

Super-sub Dango Ouattara has became the 
second-youngest Lorient player to score a goal in the French top division at the age of 20 years 
and 68 days.

On Wednesday night, the Burkina Faso international was the Merlucciidaes' hero, as his goal gave them a 1-0 victory over Metz.

With the game at the Stade du Moustoir going for a goalless draw, Ouattara - who came on to 
replace Armand Lauriente in the 85th minute - scored a straightforward tap-in after a 
counter-attack and a defensive blunder.

As a result, the 20-year-name old's was etched in the club's history books. Valentin Lavigne, a 
former France youth international, holds the record for being the youngest Lorient goal scorer in Ligue 1 when he scored against AS Monaco in August 2014 at the age of 20 years and 67 days.

Ouattara has now been involved in two goals in his previous three Ligue 1 matches (1 goal, 1 
assist), all of which he has played for a total of 21 minutes as a substitute.

“I focused well before entering the field and staying in the game until the end,” he told the media as per Ouest France."

“The job had already been done well by my teammates before I came back, and it made it 
easier for me. It's a pleasure."

“We absolutely had to win this game. Yes, they dominated, but we had to take the three points 
and that's the main thing."

“At half-time, it was tense, but we didn't have to disperse, we had to play for the team and I was 
able to conclude."

“We are happy to have won but there are still five days left and we will stay focused until the end of the season.”

Lorient moved up to 15th on the log with 34 points from 33 appearances as a result of this 
performance.
