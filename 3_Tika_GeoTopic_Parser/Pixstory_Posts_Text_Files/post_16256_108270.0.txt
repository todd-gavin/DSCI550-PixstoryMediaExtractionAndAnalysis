Talking about superstar fathers, Ajay Devgn is another name that makes it to this list. The actor is a father to two children, Nysa, and Yug. Talking to Hindustan Times recently, Ajay shared that he talks a lot with his children. He further added that he wants them to be grounded, just like Kajol and him. “Me and Kajol explain to them what is right and wrong and allow them to imbibe things. Of course, they make mistakes, of course they disobey on occasion. When that happens, there are more conversations. Both Kajol and I are grounded as people despite our celebrity status. We want our children to be grounded too,” the actor said.
