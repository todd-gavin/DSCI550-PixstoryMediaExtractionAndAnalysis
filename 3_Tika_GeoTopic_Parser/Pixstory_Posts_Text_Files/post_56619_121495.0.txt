A strong day in the pool, on the mat, in the field on the court, on the track and through the air sees Australia end day five of the Commonwealth Games 20 medals clear at the top of the table.

Australia won 35 medals on day five in Birmingham — 11 gold, 12 silver and 12 bronze — in sports across the board from judo to lawn bowls.

The Australian team now has 106 medals (42 gold), followed by England in second on 86 medals, with 31 gold.

Emma McKeon won her 18th and 19th Commonwealth Games medals and her final individual race ended with bronze as she finished behind teen sensation Mollie O'Callaghan and teammate Shayna Jack in the 100m freestyle final.

McKeon added her fifth gold of the Games when she swam the final freestyle leg of the mixed 4x100m medley relay alongside Kaylee McKeown, Zac Stubblety-Cook and Matthew Temple.

Australia's women also swept the podium in the 800m freestyle — with Ariarne Titmus, Kiah Melverton and Lani Pallister.

There were 16 medals in total for Australian swimmers on the penultimate day of the program, but the team is well positioned as focus shifts towards track and field.

Nina Kennedy won Australia's first field medal of the Games with gold in the pole vault, after her bronze at the world championships last month.

The track team pulled their weight too, with 17-year-old Jaydon Page winning silver in the men's T45-47 100m, and Rhiannon Clarke finishing third in the women's T37/38 100m final.

There were also medals of every variety in 3x3 basketball, with Australia's men's and women's wheelchair sides winning gold and silver respectively, while the men's and women's 3x3 teams won silver and bronze respectively.

Fiji-born Eileen Cikamatana won gold in the women's 87kg weightlifting with a Games record snatch/clean-and-jerk total of 255 kilograms, why Chris Flavel and Damien Delgado took home silver in the men's B6-B8 pairs lawn bowls.
