The largest library in India is much more than a haunt for just book lovers. This place is also one of the most horror places in Kolkata. This treasure trove for bibliophiles attracts the lovers of ghost stories in equal numbers. 
The story of Lady Metcalfe's ghost haunting its corridors has been there for quite some time; a lot of testimonies support the story with people reporting the presence of someone simply watching them. 
Add to it the mystery of the hidden chamber that was discovered by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) in 2010, a chamber that is rumoured to have served as a torture chamber during the British rule in India. 
As per witness accounts, such paranormal experiences increased all the more after 12 labourers lost their lives in an accident during some renovation work at the site. Sounds like some grist for the rumour mill.
The place evokes such fear in people that even guards refuse to work here at night. Even librarians have claimed that their chairs were pulled away by some invisible force or books were strewn around, or pages torn away. If you are one of those who have loved ghost stories and like to read, then this is a must-visit place.
