Sahai responds to Jyoti s questions What are the ways in which the media can push towards more holistic representation And is there a way in which legal changes that have happened in the past few years help in doing this Edited in the Sahai s words The interest in trans people is only as recent as the NALSA judgment no one was interested in our stories with any dignity before the NALSA judgment In fact even today the NASLA judgment is more progressive than the laws that have come after And even today often we have to rely on the NALSA judgment to go to other parties so whether it s the medical curricula conversation whether it s NCERT all the time transgender people rely on to the Constitution has been ramificated in NASLA That I would say is the watershed moment in trans representation for sure where we moved from the language of LGBTQI marginalization to a more central conversation about our lives My only suggestion in terms of what I would like to see in terms of getting representation is to say that in every story that one does around people that one speaks to more than one kind of trans person I cannot emphasize enough that the conversation around trans people is dominated by metropolitan English speaking Savarna trans people If your article on trans people does not have three different kinds of trans people then know for a fact that your article is lacking really seriously in representing trans people Three is an arbitrary number What I really really like is for media houses to have reservations But we are not ready for that conversation here
