The ATLAS platform collects information on the molecular alterations that may be the target of specific drugs In this way oncologists will have access to useful information to better manage each patient By the end of the year it will involve over oncology centers present throughout the national territory As early as today about a third of lung cancers can be tackled with an approach in the context of precision medicine, i.e. researching molecular targets for which targeted drugs have been developed An important opportunity for patients because using specific drugs has led to superior efficacy of treatments and to better tolerability of treatments, guaranteeing long life expectancies for a disease that until years ago had a decidedly poor prognosis How can all patients be given the opportunity, regardless of where they live and where they are treated, to have access to innovative and effective therapies such as those with a molecular target Also thanks to a tool such as ATLAS, the first Italian database created by Medica Publishing and Scientific Diffusion under the patronage of WALCE Onlus which systematises the information relating to mutations involving molecular alterations which are positive predictive biomarkers of response to treatment in lung cancer A useful tool for healthcare professionals who can understand the clinical value of each single mutation and consequently for patients who can benefit from the most suitable treatments for their condition The world of precision oncology and molecular profiling is becoming increasingly enriching the rapidly growing amount of information to be managed with new data often in small subgroups of patients and not known to all oncologists especially if they are professionals not specifically dedicated to lung cancer A platform such as ATLAS which collects information on known and less well-known allows clinicians, pathologists and molecular biologists to access aggregate information provided by other Italian centers quickly and easily explains Silvia Novello full professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Turin and member of the scientific board of the platform
