Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) boss Christophe Galtier has provided an update on star Lionel Messi’s injury ahead of their clash with Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday (October 16) at the Parc des Princes Stadium.
The Argentine missed a couple of clashes last week due to a calf injury. As a result, the French side failed to win both games and managed to score only one goal combined.
The manager informed Messi has returned to training and did the whole session. However, a decision on his availability will be made on Saturday, with him being optimistic about the return.
"Leo trained this morning, normally with the group," he told reporters. "He did the whole session and then we will wait to see how he reacts to the session. And tomorrow morning, we will wait to see how he reacts to the session tomorrow. But at the moment I'm talking to you: yes, [I can count on Messi]."
The forward has been in incredible form this season after having difficulties in his first season in Paris. Messi has already accounted for eight goals and as many assists in 13 features across all competitions this season.
PSG will want to retain their top spot in the domestic points table when they take on their direct rival Marseille, who are just three points behind them.
Lionel Messi will play his last World Cup this year
The seven time Ballon d’Or winner has won every possible individual and team trophy in his career. Only a World Cup is missing from his glorious career and he will have a final shot at it this year.
Messi has already announced that the Qatar World Cup will be his last as he is already 35-years-old. It remains to be seen if he will finally get his hands on the prestigious trophy or not.
