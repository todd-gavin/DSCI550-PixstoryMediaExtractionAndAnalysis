 Goblin Slayer’s author, Kumo Kagyu, is starting a new manga series. The author is known for creating the popular light novel series as well as its two side-stories. Speaking of Goblin Slayer, it is still very much on the radar as following its 2020 anime film, Goblin Slayer is all set to get a second season by White Fox soon.
The official Twitter account for Square Enix’s Big Gangan magazine announced on Thursday that the Goblin Slayer author will launch a new manga titled Moscow 2160 in the magazine soon. Kotaro Sekine (Ninja Slayer Kills) will be handling the drawing manga, while  Goblin Slayer illustrator Noboru Kannatsuki is designing the characters.
The new manga series will also have a dark tone just like Kagyu’s previous work, as the story is described to be about a “dystopian cold war” set in Russia. The manga will be dealing with some heavy subject matter as it is going to serialize in the Big Gangan manga imprint, which carries seinen manga. From the looks of it, Kagyu’s new work will also appeal to Goblin Slayer fans.
Apart from the title and a basic setting, we don’t have any other details regarding Moscow 2160. We just know that it will deal with the themes of war and politics just like Goblin Slayer did, so when going in we can expect a lot of blood, gore, and other explicit material in this manga as well.
