Kim Taehyung, Lalisa and Park Bogum came to the Celine Fashion show on the idols from the biggest boy group (Bts)and biggest girl group (Blackpink) and Park Bogum of were together at the show. They rocked the show! This news took the world by storm. This is the collab many of the armyblinks like me wanted! They had a great time together. Lisa was caught dancing on the song Lalisa and V was vibing along. This is the second time Taehyung was with the pinks. He was with Jisoo at the MC. Most of the fans loved this interaction but many people are hating on them, If our idols are happy, let them be! They are enjoying. They are also humans. We need to stop fan wars. I hope that they will continue to have interactions like these in the future. ì‚¬ëž‘í•´ ðŸ’œ
