The intent of my post is not to dismiss the idea of self improvement through self help books at all In fact I think they can possibly end up being one of the great ways to get better in life However I do think some of the points you mentioned are not true While I agree dependency on self help books is similar to dependency on different stuffs like music and sport I do think there s a difference there Self help books talks about you You you and only you They force you to stay in a headspace that s only filled with you and nobody else When you read other genres of books for example romance or mystery you re following the story of someone else Other characters You can find a relatability in them You can put yourself in their position or you can wish you were in their position but in the end you re aware that they re just some characters that are not you They don t fool you into saying it ll change your life Same with music when you listen to music you re following the journey of someone else who you can find a connection with but nevertheless someone else Music doesn t promise you stability and wealth It s just an escape I m not opposed to reading self help books but I do think an addiction to them is not healthy It s a lot like drug addiction I believe all coping mechanisms are valid but there has to be a point where you stop
