But what I have observed mostly movies are incapable of justifying and defining the depth that a book offers Even if we take the best of the movies to look at some parts and points remain untouched in the movies And one more point to be put here is as the movie can reach a wider audience than a book then most people choose to watch a movie instead of reading the original work in this case if the movie is not made perfectly then the audience makes a biased view of that particular work and the quality of the original work is compromised That is the reason why I think not every book should be turned into a movie adaptation at least not the ones that might hurt the sentiments of the audience that has read the work already Some parts of the literature should be kept in their innate form without playing with them
