Kabul was not the sad capital of the world Kabul was a city of fresh and new love with imagination It was freshness the city was full of flowers the lush garden of thousands of hopes had blossomed City of Dreams City of Wishes City of Memories The city of untold stories The city was reaching peace Kabul a city full of languages smells of love and affection Now it has become a city of ruined dreams Everything is dead in it not even kisses and hugs if it is it is a crime Kabul is the graveyard of young dreams Because we grew old in our youth We have heard the history of this sad city from our mothers How bitter and sweet it was But these days its sufferings have increased Migration It means being a stranger to everything to everyone
