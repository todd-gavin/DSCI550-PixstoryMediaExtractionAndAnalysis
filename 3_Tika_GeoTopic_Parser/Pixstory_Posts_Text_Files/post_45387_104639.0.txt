Brighton midfielder Pascal Gross has signed a two-year contract extension to extend his stay at South Coast until 2024. The 30-year-old German fielder joined from Ingolstadt in 2017 and has made 170 appearances for the Seagulls, scoring 117 goals.

Brighton boss Graham Potter told the club website, “I am delighted for Pascal and the club that he has now signed. He has been a key player throughout the club’s time in the Premier League and for me during my time as head coach. He is an excellent professional off and on the pitch.”

“As one of our senior players in the dressing room, he is a great example to any young player and he showed again this season that he is an important member of the squad and key player for us on the pitch.”

Potter had revealed that Gross and Danny Welbeck were quite close to signing new contracts with the club. 

“Pascal and Danny are quite close, I think, to agreeing with everything for next year,” he said.

“I think it’s just a matter of time, a bit of formality, so that’s great.”

He ended the season in a rich vein of form, during which Graham Potter hailed him as a “Brighton legend in terms of the Premier League” and made it clear he would be staying at the Amex. His terrific performances include his goalscoring displays in a row, against Manchester United (4-0) and Hammers (3-1) in May. 

That was despite reported interest from Germany, notably Werder Bremen.


Gross was Brighton and Hove Albion’s first signing following promotion to the Premier League in 2017.
