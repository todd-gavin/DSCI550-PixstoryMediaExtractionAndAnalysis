Marvel Cinematic Universe has boasted some pretty amazing CGI especially in its earlier days during Phase to Phase While qualitatively the MCU construct has begun creatively collapsing during Phase when it comes to its CGI MCU be it in shows or movies has begun boasting some terrible CGI all the way back from Phase which ironically is only getting worse with time Some of the best examples of this are Iron Man s entirely digital nano tech suit from Avengers Infinity War or nbsp Mark Ruffalo wearing the Hulkbuster suit While the Iron Man suit in the earlier movies came off as something much better because Robert Downey Jr was wearing an actual suit around his body while in Infinity War it was basically full CGI same with the Hulkbuster where it looked like someone did a cheap cut copy paste of Mark Ruffalo s body over the Hulkbuster In MCU Phase it is very funny to say that the CGI has gotten way worse than before whether we look at Thor Love and Thunder Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness or She Hulk all of them are boasting VFX that are pretty garbage for their total budget So what is the reason for the deteriorating CGI in MCU Simple it is its extreme overuse CGI seems best when applied over real models and structures giving it proper shape whereas existing on its own it seems off and unable to fit inside the given structure It is funny that even though Marvel budget has increased a lot ever since the first Iron Man movie came out and even though movies such as Avengers Infinity War are incredible the CGI of the older movies seems far better transitioning from a more photo realistic focus to an all out computerized plastic feel to them CGI and VFX is meant to bring fantastical elements a real base but lately their incessant overuse has rendered MCU s once amazing CGI into something that turns every shot and video captured in camera into rubber and plastic
