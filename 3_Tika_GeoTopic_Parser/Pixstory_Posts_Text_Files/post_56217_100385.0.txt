Within a few hours of being erected at her home in Grantham, former PM Margaret Thatcher's statue was egged. A protester threw eggs at the £300,000 statue from behind a temporary fence which encircles the monument.

Previously the statue was turned down by Westminster 2018, amid fears of "civil disobedience and vandalism", then it was offered to Grantham.


However, a planned £100,000 unveiling ceremony enticed criticism in 2020 and when one Facebook group proposed an "egg-throwing contest" more than 13,000 people asserted interest.

The taxpayer-funded event was later abandoned by the council and an official ceremony, funded through donations, will take place at a later date.

The statue, which was installed without ceremony on Sunday, towers over St Peter's Hill Green - close to the site of the grocer's shop owned by Baroness Thatcher's family.

The only previous memorial to her in the town was a plaque on the niche of North Parade and Broad Street to mark where she was born.

The Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), an educational charity which operates Grantham Museum, spent several years raising money for a permanent memorial to Baroness Thatcher.

Margret Thatcher was the longest-serving British Prime Minister. As prime minister, her policies were known as Thatcherism. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the "Iron Lady", a nickname that became correlated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.

Some people differ with her controversial withdrawal of Labour's Circular 10/65 which attempted to compel comprehensivisation, without going through a consultation process. She was highly criticised for the speed at which she carried this out. This remains in minds of people.
