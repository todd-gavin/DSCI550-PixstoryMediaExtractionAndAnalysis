The reviews are in and the love is pouring for The Batman. Matt Reeves is being hailed and almost every review coming in is praising this grounded realistic take on The Batman. Everyone is saying that the potential to overtake TDK trilogy is right there. Some criticism is that the movie might be too long and too long drawn. The actors are being praised a lot, Zoe Kravitz potrayal as Catwoman is being called the best to be done yet. Even Paul Dano's acting is being called the best in the movie. Some critics have went on to say that these two performances might be the best in the movie.

Coming to Robert Pattinson, he's only seen without the suit sometimes but his Batman is gritty, he's dark and insecure. He still hasn't perfected his personas we'll see him fail bur he'll also rise. He'll be the hope that Gotham needs. Gotham has been modelled after New York of 1970's but its different. Greg Fraiser has done a tremendous job as the cinematographer, many people have been awestruck with the visuals in the movie. Michael Giacchino has done a perfect job with the score of the movie.

All things said and done, Reeves has done what he set out to do, he's show. why Batman is the world's greatest detective. This isn't just a comic book adaptation, its a noir movie at the forefront. Robert Pattinson is Vengeance and we're all set for a treat so don't miss out watching this instant classic!
