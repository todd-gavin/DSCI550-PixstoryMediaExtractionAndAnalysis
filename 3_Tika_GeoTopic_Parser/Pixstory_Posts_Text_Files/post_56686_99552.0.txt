Canberra Blues Society presents Owen Campbell & The Cosmic People with special guest support The SunBears.

Owen is coming home to Canberra with the full band to launch his new LIVE ALBUM.

Owen Campbell & The Cosmic People are alternative blues and soulful cosmic rock at its best. They bring a thumping oceanic-like repertoire to their performance with smouldering guitar work running from bluesy riffs and soulful finger-picking to lap steel guitar solos using a shot glass slide, and gritty caramel vocals and a driving rhythm section.

After 3 best-selling studio albums, 2 EP’s and over 12 years of national and international touring, Owen Campbell has cemented himself as one of Australia’s premier alternative blues/rock exports. He has performed in many corners of the world from the USA, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Spain, Holland, Japan, Hong Kong, India and even performed at the highest Blues festival in the world, The Himalayan Blues Festival in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Every album upon release has hit the Top 10 on iTunes Blues Charts in over 10 countries. One of which “Sunshine Road” reached No.1 on the overall charts (Australia), knocking Adele of the top spot in 2014.
