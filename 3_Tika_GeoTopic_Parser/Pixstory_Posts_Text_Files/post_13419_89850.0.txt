The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Norway and the High Representative of the European Union issued a joint statement condemning the Taliban's decision not to reopen girls' schools. The statement said the Taliban's move violates the group's commitment to the international community.

The Taliban announced on Wednesday that three girls' schools would remain closed until further notice.

A joint statement posted on the Italian Foreign Ministry's website stressed that "the Taliban must immediately reverse their decision because its effects go far beyond the harm that Afghan girls suffer."

The decision came as the international community backed teachers and the education sector over the past seven months in hopes of reopening schools, the statement said.

The statement warned that the continued closure of girls' schools would inevitably have an impact on the Taliban's prospect of gaining political support and legitimacy at home and abroad.

The Taliban have not yet commented on the date of the reopening of the girls' schools and have only said that they are waiting for the girls to design clothes according to Islamic law.
