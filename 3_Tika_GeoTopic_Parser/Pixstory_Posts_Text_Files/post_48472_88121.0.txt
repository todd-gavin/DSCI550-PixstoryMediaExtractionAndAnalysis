In order to better understand the basic, underpinning truths of God's Word, we must engage in gospel exchanges with non-Christians. The character of God, his holiness and anger, man's creation in God's image, sin, grace, Christ's cross, and judgment are all brought into vivid perspective. We must consider how to explain these principles to various people in various situations. We also gain a clearer understanding of how these truths connect all of Scripture, from Genesis to Revelation.

Philemon 1:6: "I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full awareness of what we have in Christ," is one of the clearest texts on the discipleship benefits of evangelism.

There's a big difference between knowing something and communicating it to someone who doesn't get it or doesn't believe it. As we express these precious truths to others, they become clearer to ourselves.

Evangelism broadens our comprehension of the Bible's most essential truths.
