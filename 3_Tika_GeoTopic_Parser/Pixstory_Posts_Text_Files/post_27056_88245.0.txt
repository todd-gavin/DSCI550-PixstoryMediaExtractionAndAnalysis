During an interview with the New York Time, Daniel Radcliffe was asked whether or not he'd be interested in returning to the Harry Potter universe for a "Cursed Child" adaptation, to which he said the following:

This isn't the answer that anybody's going to want, but I think I was so able to go back and enjoy it because it's not a part of my day-to-day life anymore. I'm getting to a point where I feel like I made it out of Potter okay and I'm really happy with where I am now, and to go back would be such a massive change to my life. I'm never going to say never, but the Star Wars guys had like 30, 40 years before they went back. For me, it's only been 10. It's not something I'm really interested in doing right now.
