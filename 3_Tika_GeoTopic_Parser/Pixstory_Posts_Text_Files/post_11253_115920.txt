According to a recent examination of the personality characteristic grit individuals with greater levels of this quality also exhibited altered patterns of cognitive function but not necessarily improved cognitive function These results were recently published in the open access journal PLOS ONE by Nuria Aguerre of the University of Granada Spain and associates A person with grit is someone who perseveres admirably in the face of obstacles to achieve long term objectives The Grit Scale is a commonly used assessment instrument by researchers to quantify it No studies have specifically looked at the connection between grit and specific components of cognitive functioning despite earlier research suggesting such a connection Aguerre and colleagues asked research participants to fill out questionnaires including the Grit Scale which assesses personality traits based on three characteristics grit impulsiveness and mindfulness Four additional experimental computer based tasks were also completed by the participants to assess various aspects of cognitive ability such as flexibility inhibition the capacity to replace outdated items in one s working memory which temporarily stores information with more recent relevant ones and the tendency for control mode Contrary to the researchers expectations a statistical examination of the experimental and questionnaire data showed that grit scores were not always correlated with overall cognitive ability In contrast grit was statistically associated with the personality qualities of low impulsivity and high mindfulness both of which are connected to self regulation This finding is consistent with previous studies However albeit to a lesser statistical extent participants high in grit did show different patterns of cognitive performance The researchers characterized this cognitive profile as showing cautious control an enhanced ability to pay attention to all available information and remain sensitive to conflicting information in the present moment while relying less on earlier information Overall these findings suggest that different patterns of cognitive ability not necessarily greater ability may underlie grit This is in line with other researchers previously proposed ideas Sources
