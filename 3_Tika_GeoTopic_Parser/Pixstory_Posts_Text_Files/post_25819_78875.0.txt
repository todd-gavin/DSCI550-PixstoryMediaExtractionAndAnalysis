Veganism is a lifestyle practised to abstain from the use of animal products and byproducts in diet, clothing, cosmetics, and skincare.
The vegan lifestyle is gaining popularity these days and the plant-based diet has been approved by American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. One considers that veganism is practised only to prevent the exploitation of animals. That is the larger idea but it does not end there. A vegan lifestyle has way more benefits than you realise. Going vegan even helps to protect the environment and reduce the carbon footprint.
A plant-based rich diet is extremely healthy and suitable for all age groups.
Do you think vegetarianism and veganism are the same?
Well, they arenâ€™t.
