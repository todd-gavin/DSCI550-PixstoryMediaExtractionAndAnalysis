Jadon Sancho - 2
Lost possession of the ball many times which lead to City's counter attacks on a number of occasions. 
Marcus Rashford - 1
Failed to make his presence in front of City's box and in their half of play. Failed to have a sight of the goal even once.
Bruno Fernandez - 2
Was totally bamboozled with or without the ball. Was booked for yelling at the referee and was totally outshined by De Bruyne on the opponent's side.
Fred - 4
Came in and set up United's second goal as his shot was turned in by Martial on the rebound.
Anthony Martial - 6
Found the back of the net after a long period of time and followed it up with a composed penalty in stoppage time.
Manchester City:-
Ederson - 6
Was impactful in terms of punching away or preventing some successful looking crosses from United's players. Failed to prevent two late goals due to erroneous defending from his mates though.
Kyle Walker - 7
Brilliantly resisted United's attacks and has the upper hand in terms of preventing Rashford an opportunity to have a sight of the goal via a run early on.
Manuel Akanki - 7
Proved to be highly effective with the ball. Beat the press and brilliantly fit into the back 4 of his team's line up.
Nathan Ake - 7
Helped to set up the counter attacking runs with brilliant passing and beating the press from the opponents.
Joao Cancelo - 6.5
Was equally effective both in the defense and also creating chances for the attackers up front. Gave away a late penalty to help United score a third goal.
Kevin De Bruyne - 7.5
Hardly wasted any balls and made great use of the posession. Provided a beautiful through ball to Haaland for his brace and finished with a couple of assists.
