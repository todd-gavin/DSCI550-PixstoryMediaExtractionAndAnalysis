Circles ⭕ in my painting represent resolve, which I could not find in situations and life events happened post Covid-19 . It gives me the control which I need when I had none. Don’t we all want to feel centered within ourselves, something that anchor us, and we don’t fall apart. Small circles represent cohesiveness among people that we all are interconnected in pain and what we faced we faced it all together and none of us is alone ..⏳⌛
