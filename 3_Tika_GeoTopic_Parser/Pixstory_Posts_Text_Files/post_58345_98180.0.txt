The Charming glow , the smile wears
Still have a lot of fears
Trying to learn to let these fears go
Let the world know, that I am bold
The clear vision is what I need to have
The confusion is what I need to extract
Addition and extraction of the right things 
Is the mathematics we should learn and teach
Like addition of food, tea and sweet
And extraction of fear , negativity and grief 
Want to do something to make my parents proud 
Something they can say aloud 
Want to be rude but I am too nice, dude
Niceness is at its place but it's about my savage attitude
The sarcasm I have , the sarcasm I use 
Is the only escape in this world's loop
Creating something feels so good
Writing something spontaneously is a mood
What more I love ,is to teach
Cause teaching is a good deed 
Everybody's welcome to me 
But not their negative energies
Music is everyone's peace and love , for me it's too
As it defines me and you
Limitlessness in me comes from the love of Sky 
It keeps my siprit high
The people I love is all what I need 
Their smiles are my happiness's key.
