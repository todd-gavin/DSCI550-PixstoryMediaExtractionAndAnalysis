Prime Minister of Kashmir continues I held a Cabinet meeting and discussed with the Ministers the different problems that were waiting decision A press conference was held which a large number of representatives of different papers attended They had tea with me and asked me a number of questions about the policy that I intended to pursue I had a pleasant and interesting time with the representatives of the press It began with a statement which I made to the correspondents At the invitation of His Highness the Maharaja Bahadur of Jammu and Kashmir I am assuming charge of the office of Prime Minister at a moment when the State is on the chessboard of power politics I am here in a spirit of loyal service to the ruler and his people I am optimistic enough to say that in the dominions of His Highness the East and the West Punjabs will once again meet as friends and I come with an open mind and have no rigid political creed and theories am satisfied that constructive work for one s country irrespective of ideologies is what is needed most at the present moment I do believe that the Government of His Highness must be so run that it takes its decisions with the co operation and the consent of the people s representatives and is ultimately responsible not only to His Highness but also to his people I have no doubt in my mind that the people of the State are genuinely loyal to the person of His Highness and he is loved by them all and they regard him as a ruler with progressive ideas I would like to mention that in the discharge of my duties as Prime Minister I shall not be guided by any communal considerations whatsoever I feel that religion and politics are dangerous bed follows That it is so has been proved by the events of the last few months across the borders of the State Those who wish to carve a communal state in the dominions of Maharaja Bahadur will find no quarter from me To be continued
