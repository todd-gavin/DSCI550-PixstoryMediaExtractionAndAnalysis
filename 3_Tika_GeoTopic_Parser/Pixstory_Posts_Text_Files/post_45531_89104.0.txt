Harvey Elliott, a Liverpool youngster, has named Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold as two players with whom he enjoys playing. It's a "dream" for the 18-year-old midfielder.

Harvey Elliott was mentioned on the UMM YouTube channel (through Team Talk) as saying:
“Mo Salah is the best player in the world in my opinion. Who wouldn’t love playing with Mo Salah! Alongside Trent as well on the right side, it’s a dream for any youngster, yeah, to play alongside those two.”

Two of Liverpool's most crucial players this season have been Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Salah has scored the most goals for the Reds this season, while Trent Alexander-Arnold has provided the most assists. In the Premier League, they are also at the top of their respective standings.

In all competitions, Mohamed Salah has scored 28 goals and supplied 10 assists, while Alexander-Arnold has two goals and 17 assists.
Liverpool's style of play under Jurgen Klopp is such that full-backs are expected to assist the attackers and support the attack. Andy Robertson, the left-back, has also racked up 13 assists so far this season.

Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp has gradually introduced Harvey Elliott into the Liverpool first squad. The 18-year-old midfielder made his Premier League debut in the opening four games of the season before sustaining an ankle injury that kept him out for nearly four months.

Elliott has only scored one goal in ten appearances for the Reds so far this season. In the fourth round of the FA Cup, he scored a fantastic volley on the turn against Cardiff City.

Elliott also played in last month's Carabao Cup final against Chelsea, scoring in a penalty shootout victory at Wembley Stadium.
