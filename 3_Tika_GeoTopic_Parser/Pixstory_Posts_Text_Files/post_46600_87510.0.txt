Although the Gun Control Act laid the groundwork for subsequent gun control laws, the law's limited effectiveness was highlighted by varied licencing methods and insufficient enforcement of its requirements. Rather than stopping ineligible people from obtaining a handgun, the law proved to be more effective at punishing those who already possessed one. 

Furthermore, Gale Journals tell us that in the event of an illicit exchange, legally the law held the gun purchaser more responsible than the gun seller. The Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) relaxed several of the Gun Control Act's prohibitions. Supporters of gun rights applauded the law for removing limits on where and how firearms might be sold, but they remained opposed to an amendment that prohibited the development of machine guns for civilian use. 

Due to a lack of agreement on gun regulation, there are a plethora of state and local laws governing handgun licencing and registration. A permit or licence is necessary to acquire a gun in California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, for example. The laws governing the ability to carry a concealed firearm differ from state to state. A licenced individual may carry a concealed handgun in public in Illinois and Utah, for example, whereas several states, like Alaska and Vermont, allow individuals to carry guns without license.

Personally, I think that gun control laws should be made stricter. The current legislature does not only have many loopholes but is also not uniform. According to me, when it a question of safety of citizens of our country, the law should be iron clad. 

Moreover, recent events have taught us that more often than not the victims of lenient gun control laws are children. This makes me think, what is the actual cost of life in our country and will Biden be truly better than Trump in this aspect?
