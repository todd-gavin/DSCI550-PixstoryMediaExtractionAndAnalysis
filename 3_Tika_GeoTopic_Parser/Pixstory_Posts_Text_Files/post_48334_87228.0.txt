There are no two ways to state this fact: The root of all anti abortion laws is misogyny. It is a plain desire to establish control, rather dominance over the bodies of women hiding behind a facade of “right to life”. 

The main argument of people who are anti abortion is that abortion constitutes as “murder”. It is ironic how our lawmakers claim to care so much about unborn babies but this regard goes out the window when it comes to children in foster homes who are growing up in sub par conditions. 

We have to realise that banning abortion will not ensure that abortions will not happen, it will just make sure that SAFE ABORTIONS do that happen. 

There have been instances where women have resorted to extreme measures like throwing themselves down the stairs, using court hangers and taking drugs to get rid of the foetus for various reasons. Some are rape victims, some are not physically capable of carrying a baby to term or raise a child, some are not financially stable and some simply don’t want to be mothers. 

It is high time we recognise the fact that women are not mere wombs put on this earth to reproduce. We are rational individuals and no other person has a right to decide what we do with our bodies. 

Men who claim to have a higher stake in this decision have to realise that it is not their body that will go through drastic changes physically and mentally. They are not the ones who will maybe go through post partum depression, body image issues, infection, excessive bleeding and what not. 

There is nothing wrong with wanting children but women don’t owe them to anyone. Men should rather focus on planning to have children with women who actually sign up for being pregnant. 

We have come a long way when it comes to women’s rights but we still have a long way to go. Abortion is healthcare and it is the fundamental right of women to have access to safe abortion.
