The majority of people mistakenly believe that there are numerous wildlife species in the globe, but in reality, their numbers are declining, and if nothing is done to stop it, some of these species risk going extinct. Animals are constantly in danger of extinction, yet most people are unaware of this. A species' extinction due to an unnatural cause, for example humans, might upset the balance of the entire ecology, which would have a more significant effect than you might imagine. Each member of the wildlife was carefully chosen and used as an eco brigade soldier, contributing in some way to the survival of life on Earth. Therefore, protecting them is crucial for your own existence. It's kinda sad how we are so selfish as to not think about our own descendants. Our future generations need this planet to live on. In fact WE need this planet to live on. Previous generation has done enough damage and it is evident today. The unnatural – even though it's now – amount of flooding and natural disasters, the pandemic and what not. I believe that the future generations will loathe us for a variety of reasons, including the significant loss of species that they will never get to observe or learn about.
