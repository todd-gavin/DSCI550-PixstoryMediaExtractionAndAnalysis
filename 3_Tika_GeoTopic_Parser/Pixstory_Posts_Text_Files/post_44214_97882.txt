Stamford Bridge is a busy place right now Thomas Tuchel s blues sit rather comfortably in third place but their recent Premier League revelations have been more than disastrous Since last month s Champions League elimination the blues beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi final and scraped past West Ham United last week All their other games including Arsenal Manchester United and lately Everton have ended badly Reports coming out of central London claim English midfielder Mason Mount could be one of the players to leave the club at the end of the season With sanctions being placed on Roman Abramovich s club last month anything is possible in the months that lead up to the summer transfer market Antonio Rudiger s transfer to Real Madrid was confirmed just last week and Mason Mount looks to be on his way out now Although the report does not name any of the clubs involved one would think that Mount s name ignites the interest of some top European powerhouses The likes of Real Madrid and Manchester City have been said to be interested in right back Reece James and the report only confirms the same Mount has been at the club since the age of six rising through the ranks at Cobham s academy A move away would be presumably difficult to adjust for the Englishman likewise for James who has asserted himself as one of the best in his positions across the country Mount in particular sees his contract run down in another three seasons He remains one of the lower earners at Chelsea earning around per week These reports remain speculative but as with Rudiger it would surprise nobody if a top club simply came in and swooped another one of Chelsea s valuable gems
