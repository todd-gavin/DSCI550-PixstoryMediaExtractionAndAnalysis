By Kalim Ahmed On February Aam Aadmi Party AAP Goa shared a link to a YouTube video on their official Twitter handle The video was an hour long broadcast of a sting operation aired by a news channel called Hindi Khabar In the broadcast it is alleged that Congress and TMC candidates in Goa indulged in horse trading and discussed plans to change parties if need be post the election Link Congress Goa put out a statement on Twitter claiming the sting to be a conspiracy hatched by the BJP AAP duo Link In the context of these accusations made by both AAP and Congress on each other various screenshots of WhatsApp chats are being shared on social media by supporters of both parties In the screenshot shared by supporters of Congress it is being claimed that the sting operation is a deep fake video made by AAP Link While the screenshot shared by supporters of AAP suggests that the sting operation has rattled Goa Congress Link The screenshots of these WhatsApp chats are viral on Facebook Fake morphed chats We had a close look at these screenshots and observed a few anomalies The first screenshot which was shared by supporters of the Congress party has the following anomalies The names that are displayed on top of a WhatsApp group should have commas in between them but this one doesn t The pop up that tells the user that the chat is encrypted is completely wrong The screenshots shared by supporters of AAP also has some errors The names displayed on top of a WhatsApp group chat should appear alphabetically but here it doesn t Hasiba Amin comes after Dinesh Gundurao instead of Girish Chodankar The last name that is displayed on the top ends with two dots but in a genuine WhatsApp group chat it ends with three dots Based on all the observations that we have made it is safe to conclude that the chats shared by supporters of both parties are fake We suggest that our readers should check WhatsApp and make the observations themselves
