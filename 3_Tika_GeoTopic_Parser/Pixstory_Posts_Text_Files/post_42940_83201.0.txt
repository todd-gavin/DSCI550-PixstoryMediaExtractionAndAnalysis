Marvel’s latest in the list of TV shows partnered with Disney+ is Hawkeye. Starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld, the show follows the life of Kate Bishop portrayed by Hailee who is a Hawkeye fan girl after she saw him fight with mortal powers during Avenger’s battle against Loki in New York. 

Reeling from personal loss from the personal loss from the New York battle, Kate Bishop learns martial arts, archery and other fighting methods to protect her mother and herself keeping Hawkeye as her primary inspiration. 

On the other hand, Clint Barton the former avenger is making his way into the normal world after the events of Avengers Endgame and having lost his best friend in Black Widow in front of his eyes. He is again trying to be a family man before his past deeds as Ronin catch up with him. 

In our personal opinion, Hawkeye is simple and smooth. It is full of passion, warmth, comfort and action making it the most quintessential Marvel Show in the list. Jeremy and Hailee excel in their roles. 
For the comic book buffs, there are two surprise cameos which will make you get out of your chair and scream in happiness. 

All in all, Hawkeye serves as Marvel’s best winner in their quest for planting their strength into the world of Tv shows and is 
Highly recommended
