Compared to the past, human life has become more precious these days in the realm of the Emirate. The mother of a little girl, who in those days might have been taken for five hundred afghanis, is now being taken with a "difference of taste", with a "I do not like you to be like this" and with a "grammatical mistake". If a gunsmith thinks that lipstick, nail polish, and eyebrow creases are bad and he does not want anyone to cut a single strand of his hair against his will, he can legally shoot a woman in the heart right in front of two boys. Just a few days ago, in the Barchi plain, right in front of two boys, two bullets were fired at Zeinab's heart.

Zeinab Abdullahi was 26 years old and studied economics. He was engaged and was going to get married soon. On the 23rd of January, he was invited to a friend's wedding. On her way back from the wedding, she, her sister and her sister's groom all drove home in a car. They face a Taliban checkpoint in the Gulai area of ​​Mahtab Qala. After checking and allowing them to cross the border, one of the Taliban forces, who did not notice the order and thought they were fleeing, fired. In this shooting, out of several bullets, two bullets hit Zeinab's heart. Death was so sudden that the only last word we heard from Zeinab was "Oh my heart." Meanwhile, a young Taliban group recently shot dead another man at a checkpoint in Kabul.
