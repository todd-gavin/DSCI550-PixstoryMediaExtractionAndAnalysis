Sarvesh Patel, 29, an aspirant for competitive government exams, thought he was lucky in April 2020 when he was approved for a loan of Rs 500 from a mobile application that offers instant loans. The first Covid-19 lockdown had just begun and he needed cash urgently. “Rs 150 rupees was deducted as a processing charge and I only received Rs 350,” Patel told Article 14. 


The app asked him for a PAN card, Aadhar card and his bank details. “Within two minutes they verified and approved my loan.” The repayment was due within 15 days, Rs 650 in total. It was an interest rate of 60% per month.


Patel paid it on time, but when the Sidhi resident took another loan from another app in May 2020, this time Rs 5,000, the high interest rates hit home. Once again, the loan was to be repaid in 15 days, and the total due this time was 6,500. “Being a jobless person, it was impossible to return (the money),” he said. 


The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that most loan apps operating in India are not registered entities. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said at a post-policy press meet in June: “Law enforcement agencies need to take stringent action against the people running these apps.” 


Despite the RBI’s attempt to crack down on digital apps offering instant loans, they have continued to proliferate. Official data suggested that nearly 1,100  Indian digital lending apps were operational between 1 January 2021 and 28 February 2021, of which about 600 were illegal.


A report by a social media platform Local Circles based on a survey of over 27,500 people found that 54% of survey respondents had experienced “extortion or data misuse” during the collection process, and some apps were found to charge as much as 500% interest annually.
