Citing philosopher Walter Benjamin, Alessandro Michele writes in his Gucci Cosmogonie show notes, "History is not a container of relics deprived of their subversive charge, but rather an imaginative praxis reserve. This potential explodes when fragments and quotations of the past harmonize with the present in a brand new constellation." In his latest collection, the Creative Director crafts a bridge that continuously builds upon itself, traversing time through myriad references. Ruffs, lace, optical prints, luminous accents, pearly embroideries, and 1940s silhouettes come together, giving way to a new, elevated elegance.
