The keto diet reduces a person's carbohydrate intake while increasing fat intake. The goal is to get the body to use fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. However it can lead to many short term body conditions like nausea, fatigue and stomach issues.

Low blood pressure, kidney stones, constipation, dietary shortages, and an increased risk of heart disease have all been linked to the keto diet. Keto as an extremely restrictive diet can lead to social isolation and disordered eating. Keto is especially not recommended for anyone who has problems with their pancreas, liver, thyroid, or gallbladder.

The keto diet may elevate a person's probability of having vitamin or mineral deficiencies in the long run.

Not to mention, it adds to the already existing and extremely harmful fatphobia. Keto diet is more of a form of disordered eating than healthy eating and should not be recommended to others.
