Bade Ghulam Ali Khan approached the traditional form of Khayal without making too many changes to it He did not want to mess with the presentation and hence left the variations alone which often came along with the presentation His style was straightforward avoiding any sort of drastic changes in the style of presentation However he always had a fascination for new age technique which made him to look beyond the traditional method Also to derive the perfect melody he started toning the musical notes so as to achieve what he wanted It was usually achieved by very subtle modulation of notes This tact was innate in Bade Ghulam Ali He had the knack of toying with musical notations while finding the perfect expression and melody But his greatest contribution was to make his style of Thumri as Unique Now followed by different singers The music career Bade Ghulam Ali Khan was relatively short He made his mark in Calcutta in the year and at the All India Music Conference in Bombay in the year He was touted as the master in each and every form of music that he explored For reasons best known to him he was reluctant to lend his voice for movies for a very long time But in the year film producer K Asif managed to convince him and got him to sing for his movie Mughal e Azam which had its music composed by Naushad He sung two songs which were composed based on the ragas Sohni and Rageshree But his services came at a cost and pricey one at that According to reports Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan had charged and received a whopping Rs per song In comparison top playback singers at that time namely Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar were earning less than Rs per song
